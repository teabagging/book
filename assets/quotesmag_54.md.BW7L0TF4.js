It has also been vigorously debated by philosophers with a general consensus reached during the Enlightenment that reason or logic was the unique quality of consciousness. Even today reductionisms attempt to limit consciousness to some energetic metaphor. Merrell-Wolff's experience is all the more important for he comes out of a rigorous mathematical and philosophical background. When confronted with this nondualistic consciousness and its transformative effects, Merrell-Wolff was hard put to explain it. Taking on Kant's mirror dependencies of consciousness, being contingent upon perception and conception, Merrell-Wolff formulated important accounts all based experientially upon his own illuminate nondual consciousness. His most important work, and least known is Introceptualism where he sets out a formal epistemology and metaphysics for this basic transcendent consciousness. He also modifies some of his earlier statements, attempting to clarify his account of mysticism as well as placing his idealism into juxtaposition to modernist naturalism, realism, idealism and pragmatism. These books reflect a life time effort to formulate an adequate philosophy that can include such radical nondual consciousness as a present reality and possibility. Somewhat reclusive during his long life, he refused to guide or instruct others in what he felt was a natural condition of human consciousness when left to its own nature. In many ways these books provide a place where critical philosophy is strictly mystical. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Transformations in Consciousness: The Metaphysics and Epistemology","review":"I'm not sure how to express my admiration for Merrell-Wolff's work beyond giving this book a &quot;10&quot;. Cutting through the unfounded assertions of the major Western philosophical schools, while acknowledging some of their possibly valid assertions, Merrell-Wolff clearly establishes the potential of a third way of knowledge. This way Kant and his successors failed to fully elucidate. Merrell-Wolff was clearly inspired and writing from a direct experience of an extralogical recognition that lent itself to elaborate formulations of exhilirating beauty."},{"Title":"Transformations in Consciousness: The Metaphysics and Epistemology","review":"Franklin Merrell-Wolff is a very unique breed among philosophers and mystics alike. I am not aware of anyone that has written such a brilliant synthesis of western philosophy and at the sime time was able to ground it in a profound experience of enlightenment. Compared to this, all the modern philosophical discussions of consciousness in western circles are conducted by blind men. Literally. If you are philosophically inclined, after reading this work almost every other philosophy will seem to stand in a smaller peak. If you are more mystical, you probably will find greater rapport with his other work, Experience and Philosophy, since this one might seem a bit too analytical."},{"Title":"Transformations in Consciousness: The Metaphysics and Epistemology","review":"I find this book to be perhaps the most difficult of FMW's works to understand and integrate, but it is well worth the trouble. The west is screaming out for litterature that can bridge the gap between our philosophical way of thinking and the eastern philosophical way of thinking. FMW's work and this book in particular is in my experience the best thing on the market in that account.However, I would not recommend this book for those who are not well practised in reading philosophy of the heavier sort, because if you do not have this training you will probably become more confused than anything else. FMW does not deal with the topic in a light and accessible way, but since the topic is after all a complete philosopy of the supreme goal, enlightenment, nothing less is to be expected.For my own part, FMW's works has helped shed light on many a mystery from the buddhist sutras. This is a profound work in the true spirit of Ekayana, the one vehicle.If you are a philosophicaly inclined seeker, this is a must read along with all the other works of Merrell-Wolff. If you are not, I would recommend you go spend some more time sitting zazen/meditating and read other more easily accessible works. There are many paths that lead to the same goal.This is one of them."},{"Title":"Holiness: God's Call to Santification","review":"'The Book' on Holiness is J.C.Ryle's enduring classic 'Holiness'(of which Grace Publications 'Aspects Of Holiness' is a superb abridgment).Joel R.Beeke's booklet is an extremely helpful introduction and overview of this essential Christian teaching.The author informs us that the word holy is used nine hundred times in the Bible.Surely,this underscores its significance.Many including Mr.Beeke) have defined holy as being set apart.There is a negative aspect of being set apart((to be separate from sin)and a positive aspect(to be set apart for God).The longer I am a believer, the more amazed I become,by those who think that holiness is optional for the believer.Many,if not all,who hold to a non-Lordship view of salvation would contend for this.It seems clear from so many passages in Scripture(...be ye Holy for I am Holy...,...follow peace with all men,and holiness,without which no man shall see the Lord)and the overall witness of Scripture, stare you in the face in this matter.Pastor Beeke succinctly states it thus \\"holiness is a whole life commitment to be set apart to the Lordship of Jesus Christ.Holiness is not a list,but a lifestyle.Holiness means to live Godward.\\"The author gives ten reasons why holiness should be earnestly sought in our daily lives.Here are several of them:1.It gives evidence of your justification and election.-He then gives us this comment from John Calvin: \\"that election should discourage none,for the believer receives comfort from it,and the unbeliever is not called to consider it;rather,he is called to repentance.\\"-A fuller understanding of the Lord's ways generally comes over time,the longer one is walking with the Lord and the more of God's Word that is known(in addition further light comes through submission to God's revealed will).2.Holiness affects your assurance-If you are walking in the light God has given you and are seeking to have a clear conscience before God and man, and keep short accounts with the Lord when you do fall short,then assurance will not likely be an issue for you.3.Holiness affects your usefulness-the more holy you are (the more you will be 'a vessel which is fit for the Master's use')and the more fruit that will be borne for His glory.Joel R.Beeke's booklet on 'Holiness' is ideal for evangelistic purposes and also very helpful to stir the Lord's people to desire and pursue that which will please,honor and advance the interests of our great God and Savior."},{"Title":"The history of Rome Hanks (Armed Services edition)","review":"THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN USING MUCH OF THE LANGUAGE OF THE 1860'S AND SOMETIMES THIS MIGHT THROW YOU FOR A LOSS..THIS BOOK FOLLOWS A FAMILY THROUGH THE MESSED UP WORLD AND ENDLESS DISASTER THAT THE CIVIL WAR CREATED THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH--THE BOOK IS NOT A BATTLEFIELD THAT HOLLYWOOD WOULD PAINT, BUT RATHER YOU FIND YOURSELF WADING IN THE SLIME OF ROTTING BODIES,AND THE BLACK HUMOR OF PEOPLE HOPING TO SURVIVE AS BEST THEY ARE ABLE.."},{"Title":"Modern Egypt,","review":"\\"Modern Egypt\\", 2 vols.; 1,194 pages!

Then again, if you are buying anything written by Gibb you know you cant go wrong."},{"Title":"Number (Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics)","review":"I can already say that it's one of my favourites. The writer uses a clear style and the book itself is very well-organised. It's more descriptive than theoretical, without being boring.Many of the books in this series are about 'grammatical categories', which I guess most normal people (i.e. non-linguists) would just call 'grammar'. This book particularly is about 'number', a concept related to singular and plural, two terms that you surely are familiar with, even if you've never studied foreign languages.The basic difference in English is that we use the singular form when we talk about one entity (one book) and the plural form when we talk about two or more entities (two books, three books). So far, pretty simple.However, when we investigate the languages of the world, it turns out that things can get a lot more complicated than that. We need go no further than Europe to find examples of 'dual', a form used for pairs of entities, coming in handy e.g. when talking about body parts like eyes and ears, that fortunate people normally have two of. This naturally changes the overall system, so that the plural form doesn't have the same meaning as in English - 'two or more' - but rather 'three or more'.Along the same lines we find the 'trial' in some exotic parts of the world. Corbett also deals with the elusive 'quadral', but argues that this really might be an expression of the 'paucal', a form with the meaning 'a few', thus not specifying a particular number. Another numerically indeterminate category to be found in some faraway languages is the 'greater plural'. Apparently this is mostly used when comparing two groups of varying sizes, the smaller one being described by the plural, the bigger one by the the 'greater plural'.Finally, we also have the 'transnumeral', or as Corbett prefers it 'general number'. This form does not specify number at all, and is indeed the only form available in certain languages, something that might appear quite alien to a speaker of a 'Standard European Language'."},{"Title":"Dancing With Siva: Hinduism's Contemporary Catechism: An illustrated sourcebook, timeline and lexicon exploring how to know the Divine, honor all creation and see God everywhere, in everyone","review":"This book is the best reference book I've seen on Hinduism.

Every topic is presented in a simple short topics which makes reading this book such an ease.The views, stated in the book have very good explanation and reasons on why it is in such a manner. For example, reasons to be vegetarian, law of karma(good deed), praying to statues and why every human soul are unique. It allows readers to question and reason on each views before accepting them. The views in the book makes so much sense, and will certainly will give a good clear picture of the depth of hindusim and change anyone view that hinduism is merely praying to statues. I am most impressed that the book says hindus view all other religion with respect and they believe \\"The truth is one, but paths are many\\".To call it merely another book is an understatement. It is the book of life! The 6th edition is the first part of the tri-book mastercourse by subramuniyaswami, it explains abt the fundamental of hinduism. His second book \\"Living with Siva\\" gives a practical approach on how to lead a hindu way of live and the final book \\"Merging with Siva\\" allows serious seekers to experience God himself throught meditation and yoga. Yes, Yoga, it is more than a physical & breathing exercise that have been practised by most western society without realising the true value of Yoga.(...)I would recommend this book to everyone, including the non believer, because this book is not only about believe/faith alone but more about way of life and guide to personally experience God himself."},{"Title":"Dancing With Siva: Hinduism's Contemporary Catechism: An illustrated sourcebook, timeline and lexicon exploring how to know the Divine, honor all creation and see God everywhere, in everyone","review":"Recently, I began exploring ( but have not completed) Dancing With Shiva for my graduate work and found the author's brief explanations of the six schools of Shaivism succinct and helpful in my academic writing. Aesthetically the book is beautiful; each of the author's slokas and bhashyas are accompanied by lavish, full-page, color illustrations. There are also numerous quotes from many of the Hindu scriptures and a sizeable glossary of Sanskrit terms which I found quite helpful. The text covers a wide array of subject matters such as the true nature of reality and the roles of men and women in family life.It is in the swami's discussion of male/female roles in the home and in the larger world that some readers may have some difficulty. In this catechism the author unequivocally states that women best serve society by functioning in the traditional role as caregivers and therefore should not work outside of the home. Conversely, the husband should pursue a career outside the home while the wife acts as a supporter of his success in the world. Despite what appears to me to be a dogmatic adherence to Hindu socioreligious conventions, the text is highly readable and vast and varied in it's discussion of Hindu, and especially Shaiva, religiosity."},{"Title":"Dancing With Siva: Hinduism's Contemporary Catechism: An illustrated sourcebook, timeline and lexicon exploring how to know the Divine, honor all creation and see God everywhere, in everyone","review":"Not only is this book an awesome guide to living, its got great pictures.

While the authors obviously have a great deal of knowledge about and experience with the theory, I found the discussion to be incomplete in many places and the examples to be frequently mismatched to the discussion. There are serious problems with the practice problem sets at the end of each chapter as well.Specifically:1) the terminology used in these exercises is not consisent throughout the book or even in connection with the chapter they are intended to reinforce.2) no solution set is available to which one can turn when no satisfactory solution is evident (a great disadvantage to the professor).3) frequently the discussion in a chapter presents rules and justifications for English only and then the practice problems deal with languages that obey completely different sets of norms (and the rules may or may not have been identified as language-specific).An overarching problem is that the discussion presented by Roca and Johnson fails to account for the fact that the operations of phonetics and phonology are language-specific, and so much of what is presented deals with overgeneralizations. Of even greater concern from a theoretical point of view is their inconsistent dealings with the importance of diachronic factors. While declaring on one hand that factoring out diachronic linguistics is key to the autosegmental approach, the authors in other places invoke history to resolve problems that cannot be solved autosegmentally.In sum, this is a confusing, incomplete text in serious need of revision."},{"Title":"A Course in Phonology","review":"This textbook does a good job of explaining the basics of phonology. It uses a variety of languages to exemplify and explain the concepts like palatalization, nasals matching place of articulation of the following consonant, and so on. It doesn't depend just on English to make the case for these. It does a decent job of giving all sides of the story by explaining a broad range of theories in phonological linguistics. It starts out with some basics of phonetics, but if you have no background in phonetics, you'll want a more comprehensive starter.That said, I used this book because my professor assigned it for the phonology course I took, and without the class discussions, I probably wouldn't have understood any of it.

The glossary did not have entries for any of these terminology switches, in fact the glossary had precious few entries that gave definitions past its own root word. The second annoying thing about this book were the homework assignments at the end of each chapter. There was no answer key, and they spent an entire chapter discussing rules for English phonology, then decide to give French, Catalan, and some bizzare Micronesian language as the assignments all of which had different rules that were discussed in the chapter.

There is no justice here. She takes facts out of context and selectively presents evidence to attack the concept of innocent until proven guilty and the idea of jury trials. She is rather clear on what she wants in place of the current system. She would remove the burden of proof from the prosecution and instruct jurors to find people guilty based on the person seeming or acting guilty.For all her talk, she has repeatedly been wrong. She knew Ricci was guilty in the Smart abduction case. She knew, based the man consulting a lawyer that the man in the runaway bride case was guilty. In Nancy's world, people who get lawyers are guilty.She is a former Fulton County prosecutor who has been rebuked multiple times for ethical problems and illegal behiavor in her career. Nancy's love of the law is so great that she is willing to break it in the name of her brand of justice. You will not find that in the book.As usual, she makes her whole case based on inference and emotion. Her book offers proof in the same way that proof can be had from beating it out of witnesses. She was in rare form after the Michael Jackson trial. She could not fault the prosecution or its case so she viciously attacks the jury night after night. Repeatedly she comes back to her total misunderstanding of what a prosecutor's role is in the courtroom. A case has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury. Someone seeming guilty is not (yet) sufficent grounds to find people guilty.If you want to learn about the law, start somewhere else. This book and its author are trash."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"Nancy Grace isn't a strong woman unless people think that an obnoxous bully is strong. I've known women like her. In school they are the holier-than-thou prissy little things that gossip about how bad everyone who isn't their friend at the moment is. Every girl they don't like is a slut. And they just know that everyone around them is on drugs. When they graduate to the suburbs, they become a critic of how everyone else's children are being raised and make their own kids lives a living hell because nobody could ever be perfect enough to please them. They want to be mother hen over the whole neighborhood. Being strong isn't being a prissy nag. Whats different about Nancy is that rather than causing pain on a school bus or in a neighborhood, she has found a way to bring her bitchy schoolgirl gossip act to the whole country.Her opinions have put innocent people in jail or created an appearance that they were guilty based on nothing. She was on her way to making John Mason the next Scott Peterson. She didn't say she was sorry about it, what she did was find all kinds of sympathy in herself for that psycho Jennifer Wilbanks. Mason: Throw the book at him - he murdered her. Wilbanks: well....it was a \\"girl\\" thing so lets not punish her at all.As far as I've seen, Nancy's audience is full of the same strange people who have always got their thrills out of true crime and detective stores. What Nancy sells to her audience most of the time isn't the law or courtroom drama, its re-living the crime. Its the same as John Walsh. Most people who watch Americas Most Wanted are watching it for the slick video dramatic re-creations of crimes, not to put people in jail.Finally, Nancy is a coward and bully. If she makes a mistake, she brings out the eraser and its as if it never happened. Thats why you will not find certain things from Nancy's past in this book that she can not and will not explain. She is a coward because she hides safely on her shows where she can prevent questions from being asked and cut anyone off saying things she doesn't like. Larry King went after her one time and her response was that it was the fault of the police that she had been wrong. Even though the man died, she could not bring herself to say she even regretted what she had done to him. The family he left behind never appeared on her show after.The thing about compassion is that when its real, people can't turn it on and off depending on the person. Real people with compassion also understand when they make a horrible mistake and try in some way to make it better. That Nancy Grace is incapable of either of these things says alot about her as a woman and a human being."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"Nancy \\"Everybody is guilty Grace\\" tries to write a book(key word, try). Its funny how a her book is titled objection since its nowhere near objective. She is whats wrong with malicious prosecutors in the US today. Thinking everyone is guilty. This women covered up a case in Atlanta and they just recently let the guy out of jail cause she used her dirty ways to land and innocent man in jail. Just how she tried to dirty up the airwaves so Michael Jackson can land a seat in her everyone is guilty prison. Luckily the jury's didn't catch her malicious bias and innocent man went free. But just think of the 100s of innocent people she put away. And the many more she is trying to, with her bias ways trying pollute everyone to think that every celebrity that goes to trial is automatically guilty. This book is one sided to the fullest degree of bias. After reading this book you wonder why you are not in prison.This books should get no stars in my opinion. After the Michael Jackson trial her ratings plummeted to the ground.Just like her TV show in comparison to her book is a bunch propaganda. And people won't stand for it"},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"This is a terrible book. Its written for people who hate the bill of rights, jury trials and \\"innocent until proven guilty\\". What they and Nancy are calling for is a system where Justice is out the window and the government simply decides who is guilty and how they are to be punished.Why did I read the book? Because the law in America is under attack today. Not defense law, but the law itself. Nancy Grace is part of a larger movement to destroy American law and replace it with something alien to America and freedom. There are people who don't like judges or juries and see government, congress and prosecutors, as a better alternative. Trial by congress or judgement by prosecutor is not a legal system, its something else.There are two parts to the book. The first is a long rerun of old celebrity (and other) cases Nancy has been involved with. The second part is Nancy's simple-minded ideas for reform of the courts. I'm going to spend most of my comments on her reform ideas and what they really mean.With respect to Nancy's \\"fans\\", giving everyone the right to a trial is not \\"a waste of money\\". Everyone in America, dirtbag or not, deserves the same rights and the same treatment in a court and in front of a jury. Giving the judge or the prosecutor the power to decide the defendant's plea for the defendant is just as crazy.Nancy is of course entitled to her opinions, but considering her own shameful ethics as a prosecutor, its difficult to give those opinions any credibility. Given that she screamed on television for weeks for the arrest of an innocent man and is so utterly heartless that she has never apologized for what she did or even said she was wrong to the family. But Nancy's fans don't care. If Nancy doesn't talk about it or write about it, it didn't happen.The problem with Nancy's grude over her boyfriend is that she taking out her anger over that crime out on other people who have nothing to do with it. There is a difference between someone who changes their life in a positive way from a loss and someone who uses a loss as a justification to unleash their hatred against many other people who have nothing to do with that crime. The job of a prosecutor is to seek justice, not seek revenge. Justice means that a prosecutor seeks to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.I would not personally care if Nancy forgives the killer(s) of her boyfriend or not. That is between her and them. But the people Nancy attacks or proclaims the guilt of on national television did not kill her boyfriend. A man she falsely accused died in prison and he didn't kill her boyfriend.Nancy and her fans don't shed one tear over that man who is decompising in the ground just like her boyfriend. Why does Nancy's boyfriend rate as a national tragedy giving her unlimited rights of revenge against anyone while Nancy's victim is erased from history?Among other sick innovations promoted by Nancy and Company is the idea that juries should use common sense to convict even if the prosecution can't prove the case. By that low standard, we might as well dispose of juries and trials altogether and simply allow judges to use character judgements to convict those who seem guilty. The reason why we have trials in the first place is that most Americans used to think that a high standard was required to put people in prison. If the prosecution can't prove a crime, what basis would a juror have for deciding guilt? \\"he looks wrong\\"...\\"his friends are strange\\"...\\"he associates with a bad crowd\\"....\\"he has committed other crimes in the past\\". Thats not a system of justice, thats the end of America and its freedom.When juries concern themselves more with the fear, pain or terror of a victim than the facts of the case, they have failed in their role. The purpose of a trial is not to feel sorry for victims, its to determine guilt. The place for the fear and pain of the victims is properly in the sentencing phase once guilt has been determined. Finding people guilty based on emotion about what happened to the victim is wrong. The business of a prosecutor is facts and proof. Revenge is not a ground to find someone guilty of a crime.I can imagine the fear and pain of many people. But not just the victims of crime. I can myself also imagine the fear and pain of a man behind bars or facing death for crimes he had no part of. I can imagine the terror of someone who is sentenced to death because he didn't have enough money for a good lawyer and his case got wall to wall coverage on court TV.Rounding innocent people up and throwing them in jail isn't going to make anyone safer. And the choice isn't between blindly following Nancy Grace or being on the side of the criminals. The side of GOOD is not reserved for Nancy Grace.For example, I would like to see changes in the law as well. I would like to see all the parents who gave their children over to Michael Jackson to be prosecuted for child endangerment and have their parental rights terminated. Nancy has turned parents who pimped out their own children to a monster into victims. Thats not the side of good as far as I'm concerned.The best possible change for the sake of justice in the country would be shutting down court TV and ethically barring practicing lawyers from appearing on TV shows to discuss active cases. 24/7 TV and turning lawyers into TV stars has done more damage to justice than any celebrity verdict."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"Ms. Grace demonstrates her contempt for the United States Constitution and the American justice system in this self-aggrandizing diatribe. She criticizes what she perceives as ethical lapses of defense attorneys, but conveniently neglects those ethical violations for which she has been cited. We also get the usual sob story of the death of her fiance, which, indeed was tragic, but she seems incapable of moving on with her life.

They don't get angry about prosecutors who fail to bring good cases, who put on bad cases or put on bad witnesses...ala Michael Jackson. Its all the fault of the defense attorney for doing their job or the jury for following the judge's instructions.Nancy doesn't get around to it in the book, but I'd really like to see what these rules to control defense lawyers would look like. Is the judge going to decide what sort of defenses are allowed? How would that work? Is the right of the defense to cross-examine witnesses to be cut back? How does Nancy or anyone else come up with rules to say what style or type of questioning is allowed in cross-examination.We have a good justice system today and there is no crisis in America that justifies destroying it."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"I love Nancy Grace, she tells it how it is, no question!

Excellent reading, and as always, Nancy Grace shines.Christina Dress"},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"I guess I'm a crazy person who disagrees with Nancy Grace. Integrity isn't something I have ever thought of when her name is mentioned. Shallow, Hyper, Mean, Petty and Ignorant come to mind. A quick look at her career as a prosecutor kind of kills the integrity angle. But like I said, I'm \\"crazy\\" like others have said because I dont agree with her.What can you say about a woman with a \\"batman\\" complex. She vowed to avenge her dead boyfriend on all those who she knows to be criminals until that juicy CNN contract got put in front of her. Then he got dumped down the chute along with her legal career.The retirement of the DA in Atlanta had nothing to do with her job change. Because she and CNN were in Atlanta at the time, she got used by CNN occasionally. Her hysterical style and celebrity obsession opened doors on TV. And when Court TV came knocking, she didn't think twice. I dont know who these people think they are fooling but anyone in Atlanta knows what happened.In her book, Nancy is her usual self. She is obsessed with celebrities and hates the legal notion of having to prove people guilty. As she has said many times, if a jury thinks someone is guity, they have no choice but to vote guilty.And of course there is the hate for defense attorneys for doing their job. She doesn't really tell us how to change that. Aside from eliminating the ability of the defense to cross-examine witnesses. Think of how that would have improved the michael jackson case! The good character of that mother of that boy should never have been revealed to the jury right? Just because she had a history of fraud was no reason to doubt anything she said. And all those people involved in lawsuits against michael jackson or who were facing their own charges? Why does a jury need to know that.As far as Nancy on Michael Jackson, ANY suspect is entitled through their lawyer to negotiate how they come in to be charged. They can come in driven in their own car or on a unicycle. Many can't because they can't afford laywers, but there is nothing in the law that mandates any defendant to be publically arrested with handcuffs and sirens. What does that have to do with justice anyway? I mean seeing someone in cuffs and shoved into a police car might get Nancy all exicited, but it has nothing to do with the trail or anything else. But it WOULD make for great TV. Thats probably the real issue anyway.Nancy also mentioned \\"additional victims surfacing\\". I guess those would be the \\"victims\\" promised to the jury by the prosecution who walked into court and denied being victims?Not that Nancy noticed, but those additional victims sinking to the bottom of the sea rather than surfacing was another nail in the prosecution's coffin.As far as Nancy's comments about fellow attorneys, maybe some would care but for the fact that the entire Georgia State Supreme Court called Nancy an unethical crook who didn't understand the job of prosecutor. If Defense Attorneys are whores (like Nancy says), Nancy is a pimp for victims. She finds them, turns them out for tricks and pockets all the money & fame for herself and dumps them when they are used up. She helps them by having them relive their crimes for the cameras. Some help.As far as her quote about lawyers being \\"well-dressed hookers\\": Well, Nancy is a dried up old b**** who takes out her frustrations out on the country. The only satisfaction she is capable of getting is from reliving her true-crime fantasies in front of the country on television. I dont think its in her to empathize with anyone. She is in need of serious help. Its kind of like watching the film \\"network\\" come to life. Her illness plays out on TV every day and night.After all, if Nancy isn't going to mince words, why should anyone else?Anyone who hates laywers and is sickened by 24/7 media coverage had better remember that Nancy Grace is a lawyer and a leading factor in that 24/7 media coverage. She practically invented much of it. In the book, her answer to the problem of media coverage is MORE MEDIA COVERAGE. SHE IS THE PROBLEM!!!!"},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"A very easy book to read and understand, especially the way Nancy Grace brings this down to layman's understanding.

Makes me wish I was an attorney so I could fight right along side of her."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"I got about halfway through and gave up. The book is equally self-obsessed and celebrity obsessed. It talks down to its audience and has nothing really to say about the law.It contributes nothing serious on legal reform. Her ideas come down to getting rid of defense lawyers and juries. I think she wants to combine the job of judge and prosecutor into one too. Despite the title, she has nothing really bad to say about the media culture. If anything, the book wants media coverage of the law expanded.There isn't much in the book to speak of. Half is a rehash of old celebrity trials nearly of which were talked to death years ago. OJ is over. Move on! The other half reads like it was reconstructed from conversations into a tape recorder.I really don't know how much blame to give Nancy Grace since the ghostwriter (Diane Clehane) obviously wrote whats in the book.There is nothing new here on any of the cases. I guess my main comment would be that while lady justice is blind, she is not stupid. Even she would lose interest in this ghostwritten doorstop of a book."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"Nancy Grace does an excellent job and makes good sense recommendations for our justice system that has been hijacked by defense attorneys that will do or say anything to get a client acquited."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"After following Nancy Grace since the Simpson Trial I have come to admire her a great deal.Her matter of a fact attitude is refreshing,and in this book she takes on all that is wrong with our Legal System today.Instead of just knocking journalists annd the law she offers answers as to how it can be fixed.You may not always agree with her,but it is refreshing to read an honest account of todays situations,and how they affect us,good or bad.I enjoyed this book and will be looking forward to reading any other book she may write."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"This is an excellent book and why wouldn't it be? It is interesting to note that it received 3*;but look at the distribution. About the same number of reviewers (45) gave it 5* as did give it 1* (39) ;with (22) spread evenly between 2,3& 4 Stars.This represents just about how people are split on the subject of Law and Justice.My Father-in Law was a lawyer and I remember once asking him about something ,and was it against the law.His response to me was very thoughtful and has remained with me for many years.He said, \\"You must always remember,the Law is what is written in the Book;while Justice is what takes place in the Court\\".I enjoy Nancy Grace so much because when you listen to her speak,you know excatly how she feels and it is hard to think of anyone who speaks from the heart and soul so passionately ;expecially a lawyer.There is light and there is darkness,there is left and right,there is right and wrong ,and there is justice and there is injustice.Those who believe that,will consider Nancy \\"a candle trying to light up the darkness.Those who do not,she will find her a thorn in their side.Nancy is outspoken on everything she tackles,and because she knows right from wrong and will always deal in the truth;she comes out of every issue with her head held high,even when she doesn't win. Nancy Grace stands out when one thinks about Lawers and Politicians,who will tell you anything they think you want to hear,will take any position that seems to be to their advantage at the time,and will say anything, whether it is true or not even when they know the difference;but that is not what you are going to get from her.There are many adages that come to mind when thinking about a person like Nancy;and this is one that comes to me;\\"When the book is opened on Judgement Day;it will not say that she won or loss,but how she played she game.\\"I am sure that will be OK with her!!"},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"\\"Objection\\" is nothing but a rant after rant. There is little coherent in this book. There is no sequence to the chapters and it proves that to be \\"famous\\" one just need be controversial, not factual.For example, Grace spends a great deal of time blistering the criminal justice system for the way it treats victims. She includes a chapter on the New York Central Park jogger case, complaing about the way original case was defended. Amazingly, she makes no mention at all of the fact that the original defendants were unjustly convicted and served many years in jail for a crime they didn't commit. One wonders if ignoring the facts was something she practiced when she was a prosecutor.That this fact gets not even a footnote in her book makes all of the book suspect.While the cover of the book proclaims that it takes a look at the inside story of the criminal justice system, she also takes a pot shot at the civil justice system, a part of the law about which she has no experience. She repeats worn out myths about the \\"McDonalds's hot coffee case\\", again displaying an astonishing lack of research.Nancy Grace fans will probably like the book. I was on the fence about her from watching her on TV, but seeing how shallow this book is, I think it makes anything she says or writes about really suspect."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"Nancy Grace has co-authored a book decrying the negative influence of 24/7 media and celebrity defendants?!?! She made her millions by slinging mud at celebrity defendants, convicting them on T.V. before they've even been arrested. You need look no further than the cover of the book, which was actually authored by Diana Clehane, but whose name and photo do we see? - one that sells books - Nancy Grace's.I have to agree with Ms. Clehane and Ms. Grace on one point: We should get rid of the cable shows focusing hour-after-hour on particularly celebrated criminal cases.But they missed the target in the first part of their book's title... Our focus should not just be on \\"high-priced defense attorneys\\" but high-priced, million-book-selling, T.V. drama queens that proclaim their distorted ideas of \\"justice\\" as a prosecution system, absent defenses; one where no man is innocent - we're all guilty if she makes that her almighty determination.Our legal system is not, and should not be, a prosecution mill Ms. Grace."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"This book is full of lots of raw emotion directed against defense attorneys, celebrities, judges, juries and lots of others. The pattern to it is that the emotion is directed against those either who Nancy Grace thinks are guilty or who don't think that Nancy Grace does. The book tries to very loosely offer a plan to make the criminal justice system better, but the plan is ill-defined and weak.Her objections, summarized by me, are:- She wants tighter controls on the behavior of the defense.- She doesn't seem to like the jury system at all- She wants to re-define downward the standard for guilt. Rather than prosecutors having to prove guilt, the prosecutor would be allowed to make a circumstantial or emotional case for guilt.She spends a whole lot of time attacking defense attorneys in the book, but its not really credible because its a one-sided attack where she is blind to the possiblity of misconduct byprosecutors.The problem with the book is that Nancy Grace is blind to her own faults and her own behavior. She is critical of 24/7 News coverage of trials, but doesn't deal with her own large role in that coverage. She is also blind to the problems in her record as a prosecutor.Since leaving the prosecutor's office, Nancy Grace has been sharply repremanded by three different appeals courts for unethical and illegal behavior while she was a prosecutor. Her behavior was called illegal by every judge on the Georgia Supreme Court. Georgia is not exactly a friendly place for criminal defense and the lengths the court went in calling out Nancy Grace for ethical violations was very unusual.They said she:- Misrepresented facts to the trial judge so that her out of state witness could access the defendants home without the knowledge of the defense. Her witness gained access by breaking down the front door. For good measure, she subsequently also entered the defendants home with CNN cameras.- Outright misrepresented the testimony of witnesses (falsely indicating in her closing argument that a defense witness had not disagreed with an opinion of the state).- She inserted false information regarding hearing dates into a court proceeding to gain an advantage.- She repeatedly ignored the instructions of the court. For example, she made multiple references to issues in her opening statement that the court had ruled (previously) to be inadmissiable.- She failed to disclose a romantic relationship she knew about between two of her witnesses to the defense. She deliberatly held back her full witness list until the start of the trial.For those interested, the case was: Carr v. State, 267 Ga. 701, 482 S.E.2d 314 (1997). Its a very detailed case study in how Nancy Grace abused her power as a prosecutor and how she operated without any real sort of ethics.The court summarized her conduct in really harsh language:begin quote -Our review of the record supports Carr's contention that the prosecuting attorney engaged in an extensive pattern of inappropriate and, in some cases, illegal conduct in the course of the trial.end quote -This isn't one bad judge, its the entire very conservative usually pro prosection Georgia Supreme Court giving that opinion.Its also important to remember that the person involved is free today only because he was rich and had the money to hire the lawyers to fight back against what she was trying to do. Most people would have ended up in jail for the rest of their lives.Now you can choose to think that Nancy was right in this case and that somehow the entire court system of a state is so corrupt that it is misrepresenting the facts to free a man in a corrupt manner. But if you step back from that, your left with a prosecutor in Nancy Grace whose record of abuse in court is horrible. They didn't say sort-of illegal or maybe illegal, they said illegal.Nancy has nothing to say about this. Since she doesn't participate in any forum that she doesn't control, nobody really has the chance to ask her about it. And this isn't her only problem with an appeals court.This is important because it shows the big flaw of the book: hypocrisy. The book gets three stars because its a very useful book to read to see the dishonesty and maybe even self-deception that is behind Nancy Grace. The legal system does have ethical problems and problems with the media. But its not just defense attorneys, its prosecutors too. Its also almost surreal to see Nancy Grace of all people object to the media culture of 24/7 surrounding trials."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"To be objective is the goal of my review, and I am asking my readers to also see this approach by Grace objectively in your mind. There is an obvious crucial problem in the USA with the type of crimes Grace exploits. And if you have read this book and watched Grace over any length of time you will see with open eyes the fact of exploiting the offender and the victim. I want to ask you up front, how does this help? To give example when the murder kidnapping took place recently in Idaho, Grace was asking the officer on scene, about the gruesome details of the murdered victims. In the Jackson trial she jokes of the circumstances surrounding Jackson such as the spider bite, his pajama's, his back problem and makes them comical excuses. If Jackson is Guilty, bring on the Justice he deserves, but in the meantime does this give Grace the right to act like a 12 year old? How does this help us? I am sincerely asking, be objective, and lets take this a step further, why does Nancy Grace bring in the \\"Glove\\", the Jackson glove and flash it on CNN? Is this the type of intellect we should be respecting and regarding? Or is this about ratings, have we fallen into the Springer/Geraldo world?? What is the purpose of this and joke around in front of Larry King about this, Larry wasn't laughing, but Nancy laughs at her own jokes. Nancy certainly is having a good time, is this an objective approach to reducing sex offenses in the USA? No, it most certainly is not, if anything she is opening a possible door for allowing the weak to become what we don't want them to be. And the weak are the ones who molest children, not being rational minded,,, which do not pay attention to Graces tactics more or less fully comprehend the law. So we are to say, I am sorry afterwards and not use our god given sense and combat these crimes objectively before they take place? We take it so seriously afterwards, and then joke around about it during trial.Grace also stresses evidence, which separates humans as accepting each other. Once again I say, If Jackson is guilty, serve him Justice. Nancy's evidence log does not revolve around the fact that whether he did or did not commit a crime. Grace emphasis is on such things as the form and markings of Jackson's Penis being identified by one of the accusers. Many such pieces of evidence like this, actually an over emphasis on evidence like this. We are human, not creatures to be ashamed of one another. When I was a child I saw my female gym teachers in the shower, and many such cases similar. We accepted each other; Nancy is certainly viewing this in a very shallow and limited mind. We Americans are becoming such individuals we are fearing each other of crossing the line of respect and ashamed of our bodies? So much invented fear of being molested because someone saw a human without his clothes on!! Are we not able to see what we are without the self inflicted horror that because Jackson has a penis we accuse him of child molestation before the Jury lets out??? You have to ask why does the USA have more people in prison than any other nation for this exact same accusation. If you have never been to a foreign country, it may be hard for you to relate, men walk with boys nude throughout the world, and women with girls the same, in many cases its mixed, if you doubt me, go to a Japanese bath house, or to a German indoor swimming pool, there are hundreds of other examples much less private everywhere outside the USA. I only bring up this corner of surely usable evidence used by Nancy to further my case of realism as opposed to the real intent of Grace, or if she really knows what she is doing.Now, what is the point of this book and Nancy Grace's view then? It is an after the fact exploitation of the crime to assist the victim by locking up the offender, WHICH REALLY DOES NOT HAPPEN EITHER WAY!! Convicted sex offenders are out and by the hundreds of thousands. The victims have been made popular and have extreme shock for being exploited publicly. Grace's approach does not bring pride to the victim, but fame, deep from the heart UN wanted fame.So what is the point of my book review? The secret is prevention, not after the fact exploitation and desire to increase ones ratings on CNN. The number one prevention measure should be complete subject matter education in elementary schools for all children. Being smart is the best prevention, especially if we made the potential weak offender smart on the subject before he was able to be a molester. If you don't want to be raped, if you don't want your children molested, watch them and watch yourself by not being alone (This 18 year old in Aruba was abducted when she was alone). Protect yourself in a number of ways. I am in no way shifting the blame, I'm accepting the fact that the killer, the rapist, the child molester does in fact exist so I help you better by saying the way to rid the problem is to prevent it. When the offender is caught, get rid of him or her. Don't let them out for anything. Look what has happened in Florida, a repeat offender, this is happening everywhere in the USA. What someone needs to do, is write a book on PREVENTION, not on After The Fact IM so sorry approach. A in public school program needs to be installed to teach children at a very early age encompassing this entire subject.So I ask you to objectively look at Grace, a government prosecutor who was rejected from being a Judge, she is not helping; she is advertising the problem in its hideous Mad Light."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"After reading this book, I can't say much to recommend it. Nancy Grace is a really messed up person who doesn't understand the difference law and revenge. The hate inside her just drips out on the page. The problem with hate like that is that it can end up hurting innocent people.You will not find in the book much mention of a man named Richard Ricci. He was a totally innocent man who Nancy determined was guilty. She screamed day after day on television for his arrest in the Elizibeth Smart kidnapping. After weeks of claims that he was obviously guilty by Nancy in particular, the police put him in jail and tried to get a confession from him. He died in jail at which point Nancy went back on TV telling everyone that we would probably never know the truth about Elizebeth Smart. As much as telling everyone that the case was no longer worth pursuing.But later, due to the family (and in spite of Nancy Grace), the little girl was recovered and it became clear that Richard Ricci was as he had claimed to be until his death in jail: a totally innocent man.What did Nancy have to say after this? She had little to say but above everything else she never said she was sorry and never expressed any regret in destroying an innocent man. A man was dead in the ground and for all her supposed empathy for victims, she didn't even accept that he or his loved ones were victims.Nancy Grace claims to help victims. But nothing could be further from the truth. She uses victims to fill television time and to make money for herself. She uses victims, their emotions and their stories to draw TV ratings from freaks who are attracted not to laws or courts, but to the hearing the details of violent crimes.Anyone looking for anything reasonable about the law in the book might as well look elsewhere. Her ideas about legal reform are real simple: Get rid of ALL the lawyers and let prosecutors put whoever they think is guilty in jail.What comes across in some pages is hate for other lawyers and court process. To Nancy, having defense lawyers or juries in court is an insult to the integrity of prosecutors and gets in the way of them doing their job. Prosecutors (like her) are good people who would never bring a case against an innocent person.The lowest point in the book is when she shares her warped legal ideas about how juries are supposed to decide cases. Nancy Grace says that _beyond a reasonable doubt_ isn't to do with proving a case, its a jury using intuition. If a jury thinks someone is guilty even though the facts are not there, they have to find the person guilty because they would not think that unless the prosecutor had proved their case.There isn't much more to say about the book. Other than its a good indicator of whats going wrong with the country. innocent until proven guilty is going out of fashion. Now, the only innocent people are the accusers/victims and to be accused is to be the same as guilty.And as for anyone foolish enough to think that the current legal system is criminal friendly, I hope you either have millions of dollars for lawyers or never get accused of a crime. Because when you get into court, you may well find out that the system isn't what you thought it was. You may well find yourself in court with a lunatic prosecutor who will pass moral judgement on your life in five minutes and decide that your obviously guilty based on nothing more than a hunch. The reason we have courts and lawyers is because taking people's lives away from them is not something that should ever be done in a hurry or done based on emotion or revenge."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"Nancy is so blinded by her agenda--attacking defense attorneys and defendants--that she manipulates or ignores facts that are contrary to her extreme views. I have rarely heard anything worthwhile come out of her mouth on CourtTV, and this book is no different. I hope readers (and CourtTV viewers) who are less informed about the judicial system (I am a lawyer) realize not to take anything she says at face value."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"Nancy Grace's theme in this book is to bewail the tricks and successes of defense lawyers. She cites some cases where this directly led to tragic crimes committed by a defendant getting off for a prior crime.While I sympathize with her point of view, I don't know what can be done about it. On the other side is the problem of people being unjustly sentenced for crimes they did not commit - fortunately new DNA evidence has exonerated a number of them. However, the reality is that tightening the system to release fewer guilty people will more than likely also lead to more innocent people being sentenced to life in prison, or even death. (See Bill Kurtis' \\"Death Penalty on Trial."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"Nancy Grace has the unbridled arrogance that only the truly ordinary can possess. Former prosecutor Grace-and all of these true-believing dimbulbs are \\"former prosecutors\\"-wants the criminal justice system to do away with defense lawyers so that anyone accused of a crime can more easily be imprisoned or executed. She doesn't care much for trials either, since prosecutors and judges (blessed be they) could work better without them. There is no such thing as innocence in Grace's world. Besides, even if the accused didn't do what he's charged with he probably did something else. This woman just can not fathom that a police officer or a witness could lie, that witnesses can be mistaken, that scientific evidence can be faked, that prosecutors can tamper with, manufacture or withhold evidence, that the innocent-yes, the actually innocent-can be, and will be again, arrested, convicted, jailed and executed.What a book. Bland and pedestrian, yet vitriolic and nonsensical all at once. Quite an achievement. Were Ms. Grace to be taken seriously the entire Bill of Rights would have to be scrapped. It really sticks in her craw that OJ is breathing free air and yes, Johnny Cochran did the greatest job of lawyering since Daniel Webster bested the devil, but he was aided and abetted by a lying cop and by some very sorry prosecutors. Ms. Grace ignores the fact that these same prosecutors-thoroughly undressed by Cochran in public-scampered from the courtroom while \\"not guilty\\" was still echoing off the walls so that they could cash in on their new celebrity. Celebrity justice indeed."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"She's opinionated, ignorant, prejudicial, arrogant, and, yes, bitchy.

This book pretty much contradicts itself and offers no solution to the current disfunctionality that is dragging this nation down.

Her self-righteous, emotional, judgmental condemnation of anyone who has ever been accused of a crime, or defended a person accused of one, is worrisome -- and that so many people applaud her total lack of reason and principle in favor of hysteria and name-calling is frightening. It's clear to me that she is psychologically stuck back in the time when her fiance was tragically murdered -- and she treats each and every defendent, no matter what the evidence of their guilt or lack thereof, as if s/he is the murderer of that fiance. With each trial, she relives that pivotal event in her life, and takes control of an uncontrollable situation by crying out passionately for \\"justice\\" in the form of the harshest punishment possible. I believe that jurors and television viewers mistake her contempt for each defendant and her passion for conviction as some special knowledge of the truth of the situation at hand, but in fact they relate back to a long-ago event that changed her life forever.I have also experienced such an event -- my father was murdered when I was a child -- and I am also a lawyer. But, because of this, I would never have trusted myself to practice criminal law. The Constitution and the laws protecting the rights of ACCUSED people in this country are an enlightened, principled, rational body of laws meant to prevent us from engaging in witch-hunts or giving into that all-too-human tendency to judge emotionally and spitefully, without regard for real and reliable evidence. Nancy Grace is doing everything she can to bring us back to a state where innuendo, accusation, pointed fingers and suspicion of those who seem a little different can take the place of evidence, and people are guilty until they can prove themselves innocent.

Innocent people who have had their lives destroyed by Nancy either in the courtroom or on television. And by jumping into cases like that of that young Smart girl, she has sent the police off following FALSE leads and put a VICTIM at risk. If the family had listened to Nancy Grace, that girl would probably never have been saved.To put it in her own style: \\"Nancy, your a crook. You broke the law. You have lied to judges, have broken the rules and broken the law. Thats not me saying it, its the entire Georgia Supreme Court saying that. How can someone who has broken the law themselves and dragged the court system through the mud dare to tell America how to fix the court system. Nancy, the court record shows you to be as dirty as the worst defense lawyer in the country. But even the worst defense lawyers in the country have never dared to break into a defendant's house to get footage for CNN. Breaking and Entering Nancy: CRIME. Lying to judges: CRIME.

To know her is to love her. To disagree with her is just plain crazy. Anyone who's seen Nancy on \\"Closing Arguments,\\" \\"Nancy Grace\\" or \\"Larry King Live\\" is familiar with her outspoken yet heartfelt opinions on a number of topics. Whether you agree or disagree with her views, you have to respect the intensity she brings to the screen and now to the page.After her fiance, Keith, was brutally gunned down just months before their wedding, Nancy's plans changed from the goals of wife, mother and schoolteacher to a future in law school and then a fight for the side of good against evil in the courtrooms of Atlanta's Fulton County courts.The retirement of the elected district attorney years later precipitated another job change, and Nancy found herself in front of the cameras on Court TV where she has continued her fight for right and entertained us at the same time.In OBJECTION! Nancy confirms what a lot of us already know --- that America's justice system is not infallible. Over recent years, we've seen numerous celebrity defendants freed when public opinion and common sense tells most of us they're guilty. We've seen criminals turned into celebrities as they make a fortune selling their stories to the public, who thrive on the juicy details of the latest scandal. We've seen defense attorneys whose goal is not to provide an equitable defense for the wrongly accused but whose objective is to get the guilty off at any cost, including the absolute annihilation of the characters of witnesses and even victims.As should we all be, Nancy's mad as hell and she's not going to take it anymore! While most of us sit at home and shake our heads in disgust, Nancy is informing us, inciting us, and encouraging us to see that change takes place in a system that doesn't always work.With regard to the Michael Jackson trial, Nancy says, \\"No other suspect in a child-molestation case, especially with the specter of additional victims surfacing, would be handled with kid gloves like Jackson.\\" And it's true. \\"Regular\\" defendants do not get booked in at their convenience and under their own steam, arriving \\"for fingerprints and book-in in a shiny chauffeured SUV.\\"When it comes to her fellow attorneys, Nancy has no qualms about referring to them as \\"ambulance chasers\\" and \\"whores of the court.\\" While there may be some \\"respectable, silk-stocking lawyers\\" out there, Nancy likens them to \\"the well-dressed hooker sitting at the bar in the Ritz nursing a Cosmo.\\" Nancy doesn't mince words and we're not left in the dark as to her opinions.Anyone who hates lawyers, is sickened by the 24/7 media coverage of scandal, and believes there are serious faults in today's justice system will love Nancy's book. Those who would just like a few more inside details and some juicy gossip from recent years' headlines also will find what they're looking for. Whether you love her or love to hate her, Nancy Grace's OBJECTION! is fast-paced, thought-provoking, and just a plain good read.--- Reviewed by Amie Taylor"},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"This is a great book by a wonderful woman blessed and sent by God to deliver our American Justice System back from the evil ones who control it. Those people who write all those terrible things about her don't know her. No good person who has heard what Nancy has to say and seen her stand up to EVIL would even think to say a word against her. Nancy isn't terrible, its the Michael Jacksons, the OJs and the Scott Petersons of the world that people should be angry at!All she wants is for Lady Justice and GOD to together rule our courts again! This country cannot afford to let the guilty go free anymore!Someday when we have won our country back, there is going to be a great reckoning for many criminals walking free today: OJ, Michael Jackson, Terry Schiavo's false husband, the judges that killed her, and God willing that they live long enough the five baby-killer justices on the Supreme Court. I love on that day to see Nancy either sit in judgement of the criminals or prosecute them for the government.America's problem is that far too many criminals run free. Some of them call themselves Senators, Congressmen, Judges and even a ex-president. But some day in an America right with God under a restored constitution, these criminals will be brought to Justice.There is nothing wrong with Nancy.

The murder of poor sick Terry by her husband and the judges was a wake up call just as those circus freaks who worship Michael Jackson were a wake up call.

I'm not a fan of talking heads on television in general. I picked up the book to try and understand what she was about. I was also given the impression that this was a book about reforming the legal system.About half of this book is more talk about celebrities and their legal problems. None of its very interesting since these cases have mostly been talked to death already. I mean what is there new to say about OJ Simpson now?The other half of the book is worse. Nancy bashes the legal system. She is angry that prosecutors and judges can't just throw people they don't like or have a hunch about in jail. She doesn't like juries either. The only positive parts of the legal system in reading the book are prosecutors and the media.I get the impression that she thinks that juries and the defense are not needed. That a legal system made up of honest prosecutors rooting out the bad guys and handing them over to judges for sentencing is all thats needed.Her worst attacks are reserved for defense lawyers. She hates them. Not just some of them, but the entire profession. She calls them all whores and every other name she can think of. What comes across in the book isn't someone who is mad at bad attorneys, but someone who hates the whole concept of a defense attorney.In contrast, she doesn't have one bad word to say about any prosecutor. They are good people incapable of error, bias or mistakes.What she is suggesting as a reformed legal system is one where prosecutors round up those they think are guilty and then put them in jail. Innocent until proven guilty is replaced by prove your innocence to the prosecutor.As far as the media goes, she has nothing negative to say. Compared to all the raving about other aspects of the law, her only complaint about court media coverage is apparently that the country needs even more of it.Not recommended."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"I read this book over a weekend getaway and could not put it down.

Nancy may make some mistakes - and I believe that another reviewer misstated what the courts said - but she is never one to let her opinions sway with whatever is \\"in\\" at the moment.Yes, she is very opinioned, but hello, she is a commentator, not a judge or a jury. She is the reason CNN's ratings have skyrocketed. People love her for her strong views and are sick and tried of defendant's getting all the breaks....we all remember OJ.Yes, she does care about victims rights. Does anybody want to go back to the days of putting victims on trial? Oh, but that's right we still do. It's not just about a defendant getting a fair trail; it's also about making sure that everyone involved is treated fairly.Watching Nancy today, I saw a compassionate woman talking to the son of a woman who was killed by her husband. It was obvious that she cares about him and how he is adjusting. She keeps in contact with many of the victims of violent crimes and isn't that a nice change from the way many attorneys act.Yes, she can be over the top both in her book and on her show, but she is someone who speaks her mind and walks her talk. I couldn't imagine wanting her any other way. And for those of those who hate her, that's OK because there are enough of us who think Nancy's a great role model of a strong, passionate person.All I can says is \\"thank you friend\\" for bringing energetic and heartfelt commentary to those of us who also think that victims deserve rights as well."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"Let me defend Nancy Grace with her own words...\\"I am accused of having beliefs, opinions, and convictions.

If you are a fan of Nancy Grace, then you will likely enjoy and appreciate the book as much as I did. In this book, Nancy Grace points to the injustices of our criminal justice system -- presumably designed to protect society, but in fact protects the defendants and criminals, further victimizing the innocent victims whom it should be protecting. One may at times get the impression that she is speaking from both sides of her mouth -- BUT she is speaking...not only is she speaking a truth many in the criminal justice system would rather us turn a blind eye to, but she points fingers and names names as well in this no-holds-barred book. Those who cannot bear to look at the \\"unvarnished\\" truth exposed in this book will attack the author on semantics and political incorrectness, unfortunately these people miss the point entirely (so if you've been accused of missing the point, maybe this book isn't for you). Nancy Grace has undoubtedly ruffled some feathers with this book -- and I say that is a good thing! In my opinion, this book doesn't deserve the scathing reviews it has received...I propose it is not the person these people dislike as much as what she's saying, but, people, wake up -- it's the truth."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"This book shows some inside information on the Scott Peterson case which I find most interesting.

The point isn't that we should convict the accused before they are found guilty, but that we should force deceptive defense lawyers to stop writing fiction for their clients (making up stories that *might* convince the jury), and go back to representing their clients' rights - win or lose.What lengths will some go to to defend (or to convict) their clients? Just about anything, from what I've seen lately. And as for television making a mockery of the justice system? People need to catch up. We're living in the age of the Internet - of instant communication. Trials have always served as entertainment. The justice system has always served to stir passions. It's just that our \\"community\\" is now so much bigger than it was. I for one am glad that at least someone like Nancy Grace is passionate about victims, victims's families and victim's rights!The book is good, and regardless of which side of the system you generally sit on, it raises some excellent questions that I don't think any one author can answer - but that we should all be collectively thinking about."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"Finally, a legal analyst who actually speaks the truth and isn't afraid to shout how the media and Hollywood manipulate the gullible American public into believing the American Justice System ain't broke.In this day and age when being un-PC is considered un-American by liberals, Nancy Grace actually lays it on the line with supportive arguments, facts and extremely qualified finger-pointing, beginning with Hollywood, the media, local courts, State courts, and finally, the US Supreme court.In addition to her constructive criticisms, she actually offers possible solutions to these problems for everything and everyone whom she criticizes.She will make no friends in the media, nor Hollywood, with this explosively written tome, however, she doesn't care and neither should you.

Grace, 45, was conducting sidewalk interviews among legions of Jackson faithful when a man in the crowd yelled, \\"Who let you out of your cage, Tweety Bird?\\" Before the man could escape-which would have been difficult, as he was in a wheelchair-Grace slung him to the ground, leapt on top of him, and bit his right ear, severing the earlobe.\\"I'm damn sick and tired of people calling me that,\\" Grace screamed. She kicked the man repeatedly in the groin before she was finally subdued by police.As Grace's star has risen at CNN, where she recently was given her own prime time talk show, she has become increasingly more sensitive about her uncanny resemblance to Tweety Bird. Last week she announced that she had filed a $300-million lawsuit against the creators of the lovable cartoon character. Grace alleges that as she has become a recognizable celebrity, the creators of Tweety Bird have drawn him to look more like her \\"because they hate what I stand for.\\"Most people who witnessed Grace's demonic outburst at the courthouse were not surprised. The diminutive attorney earns her living by bullying guests on talk shows. She is known for her lack of subtlety, manners, and fair play-as well as her grating voice and rampant sexual hostility toward men. She once bit the head off an O.J. Simpson doll on camera during the short lived television show she co-hosted with Johnnie Cochran in the mid-1990s.Grace, who professes a love for Shakespeare, particularly the character of Lady Macbeth, originally planned on teaching English in prisons. In 1980 while she was an English-lit major at Valdosta State in Georgia, her fianc&eacute; was fatally shot in a random mugging near his construction job. Grace vowed to become a lawyer, and ever since she graduated from law school, she has conducted a one-woman vigilante crusade against male defendants. She has been condemned by groups as varied as the American Civil Liberties Union and Drunks Against Mad Mothers.In related news, a spokesperson at Warner Bros. said that Tweety Bird, 62, a co-defendant in the suit against his creators, would have no comment as long as the suit is pending. The reclusive Bird has rarely spoken with the press since 1950, when his original pink color was changed to his present yellow because motion picture censors thought he \\"looked naked.\\""},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"Dont' get confused, from a disgruntled former prosecutor who lost most of her cases to DEFENSE ATTORNEYS who outsmart her, and provide the facts, not overdramatic emotions.There has been a worldwide petition to fire Nancy Grace from polluting the TV Airwaves on CNN, and guess what...a high success has been accounted for.Nancy Dis-Grace has fallen from grace and she should know that HER CORPSED FIANCE WOULD ROLL OVER IN HIS GRAVE IF HE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS UP TO."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"Is sure to be an eye opener for everyone disgusted with ourjudicial system."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"I got the book and loved it could not put it down then I gave it to my mom and she could not put it down ..."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"My wife really enjoyed this book, but on the other hand, it almost put me to sleep.

There's a reason why - it's \\"good television\\". She's not on to provide thoughtful analysis, calm reasoning, and penetrating insight. She is there to lay the sensationalism on THICK. On the one hand, if she really IS giving voice to her deepest, most true emotions then I lay the blame upon her paymasters at Court TV and CNN. But let's be real - she knows what the deal is. She knows her audacious style lures people in. It makes you wonder how she performs, er, behaves when the cameras switch off. Even worse are her no-life viewers who call in, \\"Ohh, hiya Nantsi! Ohhh I just agree with evraything yew say! Are we friends, Nantsi?? Huh, ahr we????\\" Pathetic. This woman needs to get OFF of television and drag her miserable self into a sanitarium.

She wants to overturn hundreds of years of our law and our constitution in favor of new ideas that can't be found in American history. What she wants is to force an accused person to prove that they are innocent and to do so without a lawyer.

She is accused of being reckless, unethical, destroying lives and making money/fame for herself by exploiting victims of crime.She went on national TV attacking night after night attacking the wrong man in a child abduction. An innocent man went to jail and died there. But for the efforts of others, the child may never have been recovered. There is a difference between offering opinions and using national television as a forum for hysterical charges which are later shown to be _wrong_.Look at the things she said in the \\"runaway bride\\" story. She dragged another innocent person through the mud, was telling the country he was the next Scott Peterson....but she was wrong! What convinced her that the man was a murderer? His \\"crime\\" of consulting a lawyer.Her Ethics have been openly called into question by multiple appeals courts. She has lied to judges, held back evidence from the the other side and broken every rule she could find.Thats Nancy Grace. But your not going to find that Nancy Grace in this book.In the book, she makes a crazy shotgun attack on the basic ideas of the American Justice system. She doesn't understand that justice is about more than protecting society. Its about protecting people, even guilty people and giving them the right to defend themselves in a court of law.What Justice seeks, and Nancy doesn't, is truth. The system is that prosecutors prove a case with facts and that juries uses those facts to determine guilt. A system where those who seem guilty are thrown in jail is a system where freedom doesn't exist. But thats what many in her audience want. They would like nothing better than to sweep up everyone they don't like and put them in jail.The problem with Nancy Grace in the book is that all the outrage in the world doesn't mean a thing unless you can suggest workable changes. For example, short of abolishing the jury system, Michael Jackson wasn't going to jail. Grifters and criminals are not going to convince a jury. When the state presents a pattern of abuse and the supposed victims of the abuse deny it happened, how are you going to change the system?The short answer is that you can't change the court outcomes Nancy Grace is so angry about without destroying the rights of everyone. Knowing someone is guilty and proving someone is guilty are never the same thing. Nancy Grace doesn't understand that. Just because someone says something loudly doesn't make what they are saying the truth no matter how many times they say it.Some of the reasons for anger at Nancy Grace and her book is that she has the power now to ruin lives. And that those who are listening to her insanity want nothing less than to pull down everything American Justice has ever stood for and turn the country into a police state. She doesn't want to strengthen the system or make it better, she is trying to tear it down.John Mason was a real person. If his runaway bride, Jennifer Carol Wilbanks, had stayed disappeared he would probably be in Jail now looking at murder charges with Nancy Grace still screaming for his head every night. With the reforms Nancy Grace wants, he would probably have already been on death row before Jennifer Wilbanks reappeared.I'll take Nancy Grace seriously when she accepts and apologizes for her mistakes. Her own growing list of victims are crying out themselves for justice."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"What she did to Casey Anthony was a Disgrace.

Here is where she is wrong - it is not all the fault of \\"sleezy\\" defense attorneys trying to get their clients off. Nancy - not to shock you, but not all defendents are guilty. My brother was accused of a crime, then during the trial, they discovered that yes, he was innocent. The trial ended there. But in Nancy's view, he should have been hung even before the trial.She makes some nice points about the Kobe Bryant trial. But here is her biggest mistake - she is not funny. She tries to be funny and witty both, but fails. Have you ever seen her show on CNN Headline News? She is so convinced that Michael Jackson is guilty, it clouds her ability to reason and TELL THE TRUTH. She keeps, with a smirk and sarcasm, bringing up the book \\"THE BOY\\". Nancy - you should maybe let your audience know that that book was removed from a LOCKED box at Neverland - in 1993!! It has nothing to do with the current accuser. And get this - she calls the Jackson trial the \\"Michael Jackson Child Sex Trial\\". Nice title. I hope he is let go just so she can cry on the air.But once again - the book is readable. Kind of like Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity. You read just so you can feel smarter than the author after reading all the distortions of truth.

A shrill, almost hysterical voice on American Television who screams night after night for revenge against those she decides are guilty.She is a former prosecutor in the US. She will say so in the book, but what she doesn't say is that she has been repremanded by multiple courts for unethical and illegal behavior (the courts words) as a prosecutor. Appeals courts have found that she lied to judges, manipulated testimony, withheld information from the defense and disobeyed the instructions of the court. In the Carr case, a unanimous Georgia Supreme Court (Carr vs. State) said:&quot;Our review of the record supports Carr's contention that the prosecuting attorney engaged in an extensive pattern of inappropriate and, in some cases, illegal conduct in the course of the trial.&quot;In the book you will find a rehash of American Celebrity trials and Nancy's suggestions for improvements to the legal system.Those improvements are:1) The prosecution should not have to prove its case. A jury that emotionally thinks a person is guilty should have no choice but to find them guilty.2) The defense should not have the right to cross-examine the prosecution's witnesses.3) The presumption in a courtroom should be guilt rather than innocence.4) The victim of a crime has rights which include revenge and protection from cross-examination. The suffering of the victim should be a factor in determining guilt rather than just determining the punishment.5) The media should have unrestricted access (which is incomprehensible in a book that complains in its title about 24/7 trial coverage).Her suggestions are based on hysterical overreaction and would result in a police state if implemented. Those who have lived under such systems could tell anyone interested that giving unlimited power to judges and prosecutors does not reduce crime. What it reduces is every sort of right and freedom."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"Nancy Grace is no advocate of victims. She is an exploiter. Anyone who cared about victims would not humiliate them on television in interviews like she does. I've watched her humiliate victims of sexual assault by making them talk on television about the details of how they were assaulted. What good does knowing that do? What kind of an audience is tuning in to see people relieve their abuse in such detail?Her book is crazy because its people like her who are wrecking the justice system by their 24/7 coverage of cases. She contaiminates the jury pool for cases and not just for one side. As many people who see her hysterical act are influenced against prosecutors as the defense.How can she so bad? Ask her victims! She railroaded one man into Jail where died completely innocent. His imprisonment and death meant less than nothing to her and she has as much as said so. Victims to Nancy Grace are those who look nice on television: cute kids, young girls who can tell all the jucey perverted details about they were assaulted and loved ones whose loss can be exploited for her own gain. But if you don't have a good story or don't look right for television, your not a victim. You don't even count as a human being.As far as changing the channel, Nancy Grace isn't just an opinion on television. Her words and actions have an effect. The vicitims and the accused are real people. Her actions resulted in at least one innocent man being hounded to his death. This isn't just a book or a TV show for anyone's entertainment. These are real lives on both sides (victims and offenders) that are being exploited for the viewing pleasure of people. To those people, go change the channel to Law and Order or CSI please! leave real-world crime alone. Its a serious thing."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"I am sure that Nancy Grace believes everything that she wrote in this book. But her problem, as many others have noted, is that she is a big part of the problem. She lets her zeal for her ownpolitical, moral, and legal beliefs get in the way of truth and justice. I was so disgusted with her during the Michael Jackson trial that I wanted to throw things at the tv set everytime she was on. She had him tried and convicted on her show while the trial was going on with an unsequestered jury. When confronted with this fact by some other person (Larry King?), she shrugged it off, saying that it is not her problem if the jury doesn't follow the rules. What complete arrogance!She decided that Michael Jackson was guilty, essentially because she didn't like him or who he was. He was a homosexual (and maybe he is), he was a pervert (and maybe he is), he had committed other crimes (and maybe he did), but that was not what he was being tried for. Fortunately, the jury showed a great deal more responsibility than the O.J. Simpson jury. They really tussled with the evidence, and decided that the charges were not proved. Ms. Grace was outraged. I think the jury got it right. It was not proved.Unfortunately, people like Ms. Grace are sometimes prosecutors or police people or jury members or even judges. Their ability to find the truth is clouded by outside issues, such as their own sense of justice and just what is right and wrong, or whether they find the person morally or racially etc.acceptable, or even their desire to protect their paycheck, never mind what the law says. If for no other reason (though there are many others), the death penalty should be abolished.Meanwhile, there are things in this book with which I do agree. High-priced attorneys can hijack a trial, starting with the fact that they can buy juries. The juror doesn't get any of the money, but the attorneys buy psychological profilers who will find them a jury who will have the mental attitudes needed to benefit the client. [Why is this practice considered legal!?!]The media makes it an absolute circus rather than fostering the idea that something really important is going on here which affects people's lives. It is not, or at least should not be, another form of entertainment, one that is becoming increasingly blood thirsty."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"Nancy Grace sees everybody guilty, even before seeing the facts."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"Nancy Grace cares and has a true passion about victim's rights.

Later she became a host on a cable TV show to offer opinions on cases and trials that are publicized in the corporate media. The \`Introduction' explains Nancy's life. Her fianc&eacute; was murdered before their wedding, and she began to study law to avenge Keith's murder (p.2). Atlanta was the murder capital, it had the drug trade from Miami. [Nancy does not look at the Big Picture of the drug trade.] Nancy said she was the voice of the victims (p.3). Nancy's pride makes her criticized the Founding Fathers and the Constitution! Surely those who fought a revolutionary war had more common sense and a knowledge of history than an English lit major? Her dedication to \\"the struggle for justice\\" has its psychological overtones.Are defense lawyers slimy characters (Chapter 1)? One famous writer had his lawyer hero say \\"I defend the accused, the jury decides who is guilty\\". I once read that the Canon of Ethics requires every lawyer to do his or her best for their client (p.6). [I'll bet if Nancy ever gets indicted she will get the best defense lawyer available.] Clarence Darrow fought for his innocent clients, but made a deal if they were guilty. Does this still go on? Is the truth-seeking process a game of wits? What about the facts in the case? Why do some people not look you in the eye (p.15)? It is a cultural thing in some societies. New Yorkers are advised to not make eye contact with anyone in the street. Four-legged animals can take that as a threat (p.195). Does Nancy know this? Why is she so \\"vicious\\" (p.16)? Did Johnny Cochran really assemble that \\"dream team\\" (p.17)? Is Nancy so wise to decide what reforms we need?If Judge Ito advised the assistant district attorney that does not make him a defense partisan (p.36). Don't judges usually thank the jurors (p.37)? Is it really difficult to get a celebrity convicted (p.48)? Don't they have agents or handlers to do their dirty work? What about convicting politicians or businessmen? The comments on jury selection sound like a scheme for jobs for lawyers who can't find a job (p.63). Does Nancy have a cure for human nature (p.64)? How arrogant and contemptuous! Nancy's dream of convicting jurors demonstrates her strange ideas! Nancy's dreams of a courthouse turning into an ATM machine tells me she needs professional help (pp.67-68). And so it goes, opinions piled upon pages to either bore or anger you. If Nancy doesn't like the idea that the rich and famous get breaks she can advocate raising the top income tax rate to 90%, and the standard deduction to $50,000. America was more egalitarian back in the 1950s and 1960s with this top tax rate. Nancy can't find any bad examples when this high rate was operative.Nancy fails to understand the flawed prosecution of O. J. Simpson. The limo driver picked him up at 11pm and drove to the airport. OJ could not have personally murdered anyone at this time. That blood evidence was tainted (p.121). When you read of Nancy's ideas for changed laws, ask if they are to help seek the truth or to help convict the presumed innocent. The topics in this book are scattered around, it could be better organized. Nancy needs to do her homework and learn about the history of justice so she won't make any more mistakes in judgment."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"An informal read that feels like a two fisted war stories session in the local pub, this book will satisfy all Nancy Grace fans who can't get enough of her anecdotal legal wisdom on television. With Ms. Grace, what you see is what you get: a passionate crusader who consistently voices the most aggressive of prosecutorial agendas. Objection! continues in that fierce philosophy, with the author holding forth in her inimitable style on topics ranging from the sale of murderabilia to the celebrity factor in recent high profile criminal cases. I love Nancy Grace, even when I disagree with her, which isn't too often. The U.S.'s quest to preserve individual rights has overlooked the rights of victims of misdeeds, and voices like Nancy's will help to change our justice system for the better. My only criticism is this: Nancy, Nancy, please check your facts when you hold forth on civil matters.Right now our society is starting to hold corporations accountable for malfeasance, but the average citizen hates the notion of a windfall to a single plaintiff. To wit: the infamous McDonald's hot coffee case, which so many, including Ms Grace, cite as an example of civil litigation run amuck. That case involved a woman who sustained third degree burns of her groin following spillage of a freshly brewed cup of McDonald's coffee. She required numerous surgeries and multiple skin grafts. Here's what so many fail to report: the court found that McDonalds consistently brewed its coffee many degrees higher than any other fast food restaurant. They did so because the resulting aroma boosted sales. There had been many, many claims against McDonalds for third degree burn injuries resulting from spilling freshly purchased coffee. In spite of knowing that their coffee was more dangerous than any other in the industry, McDonald's continued to sell it. They knowingly placed profit before customers well being. In the famous case, the court took note of plaintiff's argument regarding the corporations reckless conduct, and in addition to awarding the plaintiff her medical expenses, fined McDonald's one day's worth of coffee sales. THAT is what resulted in the huge verdict. Viewing it from that aspect, the sum is not so egregious.There are thousands of us not so rich attorneys who spend tens of thousands of our own dollars to see justice done for injured folk, and wind up slashing fees because the victim needs the money most of all. Not all of us are slick Rolex wearing fat cats."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"&#65279;The idea that \\"high-priced\\" defense attorneys havesome how corrupted the system is foolish. It is true that financial resources are a huge advantage in a criminal case. The reality, though, is that 99.9% of the time the prosecution out-spends the defense. Only the wealthiest defendants have a hope of matching the prosecutors' resources. Most defendants are represented by public defenders, who are lucky if they have funding for the most basic investigation-let alone access to experts or others who could make a difference for their clients. Even most defendants who hire their own attorneys cannot really afford them and can seldom afford investigators or experts.If you want to write a book about how money influences the system, look at how often financially over-matched defense attorneys gain acquittals despite being out-spent, then posit a theory of how much more often defendants would be acquitted if their attorneys were on even-footing with the prosecutors. In other words, how many people are being convicted of crimes they did not commit because prosecutors purchase the convictions?"},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"Objection is a book I wouldn't take seriously - except that it's a best-seller. Sadly, many readers will be eager to accept Grace's view of the justice system. As other reviewers point out, Grace remains influenced by the murder of her boyfriend. She's bitter and biased.This book isn't a reasoned analysis of the legal system; it's a loosely-organized rant. I can't help wondering about Grace's qualifications: less than ten years in a DA's office followed by a move to television. And I wonder why she left for \\"political reasons.\\" In some jurisdictions, the Assistant DA's hang on regardless of who gets elected.So it's not surprising that Objection delivers a number of ironies and contradictions.(1) Grace criticizes \\"celebrity justice\\" but her own job creates and affirms celebrity. She herself has some notoriety, if not celebrity. Otherwise this book probably wouldn't have been published.(2) While celebrities do have more power and money than ordinary defendants, they also become more vulnerable to threats. DA's often follow through for fear of appearing weak or biased.As Johnnie Cochran pointed out in his own book, we can learn a great deal from celebrity trials. If everyone had OJ's resources, we would see more independent tests of forensic evidence -- and perhaps fewer convictions. If I were on a jury, I would not trust any prosecution evidence unless the defense had funds and access to materials for independent testing.(3) Grace criticizes juries for being irrational and starstruck; snidely she speculates that jurors expect to be invited to the mansion. But if juries fail to reason effectively (which many observers believe - few are trained in logical thinking and critical analysis) we need to question the entire system.For an intelligent discussion of the jury system, readers should turn to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's book, The Majesty of the Law.Grace doesn't go there, and she should. I've watched jurors interviewed on documentaries. Their reasons for verdicts often are based on their imaginary ideas of what's real, what's true and \\"what I would do.\\" Common sense is not always accurate or logical.(4) Grace questions why Kobe Bryant's accuser isn't identified as a victim. But (like so many DA's who appear on television) she forgets that Bryant never was tried. He was an alleged rapist. She's an accuser.And depression alters perception and memory, the basis for the accuser's claim. Ignoring a mental health record (as Grace implies we should do) is like asking the jury to disregard an eyewitness's need for glasses.There's special irony in Grace's criticism of Bryant's lawyer Mackey, who names the accuser several times during court hearings. As a DA, Grace herself was criticized by appellate courts for violating boundaries with over-zealous prosecution tactics.(5) Grace criticizes defendants who have \\"teams\\" of lawyers - but DA's rarely act alone. I've read that LA County assigned up to 50 lawyers on OJ's trial. The bigger problem: most defendants are hopelessly out-spent by the prosecution. Andrea Yates's defense team could not even afford a copy of the full transcript.(6) Grace attacks defense lawyers who play fast and loose with truth. But she doesn't talk about the DA in Tucson whose lies - under oath - sent innocent men to death row. (He got three years of license suspension.) I suggest buying Capturing the Friedmans and also Leslie Abramson's excellent, well-reasoned book, Ready for the Defense.(7) Grace claims to protect victims. But prosecuting innocent defendants and fighting for long jail sentences forces taxpayers to pay huge amounts of money, with no return except a feeling of vengeance. We have money for education or mental health, but when someone commits a crime, we have all the money in the world to punish them. And a falsely accused person is a victim, even if they are found not guilty.I had never watched Nancy Grace before reading this book. Now I think she belongs off the air and out of the legal field."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"This book was great.

Her desire for truth is paramount. All she states on defense attorneys, Judges, and all the other grifters involved is factual, at least to what I have seen in my life. The poll taken of Life in Prison only averages 6 years is astonishing. She is perfectly right in the fact of needing to inprison and not parole these monsters that molest and murder our children, we have to change the laws. The only thing I do feel she leaves out is that prosecutors in many states seem to work on a win/lose percentage that moves their careers forward.

I guess that would define this former prosecutor's courtroom demeanor as well. Hmm, how would I define her opponents aka defense attorneys? Kings of double-speak.Mind you I don't always agree with her, but so what? I'd rather read someone's honest opinion than regurgitation of \\"how the constitution protects the rights of criminals.\\"God, I love it when she spars with defense attorneys on TV. Like they are objective? Please.In my book I write about the brilliance of my abuser's defense attorney (wished I hired him first) and the incompetence of our Crown Attorney.

Her insights are concise and to the point, she presents her case for justice and proves it in her book just as she did as a Prosecutor in the Fulton County Court System.

Since the 1960s, we have allowed evil to get into every area of American life and we need more people in the law like Nancy to clean up the problem. The lives of our loved ones and kids are at stake!Nancy fights with passion against evil. Scott Peterson murdered his wife and Conner so he could live a life of PORNOGRAPHY and ADULTERY that Lacy would never have tolerated. But Nancy stood up when his high-powered lawyers were about to trick the courts into letting him go free and said NO! The case of Conner Peterson was about more than just murders though. It was about the right of the unborn to LIFE. There are many Conners being murdered every day in abortion clinics.This country is not about PORNOGRAPHY, child abuse, state-ordered murders of an ill woman in Florida or state-approved murders of Children. I don't want to hear any more whining about the rights of criminals or the rights of PORNOGRAPHERS. The right of unborn babies to LIFE and the rights of THE VICTIMS of crime are what counts. Nancy knows this and tells the truth in her book.This country needs to stop listening to the whining of the criminals and get on with reforming the system. There are a whole lot of lawyers who should be disbarred. It is a breach of ethics for any lawyer to enter a plea of innocence for those who are obviously guilty. The lawyers need to start being held ethically accountable for their actions in court.The criminals who have become judges and corrupted the court system need to be fired by our leaders. Every Judge involved in the Terry Schiavo case should have been arrested by our president and put on trial for MURDER. And the PORNOGRAPHY that BREEDS the MONSTERS who attack our loved ones needs to be banned as the law says it should be. As Nancy has said multiple times, where you find PORNOGRAPHY you find the roots of crime.I greatly admire what Nancy is doing on Television for our troops and our kids. She is a lone voice trying to save the victims from all highly placed elite scum who help criminals.What I really hope is that when the people of GOD finally fully redeem American Government, that Nancy steps down from Television and takes up the burden of prosecuting all of those responsible for the crimes committed by liberals, corrupt judges and the elite over the past 40 years.Bless you Nancy!!!!"},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"Nancy Grace and other TV Stars like her and their exploitive TV shows are a very deep American tragedy as they are turning our society's quest for justice into a terrible circus. This book is no better than the hundreds of TV shows she has been on convicting persons of crimes without a trial again and again. There is at least one famous case in Utah where Nancy Grace convicted a man on TV who was eventually proved to be 100% innocent, but who died in jail where he was placed for no reason, in part, because of the ranting and raving of Nancy Grace and other TV stars who jumped to the wrong conclusion without knowing the facts. As I write this the jury is in deliberation on the Jackson case, and Nancy is mocking Michael Jackson for going to the hospital and she is \\"telling the world\\" that she thinks he is guilty. Keep in mind that the jury is not even sequestered. Where is the justice? Not to be found here."},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","review":"Pathetic nonsense. A waste of time.

What a joke this system is! What a waste of money to have a trial for some Dirtbag who kills and pleads \\"Not Guilty\\" even after he/she shows the police where they left the victim and describes in detail how they were killed. Disgraceful!!! Nancy does an excellent job pointing out all the flaws and how they could be changed. To those who say she shouldn't give her opinion, I say WHAT??? She is entitled to her opinion, she isn't on the jury or prosecuting the case and it's funny how she's not entitled to her opinion but the defense attorneys are??? Some say she's just biased and holds a grudge because her fiance was murdered...Ya Think. I'd think she was crazy if she didn't, like some loons you see forgiving the killer(s). How could you forgive when your loved one is decomposing and the killer is still eating and watching TV? I've watched a trail that Nancy prosecuted years ago when Court TV really did have gavel to gavel coverage. She was Brilliant!!! During the closing arguments she told the jurors, \\"If you believe he did these crimes, then there is no reasonable doubt because you wouldn't have that belief if I didnt prove it\\". Yes, a wonderful statement and so true. There are some jurors who could have used this statement because you see them being interviewed on TV after a trial with tears rolling down there face saying, \\"I believed he killed them but the prosecution didn't prove it\\". What a DISGUSTING & SHAMEFUL statement! Couldn't they imagine the fear, pain or terror of what those poor innocent people went through before they let the killer free and put other innocent lives in danger.

We both started out knowing virtually nothing about the atomic bomb project.

My husband says that &quot;it's the stuff of guy fantasies.&quot; As the daughter of WW2 era parents, my reaction was that the romance was just that -- such a fantasy that it interfered with my ability to enjoy the story. I just can't buy Emma's promiscuity in the context of what I know of women during those years.So, three stars from me and five stars from my husband = four stars."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Great book.

All the fear and paranoia is here as is the passion of the time.After reading Cold Mountain I thought It might be a year before I read another truly wonderful book. What a treat.If you read one book this month, read Cold Mountain. If you read two, also read this book."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Joseph Kanon's Los Alamos is a brilliant piece of literature. When it was assigned for my mystery class, I was very dubious, as I don't usually read historicals. However, once I began reading, I became completely engrossed in the lives of the characters. I found myself rationing the chapters so that I wouldn't finish it too soon! The setting is so well-drawn that I could picture it vividly, and the characters are so interesting that I wanted to know more about them. After finishing the book, I was even motivated to read a biography of Robert Oppenheimer, who was one of the many historical figures in the book. Los Alamos - a book that instructs but above all entertains. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Though Los Alamos was competently written as the old saw goes; what was good wasn't original and what was original wasn't good. Most of the intrigue and paranoia of life on and around the Hill was originally done by Martin Cruz Smith in Stallion Gate, and the parallels between these novels were just too close for comfort. All Los Alamos made want to do was re-read Stallion Gate which I did, confirming that it is the far superior novel. If you like Los Alamos definitely pick up Stallion Gate and also Rhodes Making of the Atomic Bomb."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I read Los Alamos in hardcover last year and was totally blown away. (excuse the expression) What I found most amazing about Kanon's book was his ability to totally transport me back to a time that as a 37 year-old I know woefully little about. Los Alamos was a kind of Think Camp, the worlds best and often nuttiest scientists all sequestered away in the middle of the US desert, with one common goal. The horror of what they eventually created was by no means lost on them. First it's a scientific goal like any other which they strive to achieve, as they get closer to making it a reality, the two sides of the sword become frighteningly clear. Kanon writes well, has some good sub plots (love among the atoms), and really made me think. Always a plus. I bought the book for many friends in HC, you should buy it in paperback."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Why haven't I ever heard of Joseph Kanon? After years of reading thrillers, mysteries, erotica, historical fiction and Richard Feynman, here finally is an author who combines the finest aspects of all genres. Los Alamos really does have it all! I look forward to more from this author."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"What a great idea for a book --- a murder mystery that takes place during the Second World War at the secret Los Alamos lab where the atomic bomb was developed and includes famous physicists in its plot. Too bad it fell apart so completely that my only motive for completing the book was to see if its plot was as lame as I suspected. Alas, it was. The author relies on the &quot;idiot plot,&quot; with the main character behaving like a dunce solely to advance the story and prevent a premature conclusion. Why waste time on a book where you can guess who dunnit simply by the introductory description of a character? Furthermore, the moralizing in the book is superficial and serves only to fill pages up with words."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"This book is advertised as a murder mystery implicating the very core of the Manhattan Project. So, anyone interested in 1945 Los Alamos, who also enjoys a good mystery, should love this book - right? Wrong! Despite the publisher's hype, the Manhattan Project and the murder mystery are incidental to the real story. Real story: &quot;average guy&quot; protagonist is sent to Los Alamos to solve murder. He meets Gen. Groves and shakes hands with Oppenheimer. On page 36 he meets &quot;knock out&quot; wife of a foreign scientist. Despite the fact that she has slept with any male who asked on both the European and American continents, she falls instantly and deeply in love with our &quot;average guy&quot; (actually, that ends up to be the book's mystery. The reader remains clueless as to what it is that attracts her to him). After several &quot;bodice ripping&quot; encounters, she announces that &quot;average guy&quot; is the true love she has been searching for. They vow eternal love. Yada, yada, yada. With a little practice, Kanon may give Danielle Steele a run for her money in the romance category, but if it's a mystery set in historical Los Alamos that you're after, save your money."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Los Alamos reads more like a novelization of a screenplay than a novel. The idea - a murder in the Los Alamos nuclear bomb research facility - is clever enough. But the execution is lazy and washed-out. Kanon makes no real effort to bring a vision of the time to life. If it wasn't for the references to &quot;the war&quot; and 1942 Buicks and such, you'd forget where and when the novel was set. The info about the building of the bomb could have come from Encyclopedia Brittanica; the story of the Anasazi from a Park Service pamphlet. As for characters, you've got your hard-boiled loner investigator, your wild-hearted and confused broad, your straight-laced by-the-book supervisor, your blandly affable compadre, the mysterious foreign artist, and so forth. If it was a screenplay, you'd send it to a new pen for a rewrite. Okay, I bought the book in an airport, so what did I expect? But really, how did this bland and silly novel grab so many rapturous cover blurbs?"},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Kanon's novel promises a lot: A murder mystery set in World War II Los Alamos. Spies, the making of the first atomic bomb, and fascinating historical characters combine to make this potentially one of the great mystery/ suspense novels. Alas, it is not. The book collapses into implausibility and irrelevance.On the subject of implausibility -- hopefully not giving away much of the (weak) plot -- the hero Mike Connolly just happens to meet by coincidence every key figure in the plot early on in the book. This is a hard pill to swallow when one figures that several thousand people worked at Los Alamos. Coincidence happens -- but not over and over and over again.On the question of irrelevance, one assumes that the book is building up to a dramatic conclusion involving spy rings, national security, and villains of consequence. It's not. It's building up to a sordid little scandal -- unworthy of the setting and the promise of the book. In the words of the old song, \\"Is that all there is?\\"Just to see if Kanon is improving, I took a look at his newer Book, \\"The Good German.\\" He's hasn't: same weak reliance on coincidence and chance. Don't waste your time reading \\"Los Alamos\\" or \\"The Good German.\\""},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Los Alamos is truly awful book: cardboard characters, lame storyline, implausible love affair, etc. Kanon has little talent as a writer. Its almost as if he set out to make all the wrong decisions in telling this story. Connelly's character is so flat (we learn practically nothing about him), that it is impossible to care about him or anyone he encounters. I am convinced that the only reason this book was ever printed is because Kanon is a publishing exec. Mr. Kanon, please return to the business world and leave the writing to someone, anyone else."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"This was a debut novel for Joseph Kanon, and it certainly shows a lot of promise. Kanon introduces many of us to a story most of us know little about-- the development of the atomic bomb in Los Alamos, New Mexico.Kanon does a fine job of painting a picture of the time and place, as it is Spring 1945 and the scientists and soldiers at Los Alamos are nearing the time of the first test explosions of the atomic bomb (in a passage in the book, Kanon stunning describes the explosion of the A Bomb as scientists and soldiers look on, many not even realizing what the advent of the A Bomb would mean or how it would affect them).Against this backdrop, a security officer, Karl Bruner, assigned to Los Alamos, has been murdered and Michael Connolly, an intelligence officer, has been sent in to solve it. Connolly must carefully navigate the secrecy surrounding the Manhattan Project while attempting to solve the mystery of Bruner's death.Along the way, he meets such luminaries tied to the project as Robert Oppenheimer (this book made me wish I could find a good biography on him). The conclusion is not totally satisfying as I did not find the resolution of the murder totally convincing, but the journey to that resolution is well worth the trip."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"The historical aspects of Los Alamos are very educational although somewhat fictional. The characters are believable, especially the love interest for the main character and the small town sheriff. I have read this book twice and enjoyed it both times. The ending is a little to much of a fade out for my liking, but might symbolize the tensions that lay before us in the cold war. Would make a good movie with the write screenplay and believable actors."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Kanon's book is entertaining and interesting from a historical perspective. Great character's that are likable and human to a fault. The way the story is written from the perspective of someone new to Los Alamos allows you to see it for the first time throught their eyes. I plan to recommend it to alot of people and I can't wait for Kanon's next book."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Los Alamos is a good first entry for the author that, I believe, is more enjoyable if the reader has decent knowledge about the hysteria and secrecy that surrounded the Manhattan Project and its workers. Portraits of Oppenheimer, Teller and other scientists are painted against a murder myster that is slighty above average. What makes this book stand out is the detail that is given the setting and background in this novel. A good book for the summer, not a classic; however, a very promising beginning"},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I found this in a used book store and remembered it was a best seller a few years back, so I bought it for a buck. It is really different from many of the books I have read where you either liked or disliked the book. This one has me split down the middle. I really liked the background of the story, i.e. the background of the 1940's time period, the use of the historical setting of Los Alamos and the characters who created the bomb, the isolated area where the drama takes place. The details about the secrecy of the \\"gadget\\" and the mysterious murder were all very compelling. However, the two main characters and their supposed \\"love\\" affair were very superficial and left me feeling rather empty--they just did not fit well together. I did not care for the sex scenes not only because of the immorality involved, but they were overdone in an adolescent type of detail and very poorly written compared to the rest of the book. The nonsexual interaction between the two lovers was also strained and nonsensical, as was the final outcome of the relationship. In summary, the mood, atmosphere, and plot were all very good but dampened by the poorly developed relationship between the two main characters."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Los Alamos is a book by a man, about a man, for men. As a female reader, neither the story nor the characters had much to engage me. I did enjoy the setting, and wished he could have devoted more space to describing how the bomb was built and tested. The love story left me cold. I felt uncomfortable with his treatment of Robert Oppenheimer, not knowing if it was accurate. By the end of the book, I was caught up in the whodunnit, but still felt unsatisfied with the characters, especially the female ones."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"If you need something to help you sleep I suggest Los Alamos: I didn't even &quot;TRY&quot; to finish this one!"},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"an okay read to pass the time, if you're really desperate. however, as a native of new mexico, i was horrified by the characterization of it's two largest ethnic groups. all the native americans were maids and the two hispanic characters were murderous brutes. luckily we had the (one-dimensional) new yorker to come in and save us! kanon refers to new mexican hispanics as &quot;mexicans&quot;. kanon, we do not like to be referred to as mexicans and have been a part of the southwest landscape centuries before the existence of mexico (independent of spanish rule), an american territory since the 19th century and an american state more than 3 decades at the time of this story. perhaps kanon should have spoken with some (non-white) locals during his supposedly &quot;well-researched&quot; writing of this mediocre novel. i'm just glad this book was a freebie for me. kanon, go elsewhere for your next novel, do not return to the &quot;land of enchantment&quot;. why don't you set your next book in new york, where you live, i'm sure there are plenty of ethnicities to insult there."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"The story was interesting in that it gave an insite into life at Los Alamos during the Manhatten Project in the 1940's.

It's a near identical rip of Fat Man and Little Boy, but with a lame fictional subplot of a murder mystery. The characters are very forgettable, the reason for being for some characters in the story is in doubt (the main character for one, the murder victim for another - a bad combo for a murder mystery). The author basically piggybacked a half baked short story into a pre-existing historical account to flesh it out to novel length, implausably working his main character into recorded historical events.

About the only thing good with this book was that it piqued my interest in the Manhattan Project and General Groves who ran it - for that a non-fiction book is far superior."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I purchased this book in an airport because the clerk said it had been &quot;jumping off the shelves.&quot; After reading this book I can assure you that the books were &quot;jumping off the shelves&quot; in an effort to avoid a more painful death. I was disappointed.

However, after struggling through the first 100 pages, I still had no interest in the murder of Bruner. Instead of building the murder case/investigation up, Kanon opts unsuccessfully to develop the romance between Connolley and Emma. Their stilted conversations became tiresome, and Kanon's feeble attempt to portray the two as flirtatious fell quite flat. As a thriller, the book is okay. As a romance, it is unsuccessful. If you must try this book, go for the paperback version"},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Totally predictable. Thin plot. A giant waste of time and money. If you want a thriller avoid this book, if you want a love story surely there must be better ones out there"},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"The reader is treated to an investigator who's approach to investigating is to hang around and sleep with a married woman as much as possible. His big break is as a result of a chance encounter. And we learn the details of the plot from ploters who become astonishingly loquacious when confronted."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"This was the worst book I have read in a long long time. The writing was full off cliches that were like one liners in a bar. The unnessessary love scene was not even written well. It was like a teenager describing sex for the first time. The only reason I finished was to see who did what. Even after you find out, the book continues to drag on after. To much time was spent trying to set up the back ground and the chemistry between Connelly and Emma. From the get go this was a horrible trash pulp novel. And Like a cherry on the top I even found a typo. Go figure from a printing executive."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I bought this book expecting to be entralled by the characters and science in and around Los Alamos. Creating &quot;The Bomb&quot; was arguable the greatest collection of genius ever assembled in search of one goal. The thought of a murder connected with this now historic community seemed interesting at first. The first few dozen pages even hinted at a good novel. But..The author goes nowhere. The book drags on for the last 250 pages; if good books are &quot;page turners&quot; this one had the pages glued together. Only the description of Oppie kept it going. Kannon even has a nugget of a good idea by inserting some of the philosophical disputes of the day (communism vs. democracy, nationalism vs. humanism, German vs. the Jews, loyalty vs. self will, etc.) in the death of one of Los Alamos' scientists, but he makes it boring.I can't write a review without mentioning that the insertion of nearly pornographic (and poorly written) sex scenes into this book floored me. Its as if Kannon left his PC on and his 12 year old son came in and wrote some smut into his text. Kannon even makes sex boring.Bottom line, if any engineers or science folks want to try this book because of the rare mixture of science and mystery (like I did), don't waste your time. There are some redeeming qualities, but not many. The science is skimmed over, the characters are stereotypical and one dimensional and the plot never grabs you. The time period information is interesting and so are a FEW of the characters and encounters. But, read something else first."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"This is in fact an historical fiction novel with murder mystery and love story contained within. The murder mystery involves Karl Brunner, a security agent for the Manhattan project which is the massive WWII nuclear project culminating in the trinity bomb test and the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Los Alamos is the home of many scientists and engineers as well as pipe fitters, cooks, clerks etc. needed to keep the huge project going. There is tension and considerable pressure to develop the bomb as rapidly as possible. Historical figures featured in the novel include Robert Oppenheimer, the scientific director and General Groves, the army commander. In addition, somewhat complicating this story is the fact that many if not most of the scientists are not US citizens. A significant number have fled Germany due to the early manifestations of the Holocaust. Germany has surrendered by the time of this story which takes away some of the incentives that pushed the project -- many of the scientists are involved in this project to punish Nazi Germany for its misdeeds and have less of a desire to destroy Japan. This does not stop the project.The murder is very difficult to solve due to false leads sand the confession of murder by a man who had not murdered the victim. The detective investigating the case is Michael Connolly. He is the intelligence officer, brought in from the outside for the specific purpose of solving the case and excluding a national security concern. During the investigation he falls in love with wife of one of the scientists (the love story). The security of the project is in fact somewhat compromised. The ending provided many surprises when the killer/killers are revealed.The characters are well developed, the plot clever and the historical aspect very interesting. The vastness of the portion of the southwest, the seclusion of the project and the overwhelming extreme security (obviously necessary) looms over every aspect of life in the project. The concerns of some of the scientists, that although driven to succeed (and they do) is the concern that they have opened a huge can of worms. The concern seems legitimate but as some of the scientists noted, the bomb was part of science, and would be developed by other nations soon, no matter what the US did.The test succeeded and we have lived under the nuclear threat 65 years. Fortunately, miraculously, no bomb was exploded in anger since Nagasaki. The two bombs succeeded in pushing the Japanese to surrender, probably saving about a million Allied casualties and millions of Japanese casualties.I really enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"If you think that this book has an intriguing or interesting plot idea I would suggest you go to your library or local used bookstore and try to find a copy of Thomas Wiseman's much superior and well written novel &quot;Savage Day&quot;. It's basically the same premise but Wiseman pulls it off with great literary flair."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I only figured out &quot;who dun it&quot; very near then end of the book. Almost all the details fit together, making this a very satisfying mystery. It may have helped that I was born and raised in Los Alamos and most of the details were right."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Picked this up to relieve the boredom of commuting by Metro North and it did the job - and then some. Though there was a curious lack of depth to some of the characters and seemed to take too long to get to where it was going, I found it hard to put this book down. A more convincing portrayal of the Los Alamos portrayal than it's Martin Cruz Smith 'cousin' &quot;Stallion Gate&quot;."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I found this in a used book store and remembered it was a best seller a few years back, so I bought it for a buck. It is really different from many of the books I have read where you either liked or disliked the book. This one has me split down the middle. I really liked the background of the story, i.e. the background of the 1940's time period, the use of the historical setting of Los Alamos and the characters who created the bomb, the isolated area where the drama takes place. The details about the secrecy of the \\"gadget\\" and the mysterious murder were all very compelling. However, the two main characters and their supposed \\"love\\" affair were very superficial and left me feeling rather empty--they just did not fit well together. I did not care for the sex scenes not only because of the immorality involved, but they were overdone in an adolescent type of detail and very poorly written compared to the rest of the book. The nonsexual interaction between the two lovers was also strained and nonsensical, as was the final outcome of the relationship. In summary, the mood, atmosphere, and plot were all very good but dampened by the poorly developed relationship between the two main characters."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Joseph Kanon's novel Los Alamos is a wonderful period piece that uses the almost unbelievable setting of the Manhattan Project as the basis for a mystery and love story that, because of the situation and time, are more significant than would otherwise be the case. The blending of real and fictional characters in what is one of the centuries most fascinating stories makes for a gripping tale that has much to recommend it. This is a fascinating story and led me to unexpected hours of research on the actual history of the Manhbattan Project just to check things out. I think any American with a even a slight interest in our recent history would find this book fascinating. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Joseph Kanon takes a great detective setting, Los Alamos during the last hectic days of the creation of the atomic bomb, but proceeds to lull the reader to sleep with his dull and plodding writing. The only reason I give this one star is that it provided the necessary airplane relief from a yacky neighbor."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Kanon has done a good job of capturing the psychological &quot;feel&quot; of Los Alamos near the end of WW II, and if he'd made more effort to embody the ambiguous moral atmosphere of the Manhattan Project in his characters this could have been the definitive novel about the period. Unfortunately, he chose instead to populate it with cliche figures who are neither interesting nor emotionally involving for the reader (he does somewhat better with the &quot;real&quot; people he includes, but they're not as central to the main story). Again, the plot has possibilities, but his use of them is highly predictable and the ending was rather a letdown. Plus the novel is full of anachronistic errors -- e.g., his characters get from Chaco Canyon directly to Taos without benefit of the Rio Grande bridge, which was built in the 1960's to traverse a previously impassable gorge. I confess to having skimmed large portions of the novel to get through it -- in spite of its bulk, it was just too &quot;thin,&quot; plot- and character-wise, to engage me."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I started this book with high hopes, the reviews on the cover where very good and i have always enjoyed books with real characters and a true historical background.I was very disappointed, the first 100 or so pages were great but after that the reading became a chore, i did not care about the characters who were 2 dimensional at best, not one of the characters including the main characters and the murder victim ellicited any sympathy or even interest.This book did not entertain, i kept on turning the pages in the hope that it would turn around but it did not. I did not even feel i had learned anything about the Manhatten project."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"When it was first published in 1997, \\"Los Alamos\\" was hailed by many as a noteworthy debut for Joseph Kanon. The novel did pave the way for a notable career that has seen several bestsellers and one movie adaptation in the form of \\"The Good German.\\" Reading \\"Los Alamos\\" ten years later, the novel comes across as a fair, but flawed attempt at classic World War 2 noir. Kanon enjoys mixing historical moments with fictional stories, here he uses the Los Alamos, New Mexico compound where Oppenheimer and his scientists built the atomic bomb. Many of Kanon's descriptions of locations and settings are impressive, with a delicate eye towards research. He does manage to nicely capture the time, customs and technology of the 1940s in an almost cinematic way. The premise of the plot is also interesting, a murder inside the Los Alamos labs, so now our main character, detective Michael Connolly, needs to investigate the killing as he is also surrounded by a secret government project taking place. However, Kanon is great with the details but flawed with the story itself. The characters are never very interesting, they never seem to come alive or provoke much interest, especially Connolly's main love interest who is also a suspect, the passion and danger never comes across and their dialogue is very typical. Surprisingly, the only page-turner moments between them is a heavy sex scene where Kanon apparently enjoyed indulging in very vivid descriptions meant to create suspense I guess. The story also has a way of chugging along, pausing at times for moments of little interest or even little character study. The best-written character is Robert Oppenheimer, only because it's fun to read Kanon's imaginings of how the famous scientist would behave and converse with Connolly. There are moments of suspense, but surprisingly few of them in a book numbering 517 pages. The climax itself is a downer, almost predictable. \\"Los Alamos\\" is not a terrible novel, in fact, it is well-written in the sense that Kanon has a great grasp of language and detail, but it just never elevates itself to a higher level where feels satisfying in the end. It has a lot of promise, but little delivery. Great set-ups, few payoffs. It is a decent read, but not a memorable one."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"What a disappointment! This novel does nothing to set the atmosphere, reading more like a modified screenplay (which I'm suspecting was one of the motivations playing in Kanon's mind). The characters are poorly (re)imagined, the settings dismissively portrayed, and the writing style unremarkable. Also, I had the feeling that the author didn't work on immersing himself in the circumstances of New Mexico, WWII, or the Project. It's all too contemporary in parts (seems like it's pulled out of the 1980s instead of the 1940s). Finally, the plot is too simplistic and rather dull. A dud."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Nothing happens--after 250 pages!--so I just gave up. The story just meanders, goes on and on about nothing really. A security officer from Los Alamos is found dead with his pants down. So, I was thinking: Is this a comedy? The hero/sleuth Connors sets out to solve the crime...very, very, very slowly. He meets Emma, the wife of one of the scientists, and falls for her...uggh! I was convinced it was a comedy when at the memorial service for the deceased, where Oppenheimer himself quotes from the Bhagavad Gita, Connors gets a woody over Emma. What? That does it. I read a little more and gave up. Hopeless."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"The subject is very ambitious and intriguing; Los Alamos in WW2. But unfortunately, this book is extremely poor as a novel. It is lengthy and tedious, and I felt like drinking soup diluted several times with water. It contains several interesting matters such as a guilty conscience of the scientists for creating the dreadful weapon, but they are described only superficially and not appealing at all.And the characters are all dull and flat, especially Connolly, the protagonist. It might be a little better if he were a mechanical narrator who just reported the life in Los Alamos to readers. But he artificially displays his \\"personality\\" with an abrupt adultery. That makes the story increasingly diffuse and boring.I won't accuse this book as a complete waste of time, because it let me have a glimpse of the inside of Los Alamos in WW2. But I feel terribly frustrated why such an intriguing subject could not become a better novel."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I spent a goodly chunk of my formative years in the deserts of New Mexico. So naturally, whenever a book about New Mexico rolls about, I try and take a look at it, especially when it deals with Los Alamos, a tiny scrap of a town that is up high in the Jemez mountains in the northern part of the state. It's a beautiful place, full of twisting roads, amazing geology, and magnificent views. It's also rather isolated, and it was here in the 1940's that one of the most intriguing secrets of World War II took place -- the development of the atomic bombs that would later devastate Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Author Joseph Kanon uses the background of the Manhattan Project, and the world of the American southwest to create a world that is in a momumental race against time, and that left an echo that is still resounding to this day. It's tightly written thriller that sends goosebumps up the spine and still manages to leave the reader guessing as to what is really going on, despite the knowledge that we know what is going to happen.The story opens with Michael Connelly arriving in the capital of New Mexico, Santa Fe, that is perched on the edge of the Rio Grande river. He has been sent by the government to discover who killed a man whose body has been found in a city park. The powers that be want the case hushed up and done with, with as little fuss and mess as possible, for the murdered man, Karl Bruner, was a security officer at the town of Los Alamos, site of a project that the locals know about, but not the purpose of.And there are plenty of secrets to be uncovered here. Bruner, who was beaten to death, and left with his pants down around his knees, is a touchy case. Everyone, it seems, want the case to go away, from Santa Fe's police chief, Holliday, to General Groves, the head of the Project, and Connelly's assistant, Mills. But to balance that, there are the scientists at Los Alamos, especially Robert Oppenheimer, a man of vision, and a quiet physicist, Eisler, who creates a bond with Connelly. Finally, Connelly encounters a British woman, Emma, who is married to one of the researchers.Along the way, I found myself finding out about some aspects of World War II on the civilian front that I didn't know anything about. There are censors, rationing, and the unsettling knowledge that while Hitler has been defeated and the war in Europe is over, there is a far far more dangerous threat looming on the horizon. And it seems that Santa Fe and Los Alamos is simply crawling with spies, or possible spies, everywhere. There is also the plight of Jews, homosexuals and the prejudice that plagued everyone who wasn't white, male and politically left that fuels an undercurrent of hatred throughout the story.What I really enjoyed about this novel was that Kanon weaves in a lot of lore about New Mexico into his story, from the local inhabitants of Anglos, Spanish and the Indians, to the spectacular landscape, and the distinct feel that the visitor has come to a place that is different than anything else that can be found. Along the way I found out things about the ancient Anasazi, who vanished, the lore of the gemstone turquoise, and other tidbits that helped me to recall my own memories of the place.Kanon's narrative flows well, balancing out descriptive narrative, and long sections of dialogue. While the dialogue does get overwrought at times -- this is the reason why this novel got four stars, not five -- Kanon is careful enough to keep the story from bogging down into too much detail over nuclear physics, but also focused on the case of Karl Bruner. Mystery fans will have a good time sorting out the red herrings, and there is enough historical detail that makes this a very believable novel.Another enjoyable bit is that Kanon uses historical figures such as the scientists in very convincing ways, and stays within what is known about them. While Connelly and Emma are fictional, what occurs in the story from April to July 1945 is not, and those who have remained fascinated by the Manhattan Project will have a good time picking out the real figures of Oppenheimer, Weber, Groves, and others. And yes, the fact that the researchers played outrageous pranks on the security guards is quite true.I happily recommend this one, and also Kanon's later novel, The Good German, for two unique views of WWII that goes beyond the battlefields, and takes a look at the inner world of the people that lived through that time."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I liked this book, partly because I lived in Los Alamos as a child and partly because I am interested in the historical aspects of the Manhattan Project. As a thriller it was pretty good independent of those aspects, because the plot was complex enough that you couldn't see where the author was going with it from a million miles away. Of course the guy gets the girl in the end, but it seemed fresh and interesting to me."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"As a refugee from the project in the early '50s to being a refugee from Technocracy, I lived the moral challanges of the &quot;business&quot; as we called it, and through perserverence escaped. Raised as a depression kid, growing up siphoning gas to fill an &quot;A&quot; stamped '41 Chevy to go and try to score with a slick chick, I've been there. Now Anasazi-land is my refuge from the Jemez to the Land of the Hopis. Kanon has got it!I'm uncertain as to how he got the feel - but he's got it. The feelings: Tension; Suspicion; Paranoia; Desparation; Passion and Hope The desperate days of '45. The end in sight. The solution at hand. Yet always The Soviets. But the morality question shrouding all. I think of my friends doomed at the beaches of Honshu, then look at the devestation of Hiroshima. The excitement of valor in battle lost forever. Sherman was right - &quot;War is Hell&quot;.Kanon senses this - and blends it with the passion and excitement of a steamy extra-marital affair.All this is played out in Tony Hillerman's turf. I fully expected Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn to come in and clear up the whole mess with the wisdom exclusive to the Navaho tribal police.The descriptions of the high mesa country, Chaco Canyon and the southwestern's toughest desert - White Sands can only have been written by a person who has climbed the heights, seen the sunsets, felt the heat and eaten the dust. Surely Kanon was born there.But he was none of the above - yet he can spin a yarn about all of this with the best.There are times the book starts to stall, yet he picks up the pace again; and the end was a bit abrupt. But considering this is a first effort - He done damn good!I can see this as a powerful film with proper handling. (It could be a dud with mis-casting, poor rewrite and direction coupled with a stingy producer.) But the seeds are here. Let them flourish so that others share the world so few of us survived.Rated 8 as nothing is perfect and there are a few spots that weakened the story. But most certainly not the grasp of the era, the definition of the characters, the beauty of the countryside, the heat of passion and the terrifying challange of the Manhatten Project."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Los Alamos makes you feel the wind in the desert, and makes you feel it in 1945. There is a sense of weariness, of a long war winding down to a victory already made morally ambiguous by the activities on the Hill. The tenacity of the hero tracking down one murderer in the mushroom shadow of mass destruction is reminiscent of &quot;Night of the Generals&quot;. Creating fictional characters for historical figures is rarely convincing; here, they are. The plot twists are well done, even when murder turns to espionage, the story holds up. Only one flaw, but it turns a memorable book into...above average. The hero's relationship with Emma. Emma herself. The lengthy, well-written sex scenes and stirrings of true love in the hero's breast, the psuedo-cryptic dialogue between the two, and the truly unbelievable end to the romance. It's sort of like trying to combine &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; and &quot;Bridges of Madison County&quot;. I hope Mr. Kanontakes us to another time and place, leaving some unnecessary baggage behind."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"There is no denying that Joseph Kanon is a talented writer. But it should be noted that there is an undercurrent of homophobia running through his first novel, &quot;Los Alamos&quot;. For instance, on page 135 of the first edition, in a supposedly humerous exchange, one of Kanon's characters contends that the only good 'fruit' is a dead 'fruit'. And the book abounds with gratuitous, derogatory references to 'queers'. &quot;Los Alamos&quot; encourages negative attitudes toward gays. Those who are uncomfortable with that would do well to skip the book. Those who don't find that off-putting will probably consider &quot;Los Alamos&quot; a good read"},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Kanon's genius is his ability to make the reader accept that events and conversations happened just as they appear on the page. His characterizations of Oppenheimer and Groves are especially believable. One has to be careful not to take these &quot;fictions&quot; as reality, as they are so convincingly presented. There is some unevenness in the fictional characters in that they can seem manufactured to fit the story line. But the real life participants, like the scientists, exude a genuineness that is remarkable. Connolly, the hero, and his affair with Emma, the straying wife of one of the scientists, often have a contrived aspect about them. Their presense is needed to flow the story line of the murder mystery, but can at times seem interruptive to the &quot;real&quot; happenings. When Connolly enlists Emma to set the final trap for the cuprits, Kanon's dialog again captures the tone of a real life situation. The resolution of the crime is reminiscent of a movie scenario where the bad guy explains to the hero the justification of the bad deeds before the hero is liquidated. That shortcoming is minor against the background of what was one of the world's major historic events"},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"This novel is a cut above the usual police/detective/mystery/spy potboiler inasmuch as its setting is of historical interest--and importance. Kanon has done excellent background research on the Los Alamos project and the New Mexico setting for the Manhattan Project. His historical and political characterization is perceptive and for many younger readers, especially, even educational. The plot structure is nuanced and clever, right down to the resolution of the mystery, which had me, at least, slapping my forehead bleating, \\"Why didn't I figure that out earlier myself?\\" Maybe I'm thick, but this obvious-after-the-case resolution is to me the sign of a well-crafted story.It seems, however, that whenever a novelist invests the time and effort to spin a yarn of this magnitude, there is a little voice suggesting that maybe just maybe, this is the stuff of which Hollywood films are made. That's my explanation, at least, of why Kanon seemed compelled to incorporate some fairly pedestrian and sometimes embarrassingly juvenile romantic and sexual hijinks into his story. The interaction between the protagonist Michael Connelly and the barb-tongued British wife of a project scientist seems as adolescent as it is improbable. The sex scenes are cliched and just plain silly.But given the overall quality of the novel otherwise, I can forgive Kanon this indulgence, and I think other readers will, as well. Let me add here that I was intrigued by the name of the story's hero, Michael Connelly. Is it sheer coincidence that this character's real life namesake is one of the leading mystery writers working today? I doubt it."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Curiously dissapointing. Might have been the hype, the setting, (and the cool cover art), but pretty forgettable all the way around."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I really liked this book, it's a mystery within a mystery within a mystery. I liked the characters and the story and I thought it was reasonably true to the times, historically as well as culturally (sorry, I don't know enough about nuclear fission to comment on the science) including the overt racism towards American citizens of Hispanic descent that was so prevalent at the time (although Kanon could have done with a bit less authenticity in this area) as well as the main characters' tendency to romanticize the Anasazi people of Chaco and Bandalier while marginalizing current Navaho and pueblo tribes. It did irk me that Kanon kept referring to the Los Alamos/Jemez area as the &quot;desert,&quot; when, in fact, it's actually part of the Rocky Mountains and sustains not only the snowfall but also similar varieties of the flora and fauna found throughout that mountain chain, but that's a small thing in comparison with how much I enjoyed this book. Ps for Mr Kanon: most of those roads were not paved until the 1960's and 70's."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Were it not set against such a compelling historical backdrop, this would be an entirely forgettable mystery. But Army Intelligence officer Michael Connolly isn't investigating just any murder; the corpse found in a Santa Fe park is that of a Los Alamos security officer and it is early April, 1945. Though the victim is found with his pants around his ankles, suggesting a possible tie to a previous unsolved homosexual murder, it is Connolly's job to be certain that the case does not effect security at the most secretive and important military installation in the country.Kanon uses the setting and real life characters to good effect. The story unfolds as final preparations are made for testing the atomic bomb and concludes on the night of Trinity, with the blast being the most impressive bit of writing in the book. Kanon's hardly the first to exploit the natural tension between the very different General Leslie Groves--blunt, bluff, and straightforward--and J. Robert Oppenheimer--all introspection and angst--but he does so capably. And the questions of whether to use the bomb and what motivated those who spied for the Soviets provide a patina of moral seriousness.Unfortunately though, much of this historical drama is undercut by what we now know of the real history. Obviously we know that the bomb will work and that it will be dropped on Japan. More importantly, we know that the Manhattan Project was thoroughly infiltrated by Soviet Intelligence and that even some of the scientists who were not Communists may have supplied information to the Soviets. They may honestly have believed that the post-War world would be better off if both superpowers had the bomb, but, whether they were right or not (a fight we need not take up here), such actions on their part were nonetheless treasonous.Of course, the big question concerns Oppenheimer himself. With the fall of the Soviet Union, there has been some corroboration of the accusation that he too aided the Soviet Union (see particularly the memoirs of Pavel Sudoplatov, Special Tasks: The Memoirs of an Unwanted Witness--A Soviet Spymaster), but nothing definitive has come out. I recall my first exposure to Oppenheimer was a miniseries in 1980 which not only sought to portray him as something of a martyr to anti-Communist witch hunts, but which, given the context of the times, was at least an oblique commentary on US paranoia as a cause of the Cold War. Now that we can step back and look at the Oppenheimer case with a little less emotion, it seems unimportant whether he actually committed any acts of espionage himself; what seems truly bizarre is that a man who had belonged to Communist front groups and whose wife, brother, and many friends were all Communists, at one time or another, was put, and left, in charge of the project in the first place. Though he was reviled for saying so, one has to agree with Edward Teller's testimony at Oppenheimer's security hearings that the nation would be more secure with Oppenheimer out of government.At any rate, considering the ease with which the Soviets obtained the supposedly safely guarded atomic secrets, it's a little bit difficult to take the book's espionage plotline seriously. In fact, the book would have benefited from a little less of the standard chase, since its outcome doesn't ultimately matter, and a little further exploration of the motivations and consequences of the real spying that went on there.GRADE : C"},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Kanon has an excellent idea and plot line for a good book but it just doesn't have the pizzaz I was looking for. At times it was slow but I finished it. I hope Kanon can write something better cause I'll give him one more chance."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I found this to be a pretty solid spy story set in zenith of the nuclear era. I'd have given it 3.5 stars, to be honest, as it got a little long-winded toward the end. But overall the characters are good, and the plot has some great twists and the whole history surrounding the story is intriguing. Definitely could've been better though."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"We start out with a simple murder. A man's been killed, and the circumstances seem to imply a homosexual liason gone wrong. The problem is that the victim is a security officer at the Los Alamos Atomic Weapons Facility, so someone must investigate thoroughly to make sure nothing's compromised. A peacetime newspaperman improbably turned detective shows up to investigate, and thus begins Joseph Kanon's Los Alamos.Moving from the desert to diners in New York City, the book has an easy sort of grace to it. The characters are fluent, and believeable, and the plot is fast enough to be interesting. Our hero gets a girl, the bad guys are interesting, it's all worthwhile, far as I was concerned. There are also interesting supporting characters, including General Leslie Groves, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and a bunch of scientists. This makes for a very entertaining book."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I have read everything that Forsythe and Follett have written. I find international spy stories to be fascinating, especially by these two authors. The way that they can weave a spy mystery plot into the details of a specific international setting is masterful writing to me. I consider &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; to be at the top of the class for this genre. Follett's latest &quot;The Hammer of Eden&quot; continues this tradition.In &quot;Los Alamos&quot;, Joseph Kanon writes in the same tradition. If nothing else, his setting of the Manhattan Project, and the portrayals of the personalities involved make this an historical novel of detail that brings the Project alive and makes it real. To weave a murder plot concerning National Security into the setting is masterful. The only drawback that I felt to the story was that the plot itself dragged slightly and was not as dramatic as the setting.For a first novel, Kanon has placed himself among the top of mystery writers and the book deserves the awards that it received. It was an excellent read. I look forward to now reading his second book."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Moral ambiguity is the spice to mysteries, and it grow sharpest than at ground zero on a windswept mesa in New Mexico in Joseph Kanon's debut novel &quot;Los Alamos.&quot;There, working in near-complete secrecy on a government-built city, scientists led by J. Robert Oppenheimer developed the atomic bomb. But when the murder of a security officer -- himself a German refugee like many of the scientists -- with hints of a homosexual encounter involved, poses a risk to the project. The project chief calls in Army Intelligence, in the form of Michael Connolly, to investigate, and possibly to suppress what he finds.The case is tricky in more ways than one. Connolly must deal with the local police, as well as suspicions that the murder may be homosexually related, at a time where homophobia was public policy instead of a private embarrassment.But Kanon shines in recreating the atmosphere of this city in the clouds, where scientists work feverishly to unveil the secrets of atomic fission by day, and listen to Beethoven quartets by night; where its residents can be reached by only a box number, their driver's licenses identify them by numbers, but as Connolly observed, &quot;in the most secret place in the world, there was maid service.&quot; Kanon dives into issues of moral responsibility often, of the need for secrecy and deceit, but also for the need for love and trust among people seemingly incapable of both. Kanon obligingly throws in the English wife of an emigre scientist, tough and cynical in jodhpurs and drink, aching for the human touch inside.&quot;Los Alamos&quot; is really what much-hyped &quot;The Big Picture&quot; should have been, a look at some truly heady moral issues wrapped in the guilty pleasures of a murder mystery. While Kanon trots with the conventions of the genre instead of runs with it, taking few risks and faithfully following the contours of the genre, &quot;Los Alamos&quot; offers greater pleasures in its depiction of everyday life in a city that doesn't exist, among people without identity. It's a memorable depiction of two worlds, the outside pre-nuclear power civilization and the inside community of scientists, both blown away forever by the radioactive dust from the Trinity bomb site."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Upon reading all the reviews of this book on the inside cover and first couple pages, I figured I had a fantastic book in my hands, and couldn't wait to finish the one I was reading to get started on it. The premise seemed original, and the critics comments were outstanding. However, I must say I am slightly disappointed in not getting as much out of it as I thought I would. It just seemed like it never really hit full stride. It was entertaining but at times moved rather slowly; I charged ahead enthusiastically though in anticipation of an explosive (no pun intended!)ending. Aside from the obvious event, it never really happened. I also must say that that callous feelings our hero and heroin seemed to have about infidelity bothered me throughout. If this rating system had 1/2 stars, I would have given it 3-1/2."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"The philosophically chilling and personally poignant effects of one of the 20th century's most important scientific discoveries provides the background to an intricate mystery and passionate love affair. A little heavy in the communist conspiracy, but otherwise beautifully written."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"The book is fairly well written and the subject interesting the mystery is weak. The strength of the book is the examination of the scientists view of the process and implications of making the gadget. I was disappointed in the end -- I thought so much more could have been built into the story."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"The premise had promise a murder of one of the people inviolved with the nations most secret project, the building of the first atomic bomb. The main thrust of the book is not the building or the interpersonal conflict that arise from the creation of the bomb, you learn nothing of it from the book. The point seems to be how often the main character can have sex with the wife of one of the bombs builders. Once the covert spying network is uncovered nothing happens. Great expectations, no delivery."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"What can I say, the only thrill I got was that of finally putting this book down! I only finished it as a test of intestinal fortitude!The characters are dull and uninteresting, the &quot;plot&quot; is ponderous, with long meandering gaps where nothing happens ...Fundamentally the book has no pace, I had no interest in finding out who killed Karl ... no one seemed at all concerned that atomic secrets were leaked to the Soviets ... most of it was predictable, and then ending was weaker than what came before it ... was this a thriller or a love story, either way Z- for effort!If you are looking for a good read ... avoid this book ... go read Richard Feyman's biography far more entertaining and exciting than this crappy mini-series fodder!The author would have done us all a favor by re-writing historty and having the main character crash into 2 sub-critical masses, initiating a fission reaction and wiping Los Alamos off the face of the literary map around the end of the first chapter ..."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I'm not quite finished reading the book yet, but I'm really enjoying the read. Living in New Mexico, I can relate to the story as the author describes the scenery. It is a mystery but it has a lot of history thrown in - albeit some of the historical characters are obviously embellished.All-in-all a good read."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"One would never know it by the title of this book, but it is, in fact, a murder mystery. The title gives away the fact that this isn't just ANY murder mystery. It takes place during the days of the Manhattan Project. A security guard is murdered, and an outsider is \\"brought in\\" to discern the situation.The big twist is that Army intelligence does not care so much who murdered the guard. Rather, the $60,000 question is WHY he was whacked. Was he simply mugged, as it would appear? Or did it have something to do with the security of the project? That's what the protagonist, Connolly, is there to find out. And fast!The plot of the book takes a backseat to the historical setting. Kanon does a wonderful job of interweaving the goings-on of Los Alamos. The fictional character of Connolly interacts wonderfully with figures such as General Leslie Groves and the famous physicists involved in the Top-Secret Project. Legendary names such as Robert Oppenheimer, Edward Teller, Enrico Fermi, Hans Bethe, Richard Feynman and a few others enter into the pages of the story.This book that is highly recommended to anyone who is even vaguely interested in the Manhattan Project - whether they like \\"murder mysteries\\" or not. The ethics of making & using the bomb, the political polemics of Communism, the almost paranoia for secrecy @ Los Alamos & brief glimpses of the \\"gadget's\\" scientists are all enclosed within this book.Although the story is fiction, I can't imagine Los Alamos during the mid-1940s being much different than the way in which Kanon describes it in his novel. I can think of no greater compliment to give a work of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Los Alamos, reading it into the wee hours. What's more, it's a mystery I can recommend to non-mystery readers because it so thoroughly rejects cliche and convention -- even its spies are unique.Michael Connolly is assigned to Los Alamos to investigate the murder of Karl Bruner,one of the site's security personnel. He could, and is encouraged to, take the easy route and call it case closed when local cops \\"persuade\\" someone to confess, but he keeps digging until he roots out the truth - though, to be completely accurate, he never &lt;i>detects&lt;/i> the truth. He uncovers the spy by accident -- however, his detecting gives him the information needed to form the correct conclusion when he stumbles on critical information.The mystery is fair -- so fair that you share Connolly's frustration that there are no clues to the spy's collaborators. The entirety of the story, however, transcends mystery novels. There is an excellent romance sub-plot with a more complicated and original woman than you usually encounter in mystery/espionage stories. There is also the wonderfully executed historical backdrop complete with the small details of life that make for a true sense of place. Even minor characters have depths that surprise, such as Mrs. Weber's moments of insight that save her from being a stereotypical gossipy hen. I think the character of the spy is the most intriguing and wonderfully drawn in the book. There is a complexity and subtlety to this character that is rarely seen. In fact, that is where the book really shines, in subtlely facing the moral question of what they were doing there, what gave them permission to seek such destructive power, Kanon never preaches, but he makes you think."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I read quite a lot, including many techno-thrillers, and I know what I like. I liked Los Alamos quite a bit. I don't expect the author to have the science of the Manhattan Project exactly right. It's only the setting for the story, not the story itself. This is not a techno-thriller. It's a murder mystery/romance. The book is written in the first person for the most part, and the author adopts his protagonist's admittedly limited understanding of what the Manhattan Project was all about: building a really powerful weapon that would end the war. That's all Michael Connolly needed to know about what was going on at Loa Alamos in order to do his job of tracking down a murderer and a potential security breach, and that's all the author really gives the reader about the project. The author did an excellent job of setting the period scene, in the spring and oppressive summer of 1945 in and around Los Alamos, NM. I found the main characters engaging, and the historical fiction entertaining. There are no real good guys and bad guys in this book. Everybody in this story wears sort of a gray hat, with competing elements of good and evil within them. I found the book very entertaining, and look forward to reading something else by Mr. Kanon very soon."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"This book lends interest and intrigue to the hidden city of Los Alamos when the Manhattan Project was underway, and the U.S. military and world's top scientists were involved in creating the scientifically and politically pivotal atomic bomb. Kanon successfully created a tension-filled and frenzied atmosphere surrounding the city and it's top-secret purpose, as well as provided a very believable glimpse into the psyche and everyday lives of several historical figures and great minds involved in the project. But the murder mystery subplot was less than believable and more than predictable, leaving off with the dissatisfactory question \`how did these things escape the writers and editors?'When intelligence officer Connolly was sent to Los Alamos to investigate the murder of one of its security officers, his mission was to not only find the killer, but to prove or disprove a plot that could jeopardize the project's security. This sent him through a labyrinth of double-edged military intelligence, non-cooperative local police, idealistic scientists, a straying wife who sleeps with anyone that gives her escape from her situation of the moment, and high-stakes international espionage.Connolly solves the mystery, but... What took him so long? Early on, Connolly missed the mark and overlooked the obvious suspect based on the character's introductory description of physical appearance and place and line of work. Along with crime scene details, this info seemed an immediate give away. The romance Connolly had with a scientist's straying wife wreaked of young male fantasy and too conveniently held keys to the investigation. And unfortunately, once the mystery was solved and the story revealed, there remained an inconsistent detail that placed a central character's arrival to the Los Alamos area at two distinct points in time, 1 to 1 years apart. The timing of the character's arrival is key to his or her role in the story... how did this escape the writers and editors? This seems to be the real mystery!"},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"This is a great read. I found it hard to put down. Mr. Kanon must have done a lot of research to bring this fascinating period of history to life. I found it like a visit to New Mexico in 1945. Especially the pages on Chaco Canyon's Anasazi ruins. I am looking forward to Mr. Kanon's next book, The Prodigal Spy and the novels to follow."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Los Alamos is an extraordinary read. Like a great musician, Joseph Kanon's writing is as remarkable for the notes he chooses not to play as it is for the ones he does. Set in last days of World War II, the novel lives in a world of moral ambiguity which later generations will always have difficulty understanding because we weren't there.The final revelations of the Holocaust, horrifically poignant here, the moral questions raised by the builders of the bomb and the rot of paranoia already setting into the American mindset are laid out before us in a rich banquet of ideas. This reader had to put the book down several times because of the profoundity of understanding and insight the writer brings.However, Kanon does not preach, he is not obvious and he draws no conclusions. He leaves it to the reader to find their own way.To the casual reader expecting a standard &quot;thriller&quot;, all of this might actually be a negative against Los Alamos. The plot is almost secondary save for the canny way Kanon uses familiar genre devices to lead us back into a time where of dreams of glory and nightmares of innocence lost sit &quot;cheek to jowl.&quot; Here even the murder victim becomes a vehicle for communicating everything from the homophobia of the times to the coming American decline into McCarthyism.The characters all seem be to be searching for their identities as either crusaders or cannibals. Like most of us, they turn out to be a little of both. But it is also the times which create the characters. There is no Oppenheimer if there is no war. There is no love story if there is no murder. No higher truth without an insidious lie. No...well, you get the idea.So, if you're looking for a plot driven page turner, look elsewhere. If, however, you're interested in an eloquent, character driven story which allows a look back to where the seeds of the 1950s, 1960s and even the 1970s were planted, this is thrilling stuff indeed."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"During World War II, Michael Connolly is sent to Los Alamos to investigate the murder of a low-level employee. Is it connected to the top secret work of the Manhattan Project, or just a random crime? The book expertly re-creates the unique atmosphere of a mini-city stuffed full of geniuses desperately trying to discover the mysteries of nuclear fission in time to win the war. Unfortunately, the plot becomes bogged down in formulaic thriller devices, including Connolly's affair with a beautiful married woman and an improbable cast of international spies. Like so many other recent works, this novel seems written with one eye on the plot and one eye on who will be cast in the movie version."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"As an avid reader and student of military history, and as someone with a surpassing interest in the history of science and technology, I was breathless with anticipation over &quot;Los Alamos.&quot; Having read extensively about the history of the atomic bomb I couldn't wait to read a novel with the Manhattan Project as its backdrop. Mr. Kanon, I think, got the science, the setting, and the mood right. But like some of the other reviewers here, I found it difficult to care about Karl's murder. I found the dialogue, through which Mr. Kanon develops his plot more than through narrative, to be a bit noirish and facile for my taste. I thought the book was at its best when tha author wrote of the desert, of the race to build the &quot;gadget&quot;, and of the moral and intellectual dilemmas faced by the scientists on the project. Theirs was arguably the greatest technical feat of this century, in a project whose scale and expense was exceeded only by the B-29 project (the delivery vehicle for the Bomb, ironically.) The romance between Connolly and Emma was just too predictable for my taste, and it seemed to have too little to do with the central problem: who killed Karl, why was he killed, and what are the implications for the Project. I think I was hampered by my own expectations. Perhaps I should have reread Richard Rhodes' book, &quot;The Making of the Atomic Bomb&quot;, instead. I'll be less grumpy after Christmas!"},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I really wanted to love this book. At times I DID love this book. But like so many books today it's 100 pages too long. Which precludes it from delivering the promised thrills. I did like the characters and the setting a lot. Some of the writing is very evocative. But in terms of the mystery, when fictional characters intermingle with real-life people, it is not hard to figure out who done what. I am a fairly fast reader and this book took forever to finish"},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"This novel is shelved as a mystery but it is every bit as much, or more, a romance. It is told with the hero's first person voice and is set in atmospheric Los Alamos during WW II during the Manhattan Project. I found the setting of the story compelling. The characters are not all white or black, any of them, but shades of grey instead. This rather fits with the setting since many people have mixed feelings nowadays about both Los Alamos and the Manhattan Project themselves. Los Alamos and the atom bomb project are backdrop and setting, however, to a character driven novel that also provides a murder mystery to solve. For those romance readers eager to shake the virginal heroine with the heart of gold and try a flawed heroine instead, this may be your book. This could have been a big groundbreaking novel in the romance genre had it been shelved or classified there and I'm sorry it wasn't."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Kanon took one of the most interesting and fascinating event in modern american history and put a mystery in it, and then put a love story in that (which was probably the weakest sub-plot of the book). but i'd say it was more of an espionage story. kanon did an excellent job."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"well, i finished the thing. took DAYS because it just was not captivating. but i couldn't believe that all of the hype on the cover was wrong - there had to be some wonderful nuanced ending. but no, the book had too much repetition of the &quot;secrecy&quot; thing, not enough plot, gratuitous sex, and...as i've said before, 300 extra pages. wait. make that 350 extra pages. save your money."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I found &quot;Los Alamos&quot; to be a solid mystery-thriller packaged in good writing and logic. This is a thriller without rampaging serial-killers or enraged jealous nut cases or out of synch lawyers. This is a good book with solid writing, strong characters, intelligent reasoning,historical insight, and just plain good fun.I was fortunate in that I was able to bring my time spent in Los Alamos, in the early fifties, along with me when I read this book. I have seen this country, known some of these people and experienced some of the things that occurred in the book...one of the great loves of my life began in Los Alamos and my oldest friend is from that time. A nice book, a book with some meat along with the story. A book that I was able to bring something to...enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"This was my first Kanon book, and while I found the history surrounding the A-Bomb development interesting and believable, the mystery was strained at times."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"The author has written a spy thriller/romance story about the country's most top secret military and research facility during the second World War. A security agent at the facility is found murdered and it is decided to bring in someone from outside to conduct an investigation and determine if the security of the research has been compromised. One might think that the most logical choice would be someone from military intellegence, the FBI, or even an experienced homicide investigator. Instead, the choice is a newspaper reporter, Michael Connolly, whose qualifications consist of working the crime beat for East Coast papers. This is where I started to lose hope for the story. I became even more disheartened when Connolly started taking on all the appearances of a teenaged boy in heat. The story began to evolve more into tawdry romance than spy thriller. The plot plods along as the characters express increasing angst about super weapons and maritial infidelity. The murder becomes almost a second thought in the book. The setting and historical background would seem to be elements of a potentially good story but I feel the author lost focus and the book suffered."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Another good read by this author.

I enjoyed the small personality quirks of the historical figures - it made them more real to me, not just images from the latest documentary.

I will continue to read Kanon's books - all for the suspense and intrigue."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"It took a few pages to get into this story but it was worth the effort.

I thought that the writing here was just as good. I especially appreciated how he took a homosexual subplot and kept it in the tenor of the day without pandering. It was well done. I didn't much like our main investigator, who seemed to have no quarrels with stealing another man's wife, or using anyone that he thought could advance his own investigation. But, it is well-written, rarely slows down, and kept me going to the end. The Manhattan project itself defies belief, but, it happened and so many died from it. How those people could so casually ignore the condsequences of what they were doing is mind boggling."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Somber, thoughtful novel seasoned with science (a soupcon) and sex (a pinch). Plot unfolds through characters that could be more interesting. Oppenheimer in particular is a genuine missed opportunity -- shoulda worked harder on him (many people have). A murder mystery."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Joseph Kanon's excellent writing (not ornate, just smooth) and the fascinating story of Los Alamos itself saved this book from being Yet Another Murder Mystery. Kanon also did a great job painting the characters, though under the surface they didn't seem to actually have any genuine emotions, which seemed rather strange...(that's the mood of all the sex scenes in this book).. with or without any enthusiasm from her. He eventually decides it's true love, apparently because his life without her was so boring and pointless that stealing her from her husband could only be an improvement. Nonetheless, the suspense and the setting were enough to make me neglect all sorts of important things to finish this book. The attempts at moralistic philosophy about the bomb also fell pretty flat, mostly because I couldn't beleive the main character gave a darn about any of that. If you like a good mystery, you'll find one in this book. If you like a little romance and ethics mixed in, you'll find that too (but *very* little). Oh, and if you're after neat details on the science and personalities of Los Alamos, better skip this title. He doesn't really get into that, except for a nice character portrait of Oppenheimer."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"What makes this book is its historical setting. With a facinating perspective, the reader is able to watch the characters as they take part in the US government's most contraversial project.

But read this one for its look into wartime America."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"Kanon's book is entertaining and interesting from a historical perspective. Great character's that are likable and human to a fault. The way the story is written from the perspective of someone new to Los Alamos allows you to see it for the first time throught their eyes. I plan to recommend it to alot of people and I can't wait for Kanon's next book."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I found this to be a very enjoyable book to read. I could never predict the turns the story would take. It is hard to review this book without giving away the story, but after the murders were finally identified, I thought the pages after that were somewhat &quot;who cares.&quot;Bottom line. I enjoyed the book and will most likely read the author's next effort."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"I didn't find this book to be great as thriller or history. As romance it was boring: The characters didn't interest me that much, and their love affair was ho hum. I stuck with it because of the history and my increasing time investment. The funny thing is that Kanon is a pretty good writer, but the book is lengthy and somewhat tedious.

I enjoyed the stories of the bomb and the characters involved in the project; I often paused to compare the novel's anecdotes against memories of nonfiction works on the making of the bomb and the people involved. Having spent a good part of my childhood touring the sights of northern New Mexico, the setting was warmly nostalgic, adding to the pleasure. It's not a classic but it's a decent way to pass some time."},{"Title":"Los Alamos a","review":"About the only thing Los Alamos has going for it is good writing. The plot is weak; the &quot;detective&quot; does little detecting; the sex, while intrusive and out of place, isn't titilating; but the writing is good. Kanon uses mature diction and correct grammar. While the story is nothing great, it is a pleasure to see a competent craftsman weilding the tools of his trade well.You won't be sorry you read this book, but it won't keep your spouse awake with the rustle of pages being flipped.I did enjoy the occassional inclusion of real people in the story. There were some genuine characters at Los Alamos and every now and again Kanon reveals a hint of the flavor of that time an place.

The authors know their subject well. Background is given of styles, periods, and pieces. This book is useful for the home owner who wants to decorate in a more authentic style or even for the museum employee who wants to reproduce a certain period in time.Some people may find the book tedious reading because of the lack of colorful photographic examples, but I found the supplied information so much more thorough and authentic than what is found in modern books that I believe if you are serious about a certain historical look, you ought to give this book a try."},{"Title":"Preaching without notes (Notable books on preaching)","review":"I'm trying to do this...preach without notes.

Just as \\"The Deer Hunter\\" made all other Nam movies irrelevant, \\"Fire\\" leaves all other Viet Nam war books looking shallow.Webb sees war through the eyes and lives of those men most used up by it, as did \\"The Deer Hunter\\". He has a profound respect for those Americans from the lower and lower-middle classes who fought this conflict for the rest of us.

Do the arithmetic: less than 10% of American men, less than 5% of the then eligible aged population ever served there. How easy it has been to see the war as simply wrong, justifying our own draft dodging as moral. Webb's book is full of the raw truth about those who fought there and those who refused. The men who answered the call, whether the call was wrong or right (the call was never theirs to make), are saluted in \\"Fields of Fire\\". It's about time.\\"Fields of Fire\\" is often attacked as pro-war in college classes. But in its honesty the book is patently anti-war as it celebrates the courage of warriors.

I give this book my most enthusiastic endorsement."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"&quot;Fields of Fire&quot; is a story of a Marine infantry platoon, whose characters are simply unlucky and cursed by fate. Most of the characters in the novel, with the exception of Lt. Hodges, stumble into the Marine Corps, and in effect, combat by accident. They are kids from all over America seeking to get away from the harsh and grim reality of the streets--with the exception of Goodrich/&quot;Senator&quot; and Hodges--by enlisting in the Corps.The novel evolves around the lives of each Marine in the grunt platoon, but the author gives his perspective of what it was like in the battlefield through the central characters Hodges, Snake, Goodrich and Dan the Defector.Hodges, the Webb-like platoon leader, mirrors the author in that he volunteers for a service in Vietnam, seeking the honor and glory of dying in combat like his forefathers. He, like the former Marine Captain Webb, is a descendant of warriors and the &quot;last of the American Samurai.&quot; He is a natural warrior in the battlefield, and becomes something of a big brother brother to the Marines in his platoon. He and Snake are like peas and carrots. He turns down a recreation officer billet in Okinawa, because he misses the action in the boonies, and out of a duty to take care of his Marines. Perhaps his sense of duty for his Marines brought the misfortune onto himself. He caught a bullet in his face, while evacuating his wounded Marines from a hell called Go Noi Island.Snake is a nineteen year old-misfit, who after being fired from his janitorial job, decides to enlist in the Corps. He finds home in the Marine Corps, and decides to make a career there. In the streets at home he is a misfit, but in the boonies you depend on his bush smarts and leadership. He is disdainful of the career NCOs and officers--his squad &quot;fragged&quot; the first Platoon Sergeant--but he looks up to Lt. Hodges like a demigod. He does not like the cowardly Goodrich, but looks after him anyhow even after he turns in the entire platoon for summarily executing a Vietnamese &quot;couple&quot; suspected of taking part in executing two of his Marines. His midsection was torn apart by a stream of NVA machinegun fire, as he evacuated the wounded Goodrich. His mother waits for the posthumous Congressional Medal of Honor his company commander recommended, but the award never materialized due to the incident involving a Vietnamese &quot;couple.&quot;Dan the Defector, is a former Viet Cong-turned-American collaborator.He is fatalistic, for views everything as a &quot;nature of things.&quot; When his brother died fighting the Marines, he is conscripted into the ranks of Viet Cong as a propagandist. He does not like fighting, nor the draconian discipline of the Viet Cong. When he defects to the American Marines, his family is massacred by the Communists. The loss of his family makes him a fierce, fanatical anti-Communist fighter. But being a fatalist that he is, he surrenders himself to the North Vietnamese in a South Vietnamese campaign in Laos known as &quot;Lam Son 701.&quot;Goodrich is a Harvard undergraduate, who blunders into the Marines after being rejected by the Peace Corps. He hopes to join the Marine Band, but in the scheme of things, he winds up in a Marine rifle platoon in Vietnam. He is in the platoon, but does not feel a part of it. He is resentful of, repulsed by the barbaric nature of his fellow platoonmates. When a Marine is wounded, he refuses to help him, causing him to bleed to death. He reads philosophy books to maintain sanity. He hopes to pull himself out of Vietnam by faking an infection. When his platoonmates summarily execute the Vietnamese &quot;couple&quot; in retaliation, he turns them in.Goodrich/&quot;Senator&quot; is perhaps the most complex character of the novel. Goodrich is the product of Webb's bitterness toward his lawschool classmates whose antiwar attitude was nothing but a product of cowardice. While he holds his platoonmates in contempt, he nonetheless seeks their approval, especially Snake's. Towards the conclusion of the novel, he undergoes a gradual personality change; he sympathizes with the emotions of his platoonmates, and no longer holds them in contempt. In the midst of an ongoing investigation for the murder incident, his blunder in combat costs him a leg, Snake and Hodges. He comes out of the war feeling guilty for the casualties in the platoon. This is articulated in the conclusion of the novel, as he professes to his father his guilt, and again when he gives his antiwar speech. In his speech, he indicts the upper middleclass protesters for having copped out of cowardice, while leaving the lowerclass kids hanging to dry in Vietnam. That was Webb's bitter voice echoing through Goodrich.The characters in the novel are unlucky and cursed, not only in the battlefield, but also by their own people they swore to defend. The longer they stay in the boonies and watch their comrades become casualties, the less humane and sane they become. In the end, they all become casualties, either killed or maimed.This is one of the most brutal, electrifying and depressing combat writing I've ever read. I was deeply touched by it.&lt;b"},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"If you want to know some truths concerning the realities of the Vietnam war, particularly in the early stages, you will want to read this book.

As a man of Vietnam era age, I connected with this book in a powerful way, from it's treatment of the strange comradery of the soldiers to the numbing, almost casual way that the horror of this war is portrayed. One gains the sense that the war was about the process of waging war, and the dreary nightmare seems to be perpetuated on both sides more from habit and obligation than from promoting any issue. The characters in this book were not super-human, nor was the war romanticized in any way. You are quite literally in VietNam when you read this book. An interesting side light in this book is the surprising amount of our vernacular that came from VietNam, some words having even been left there by the French, and assimilated by our GI's (eg. beaucoups). WWII was not alone in it's contribution to our language. I have read this book 3 times. It is hard to believe it is out of print. I am also surprise that this was never made into a movie."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"There is no question in my mind that this novel stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of the books in the genre. This is particularly true in relation to the \\"surrealistic-\\", \\"experimental-\\" style novels such as Wright's \\"Meditations in Green\\", Hasford's \\"The Short-Timers\\", and O'Brien's \\"Going After Cacciato.\\"What Webb's novel has that these other ones lack is a mature sense of the moral ambiguity of war, and of the Vietnam War in particular. That is to say that it does not characterize the U.S. involvement as a giant war crime or an exercise in evil or madness. This is not Apocalypse Now. We see examples, among the Americans, of good and evil, competence and incompetence, sensitivity and callousness. Webb does not paint with broad strokes.Through the story of the Vietnamese character Dan, whose home the Communists invaded and whose wife and small children they murdered, we get some idea of the PURPOSE of the fighting and the nature of the aggressors. Such a sense of the bigger picture is sadly lacking in most fictional accounts of the war.It also forces us to consider the morality of those who protested the war and those who openly hoped for a Communist victory. Just as there is moral responsibility for the consequences of a war one supports, there is also moral responsibility for the consequences of opposing a war.This book is not a polemic by any means. It is a thoughtful, nuanced illustration of the war that is free of the crude generalities and inconsistencies that have completely skewed so many people's understanding of the Vietnam War.An equally fantastic novel of the Vietnam War is John Del Vecchio's \\"13th Valley.\\""},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I originally got this book just for a school project, but i ended up loving every page of it. The colorful cast of characters along with the witty dialog, make you feel as if they were real. The battle scenes are amazing and VERY descriptive. There are, however, some offensive and gory situations. But that just adds to the realism in my opinion. Now I've obviously never been to war but they're as close to one as i could imagine in my opinion. This book has the perfect mix of action, suspense, and comedy. Since I ordered from Amazon, it got here within just a few days. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves war novels, the Vietnam War era, or just a good read. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I do."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"This book leaves me wanting more. It illustrates all of the emotions that a soldier must have felt in battle.

What I found (or re-discovered) is a tremendous accomplishment by James Webb that more than compensates for minor shortcomings in style with an intense authenticity and compassion.The novel that I was most reminded of in this second reading is \\"The Naked and the Dead.\\" Both were debut novels written by young veterans of recently-concluded wars, there are stylistic similarities (primarily, in the way that both visit their characters before the war and during) and both are filled with real experience and true-life details of combat that are simply not achievable by writers who never saw war, regardless of their talent. But while Norman Mailer's World War II epic is ultimately both more accomplished and grandiose, \\"Fields of Fire\\" is every bit as intense, harrowing, authentic, rewarding, and, finally, more accessible.This was James Webb's first novel, and his inexperience shows in parts. He re-uses certain descriptions and relies on some adjectives too heavily at points. But the honesty and compassion for the impressively large cast of characters is there; what Webb may lack in style here is easily carried by the commitment to truth and accuracy that seems to burn through every page. And although his descriptions are largely unadorned, they paint surprisingly effective portraits of the Vietnamese landscape and the men fighting there.\\"Fields of Fire\\" is highly recommended - an utterly gripping American novel that fully deserves to be considered a classic, if it isn't already."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I read this book shortly after it was first published, and recently bought it again to re-read. What a great book! The character development is real, the characters lovable and the story compelling.

It would not be the first time \\"Publishers\\" have 'ignored' reality when creating the front cover.However, having said all that this book remains today the book I measure all Vietnam war novels (fiction & non-fiction) against. It is like many others of its genre ie the story of a group of men (boys really) trying to survive their 'tour of duty' in and around the chaos of their reality.Its the 'feel' of the environmant as outlined in the book in & out of combat (as written by combat veteran James Webb), that remains so very real.It measures up the equal of 'The 13th Valley' in terms of story telling and is far better than 'We Were Soldiers Once..And Young' in terms of maps.This novel will go down as one of the overall greats of its era."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"A real page turner.

It was Webb's relentless courage told in Timberg's book that made me interested in reading Fields of Fire. And this book is amazing.

I got a realistic sense of how people would act when placed in a situation as the characters themselves and tended to question my own sense of how I would act. This book makes you think."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"This is a remarkable book. Gripping, vivid, frightening. More than just about any other war book I can think of, Fields of Fire peels back the thin veneer of civilization and shows the muck underneath.War isn't pretty, and books that make it appear so aren't just banal -- they do a disservice to those who serve in future wars, as well as those who send them there. James Webb, on the other hand, tells it like it is -- bloody, brutal and final."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"The thing I most like about Fields of Fire is the emphasis it puts on showing how things in Vietnam operated. I've read other pieces about the war where the author takes a somewhat trippy approach and dwells on a few enlisted men doing and experiencing surreal, terrible things. I've enjoyed those kinds of stories from a literary perspective, but they don't really give much insight into what was going on. Webb ventures beyond the viewpoint of some prototypical disoriented recruit and shows more of the actual military operations: what it was like for the lieutenants, how Marine platoons were organized and run, what the day-to-day procedures were.True, Webb's characters don't have the depth of some. He's working with an ensemble cast, and he's trying to get a lot of information in. If you're looking for a character study, you might try Kent Anderson's Sympathy For the Devil and its sequel Night Dogs, which do just the opposite of Fields of Fire: follow a single character before, during, and long after the war, without a lot of attention to sequence, context, or minutiae. But I'd have to say Fields of Fire is stronger: the ensemble is diverse, and none of the characters are stereotypical or even flat. Likewise, Webb's prose is not perfect, but he never holds forth.One other book that goes well with Fields of Fire is The Nightingale's Song, by Robert Timberg. Among other things, Timberg writes about Webb's life and what went into Fields of Fire. But this is an excellent book even without a counterpoint or a companion piece."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I just read this book for the second time in ten years. Once again I am struck by how Jim Webb captures the essence of Marines in combat during the 1968 and 1969 period. From the mounting racial tensions to the chaos of night combat he gets it right. I particularly appreciate that he explored that not so rare, but inexplicable to most people, phenomenon of a Marine who extends his tour of duty for more of the same. On my first tour as an enlisted Marine I extended twice. On my second tour as an officer I extended twice again. Read the ruminations of the squad leader after he extends his tour and you'll get a glimpse of why many combat Marines chose to stay on."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"This book was absolutely amazing.

The book unites unnique prespectives on the conflict from all different view points. Excellent reading."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"Vietnam novels, as opposed to memoirs, only have credibility for me, if the author served either in the unit he writes about or in combat in general during the Vietnam war. Mr Webb served as a Marine in Vietnam and was decorated for his service. Credibility established.This story is by far one of the best I've read novelizing Vietnam. The story revolves around 3 main characters all serving in the 25th Marines during 1969. Their AO is called \\"Arizona\\" and refers to a valley somewhere in the middle of nowhere, Vietnam. The main actors, Hodges, Snake and Goodrich take on personalities that seem to cover the 60's view of the war.Snake, is probably the most realistic given the circumstances. He's very good at being a marine. Thinks clearly about what he needs to do and wont stand for any BS from anyone. Hodges is the 2nd LT, new to the bush, not too wide eyed; idealistic to a point but realizes certain things have to be done. Goodrich, Harvard educated, bored but way too intelligent for his own good becomes more and more disenchanted with the proceedings as his time in country wears on. Goodrich never quite fits in to the group.We follow the Platoon through it's various phases of life, death, lies, deceit, ideology, maturity and eventual renewal through various forms of rotation. Dead man out, new guy in, wounded out, new guy in etc... Along with the main Vietnam theme of the book, each of the main players gets his own chapter showing his evolution from main street into the war.The writing style meshes the strained and guttural conversation of bush marines with the clarity and articulation needed to illustrate experiences and situations required to keep the reader hooked. Mr Webb, along with being experienced, is obviously extremely well read as his choice of words and phrasing exhibits.I'd like to offer this:We all have feelings and thoughts about War, probably about the Vietnam war more than any other, it was just one of those wars. Those feelings are ours to think about, explore, play with etc. Positive or negative, we owe it to the guys who served to hear their side of things. We can sit all day and share our speeches and opinions on politics and military actions until the cows come home, it changes nothing. What makes the changes are the guys who put up at the time of calling. Their meat hit the metal and we owe it to all of them to sit on our hands and listen as they speak to us. Offer no words of encouragement, no words of grievance, no words of understanding but offer a willingness to keep our mouths shut and listen."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"This book should be required reading in college history classes. It is an amazing look into what was a difficult time in American history and tells the story of several soldiers in Nam in such a way that the telling of this story will stay with you forever. The Vietnam war was a conflict this nation had never seen the like of before or since and this book is a must read for any one who harbours any illusions that the soldiers over there were doing wrong. They were our citizens, sons, brothers and fathers and the way this nation disregarded them makes me ashamed and glad I wasn't yet born to bear witness.Anyways, I recommend this book and give it five stars. I also give thanks to the troops who servered there and did their best in a fubar'ed situation and I grieve with them for their losses."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"This book took me a while to get into, what with the tape-recorder-like gutter language and the awful things its characters went thru and their tomcat morals. But it screams authenticity to me, which may not mean much since I was never in Vietnam. But the haunting moral dilemmas faced by the protagonists cannot help but inspire thoughts such as: what would I have done in a like situation? While Robert E. Lee Hodges is the central character, Goodrich (&quot;the Senator&quot;) faces the more agonizing situations. Read the book, and you decide. But don't let the grime and the horror keep you from getting to its overpowering ending."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"Those who were born beneath the Line will appreciate this, as will those Northerners who still remember the line between the good guys and the bad guys. Men are thrust into war, for the most part--and we should remember that these days as the bullets fly. Mr. Webb shows us here the American warrior's spirit: reluctant, but resolute; other wise engaged, but ready to do his duty. Better than the standard set before (&quot;Thin Red Line&quot; comes to mind), this novel gives us war as he knew it, and he knew it well. Purchase this to know what Americans can do and what Americans can be in a horrible situation."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"Mr. Webb was among the first to tell of the war from the gritty, unglamorous viewpoint of the field Marine, the grunt. The book chronicles the operations of a rifle platoon operating in Vietnam at the height of the war, and the story circles around a young lieutenant who strives to survive and serve his rowdy band of drafted Marines while still completing the mission. Webb has an unusual writing style, but it works well within the story, especially the &quot;street&quot; style dialogue of the young combatants that depicts the manner in which Vietnam era Marines spoke. Unlike shelves of blase, feelgood snorers of military fiction out there, this book stands apart as one of the truly great war novels of all time. It is a must read for anyone who served or is currently serving."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I had watched many movies about the Vietnam War, but I'd never read a book about it. James Webb's \\"Fields of fire\\" was my first choice because of the high-rated reviews and praising I found everywhere I looked for information on this book.James Webb was in Vietnam, so he knows what he's writing about. His style is simple and direct; he didn't intend to create a poetic or philosophical book about the war. \\"Fields of fire\\" is a very graphic and accurate portrait of the real people who fought against the vietnamese. Characters are not stereotyped, but rather a display of the many kinds of men who were in SE Asia, and their different motivations or reasons to be there at the time. Interestingly, there are not that many battle scenes, but rather the plot of the book is a fabric of human behaviour during a war, with occasional fighting and changes thrown in the middle.This book is considered very good because the reader can sense that everything in the pages is real. Another thing comes to my mind now: the final chapter (and the ending) is one of the most sensitive, believable and, therefore, appropriated final moment of a book dealing with war that I've ever read.Congratulations to the author, who created a fine book about a gruesome subject.

We get to spend a tour with a group of people from all walks of life, cast into a common hell as soldiers in Vietnam.We walk beside them as they endure endless, seemingly fruitless, patrols. We feel their uncertainty, live with the filth, fear, bravery, triumph, and tragedy of combat. Get to know each man as a person and get inside his thoughts, fears, and motivation. Share the camaraderie, and feel the pain. And, tragically, feel shame for a country that little appreciates or understands their sacrifice.Fields of Fire is extremely powerful and a little graphic (but not gratuitously so), at times funny, often poignant and sad. This is not just a war story, but a magnificent commentary on war and society, and all can understand and benefit from it's message."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"Fields of Fire was the first of many Vietnam novels I have read. It was the first because I picked it up at a bookstore one day, and realized Jim Webb and I were in the same unit in Vietnam.Webb writes from the gut, and he writes true. I know from personal experience his descriptions are both accurate and all too real at times. In Fields of Fire he captures the day to day existence in a Marine infantry platoon in Vietnam. He captures the madness, the love, and the indelible mark that Vietnam has left on all those that experienced it."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"Good fiction always gets you involved in the characters. I gaurantee you will care about the grunts that Webb sends into the An Hoa Basin (the Arizona Terriotory) under the leadership of Lt. Robert E. Lee Hodges, Jr., a southern boy with a rich heritage of warrior blood. In the course of the narrative, Hodges falls in love with an Okinawan woman that works in the officer's mess at Camp Hansen on Okinawa, or \\"the Rock\\" as we called it when I was there eons ago. Then there is \\"Snake,\\" an unsavory product of the slums that seems the antithesis of Hodges. Yet, the two bond in the field, and much of the narrative centers around them. You're pulling for Hodges to make it back to the girl on Okinawa. You're pulling for Snake to make it good in the Marine Corps, which has given him a new start on life. Enter Goodrich, a whining and whimpy over-priveleged Harvard student whose best friend has fled to Canada to avoid getting drafted. Goodrich is a fascinating study in analysis paralysis. He alienates himself from his comrades and spends inordinate amounts of time agonizing over the morality of the war and the [pros and cons] of his fellow grunts' actions in the war. He is the consummate \\"effete snob\\" about whom Vice-President Spiro Agnew once declaimed. However, it's only a matter of time before Goodrich effects the action that brings this powerful novel to a climax. In the end, we see Goodrich speaking before a Harvard anti-war rally, but he has gone through a major sea-change and embarrasses the peacenik leaders that wanted to use him for a mascot. This novel is a pretty fast read. The descriptions are vivid and poetic. The dialogue bears the ring of truth. Webb himself served in the Marine Corps in Vietnam and knows of what he speaks. I would rate this novel, along with \\"The 13th Valley,\\" as one of the two best Vietnam novels written to date."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"This is an amazing work when you consider it's Webb's first book. The writing is so compelling you may feel like you've been dropped into a rice paddy with Webb's/Hodges' platoon.In Robert Timberg's book, The Nightingale's Song, Webb is a featured character. He describes Webb's experiences from the Naval Academy through his stint as Secretary of the Navy. The real people who were main characters in Fields of Fire are discussed. He also tells the amazing story of how Webb read Hemingway at the urging of a law school classmate and decided he could write like that. I'm sure glad he did. All of his books are among the best I've read."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"Best Vietnam book I've come across.

I read this book after Robert Timberg's Nightengale Song and I must say that I was impressed."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. James Webb has done an excellent job at not only the reality of the situation in Viet Nam, but also at making a factually correct fictional work. I am currently an infantryman in the Marine Corps, 1st Bn, 5th MAR to be exact, and still can't believe how closely I can relate to the characters, even though I have never been to combat. I am currently deployed to Okinawa, and am on Camp Hansen, where Lt. Hodges meets the love of his life at the O-Club. And sure enough the O-Club is on a hill, just like in the book. I have heard that a movie is in the works and that everything will be on location, I certainly hope so. I also think that everyone, not just military, should read this book. It will change your outlook on life, and how you view the men that currently serve this fine and beautiful country. Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"As a Marine who served in Vietnam during the time period this book is set in (68-70), I can confirm that this book accurately depicts the experience of being a Marine Grunt serving in Vietnam. The author, James Webb, is a highly decorated Combat Veteran of the war, and lived the story. He obviously put his heart and soul into it. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is a fictional account of a Grunt platoon, but the story is taken from real life. The main charactors and events were developed perfectly, and while being fictional, I knew Marines, and experienced events exactly like those in the story. It is a gut wrenching trip to the past, and a \\"must read\\" for anyone who wants to know what it was \\"really like\\" for Marines who fought in that war."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"A lot has been said about style, etc. that I agree with & won't repeat. Suffice to say James Webb was a platoon commander in Delta Co./1st Battalion/5th Marines: I was a grunt (said with pride) in C/1/5. When I first opened this book back in late '70s and saw the map of the An Hoa basin - the \\"Arizona territory\\", Go Noi (No-go) Island, Liberty Bridge, the Phu Locs - the hairs on my neck stiffened, and then I let out an \\"Alllright!!\\" (scared a few bookstore patrons, nbd).When you're reading this you are walking down the same trails, setting up ambushes in the same spots, taking fire from the same tree-lines that Lt. Webb and this young (then)PFC walked & fought from. Hell, it was like goin' home for a visit!I had the chance to meet James Webb during the dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and thank him for writing this personally. He still had the look in the eyes: quiet, deadly calm, with steel-trap analytical processes going on upstairs. At his swearing-in ceremony for Secretary of the Navy (he remembered this grunt from two chance meetings & sent me an invitation!), as soon as he was \\"official\\", he stopped the show, called up some of the men who had served with him back in An Hoa, and gave them the medals and commendations he had recommended so many years before but had never been given to them. Outstanding!Jim has the courage of his convictions that he later resigned rather than acquiesce to a polically-motivated evisceration of the Naval service he was entrusted with. He exemplifies the Marine officer - I know of only one other, a Lieutenant in C co, that I had as much respect for, and sadly he didn't make it out alive. He's the real deal: this old grunt would assault the fire-and-brimstone-beaches of hell if James Webb was commanding!"},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"Jim Webb served his time in Vietnam during one of my nearly three years in Vietnam. I found this book just after the original publication in 1979. It was as if I was reading a biography of my own service with the grunts in the 1st Marine Division. In the years since I have always admired his work, first as a Platoon and Company Commander in 5th Marines and then as Secretary of the Navy and as an author.Fields of Fire fully described the green hell that was Vietnam for every Marine infantryman who served there.If you want to get a feel for what that war was like, read this book. If you think you might want to go fight in a war, read this book."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I read Jarhead on a whim earlier this past week. Anthony Swofford, the author, is a gifted young writer. But the book left me feeling empty, even angry. There was an attitude about Swofford and many of his Marine Corps buddies that just rubbed me the wrong way. Whiney might be the right word. Furthermore, Swofford through the course of the book seems to have been in a serious, depressive state that probably required professional help. It does not appear that he received that help prior to being discharged from the Marine Corps. Based on several of the Jarhead reviews I read on Amazon, I then read James Webb's Fields of Fire. Granted, it was a novel and it was based on the Vietnam war, not the first Iraq war. But the book was much more satisfying. In fact, it was a terrific read. Webb's description of war, and how Marines of various backgrounds experienced and dealt with it, was unforgettable. Until now, I thought that Anton Myrer's epic Once and Eagle was the best war novel I had ever read. Fields of Fire rivals it. It is not nearly as lengthy as Myrer's novel, and the characters are not developed quite as well, but the prose and the realism are absolutely first rate. So, here's my recommendation. First read Jarhead. Its an easy read, its popular, and you can appreciate a great young writer from whom we will be hearing much in the future. Then read Fields of Fire. Webb, like Swofford, has also been there and done that. Together the books provide two very interesting compares and contrasts of the Marine Corps infantry in wartime situations. My bet is you will be much more satisfied with the latter."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I started reading novels about Nam when I got home from the Army in 1977 and have read a lot of them. Without a doubt, this is the best one I have read - over and over again through the years. James Webb brings a squad of grunts at the end of the pipeline in Vietnam to life. Every man in the squad has a nickname: Snake (you will come to love him), Phony, Senator, Cannonball, Bagger, Waterbull, Wild Man, Baby Cakes, Ogre, etc. Each character is developed and the background of the main characters before they became part of the Corps is flashbacked to. The squad is commanded by a newly commissioned 2nd Lt. named Robert E. Lee Hodges, a real grit as Snake says, but one who knows how to call in artillery support when needed in a hurry. The utter futility of patrolling endlessly through the An Hoa valley as \\"bait\\", trying to draw an elusive enemy out to fight comes through loud and clear. The firefights are breathtaking and the sheer terror of having the perimeter overrun by sappers or being on an LP and hearing movement is unbelieveable. This book brought back so many memories of the 1960s it is like going into a time warp: from the popular music, to the figures of speech used, to the thoughts of the men as they count down their time before they can go back to The World. Unlike many other Nam novels this actually goes into the experiences of a couple of the men when they return to the States only to discover that no one acts like there is even a war on, treating them like outcasts. The incredible camaraderie of men in fighting holes protecting each other in battle as well as the racial tensions of the time in the rear areas comes through loud and clear. I have read all of Webb's novels and this one is his best. Two Nam books come to mind that are close to, but not quite as good as this one: Body Count and Close Quarters."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"After reading &quot;The Nightingale Song&quot;, which covers Webb's career at Annapolis and Washington, I was compelled to read this book. A conservative person who fought valiantly but underwent a metamorphis after the war and became more liberal, this book was clearly a method to exorcise the pain of the war for Webb.Unfortunately, I was traveling when I read this and read in many short periods. I became extremely engrossed in the battle tales but failed to connect with the characters as well as I would have liked. Irrespective, I would agree that this sounds like the most realistic book describing what it was like to be in the field in Vietnam. But Webb covered much more than just a platoon that suffers heavy casualties. A brief part of the book covers a young officer in Okinawaw who develops a love interest with a young Japanese girl with the relevant cultural issues that arise when he proposes.The battle scenes are mezmerizing like the three men sent outside the perimeter stupidly by command who are terribly overrun and must lay wounded in the midst of the enemy all night. In many respects this book seemed to closely parallel the movie Platoon.But the most unexpected part of the book was the dialog from the Vietnamese scout who was a former Viet Cong who defects only to have his family killed. This was great perspective on what was going on in the minds of the Vietnamese people who generally hated the Americans for their brutal treatment.In summary, I think this is a very important book by a very decorated and brave individual that shows the mental conflicts and pain of war. I encourage you to read this if you want to learn of the brutality of war. But this is not a light read and will challenge your feelings of the war."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I've read Gustav Hasford's \\"The Shorttimers,\\" and Tim O'Brien's \\"The Things They Carried.\\" Both are excellent books and I heartily recommend them, but neither I think can compare to James Webb's classic \\"Fields of Fire.\\"Webb's book is from the James Jones school of realism. The book has the stinging ring of authenticity and no wonder, Webb was a Marine officer in Vietnam himself and won the Navy Cross, a Silver Star and two Bronze Stars so he definitely knows of what he writes.But this isn't just a book written by an officer about officers. His portraits of the enlisted men are just as real and are full blooded characters. Some are tough, mean and unlikeable, but hey, that's real life for you.And just like real life, you'll find yourself bonding and getting close to these characters and when some are killed, you are affected.Be warned: \\"Fields of Fire\\" isn't a happy story. The ending is tragic but given the setting of the story, it's entirely appropriate.Mr. Webb has done himself and the Marines who served in Vietnam a great honor.Semper Fi Mr. Webb."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"There is an element of truth in every good lie. While listening to a review of James Webb's newest book, Something to Die For, on NPR in May of 1991, it occurred to me that the James H. Webb, Jr. who recently had been SecNav was my Platoon Leader in Vietnam in early 1969 through 1 July 1969 when I was medivac'ed out of the field and into DaNang Naval Hospital for the second time in two months. While Jim had become a fairly successful lawyer/bureaucrat/writer, I returned to Purdue and finished my undergrad and MS degrees in Civil Engineering. Combat gives one a renewed sense of purpose and direction. I picked up a copy of Fields of Fire and noticed that the list of characters, any relationship of which to anyone living or dead being purely circumstantial, included a number of fairly identifiable idiosyncracies. When I located Jim Webb in Arlington, VA, I phoned him and we talked about common experiences and whatever happened to &lt;N&gt;, but we didn't talk about any of his four books, as I had not yet read Fields of Fire (1978), A Sense of Honor (1981), A Country Such as This (1983), or the then-new (Feb. 1991) Something to Die For--a rather prescient fiction about Ethiopia and Eritrea (read &quot;Iraq and Kuwait&quot;). When I later read Fields of Fire, I identified with the character PFC Will Goodrich, as I had been in the Peace Corps before entering the Marine Corps, was booted out of the Peace Corps because my family was &quot;too militarily-oriented&quot;, had thought I could get into the Marine Corps Band or the Drum and Bugle Corps (NOT!), and ended up a fairly inept warrier and was medivac'ed out with leg wounds. Having been unable to read books, see movies, or deal with other veterans for some time after my war was over, I appreciated the analysis contained in Fields of Fire. Interestingly, in my mind I created a myth that Jim Webb had simply maintained a journal of our exploits and spilled them out to produce a very readably, terrifying, and realistic tale. My little brother, coincidentally a plebe at USNA and a student of Instructor First Classman James Webb in 1968, sent me a copy of Robert Timberg's &quot;The Nightingale's Song&quot; this year. The segments about Jim Webb and his development as an author are stimulating and enlightening to one who invented the myth of &quot;pouring out a prize-winning book&quot;. Because of my exposure to the events and some of the characters, and because of my personal admiration and respect for the author, I rate this book (and his 3 others) very high"},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I cannot praise this book high enough, but I can try.About a year ago, maybe more, someone in my apartment building threw out a bunch of books. As an avid reader, I went through them. Fields of Fire caiught my eye, and I read the blurb. Vietnam had always intrested me, as it was so fantastically differant from any other war. Also, I thought that it would help me to get to know my uncle, who was in Nam, and I did not know well.To be honest, I did not have high hopes, but started into it anyway. I couldnt put it down.Recently, I was digging through my library, and came upon it again, joyfully, and have been re-reading it once more. A fantastic, well-writen, realistic novel, it allows you to experience the life, sympathize with the grunts, and shake hands with the charectors, who are done so realistically, it's almost frightening.Realistic enough that it's a sad ending. As someone in a previous review said &quot;Everyone ends up casualties.&quot; Ironic as well. The people you love die, and the ones you hate eventually turn into people you like.A terrifying glimpse into the past for a junior in high school. And yet, at the same time, a growing experience, which allows you to perhaps view things mroe realistically. A must read for studying the time period, or if you are just in the mood for a good novel.As my copy proclaims upon the cover &quot;One of the great war novels of our generation.&quot; Very true. I commend James Webb, and eagerly search for his others books, though still hold this close to my heart."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"&quot;Fields of Fire&quot; is an amazing journey back to a time of confusion and significance. Through the experiences of a group of diverse, interesting characters, Webb transports the reader to the chaotic environment of Vietnam when the U.S. was exerting its' last gasp into the mutated conflict known as the Vietnam War. The realistic dialogue and beautifully woven descriptions draw the reader into that world of madness and give a glimpse of what it must've been like. The book explores many of the issues surrounding the war; race relations, corruptness, moral dilemmas and the constant clashes between career soldiers and the new breed of drafted grunts. Webb puts the Marine Corp itself on display in this book, and reveals it as a living, breathing organism which is all the more endearing for surviving its' flaws during its' greatest test. Webb's choice to concentrate on a Marine platoon, and specifically a squad, is an interesting one because obviously these units don't act in a vacuum. That there is almost no interaction with the surrounding units is one thing, but the fact that Lt. Hodges (who is in charge of the 3rd Platoon) is predominantly featured interacting with the main characters of only one squad is remarkable. We never even meet Hodges' immediate superior- the Company's Captain, other than a couple vague descriptions. This approach helps keep the story on a personal level and I think successfully portrays the conflict from the most basic element of the conflict; the lone infantryman."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"Having been through the thick of it, and survived I reluctantly read &quot;yet another Nam book&quot; this one hit me.

It verbalizes the action, nonsense, self-serving behaviour of some officers and the bravery of others and the people who have to carry the orders out.

This book goes hand in hand with Oliver Stone's movie \\"Platoon\\".The book is visceral and true to all that I have learned about the Vietnam conflict.

A few have run a very close second (\\"Body Count\\" by William Turner Huggett, for instance), but this one sets the standard for what a Vietnam novel should be. I'd place it in the Top 10 American novels of the second half of the 20th century.The men who make up the unit in \\"FoF\\" are realistically depicted, and I'm sure they are based on men that the author led during his time there. The reader actually feels like a member of the unit, and he or she starts to empathize with, and even like, most of them. The combat scenes will have you on the edge of your seat, and you feel it when certain characters give their lives for their country and friends.This has yet to be made into a movie.

The primary protagonist is a young, cocky lieutenant fresh out of West Point (Webb went to Vietnam as a young, cocky lieutenant fresh out of West Point). Goodrich's experiences when he returns to Harvard are reminiscent of Webb's experiences at Georgetown University Law Center after he returned from Vietnam, as relayed in his non-fiction book Born Fighting.I would almost think either Oliver Stone stole from Webb in making Platoon, or Webb stole from Stone in writing Fields of Fire, had both not fought in Vietnam. The two are quite similar in their depictions of combat and daily life in Vietnam.The characters are well fleshed out, from those that get multiple POVs to the more minor characters, in large part because Webb intersperses the story in Vietnam with short chapters giving the background of the secondary characters. Goodrich, a \\"Harvard man\\" who is not really sure why he went to Vietnam, grows the most over the novel and transforms from someone the reader naturally loathes to someone the reader, well, still loathes, but also pities and respects. The third main character, in addition to Hodges and Goodrich, is Snake, who represents yet another subset of the men who fought in Vietnam. He's a tough kid from the bad part of town who never fit in anywhere nearly so well as he does fighting in Vietnam."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"Enjoyed reading it .

This is one of the greatest novels I have ever read and I highly recommend it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"Mr. Webb is a highly decorated Vietnam War veteran who has the bonafides to write a grunt's perspective. I'm at loss how this book didn't win the Pulitzer Prize or some comparable award. It's that good. The author effectively conveys the sights, sounds and thoughts of the soldiers in combat. The illogical nature of its jungle warfare is seen through the eyes of a half dozen people including a Vietnamese scout whose allegiance shifts depending upon the best possible way for him to survive and seek vengeance. The new recruits go into Nam scared but with high ideals. These are quickly stripped away by the violence, randomness of survival and the cloudy nature of their military objectives. The characters do not all get along and most are uneducated, poor guys but very effective in combat because they embrace their inner primitive viciousness. The one who is clearly the black sheep in their platoon is Senator; a Harvard dropout who existential musings and lack of combat courage are ridiculed by the other soldiers. All the characters are complex with both a mixture of courage and monster wrapped into each personality. If there is anyone who can be considered the antagonist of this excellent novel, I guess, it would be the unseen higher-ups who got us into this Vietnam mess. The small Glossary of military terms in the back of the book was also very helpful. Ultimately, Mr. Webb's book is a compassionate tribute to soldiers that go to war and the emotional scars they must carry for the rest of their lives when they return home. Truly a great work."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I first started reading this book in 1978. I was stationed at Camp Pendleton with the 11th Marines and was finishing 6 years of active duty. I was drawn into this book from the very first page. The introduction and development of the characters, the scenes and situations have never felt as real for me in any other book, play or movie. I could tell that this man had been there, done that and had great skill in the retelling of it. Here was a story of a band of men at the forward edge told by a leader that truly knew and understood them.And I knew these guys. Yes, the \\"all persons and places are fictional...\\" in the preface, but the author's understanding of these men is spot on. I served with every one of these guys, every character in the book had a real life counterpart that I had known. That was a problem for me.As I said at the beginning, I started this book in 1978. But about 3/4 of the way through I got a \\"bad feeling\\" and I just couldn't go on. I didn't want to know what happened to these men, my brothers. I just couldn't take it. In 1994, I started rereading the book. It was just as real, but I guess I was stronger. I was able to finish it.This should be required reading for anyone hoping to be a leader of men. Lt.

And, wow, I have to say this book had a profound effect on me. I thought the \\"Battered Bastards of the Bastion of Bastogne\\" had it rough, I was just amazed and horrified by the conditions these Marines suffered through (Webb was a Marine in Vietnam himself and therefore knows of what he speaks). Not only that, but one of the plotlines of this novel was very disturbing, primarily because no matter how much thought I gave it, I honestly could understand both sides of the issue (a group of Marines are accused of murdering two Vietnamese civilians). Which is not to say I would have excused or condoned the Marines' behavior, but holy cow was that a horrific, confusing disaster of a war. I had a hard time blaming them for what happened, even while I knew it was wrong. But as one character pointed out, the line between combat and murder was just impossibly vague at times -- he says something like \\"You kill a man at 5:30 and it's murder; you kill him at 6, it's combat.\\"What a nightmare. This is a tremendous novel -- one I'd recommend to anyone who has ever been curious about what it was really like in Vietnam.

James Webb not only captures the spirit of a very trying time in our past he also captures the spirit of the human soul at its best and worst. Not only is this book a great lesson about the turmoil of the Vietnam era it applies in many ways to our current situation. I think that every American needs to read this book, especially the ones who question our fighting men and women. It shows how the class system in America sometimes neglects or outcasts our middle or lower class who most of the time do not have the priviledge of ivy league schools or a free ride in life. I not only write this review as a lover of literature but also as a U.S. Marine who has seen the many different classes and cultures of the people who serve in our military, and this book hits the nail on the head when describing what it is like in an organization where it doesn't matter where you come from, that everybody here has an equal chance to shine. A must read. Semper FI."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"Webb ties his story to the character's social histories, and particularly the platoon commander Hodges - who is always conscious of his ancestors who came to bad ends while fighting - and inevitability of bad results here - and perhaps in war generally - is the overall theme. Knowing his background, Webb surely believes that the leaders' role is to keep his people out of needless trouble; and there is a strong sense of bitterness in the failure of civil leadership, resulting in pointless bloody misery all around. While he acknowledges that other cultures may not be any smarter (his Vietnamese scout muses, this 'is the nature of life') he clearly believes that a country with American resources should use them more intelligently, with more foresight and morality. Between the lines, he rails at the indifference and corruption of military and civilian leaders alike whose ignorance and selfishness stupidly pushes his Marines into harm's way.By comparison, both William Manchester (a Sgt on Okinawa before writing Goodbye Darkness) and Philip Caputo (also a Lt in Vietnam before writing Rumor of War) carry less social baggage. All of these authors had very immediate experience, and speak with personal credibility in the context of ground combat - as you might expect, Manchester is a poet of tragedy; and Caputo's tale is more organized and clearer; while Webb's story is more of a morality play - some of Manchester's and Caputo's characters get out, and there is little sense of general community failure in those stories - but nobody survives intact in Webb's account, and he is not shy about how that happens. It may be the nature of life, but Webb seems to believe it doesn't have to be that way.Webb puts more time into describing characters and their relationships than either Manchester or Caputo, whose accounts are more descriptive of a situation. Overall, you get the sense that Manchester is writing a personal and collective history; Caputo is making a case to describe a problem; while Webb is writing about futility and even betrayal."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"Although I've had &quot;Fields of Fire&quot; for years, I had never managed to read it until I read &quot;The Nightengale's Song&quot;, which chronicled the lives of Webb and four other Naval Academy graduates (also a great book). I only regret that I had not read &quot;Fields of Fire&quot; years ago. It is one of the most honest, realistic, and gut-wrenching war novels I have ever read. I think it ranks with the likes of &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;, &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot;, and &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; as one of the best novels written about ANY war.I did not serve in Viet Nam (I was in the Navy), so I won't pretend to truly understand how the grunt really experienced the war. However, I am certain that &quot;Fields of Fire&quot; probably comes closer to conveying an understanding than any book written on Viet Nam. I have read other, non-fiction accounts of platoon-level fighting in Viet Nam (e.g., &quot;We Were Soldiers Once .. and Young&quot; and &quot;Steel My Soldiers' Hearts&quot;), and the descriptions of everything from the nightly patrols, the constant sense of fear, and just the brutality of so much around them could have been interchanged with Webb's descriptions.

The brutality and gruesomeness of war may be exacted with various themes, but it is always human life that suffers the toll.Fields of Fire provides the reader with a very good insight into Military life, despite the book's backdrop being the Vietnam War. Clearly, if Webb did not personally experience everything he writes about in Fields of Fire (Webb did serve in Vietnam), he certainly came close enough to what is depicted to personally resonate with them.Fields of Fire is raw in its reality. It does not sugarcoat or romanticize this war, or any war. The diverse personalities that form this small cadre of fighting Marines are in themselves very real. Having served in the US Military myself, I know and understand how one may and most likely will serve next to someone they fully dislike or ever loathe. Yet, that tension cannot and must not get in the way of fulfilling the mission.The ironies that crop up in Fields of Fire are magnificently true to life, although in many in-stances they are sad and sorrowful realities. But, isn't that life's own reality? Is that not the truth of war? How is it one man who is well liked, even revered, saves another Marine who is not well liked, giving up his own life? The message is clear: Personalities cannot and must not get in the way of protecting a fellow soldier's life. God does not favor the popular over the less popular in such settings.Parts of Fields of Fire are graphically gruesome, but that is not theatrics or literary drama. Any-one who has read anything about the Vietnam War knows of its human destruction, physical and psychological. The reader grows to like, even become fond of, certain characters and to dislike or loathe others. Webb does an excellent job of pulling the personalities off the pages, bringing each character to real life for the reader.I came away from Fields of Fire feeling sad, but that has been the case with me on most books written about Vietnam. Yet Fields of Fire held me captive from start to finish. And, at the finish I actually was wanting of a \\"bit more\\". I wanted it to continue, as though there was yet more to tell. It is well worth a good read for anyone interested in books of this genre."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"Very well written, interesting book on the war and those who conducted it. Mr. Webb presents the incongruities of the participants in a fashion that demands notice if not understanding. Exhilarating action and drama with honest (I think) insight of personal conflict brought on by differing perspectives. An excellent book and a good read that will surely keep you riveted."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I stopped reading in the first 100 pages when the author went on and on about how Robert E Hodges lost 3 ancestors on Picketts Charge with the 9th Kentucky Infantry. There was not a single Confederate Kentucky unit any where near Gettysburg.If you want to read a good book on Vietnam, read: Rumor of War, Loon or Matterhorn."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I picked up this book after amazon.com pointed me towards it after buying and reading \\"Matterhorn\\" by Karl Marlantes.Is the book as good as its reviews (Tom Wolfe has a blurb saying \\"In my opinion, the finest of the Vietnam novels...\\") ?Well, very gritty, gets you into the \\"bush\\", but a couple of comments:(1) Writer is very proud of his writing style and oftentimes just uses sentence fragments. I guess some people will like this but I found it lazy and distracting.(2) Book is choppy; difficult to explain but the back-and-forth between the history of the main characters and \\"current\\" action is not transitioned well... again, I think this is the author's proud style of writing(3) There are several graphic $ex scenes where the man forces himself on an unwilling woman and the woman ends up enjoying it. I really wonder where the author learned this and if he believes it; I call this rape and scenes like this makes me wonder about the author's treatment of women.I should have made this connection beforehand, but it wasn't until I bought this book that I made the connection that the author is Senator Jim Webb. Although I appreciate Senator Webb's military service, I suggest if you are interested in this book going to the used book store; buying this book you are sending a royalty check to someone who voted for the stimulus, healthcare, and financial reform bills that nobody read and will cost us trillions while reducing our freedom.\\"Matterhorn\\" is definitely worth buying the hardcover edition."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"First I don't like fiction generally, its just not helpful enough when trying to change the REAL non-fictional behavior of people often bent on self-destruction through self-deception. But James Webb is a &quot;straight shooter&quot; and his fiction encapsulates his observations/experiences in Vietnam. And they are indeed a negative collection of what NOT to do. Those that think Fields of Fire somehow supports and justifies the marine corps status quo tactically are just decieved, perhaps even Webb himself. I read a unit that is getting its tail kicked that has not adapted its tactics, techniques and procedures to overcome the enemy. The vanity and ethos of Lt. Hodges has nothing &quot;under the hood&quot; in his bag of tricks to defeat the enemy other than stumbling around in the jungle overloaded with gear. If Webb sees him as the epitome of military training, then its his own limitations showing. A THINKING ethos would have its leaders reading Bernard Fall, Larteguy, Mao, whatever it took to get the &quot;edge&quot; we need to win as the Hackworth of old did.The beginning/ending scene when the unit is surrounded, in the dark guarding a too-heavy for Vietnam M48 tank symbolizes America's predicament--supposedly so &quot;powerful&quot; but when it comes down to it it cannot even protect itself as it got disabled by a mere land mine. The last scenes of the movie Platoon with its impending doom captures this essence of despair Webb wants you to feel. Hell yes, I'm grateful we have men willing to be there in uniform in dark situations, but I WANT THEM TO WIN, and we don't get there by business-as-usual. You get there by innovation, by THINKING by looking less in the mirror wearing dress blues and recounting family heritage and spending more time learning what makes the enemy tick, perhaps....heresy......in a LIBRARY? Or ordering a book from Amazon.com.... Then you get involved in how America designs its armored vehicles (less time at uniform balls chasing skirts) so they have a &quot;V&quot; hull shape so they can deflect a mine, have powered road wheels so they can run on a short track...make them light enough so they can go off the roads and avoid likely mines/ambushes..make them light enough so they can fly by helicopters to get into dominant positions using the Air-Mech-Strike concept in General David Grange's new book by the same name.You only need to read this book once to know what NOT to do. For this, it succeeds marvelously."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"This book pwns!! Lol! Liek, it totally roxxorz my soxxorz!! Lol!!

Mr. Webb created believable and compelling characters. Hodges, Snake, and Goodrich all kept my attention throughout the book. Overall, my favorite section of the book came when Goodrich returned home. While I thought the confrontation with Harvard anti-war protesters was cliche, his conversation with his father was extremely well-done. If I recall correctly, the father's wise words--&quot;morality combined with self-interest isn't really about morality&quot;--rang appropriate to me."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"My all time favorite novel. The Honorable Mr. Webb personally epitomizes the characteristics of the legends of the Marine Corps, a real Marine's Marine. His writing and stories resound with realism, and strike home the story as a result of being told from his obvious experienced perspective. He magically and gracefully captures the evasive masculine beauty of the camaraderie Marines share. He skillfully weaves the story so that the trials of leadership, service, and the effects of the grim specter of combat are equally represented and properly illustrated. A masterpiece in any setting, this book eloquently portrays the true spirit and essence of the countless souls who have borne the Eagle, Globe, & Anchor...Semper Fidelis"},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I have read my two autographed copies of this book several times, each time I have laughed and cried.

My undieing loyalty will always be with this author. Semper fi Lt.

What troubles me is that several reviewers have expressed thoughts akin to worship, a phenomenon relished by authors and publishers ever since the making of Red Badge of Courage. In the 1970s, I met James Webb while working at the Naval Academy. Later, when I saw that he had published a novel about Vietnam, I got it and began to read. But I couldn't get far into the story. I tried several times but found its style and tone too poetic and storybook. The book tried desperately to expose me to a narrow set of fictional names, places, and events that were impossible to accept. I couldn't give up my own experiences in combat (1968-69), those inexplicable moments of survival with men that sacrificed their lives to save mine. The book didn't come to my defense but weakened my experiences with another story that wanted to decide the outcome of the war for me in words conforming to a style relished by publishers and book lovers only. I suspect this is the same for most veterans (soldiers and marines) that saw heavy combat in Vietnam. I'm troubled by the thought that war stories such as this one exploit with hyperbole and polemics mainly to make a profit. Suffice to say that Webb knew exactly what type of writing publishers were craving, and he wrote this story primarily to be published, making sure not to burn any bridges along the way. It is indeed fiction rather than history or autobiography. In this way, it was indeed a political statement, and those that think it is an anti-war novel are mistaken. There are no anti-war books or movies. They don't exist. A well known film historian recently said of the movie Paths of Glory, \\"Should the whole world watch this movie, there would be no more wars.\\" This is a specious as saying that if we made everyone a cop, there would be no more crime. Books and movies about war, especially those with \\"searing truths\\" about combat, do not add to our understanding of war, nor do they prevent anyone from picking up a gun and going to war. In fact, the more searing the story, the more likely the readers or viewers will want to experience so-called truths for themselves, to watch others die, to kill others and be made heroes for it. Is there any wonder why we went to war in Iraq? For a nonconforming, nonprofit-oriented book about the Vietnam War, see \\"Traces of a Lost War\\" by Richard Barone. Independently published, it goes for broke in its denial of the \\"war story,\\" fully admitting that its own words cannot touch or come close to the war they attempt to describe. http://www.amazon.com/Traces-Lost-War-Richard-Barone/dp/0975471104/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1321734400&sr=8-1"},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I dig this book, but it was a wee bit on the lengthy side. It portrayed everything I'd expect from good ol' James Webb, but I had lots of trouble connecting with its main characters, and I think that this was an outlet of some kind for Mr. Webb.

Maybe it will get better!"},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"James Webb's \\"Fields of Fire\\" describes the actions of a platoon of Marines during the height of action in Vietnam. The men come from different walks of life and react to war in their own way.Robert Lee Hodges, Jr. comes from a southern family with a strong military background. There were many times that Hodges thought about the trunk he had with his father's WWII uniform in it. It was said that if there were no Vietnam, he'd have to invent one. He does well in Marine Officer training and his sent to Vietnam.Webb introduces the men as they come together and make up Hodges unit, between scenes of combat so we can see the misery of war and learn of the participants.Snake, nicknamed for his tattoo has a bad day at the office of his low level job and he is fired. He sees the Marine motto, \\"Death Before Dishonor\\" has that tattooed and joins up. It is Snake's steadiness in battle that provides stability in the unit and saves other men's lives.Will Goodrich is the college man. While his buddies were running off to Canada or attending grad school to escape the draft, Will feels compelled to leave Harvard and enlists. He is the sensitive member of the unit and it is through his eyes we see much of the death and destruction and come to know what that can do to a young man, barely more than a teenager.These men and others are in a position where enemies surround them. Is the farmer in then nearby village really a farmer or is he Viet Cong waiting to kill them when they have their defences down.Webb also lets us see what war can do to a man. A Sgt. Austin joins the platoon. He is a by the book Marine and demands that rules that work stateside be implimented in the face of battle, shaving, haircuts, inspections etc. Not long after, he gets fragged where one of his men throw a grenade close enough to injure him and have him removed from their unit.It is a dark but well done novel that lets the reader see some of the things that make the Vietnam war one of the darkest times of our history.Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I received this book in great shape. I've yet to read it but I've heard so much about it, that it is next on my list!"},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"This book is exceptionally well written. It's right up there with Dispatches and A Rumor of War in terms of readability, though the style is quite different. It's got multiple strong characters, and lets you see the war from many viewpoints."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I read this before reading \\"Matterhorn\\" - the much-praised recent novel, which, while it mirrors \\"Fields of Fire\\" in many respects, lacks both the concision and the superb writing skills evidenced in James Webb's book. In other words, you can get the essence of \\"Matterhorn\\" in a shorter much more readable version by getting Webb's book. In particular, descriptions of combat itself are much more terrifying.ALERT:That said, I am a bit perplexed by the character of Goodwin in the epilogue (which is both astructural balance with the prologue introduction of several of the main characters and a moving depiction of the effect of death and wounds on families). But, in Goodwin's case I can't help but find a disconnect between his feelings while in country, where from day one he considers the war meaningless and wishes to be out of country, with the epilogue wherehe defends the war, be it mildly (with Mark) or in something akin to a ramble when addressing the rally (why he was chosen is curious, other than for his wound, because there was a branch of VVAW at Harvard at the time). Yeah, I get the point that to really understand the reality of the war from a grunt's point of view, you had to have been there, but that doesn't negate the validity having a \\"macro\\" position on the war, even if you were never going to have to serve.And, my second head-scratcher: Goodwin was appalled at the execution of two probable VC by Snake and others, and went so far as to make a formal complaint (with consequence he couldn't imagine at the time). And nothing afterwards indicates he had any regrets....But then, when talking with two organizers of the peace rally, he blurts out that he would have had no qualms about tracking down nd killing the young girl he believes led them into the ambush. In short, I'm left with a very puzzled understanding of him. Maybe that was Webb's intention, but it reads like some kind of authorial final word on the war.I'll leave it at that. And highly recommend this book as being the very best narrative of its kind."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"Not much I can say other than this is one of the best books I ever read. No hokey Mack Bolin action and dialogue. Just a deep novel with complex and very well developed characters. A larconic type feel with a good ending."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"For some reason this summer I became re-interested in the Vietnam war and trying to gain insight into the experience of our troops on the ground. As someone who grew up in the 60's in Canada, I recall listening to the nightly news and Walter Kronkite read the numbers of KIA and vague descriptions of battles. I also vividly recall the anti-war protesters and stories of draft dodgers relocating to Canada. But what wasn't well documented of course at the time was the real life experience of those who put their lives on the line in those south east jungles.This book was one I couldn't put down. I became completely engrossed by the human drama and daily struggles of this group of Marines as their life and death struggle played out in the hostile Vietnamese jungles. My respect for those who fought in this war has forever been altered. Not that I was ever part of the anti-war movement, but clearly it's difficult to envision the daily life of a grunt Marine in the treacherous jungles of southeast Asia if you've never witnessed it first hand.After reading this book, I can honestly say that it felt like I was there. Not to pretend that a novel can replicate any actual experience, nor to diminish what these brave men went through. But at the very least, if you pick this book up you'll gain a much clearer picture of what they endured and along the way you'll find your heart pounding as you creep through the thick bush with them.This is a great read. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I always enjoy reading a novel where the author has firsthand experience of what he writes - makes for a great, authentic story. I've read probably read about 25 war novels and this rates as one of the best. I like the author's sharp, accurate observations, and his characterization of the players was one of the best. Webb is a gifted storyteller, as well as being successful in his other careers, such as the USMC and the halls of government, which I suppose can be more troublesome and deadly than \\"Charlie\\" at times. Webb gives us an inside look at the insanity of war (and politics), and how his Marines felt after being constantly betrayed back home by the media and by the anti-war demonstrators. You just have to imagine the threatening pressures of being on the front-lines for your year's tour in Vietnam- complete boredom for weeks followed by a few minutes of sheer terror. A good book to read before we think about sending our young people off to do battle in foreign lands."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"Fields of Fire is not just an excellent novel about Vietnam. It's an excellent novel. The characters are believable and complex; the scenes are replete with meaning and context without being overbearing, and the story line keeps one's attention while it teaches some lessons about life and war--during combat, awaiting combat, and during moments of reflection. It has a rare combination of pragmatism and romanticism that I can only attribute to the author's views on life. Webb, himself a fearless ex-Vietnam vet doesn't disparage anyone--even he character \\"Harvard,\\" a clueless Ivy-leaguer forced into combat. Rather than create a stereotypical 'egghead' type, Webb treats him with sympathy. He does the same for gung-ho combat freaks as well as for the average soldier who is just trying to stay alive. I might call the style something like 'Hemingway a la mode.' Webb's style is both denotative and expressive; but he does not work hard at the spare style Hemingway championed. There's some nice 'adornment' along the way. If anyone knows the Buffy Saint Marie song 'Until It's Time for You to Go', you will find it used here in the most sensitive and moving of scenes.I also recommend another Webb novel, Missing Soldiers (or is it Lost Soldiers-sorry, forget), a book set many years later, in which an ex-Vietnam era Vet is called in to help solve a Vietnam War mystery: a different book, a different style, a different genre, but as good as or better than this one.The style of the fiction writer Webb pretty much complements the politician/real-life Webb, now Senator of Virginia. He demonstrates fictionally in his novels that honest and thoughtful and critical examination of one's country comes from that deepest of places: from a patriot's heart who loves his/her country to the point of reverence and becomes rightly indignant when the values one cherishes are transgressed by those who claim to be upholding them. This might not be the place to mention it, but if you think I'm suggeting what Webb things of George W., you're right."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"This book is fantastic in general, but as a 2ndLt of Marines it hits on a completely different level. The book describes the feelings one has when being thrown into a completely new situation with the added pressure of being the one in charge. It brings the Vietnam war to life in a way I have never seen or read."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I would rank this as one of the best vietnam era novels I have read. The way james webb introduces and describes the characters really brings you into the book. This was one of those books that I felt disappointed when it was finished, I have re-read this book twice already and have only owned it for a few month's I would suggest this book to anyone interested in vietnam era novels and of course those that are not. This is a great book."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"James Webb has written an awesome account of the Marines in Vietnam during the year 1969. I'm a Marine myself...an infantryman with 3rd Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment and also a writer myself and I found myself very much able to relate to the Marines in &quot;Fields Of Fire&quot; and also was able to draw a lot of literary lessons from this book."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I was lead to &quot;Fields of Fire&quot; after becoming interested in James Webb based on Robert Timberg's portrayal of him in &quot;The Nightingale's Song&quot;. &quot;Fields of Fire&quot; was referenced several times as a portal into his character. &quot;Fields of Fire&quot; filled many of the gaps in my understanding of what the Vietnam War meant. It highlights the human element of combat and burns the cliche &quot;War is Hell&quot; into your mind in vivid fashion. It is a book that will linger with you for a very long time."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I bought this book because it was recommended by Tom Wolfe in 'Hooking up' as 'In my opinion the finest of the Vietnam novels'. I have not read many Vietnam novels, but I agree that this is a very good one. Looking through the eyes of several different players, you get an insight in some of the viewpoints of the insanity called war. Snake, who got his Marine tattoo before boot camp, born to fight, never fitting in, until this war came along and gave him friends to die for. Hodges, who raised himself as a Marine, modelling himself after his dead father. Bagger, father of a little baby, scared of [messing] up, overwhelmed by the calamities of adulthood. Goodrich, a shameful coward, spending more time battling his conscience, than his enemies. All are heroes, but not the easy 'save some lives and get a medal' kind, but more of a stubborn, helpless, accepting gritty kind with an aura of uselessness around it. Maybe heroes isn't even the right word. Human. With all the fears and cravings and feelings of hope and friendship we come with. James Webb gave some of those who died their face back and I am grateful for it."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"This Pulitzer-nominated book borrows brilliantly from authors such as Norman Mailer, Stephen Crane, Ernest Hemingway, and draws from the author's own experience as a Marine rifle platoon and company commander in a hell known as An Hoa Basin.Throughout the book, Mr. Webb painstakingly leaves political discussion out of the picture, and instead, focuses on a Marine rifle platoon in one of the fiercest battlefields of Vietnam where the American civilian value has no relevance, and the platoon, consequently, is pitted in a struggle for survival. Eventually, the entire platoon is wiped out during a regimental operation against the North Vietnamese regulars. Ironically, it is the crippled Harvard undergraduate--a misfit who is dubbed the &quot;Senator&quot; because of his elite background--who delivers the verdict on the anti-war demonstrators for their alleged cowardice.The book does not try to justify the &quot;legitimacy&quot;--or the lack thereof--of the war where Mr. Webb and his men fought and bled, but calls for its readers to sympathize with and respect the men who fought in it. As he suggests through a Maileresque device known as the Time Machine, everyone in the platoon, except for Senator and the lieutenant, joins the Corps to get away from grim prospects at home, unaware that they will die in a godforsaken war. However, in spite of this, unlike many other typical Vietnam War novels, it discusses abstract ideals such as honor and duty associated with battlefield through Lt. Hodges who willingly volunteers for a tour in Vietnam.True, the book is dark and depressing, but it is also entertaining and totally believable at the same time. That is why this book remains one of the finest literary works on the Vietnam War"},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"This was a really well done and good book about Marines fighting in Vietnam. The soldiers are very real and the situations are horrible but so well written. I felt as if I had been there. I haven't read much fiction lately that I thought was very good but this book is - very good."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"From the first paragraph, Jim Webb paints the perfect picture of the war in the rice paddies that was fought by so many Marines.His characters are true to life--many similar men were in my rifle platoon in the same area at the same time.This book reveals a very well known aspect of war at the small unit level. What is happening 1000 meters down the road is of utmost importance. What is happening back home &quot;in the world&quot; means very little. And the idealistic views of the protected elite who are quite willing to let someone else do the dirty work and would never think to grab a rifle and go to war change graphically when they are suddenly in the line of fire. That is when the basics of survival kick in, and an entirely new world view is born.A must read."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I am not widely read in war novels, but this one carries the flavor and angst of Vietnam as well as its dilemmas. Webb scallops the line between hero and murderer to the point of invisibility. His characters live their mostly brief lives on the edge of rage and desperation, cockiness and cool.Fields of Fire provides glimpses of what it takes to be a fighting man. The Marine Corps can standardize them in boot camp, but the really superb ones have it in their bones- a natural alacrity that keeps them forever watchful and reactive.Finally, if anyone wonders why combat soldiers re-up, the author demonstrates the reasons. It must be a huge rush to perform this perilous, bloody work, do it well and cheat the grim reaper. No other job is as real, no bonds of fealty are stronger. Thank you Mr. Webb, for all your services."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"James Webb, now a US Senator, formerly Secretary of the Navy, and once upon a time, a Marine Lieutenant, has captured the essence of brotherhood, duty, hardship, and sacrifice that all former Marines can relate to so strongly. This book brought back so many of the long-buried ghosts of my own service 30 years ago, and then resurrected my pride in serving. Anyone with an interest in the Vietnam conflict from an infantryman's standpoint will find this book indispensable."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"James Webb is a terrific writer. As a former marine infantry soldier who experienced the war in Viet Nam first hand, he could have taken that experience to extremes as some writers have, either exaggerating the Gung Ho comeradere of the soldier's experience or attacking the war itself as a meaningless and senseless horrer. Instead, while showing clearly the dehumanizing effects of terror and hardship that marines in the field experienced, he manages to make the reader care about the characters - even while honestly presenting them with their many faults. He doesn't turn his head away from brutality and inhumane actions on the part of his characters. Rather he creates a world where normal values have to be put aside in favor of survival, and even those characters one might dislike initially because they are crude, viscious and stupid, take on an almost larger than life image as they survive and help their buddies survive.Webb can really write. This is a book told with the authority of one who was actually there and has thought long and hard about his experiences. The characters are skillfully drawn, the action of the story moves forcefully forward with few lulls and the descriptive passages and dialogue are so right on that one really believes that this is real - these people, these actions.This is an excellent book and should be appreciated both by those who had the first hand experience and those who didn't."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"This book is one of the Top 10 best war novels of all time. Webb's experience as a platoon commander in Vietnam makes him expertly qualified to comment on the gap that existed between the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have-nots.&quot; His combat experiences are thinly veiled through the eyes of LT Hodges, a main character in the novel. The enlisted Marines in this book are based on the farmers, coal miners, drop-outs, immigrants and the lower class in general who fought and died in the war. The quote at the beginning of the book, from a General to a war correspondant, accurately depicts the gap in society that was created by LBJ's draft laws. The draft laws were full of loopholes that the middle and upper class were only too eager to exploit. Webb uses &quot;Senator&quot; Goodrich, an Ivy League dropout and a disabled infatryman, as an anti-hero to explain the war to the privilaged few who decided to protest the war from thousands of miles away. His epic quote of &quot; How many of you are going to get hurt in Vietnam? I didn't see any of you in Vietnam. I saw dudes, man. Dudes. And truck drivers and coal miners and farmers. I didn't see you. Where were you? Flunking your draft physicals? What do you care if it ends? You won't get hurt.&quot; to a peace rally at Harvard is one the most gripping paragraphs in context of the civilian protests of the Vietnam War. Webb has shown that the college students, the draft dodgers and the morally weak deserted the country in it's time of need. The United States used the underprivaleged to fight a stupid war. How would the war have turned out if a few senator's sons, or a few sons of prominent businessmen were KIA in Vietnam? How many lives could have been saved if this occurred? As Mr. Goodrich eloquently states in the novel,&quot; These people have no sense of country. They have no sense of obligation. Well, so be it. If they are willing to accept the benefits of this society- such as a Harvard education- the they should also accept the burdens.&quot; A fascinating look into the souls of the forgetten men who were willing to fight for no other reason than brotherhood. They didn't fight for the US, they didn't fight for the society- they fought for themselves, and they often paid the price in blood. Mr. Webb- thank you for such a wonderful novel. It helped see what my father had to endure as an Army infantrymen in Vietnam."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I am a pretty slow reader. As I read late at night before going to bed, I often only read a few pages before nodding off. It can take me a couple of weeks to finish a novel. However, I finished Fields of Fire over one weekend. I could not put it down. I found it compelling, interesting, and all-too-real. I felt like I knew the guys in the platoon. I felt their emotions, I laughed at their jokes, I wept at their losses. Better than any of the many Vietnam movies I have seen, this book painted a picture of what the life of a Marine was like during that terrible war. I hope that all Americans -- regardless of their feelings about Vietnam, Iraq, or war in general -- should read this book to gain insights that they could only otherwise get by actually being in combat."},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","review":"I've read a lot of books about Vietnam, however this novel is literally THE best I've ever read about Vietnam. The insight about the men (or boys if you will) that fought in Vietnam is RIGHT on the money. Most of them from poor areas, sons of farmers, immigrants, blacks..etc. The different perspectives from these characters gives you an incredibly clear picture of what it was like, how they experienced it, how they felt about it. You really grasp the absolute TRAGEDY that was Vietnam. In my opinion this should be a MANDATORY read in schools. If we can get more young people to read this perhaps we can avoid further tragedies like this from ever happening again.

Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz from the classic 1939 movie. It was therefore an interesting exercise to read the original version of Dorothy's story--the first book, published in 1899, of what came to be a very lengthy series--and compare it with the film version. There are some substantial differences between the two. In the film version, Dorothy's journey to Oz is an unreal episode, an elaborate dream experienced after being hit on the head. Her dream world and her real life, meanwhile, were symmetrical insofar as some of the principal characters from Kansas were translated into characters in Oz. There is no such symmetry in Baum's version. The witch-like Miss Gulch and humbuggy Professor Marvel, the farm hands Hickory, Huck, and Zeke do not appear in the book. Further, Dorothy's house really is transported to Oz in the cyclone, and when she returns to Kansas Dorothy does so bodily: that is, she travels from Oz and does not merely wake from a dream. Smaller differences between the book and film versions are numerous.On the whole, I think that the movie tells a tighter, more interesting story than does the book. The Wicked Witch of the West--whose demise in the book is strangely anticlimactic--plays a much bigger role in the film. This holds the story together nicely just as does the symmetry between Dorothy's real and unreal worlds. The movie also omits a good many of the less interesting episodes included in the book, such as Dorothy's adventures among the Dainty China people. What the book has to offer, in turn, is more on the characters' back stories, in particular those of the Tin Woodman and, of all creatures, the Flying Monkeys--much maligned, misunderstood beasts that they are. Who would have guessed their sad plight from the Monkeys' nightmare-inducing depiction in the movie?While some of Baum's book could have been excised without losing anything, and though the movie tells an arguably better story, Baum's writing is pleasant and his characters well-developed and interesting. It's not surprising that the book has inspired so much affection over the years.Debra Hamel -- author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in ancient Greece (Yale University Press, 2003)"},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The Wizard of Oz is a well-made children's literature and very American fairy tale.Oz's answer to Dorothy and her companion is quite a right one.To win \\"hearts\\", \\"brains\\" and \\"courage\\" and \\"returning to home\\" they should make efforts and do something worthwhile. Unlike European fairy tales use of magic power is quite restrained or limited. Even Dorothy wearing her magic boots and hat, the writer made her unaware of the effect. Power, strength or ability you need to make a living is not something automatically confered upon from the witch nor wizard. Through a number of adventures they eventually earn rights to claim what they desire.The storyline and the moral of the story quite fit the founding principles of America and presented to the child in such a charming manner. The movie in 1939 based on this story is also impressive and can be recommendable."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The well written, enduring children's tale of OZ deserves a place in our cultural history.The oft told tale of OZ is known to all of us... mostly through the 1939 Technicolor film masterpiece. Dorthy like Christian in PILGRIM'S PROGRESS travels through space and time on a trip of revelation. Perhaps Oz' odyssey is a continuation of the trip in PILGRIM'S PROGRESS long before Baum.The two tales diverge towards radically different destinations relevant to both secular and Christian readers. The 1939 movie differs from the book for reasons of brevity and perhaps fear: The porcelain church broken by the Lion and deemed unimportant by Dorthy does not appear in the movie. Indeed the porcelain society with its frailty and weakness is excluded perhaps for brevity...too abstract.The Wizard is a projection in the movie, but a series of hallucinations specific to the fears of each character in the book. Baum's OZ is a bogus God. The green hue of the Emerald City is a figment of Dorthy's imagination created by green eyeglasses in the book but a real city in the movie. Is capitalism and prosperity merely an illusion created by paper wealth? This book had populist roots as well.The heaven of PILGRIM'S PROGRESS becomes the humble Kansas earth of Dorthy's childhood...Dorthy's destination.OZ is a circular land which has at its centre the Emerald City surrounded by desert. Jerusalem of yore was often portrayed as the centre of a circular world surrounded by a desert. The Emerald City becomes a bogus Jerusalem, colored by shaded eyeglasses,in a tale which many have identified as an occult PILGRIM'S PROGRESS loaded with dark symbolism.It is likely that the screenwriters of 1939 saw the corrosive anti-God symbolism of Baum's book and wisely took heed to erase it. The real question readers should ask is why this tale was written at all. L. Frank Baum was an ardent racist who advocated,in two editorials, the genocide of Native Americans. Baum's descendants later apologized on National Public Radio for the thoughts of Baum.Shortly after Baum's outbursts, the massacre at Wounded Knee occurred. The army murdered native american children at Wounded Knee and honestly documented the horrible act. The dark question posed by this book is why a mind which so callously disregarded the lives of minority children would want to speak to other children in a fantasy?It is as if a NAZI war criminal would find it necessary to write children's books after the War. Should you honor Baum's thoughts by buying this book? Judged in the context of history this book should be avoided by secular as well as Christian parents.Baum's book is worthy of historical and psychological analysis but belongs in the libraries of academics. THE WIZARD OF OZ does not belong in your child's library. Sorry for the negatvity... but while I recognize the value of this book I can not give credibility to the author.Ephesians 5:11...

That happened to Auntie Em because she was a pretty, young wife but the sun and wind took the sparkle from her eyes and the red from her cheeks. When Dorothy came to live with Auntie Em and Uncle Henry, the only thing that kept her from turning somber was her dog Toto. Toto gave her laughter.When a cyclone came, Dorothy was in the house with Toto and got whisked away. She fell onto her bed and fell asleep. When the house landed with a thump, Dorothy awoke. She opened the door to a beautiful and colorful land. There were Munchkins, the little natives, and the good Witch of the North. They told her that her house had fallen onto the Wicked Witch of the East and killed her.Because Dorothy wanted to get back to Kansas, she asked if they knew how she could get back. The good Witch of the North told her to go see the Great Wizard of Oz. To get to Oz, you follow the Yellow Brick Path. First the good Witch gave Dorothy a Kiss that protected her from Evil and Dorothy took the Silver Shoes that the Wicked Witch of the East left behind.On her journey, Dorothy met the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion. The Scarecrow wanted a brain because his head was stuffed with straw. The Tin Man wanted a heart because he was in love with a Munchkin girl and she could marry him as soon as he had wood for a house. But the old woman she lived with traded two sheep to the Wicked Witch of the East to prevent the marriage. The Wicked Witch enchanted the ax, so each time he cut, the ax would chop through his body and each time the Tin Man went to a tinsmith that would repair his body... until he was all tin and didn't have a heart. The Cowardly Lion was supposed to be King of the Forest, but was a coward. The Cowardly Lion needed courage to be the true King. So all of them continued on the journey to Oz.When the group arrived at Oz, the gatekeeper let them in because the Kiss of the good Witch and the Silver Shoes. Then they put on some green spectacles to protect their eyes from the brightness. Each one saw the great Oz, but each saw him differently. Each time he told one to destroy the Wicked Witch of the West.So Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion set off to find the Witch. As soon as they stepped onto her land, the Wicked Witch sent wolves, crows, bees, and Winged Monkeys after them. Do you think Dorothy destroyed the Witch? You should read The Wizard of Oz to find out. It was a well-written book that was intriguing and had fun characters."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I was a reasonably big fan of the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" when I was a kid. I'd seen the Judy Garland film, the \\"Return to Oz\\" film, my parents had taken me to a theatre production, and there used to be a cartoon series about Dorothy and her friends that I quite liked. Here in Australia, though, you don't see an awful lot of the Wizard of Oz books, and I missed out on all that as a kid. I managed to find a copy just recently of the the original story, and I really liked it. It's really a shame I couldn't find it earlier.Dorothy is a girl who lives with her aunt and her uncle in the countryside of Kansas. In the midst of a \\"cyclone\\", Dorothy, her dog Toto, and her whole house are swept away to the Land of Oz, a beautiful but strange world full of all sorts of interesting creatures, good and bad witches, and a very famous wizard. Dorothy tries to find her way home, and on the way makes many new friends, like the Scarecrow, \\"Tin Woodsman\\" and the cowardly lion. Will she ever make it home?It's rather different to the movie, I found. For one, the journey Dorothy and her friends go on takes many days, whereas the in the Judy Garland film it seems to all take place much shorter. The magic shoes Dorothy picks up in Oz are silver here, and not ruby red like in the film. There are also a lot of other creatures and things in the book, like the queen of the mice, the Hammerheads, and the Dainty China people. Though the world of Oz seems pretty big in the film, it feels a lot bigger to me in the book. Oz has a nice atmosphere too, I thought. It's very cosy and familiar, and kind of evokes a kind of America the way that say C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien evokes a kind of Britain, if that makes any sense. North, south, east, west... in Oz's every direction there's a new land to explore. You never know who you might meet, or how they'll do things there. I quite like how laid back everyone is in Oz. The way the Munchkins and the people of the Emerald City speak, for instance.I enjoyed finding out things about my favorite characters too, like how the Tinman became made of tin and how the flying monkeys became slave to the wicked witch of the west, which is all described here. That reminds me, there is a little bit of fairy tale violence here, but nothing worse than you might find in \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\".All in all, a great read, I thought. Whimsical, colourful and fun. I do hope I can get my hands on some of the follow up books. Good thing there's amazon!"},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The movie based on this book has so eclipsed the novel in the mind of the general public that it's difficult to review the book on its own.The book isn't a musical, obviously, and it has spectacles and scenes which could never have been brought to the screen at the time it was published. Also, the land of Oz has more of a culture and political atmosphere than the film makes note of.That being said, this book is a wild ride through the imagination of Frank L. Baum, with elements from our world transformed in bizarre ways that could never have been anticipated. The entire idea of a talking scarecrow is brilliantly imaginative, if you think about it, as is the cowardly talking lion, the winged monkeys, and the magical field of flowers which puts the adventurers to sleep.Oz is a wonderland unlike any other, and children will delight in the magical surprises that lurk around every bend in the yellow brick road. The special magic of this extensive series is that despite the magic suffusing every nook and cranny of Oz, there are familiar objects and creature from our world that keep us grounded.However, the older you are, the less you will enjoy this book, because it has some pretty serious flaws by modern standards.The language has become quite dated, and the goody-goody dialogue can be jarring to someone who has grown used to a more modern approach. If this book were released today, I don't believe it would ever enjoy the type of success that it did then.Luckily, this book is written for the children, who can generally forgive the fact that characters talk a little strangely (as long as it's consistent, which it is), and the sometimes clunky plot turns.For a child, the focus will be on the King of Mice, or the terrible Kalidah, just two of the magical creatures that escaped the screenplay for the movie.

Mr. Baum put up the money himself to publish the first edition of &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; because no established company would touch a &quot;modern&quot; American fairy tale. As a result, few books were actually produced, but rarely has an author had such control over his finished product. Here's your chance to own a reproduced copy of his original vision!

One of the violent acts was when the tin man chopped off the mountain lions head. You don't usually see that kind of violence in Shirley. Another event happened when forty or so wolves were killed. I think that if the movie were to be made exactly how the book was wrote that it would be an interesting movie.

Frank Baum's classic novel as a simple children's story, but it has a deeper significance. Baum lived in the Great Plains of the American West during the Populist uprising of the 1890s, and the characters and events of the Wizard of Oz are based upon what he observed. For example, Dorothy represents the innocent midwesterner who must contend with the wild nature of the West (the Wicked Witch of the West) and the deceptive idea that all solutions can be found with money (following the path of gold, or the Yellow Brick Road). The Scarecrow represents American farmers, the Tin Woodsman represents American workers (his transformation from human to tin man represents industrial accidents), and the Cowardly Lion represents Populist presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan (a great orator but a pacifist, hence the cowardly lion). Following the path of gold leads Dorothy and her companions to the Emerald City, which represents Washington, DC, and the corrupt influence that money has on the city. The Wizard is the President of the U.S.--a weak and powerless humbug who nevertheless manages to convince the inocent Dorothy that it is he and not the moneyed special interests that control the land. Anyway, there is much more, but in the end Dorothy conquers nature (the Witch of the West), and with the help of the Silver Slippers (the Populist Party's Free Silver issue), finally finds her way home to truth and happiness.

The novel was not really meant to be a fairy tale for young children, instead it was a Populist book on the issue of bimetalism and argrarian discontent with Industrial Tycoons and Robber Barons. The movie really did a horrible job with this book, changing the &quot;silver slippers&quot; into ruby slippers to show off the impressive Technicolor. The book however is a classic, for its subtle references to politcal issues and the immagination of the mind.

Escape liturature of the highest caliber."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I have read and watched the Wizard of Oz a bunch of times. A classic for sure. However, I have not read it quite like Mr. Baum wrote it. What I mean is in this book, the shoes that Dorothy gains from eliminating the Wicked Witch of the East are \\"silver\\". Yes, you heard me the original shoes were silver and not \\"ruby\\".So, I checked it out to see why the change and the reason is:In the original 1900 book edition of 'The Wizard of Oz', the slippers of the Wicked Witch of the East were silver in color. But in the beloved 1939 film version, they were ruby red. According to those involved in the making of the film, a silver color washed out in comparison to the beautiful, riotously rich colors of the dream sequences in the enchanted, magical land of Oz. In the search for a more photogenic alternative. ruby red came out the winner.What I liked about reading the original story as the author wrote it is that he really went into detail about the characters and the land and story. Like who the Tin Man really was prior to becoming the Tin Man. He was a man who had fallen in love. A witch put a curse on his axe and every time that he would go out to chop wood, he chopped off a limp until he was nothing more then a Tin Man.The illustrations that Mr. Sieben did were great. They were quirky but colorful and really portrayed the characters and the story nicely. So whether you are a fan or just want to read this book again, you need to pick up 2 copies. One to keep as a treasure on your bookshelf and another to read."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The true American fairy tale! We all loved the movie but now is the time for all of us to curl up on the sofa and read L. Frank Baum's original version of the wonderful land of OZ. This is the first book in the set of 14 books and I must say it was a pleasure to read the real story behind Dorothy and her band of friends as they follow that famous yellow brick road. Some things are familiar in the story; creatures and settings and people that we have seen in the movie. But many, many things are very different. I do not want to mention any of the differences because that is where the fun lays in reading the original version. To find out for yourself what hardships our band of four adventurous souls discover on their journey to the Emerald City.

When Dorothy lands she finds herself in a strange land.There is filled with munchkins, flying monkeys, hammer heads, witches, a wizard, a talking lion, a tin man, and much more. In the story there are several conflicts that Dorothy and her comrades face. One of the conflicts that they face is when Dorothy and her comrades must travel to the beautiful Emerald City to find Oz the great and the terrible.When she and her comrades get there, their plan is to ask the great Oz to fulfill the greatest wishes.

At the height of the anniversary comes this lively audio book.I feel that this 'radio theatre' adaptation did the book justice. Monterey Soundworks did a great job of transfering Baum's fantasy world to an audio book, giving listeners a new interpretation to the story, yet retaining some of MGM's inescapable influence.The cast is wonderful, bringing new life to the characters, though the Cowardly Lion and Wicked Witch characterizations sound similar to the MGM Bert Lahr and Margaret Hamilton interpretations. In a world where the Judy Garland movie overshadows the original book, it is virtually impossible to not think of at least some of the MGM characters while listening to this adaptation.The adaptation also includes many adventures in the book that are not found in the MGM film, such as the journey through the Dainty China Country, the Hammerheads, the Field Mice, etc. Other differences are that the color of Munchkin clothing is blue, an indication of that country's favorite color. The Wicked Witch of the West is melted not by setting the Scarecrow on fire, but after tripping Dorothy to get the silver shoes and making Dorothy angry (the 'Ruby Slippers' are an MGM creation). Glinda has a british accent, as does the witch of the North.Listening made me realize just how much more to the original 'Wonderful Wizard' book there is, and that MGM cut out a huge chunk of adventures that kids can now enjoy listening to here.I recommend this audio adaptation to any teacher, parent, or child who enjoys reading (or hearing) the magic of Baum's tale. It will transport you 'Over that Rainbow' to the world as Baum originally wrote it."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"It took me 29 years to finally make it to Oz, and I can't wait to go back again!Of course, I'd seen the movie many times.

If you're getting through life only seeing the movie and singing the songs, pick up the book sometime!I want to live in Oz!"},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I have to admit, until this year I didn't care much for the Wizard of Oz. It was my wife's favorite movie (and she even has checks with Oz scenes on them), but it never was \\"fantasy\\" enough for me. I had been an avid modern fantasy/sci-fi reader until this year when I started reading classics like the Hobbit, the Chronicles of Narnia, and ultimately I picked up the Wizard of Oz.This book is a wonderful read and I fully intend to finish the entire series. There is something so pure and simple about Baum's tale that I find myself entranced and wanting more. This book enchanted me, and immersed me in a world I wished I could visit. I love feeling amazed when I read a book, and this book amazed me.The only thing I didn't care for in this edition is the time spent by Eloise McGraw in the forward addressing the writing style and prose of Baum. For those of you concerned that this is not the Grapes of Wrath, well...is isn't. It also is everything I need in 2006 and the world is heavy with war and hatred: a fantasy tale that takes me away from my troubles and sets me sailing into Oz. I am very glad this isn't classic literature...very glad. I hope you understand that statement as a comment of praise for Baum."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"In this classic, Baum describes the tale of poor Dorothy, who is hurled by a cyclone away from her uncle and aunt in Kansas into a strange and magical world of wizards and witches. Fortunately Dorothy has the help of several companions that she meets in this new world - a stuffed scarecrow who wants brains, a tin woodsman who wants a heart, and a cowardly lion who wants courage. Together with Dorothy - who wants a return trip to Kansas - they travel to the emerald city where Oz is wizard, to ask him to make their wishes come true. Their journey is fraught with adventures, and when they finally meet Oz they discover a terrible truth, that leads them into even more challenges and adventures. The magical fantasy of this tale has pleased readers of all ages for a century, and it's not hard to see why. Baum spins a wonderfully enchanting tale that includes wicked witches, flying monkeys, talking mice, and other fantastic creatures.Is this book more than just a fantasy thrill? Some literary critics have proposed that Baum - a strong believer in individualism and self-confidence - is working with themes about self-esteem and self-reliance. This is quite plausible, especially considering that the brains, heart and courage sought by the scarecrow, woodsman and lion are abilities that they clearly already possess - they just need to recognize them and use them. And Dorothy herself discovers that when the wizard can't help her, she must and can rely on herself. Other literary critics have claimed that &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; needs to be read as an elaborate political allegory where the various characters represent various social classes and financial structures - a not impossible suggestion, but one that's somewhat difficult to defend. Ultimately, however, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; is best enjoyed as a wonderful story. That doesn't mean it is any less of a contribution to English literature, because when appreciated as a brilliant story, you're sure to come back to it again and again, as are your children and grandchildren. It's precisely this universal appeal that makes &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; a true classic."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"It is unfortunate that most people know The Wizard of Oz only by the movie. To be perfectly honest, I found the movie bland compared to the book. For those who have read the book, many don't know that there was thirteen other Oz books written by L. Frank Baum. People who have read the first fourteen probably don't know that five other authors wrote more Oz books after Baum's death, making a total of forty books in the original series. The Wizard of Oz is a wonderful book for anyone no matter what age you are. Just remember to forget every thing you saw in the movie. Most people are surprise when the story doesn't end where the movie ends. When you,re finished the book try the other books in the series. I think you would enjoy them all."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"It's amazing how little people know about this book. I've seen only one review note that this story is an economic parable, not just a fable for children, and the reviewer who mentioned it made it sound like this was a wacky, unrealistic modern interpretation of a simple children's tale.Not so!Baum wrote this story as an analogy for the bimetallic standard, an issue that people actually cared about around the turn of the century but now hardly know ever existed, since we don't back our money with anything anymore. But there was a time, and The Wizzard of Oz (short for ounce, as in an ounce of gold, as in the issue of price-ratios) was written during that period, when the hottest issue on the political plate was that of the bimetallic standard--how and if it should be used. Baum, incidentally, was an enthusiastic political participant, was, in fact, probably present during William Jennings Bryan's famous &quot;cross of gold&quot; speech.But no one knows this anymore. The film is much to blame. Replacing the SILVER shoes of the wicked witch of the east(ern financial establishment) with ruby slippers is inexcusable, even if people don't know or care about these issues now. The silver shoes (silver standard) on the yellow brick road (gold standard) is a vital immage. Ah well. Still a good story."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"A foul, evil stench has blown into Munchkin Land.....After a hundred years in print \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" has been drastically changed by one Suzi Alexander. She has added her name as an author to \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\\" which was written long before she was ever born. So, what has she done to deserve the co-author credit for a book that sold millions worldwide before she ever heard of it? The \\"Great and Powerful\\" Suzi of Oz has judged that L. Frank Baum didn't know what he was doing and thus his great novel needed to be condensed and adapted by her for modern audiences. The original, best-selling Oz needed Suzi to save it.Tell us Suzi, Who died an made you Wizard?This is an outrage made possible because the copyright for \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" has expired and so anyone can do anything they like with the text. Yes, by law it is now in the public domain. Anyone, anywhere can publish it.I have many fine editions of the original novel published by divergent companies that loved the story so much they wanted to keep making it available to more and more children as well as the child in all of us. The Suzi Alexander version, however, seems to be written not by someone who loves the the original but instead by a person who thinks she can make a better version than the one who sold all these millions of copies before she got her hands on it.May the children of the world throw a bucket of water on her and watch Suzi's wickedness melt away.As a child who carefully memorized every single word of the original, I find the Dalmatian Press, Suzi Alexander, altered and condensed work to be nothing less than an abomination.Keep your hands off our priceless treasures! These silver shoes do NOT belong to you!Don't be fooled by the cover. It may say \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\\" but the Dalmatian Press, Suzi Alexander version is NOT the original novel that L. Frank Baum wrote. It is not good enough to be used in fireplaces or in landfills. Suzi should attempt to write her own terrible books rather than messing with our established American classics.Suzi, If you had enough heart to love the original, you'd have had the courage to bring it to us unblemished, but sadly you haven't got a brain and you can never go home again."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ,L. Frank Baum's 1899 copyright,Kindle edition, 2012-01-09One summer day in 1937, my sister and I took a trip to Oz. Unlike Dorothy, we didn't have a cyclone, we had to roller skate a mile to the library. I was ten, my sister seven. The effort was worth it. We discovered L. Frank Baum's many Oz books and spent hours at a time in Oz. It is one of my most cherished memories from childhood.Alan Pearce's Kindle Edition of Baum's original 1899 book is beautifully done, and very faithful to the book. It's also a real eye-opener when compared with the MGM movie. Baum had four people greet Dorothy, three Munchkin men and the Witch of the North. MGM's myriad Munchkins were little people gathered from all over the world. Dorothy's \\"ruby slippers\\" in the movie were silver in the book. Admitedly, these are nit-picking examples, simply to show how MGM messed up the book. Only someone who has seen the movie, and now reads the book, will notice the major differences.This is the most beautiful e-book I have ever seen! If you decide to read it, please do it justice.

Kindle Edition."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The Wizard of Oz is one of my all-time favorite movies, and I still have to say that I like the book better. Why? The book has more weird stuff in it than the movie does; probably because of theatrical limitations like time, budget, and technological contraints. For instance, the Wicked Witch of the West in the book has only one eye. Nowadays computer graphics could make that possible in a film, but back in the day, most movies couldn't pull off effects like that.The book and the movie deviate from each other quite a bit, but both include essentially the same story. I'm glad the movie didn't try to copy the book directly, and changed some parts to not only fit the limits it had, but to make the whole story more movie-esque - like really jazzing up Munchkin Land and making it smaller than the book implied it was. (Dorothy is of the same height as the Munchkins in the book.)One thing in the book that I thought was really cool was that the Wizard of Oz shows himself in multiple forms, not just the big head. He's even a lady at one point. Also I like the hammer-head guys at the end of the book. L. Frank Baum really showed me his creative abilities there.On a side note, there are some violent scenes in the book, particularly involving multiple beheadings at a time.I really think that if you only see the movie and don't read the book, you're missing out. This book contains the REAL Tinman, and the REAL Scarecrow. The ones from the movie are just copies. Darn good copies, but still copies. Oh, the things a good book from a good author can inspire!"},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This story all started when a farm girl from Kansas named Dorothy Gale, and her little dog Toto got sucked into a tornado and landed in a fairyland named Oz.

Each one wanting a different wish. On the way to the wizard they come across multiple things. And when they finally got to Emerald city the wizard told them that they must first kill the wicked witch of the west if they want him to make there wishes come true. Eventually they succeed in doing that along with multiple hard things to do. After all that they find out that the wizard is a &quot;humbug&quot; and he grants everyone's wishes.

Well they found her and Dorothy got back home along with her dog Toto, and she had what she needed all along in order for her to return home. Personally in my opinion I enjoyed the book better then the movie. I would recommend this book to anyone with a good imagination, because I kept imagining the story as I read it. The book has some drawings in it wich makes imagining things a lot easier, it has drawings of the main characters, villains, and some of the scenes in the book such as there journey on the yellow brick road. I would also recommend this book to anyone if the ages of 10 and up."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"In his introduction to the first American fairytale that went on to become one of the most famous and beloved movies of all time, author L. Frank Baum says a rather extraordinary thing. Discussing the purpose of the old fairytales by Grimm and Andersen, Baum tells us that such tales existed both to entertain children and provide a moral by means of \\"horrible and blood-curdling\\" incident. True enough, but Baum goes on to say that his book falls outside this typical definition of a fairytale, telling us that: \\"the story of the Wizard of Oz was written solely to pleasure children of today. It aspires to being a modernized fairytale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out.\\"Reading The Wizard of Oz for the first time made me wonder if Baum was even aware of what he'd written, or if perhaps someone else had written this introduction (someone who hadn't read the book), for The Wizard of Oz is positively jam-packed full of beheadings, monsters, witches, deaths and other terrors, all focused on a character that embodies the quintessential childhood fear: that of being lost and unable to return home. Indeed, with his description of Uncle Henry in the very first chapter, Baum writes: \\"He worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was. He was gray, from his long beard to his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.\\" Not quite the cheerful fairytale Baum promises, is it?But of course, this isn't a bad thing. If we want to enjoy the light, then there has to be some shadows, and throughout Baum's story there is a perfect blend of happiness and pain, wonderment and horror as Dorothy Gale traverses the Land of Oz in her attempts to get home to Kansas. I just find it rather bemusing that the author was apparently wholly unaware of this!Inevitably, one can't help but compare Baum's original story with the movie-version, and it's interesting to compare the areas in which the two differ. There's still a little girl called Dorothy who lives with her Uncle Henry, Aunt Em and her dog Toto, and she's still caught up in a cyclone that whisks her away to the Land of Oz. On waking up, she finds that her house has landed on the Wicked Witch of the East, much to the delight of the diminutive Munchkins, who have been slaves under her rule. Rewarded with the Witch's Silver Shoes (*not* Ruby Slippers, which were an innovation of the movie in order to make the most of Technicolor), Dorothy is told to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and the Wizard of Oz, a mysterious figure who holds the best hope of getting her home again.And of course there are the familiar and beloved figures of the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion, stalwart friends to Dorothy on her journey, and all desiring some internal quality (a brain, a heart and courage, respectively), completely unaware that they already have these traits in abundance. There's also the surprising Wizard of Oz, the evil Wicked Witch of the West (not as prevalent here as she was in the movie) and the good witches of the North and South (who in the movie are combined into the singular character of Glinda).But there are plenty of things of Baum's creation that the movie left out, such as a community of talking field mice and their Queen, a city of tiny china people, and a whole range of other bizarre inhabitants that would have been entirely impossible for the movie to recreate. The book also gives us more background into certain people and places. For example, I was delighted to find that the book gives us background on the Tin Woodman, detailing how exactly he came to be made of tin, which is a rather poignant tale of lost love. And as it turns out, there is a lot more to those creepy flying monkeys and the Emerald City than the movie shows us.In the movie, marvels are introduced one after the other in quick succession, making Oz a rather abstract and random place, much akin to Lewis Carroll's Wonderland in the \\"Alice\\" stories, (which makes a sort-of sense considering the film presents Oz as a dream that takes place in a concussed Dorothy's mind), but the literary Oz has some semblance of order and symmetry to it. The country is divided by color and direction, with the yellow-clad Winkies in the west, the red-clad Quadlings in the south, the blue-clad Munchkins in the east, and of course the green inhabitants of the Emerald City.Apologies if this review has ended up more like a comparison piece between the film and the book, but having been brought up with fond memories of the film, and approaching the book for the first time in adulthood, it was rather inevitable that the two would be held up against one another. In any case, reading the original story served to convince me that both the book and the film are necessary to appreciate each one, and any childhood would be all the richer for having been exposed to both!"},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"you have got to read this book i love it absolutly loveit it is great trust me you would love it you have just got to read it most people dont really think about reading this book its all about Harry Potter dont get me wrong i like harry potter but everyone knows about them nobody knows about this book that is why im posting it on the internet so please please reade it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THanks by"},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"DOROTHY AND HER DOG TOTO GET CAUGHT IN A CYCLONE AND IT CARRIES THEM TO OZ!OZ IS A PLACE WHERE ANYTING CAN HAPPEN,ALMOST EVERYTHING DOES.I'M SURE WHOEVER READS THIS BOOK WILL ENJOY IT LIKE I DID."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I did not grow up with the Oz books.

But in this ORIGINAL story it talks a lot about DEATH, and there are some VIOLENT and SCARY scenes that I am GLAD that MGM either ommited or just didn't put in. Especially since most of those scenes involve my dear Tin Woodman.

Generally, I find the book version to be superior to the movie, so, given how much I love the movie version of this story, it was with great anticipation that I finally got around to reading it. Unfortunately, this is one of those rare occasions in which the movie is vastly superior to the book. The book is written in a style not too different from the fairie tales of Hans Christian Anderson (definitely more his than the Brothers Grimm); that is to say, it's very straightforward, with little or nothing in the way of style to embellish the basic story. The dialogue is bland, the plot without nuance or embellishment, the characters only a little better than wooden and one-dimensional. Which is okay for a book that is intended purely as a children's story, but given the humor, nuance, and characterization found in the movie which was based on this story, I'd expected more; I'd expected it to be one of those \\"children's stories\\" that was still entertaining to an adult.

The book has a bunch of different and wierd parts that the movie didn't have.After awhile dorothy get annoying when see keeps complaining that see wants to go home and she seems not to care about anyone exept for her dog toto.To any child or,parent looking for a book for a child, this book is for you. But to the teenagers and adults that don't enjoy children's books, this book isn't for you. It may seem that i've been harsh on the book but there is some good parts too. Its also a classic so it wouldn't hurt to read this book."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Someone pointed out a movie reviewer who has succinct entertaining reviews, via livejournal, and the one for this story went something like this:-Girl stars adventure with a killing, gets three friends, and goes off to kill some more.

Dorothy gets whisked away into a strange land where most of it is pleasant, but the other half of this strange land is dark and creepy. Dorothy must follow the Yellow Brick Road to get to the City of Emeralds to ask the great and powerful Wizard of Oz to help her get back to Kansas. On the way she meets three new friends who come with her to Oz in need of something. The Scarecrow wants some brains, the Tin Woodman wants a heart, and the Cowardly Lion wants some courage. They travel a long way and meet many dangers including the Kalidahs, the Deadly Poppy Field, the Wicked Witch of the West's Castle, and the Hammerheads. But they find ways to get across these obstacles. Their wishes get granted; in a funny way that is. Dorothy doesn't get her wish granted by the Wizard, Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, grants her wish with Dorothy's silver shoes.

America has, unfortunately, produced fewer true &quot;fairy tales&quot; than Europe. And though Americans could enjoy the old stories, simple and universal as they are, we needed new ones with the distinctive qualities of our land. &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, American tall tales, and the comic book creations of the 1950s and 60s are what we have produced to fill the gap. When I first read this book at 7 years old, I was disappointed it was so different from the movie, which I loved then, but as I've grown older I've found the book to be superior, because it depicts Oz as less of a benign candyland. Despite this the book (and its sequels even more so) is seriously flawed. These are flaws of imagination: like the works of Roal Dahl many of the people who read the Oz books see them as unbridedly imaginative. They arent. C.S. Lewis built a cousin-world to Oz with much more imagination and style in his far better Narnia books. Read them instead."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This is an edition of The Wizard of Oz with two long critical essays by the editor.

Somebody must have forgotten to tell that to Frank L. Baum! With The Wizard of Oz, Baum single-handedly challenges the greatest works of British fantasy without blinking.At first glance, one can see the influence of Lewis Carroll's masterpiece, Alice in Wonderland, on The Wizard of Oz. But what separates The Wizard of Oz from all other fairy tales before this time, is that this fairy tale is uniquely American both in mood and setting. The characters in The Wizard of Oz are as enchanting as anything the Grimms wrote about. There's Dorothy, Toto the dog, The Scarecrow who wants a brain, the Tin Man without a heart, The Cowardly Lion, the Wicked Witch of the West, and of course, The Mighty Wizard of Oz who rules Emerald City.When the story begins, a fierce cyclone descends on Dorothy's house in rural Kansas and transports her to the magical Land of Oz. No sooner than she arrives in Oz, Dorothy discovers that her house has fallen on and killed The Wicked Witch of the East. By so doing, Dorothy has freed the people of Oz from the tyranny of one of two evil witches. Even so, Dorothy wants to return to Kansas and is instructed by The Good Witch of the North that only the Wonderful Wizard of Oz can send her home. Thus, Dorothy embarks on the Yellow Brick road to seek the wizard and along the way encounters many strange and wonderful creatures. Little does she know that her quest is ill-fated, for an unexpected surprise awaits her at journey's end.What truly distinguishes The Wizard of Oz from preexisting fairy tales, is that Baum intentionally sought to create a contemporary American fairy tale that discarded all of the terrifying and gruesome aspects of the fairy tales of European tradition. Baum succeeded beyond his wildest imaginations and created an unforgettable classic that went on to spawn a number of popular sequels.Anyone who loves traditional fairy tales and hasn't yet read this book should grab themselves a copy of The Wizard of Oz. A wonderful tale of enchantment and excitement awaits. All you have to do is to follow Dorothy on her magical adventure and travel the Yellow Brick Road!"},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The Oz books were a huge part of my childhood. I never really got into other series that other kids my age liked: Hardy Boys, Box Car Children, Encyclopedia Brown. For some reason, I always preferred the more fantastic stories, which probably heavily influenced my later choices in fantasy and science fiction.My wife never read the Oz books, and so I talked her into reading them with me. We have no children, but we both still enjoy children's books, and have a collection that we look forward to one day sharing with our children. \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" tops that list, for both of us now, with a few caveats.It is obvious on reading the books that they are from a different world and a different time. I'm not talking about some fictional land somewhere over the rainbow; I'm talking about a time when children were not supposed to be protected from any nastiness or unpleasantness. Anyone who has read the original versions of Grimm's Fairy Tales knows what I'm talking about: beheadings, wars, violence, betrayal, abuse, etc. Some of these are found without apology in the land of Oz, which may shock people whose only other introduction to the world was through Judy Garland. The Tin Woodman is constantly chopping the head off of something, (to protect Dorothy, of course), not to mention the Scarecrow breaking the necks several dozen nefarious crows. Many other differences from the musical are discovered when reading the books: The Cowardly Lion isn't really cowardly, the Tin Woodman has always had a heart, and the Scarecrow is without a doubt the cleverest one in the bunch. I've never understood why the movie ignored these facts, or why the MGM's wizard didn't do as the great Oz in the books, and just give the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Lion exactly what they asked for: brains, a heart, and courage. This is to say nothing of the annoying fact the \\"Good Witch\\" in the movie knew the whole entire time Dorothy could have gone home whenever she wanted.People who feel children should be protected and shielded at all cost to the \\"uglier\\" side of make-believe would do well to stay away from Oz. But individuals who feel a little fantasy, a little humour, and a small pinch of moral make for a fun story enjoyable by kids of all ages should enjoy Oz."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The Wizard of Oz is a story about a girl named Dorothy. She lives in Kansas where there are lots of tornados. She also has a dog named Toto who lives on a farm with her and her Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and the workers that help Aunt Em and Uncle Henry on the farm. The next-door neighbor hates Toto because he gets in her crops and chases her ugly cat. She comes out with a rake and tries to catch Toto and poke him with the rake.Dorothy loves to sing and is always doing something she's not supposed to do. Dorothy also goes places that are completely unknown to her. Toto is black and very small. She spends most of the time with Toto because she doesn't have any friends in Kansas.I relate to Dorothy because she's very outgoing and is always in mischief just like me. Dorothy is a neat person and I really want to meet someone like her some day.Dorothy is a very normal person and she isn't very wild like some characters in books. I like that. I like normal, not weird and not wild."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I know there are many people who are in love with the movie and don't get me wrong, it's an amazing script. I have personal attatchments with it because I played the wicked witch of the west in a school production of the musical and I am very partial to the her character. The witch in the book is no where near as interesting as the movie. However, I love some of the extra twists in the book that the movie doesn't include. Such as: the green tinted specticals that Dorothy and her friends have to put on in entering Oz, the queen of the mice, the winged monkeys' story, and Dorothy's experiances in the witch's castle. I also think that this book has its limitations. The charqacters are mostly rather shallow and the writing is simple, in the way that most books for young children are. Instead the authers spends his time writing histories for most of the characters, even the winged monkeys, and adding creative twists. Did you know that the ruby slippers were really silver?I would say that this is definately a children's book but that if you're a big fan of the movie, it's worth reading. If you were ever in the musical, it's a lot of fun to look up the background of even small parts like aunt Em and discover things about her that you didn't know before."},{"Title":"Messengers: After-Death Appearances of Saints and Mystics","review":"This is one of my favorite books on the subject of &quot;after death&quot; realities.

Patricia's story telling is as honest, clear, and forthright as any one could get. She does not seem to have an agenda or purpose other than to be transparent in her reporting. There are 350 pages broken into 27 chapters, an epilogue, and an index of saints and mystics.

I also like the fact that developmental anatomy (fetal development) is separate, so you can only go to that if you're interested. Lot's of cadaver pics, which are very important in showing that real bodes are not coveniently neon and coordinated colors.BTW, the other two books mentioned are also good.

My real frustration was due to the fact that I feel the publisher should have supplied a carrying case specifically designed to carry such a large, awkward book. I realize that the size contributed to larger pictures but I feel it was a bit overboard! Finally, as I mentioned before, a new edition came out very recently. The new book resembles the previous edition too much. It's unfortunate we live in such a capitalistic society as to allow such a situation to take place.."},{"Title":"Jephte's Daughter (Readers Guide Editions)","review":"I never read Ragen before. She's a good writer and has a good grasp of Jewish women, but she didn't sustain the story. For the first two-thirds of the novel, I couldn't do anything but read. Whether Ragen got bad editorial advice, or just ran out of premise, she opts for a storybook ending that is so preposterous, it is laughable. It is also insulting to Christians. If a Christian novelist described Jewish belief in the same shallow way she describes Christian belief, they'd be stoned. Despite this. It's worth the time spent because it is a promise of better things in newer Ragen efforts. I'm hopeful. I made my sister read it and she agrees. We're both waiting to read Hannah Mendes. I hope we won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Jephte's Daughter (Readers Guide Editions)","review":"Jephte's Daughter is the story of Batsheva Ha-Levi, the last surviving descendant of a Hassidic dynasty nearly wiped out in the Holocaust. A dutiful Orthodox Jewish daughter, she marries the man her father chooses for her--a renowned scholar--and moves off to Jerusalem to begin a life with him with nothing but youthful and vague romantic notions and her deep Jewish faith to guide her. In the disastrous marriage that follows, both fail her for a time, but ultimately her faith sustains her and gives her the courage to save herself and her son, and while she outgrows youthful romantic ideals, she ultimately finds love in the end.If I had bought Jephte's Daughter in the new edition, packaged as women's literary fiction in trade size with an abstract design on the cover, I probably would have been as disappointed as many of the readers reviewing it here were. Yes, the storyline is often silly and unbelievable. Some of the supporting characters and dialogue are almost unbearably cheesy.But I read the original paperback version of the book, published in 1989. The mass market paperback features an exotic Jerusalem backdrop and a beautiful long haired woman in the foreground, gazing out with longing and determination, and the cover art and packaging show the books true origins: not an Oprah-style literary novel, but a romantic saga of the kind that was so popular in the 1980s, of the Belva Plain/Judith Krantz variety. Judged as a product of the 1980s women's fiction market and not that of the 2000s, Jephte's Daughter actually succeeds pretty well, meeting the conventions of those stories (fabulous wealth, family history, bad experiences with men before the right one emerges, a strong central female character) but departing from them into the interesting setting of the Orthodox Jewish world.The parts of the book showing Batsheva's upbringing and life in Jerusalem are the best parts of the book. Ragen's love for the rituals and the learning that suffuse traditional Jewish life is evident in the details that she pours into this part of the book. Batsheva's husband and mother in law are cartoonish bad guys, but underneath the soap opera melodrama are real issues, as Orthodox women in Israel sometimes do find themselves trapped by tradition and mores in disastrous marriages with abusive husbands who refuse to give them divorces.The book weakens when it leaves this setting, and the section set in England is cringeworthy in its depiction of goyish male lust and snobbish anti-semitism. Some of the dialogue is simply laughable. And the man who ultimately turns out to be Batsheva's true love is unbelievably perfect. But the story was suspenseful enough to keep me turning pages quickly, even if I did wince at some of the worst dialogue and skim over the purplest prose.I can't wholeheartedly recommend the book, but I know that the author, Naomi Ragen, has continued to write books set in the world of Orthodox Jewry which is a setting that fascinates me, and I know that her recent books have been fairly well received, so I would definitely read more of her work. Taken as a dated 1980s novel and a first novel at that, it's not horrible, but it probably should have been left back in the 1980s rather than dusted off and repackaged for current day release."},{"Title":"Jephte's Daughter (Readers Guide Editions)","review":"This is a made-for-TV movie in book form. It is so sloppy in its writing and editing that I almost wished for commercial breaks. The basic premise that this family would allow a free-thinking non-Jewish tutor into their home to work with their impressionable young daughter is so absurd as to be laughable. About 50 times you get to read about the main character's long legs and slim waist. She has no education but is accepted (embraced!) by intellectual cirles in London. She has no training but becomes an instant success as a photographer. One character fondly remembers his mother, except we were previously told she died when she gave birth to him. Events described don't add up in terms of a time line -- one character born in 1894 has a daughter who is a professor in Germany before the war -- so she was born when her father was 10? Jews are described in the most humiliating terms -- the Orthodox are continuously sweating and wiping their brows. This simplistic novel was a major disappointment."},{"Title":"Jephte's Daughter (Readers Guide Editions)","review":"I thought that this was a good book, interesting & engaging to read. However, I have to [say] that the storyline was not very believable. I found it strange that this very well educated & religious girl all of a sudden \\"forgets\\" that a married orthodox woman can't walk all over Jerusalem wearing pants, and with her hair uncovered. Most of non-Jewish women know that, but she didn't? And then a father that absolutely adored her up to the point she got married,all of a sudden decides that he won't help his only child? And a Christian would-be priest that \\"conviniently\\" discovers a Jewish mother seems a little too much, at least to me. Although I still enjoyed reading this book, in my opinion it wasn't as good as \\"Sotah\\", and \\"Sacrifice of Tamar\\" both of which I found absolutely amazing."},{"Title":"Jephte's Daughter (Readers Guide Editions)","review":"I agree with another reviewer here about how the storyline andcharacters for this novel are just utterly preposterous! If theprotagonist of the novel really was an ultra-Orthodox Jew, nothingthat was expected of her after marriage would have been a surprise.The husband is originally portrayed as a sympathetic character but almost immediately becomes a caricature. He starts beating his wife and torturing her. Her parents don't give a hoot when she calls them to tell them that her husband is abusing her. Supposedly their lives revolved around her before she married. All of a sudden, they stopped caring. Real people just aren't like that.While the writing style was engaging, I finished this book merely for the entertainment value. The plot twists were so outrageous that they were quite amusing."},{"Title":"Jephte's Daughter (Readers Guide Editions)","review":"This is the 3rd book I've read by Naomi Ragen so I was more familiar with the ultra orthodox communities her characters belong too. I got into the story more this time because I wasn't so focused on trying to understand their bizarre world. I have to say this book was JUICY and kept me interested. Especially the end was a real page turner. It had a soap opera quality to it with the rich father and all the honor and expectations the family had, plus you had the evil husband and mother in-law. Jephte has big balls and you really root for her. She's a spoiled princess who's still innocent and kind with a self preservation about herself you can't deny. Interesting reading for sure, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Jephte's Daughter (Readers Guide Editions)","review":"It is difficult to categorize this seductive first novelistic offering by Naomi Ragen.Somewhat sheephishly, this middle-aged, white, male reviewer confesses its tones of over-written girly pop, an aspect that explains its being laid aside half-read for six months before it jumped back into my suitcase and lured me into a hungry, late-night series of readings to finish it. This element of Jephte's Daughter is most charitably explained as the work of an immature but promising novelist.Then there is the tendency towards caricature, a trait placed in service of an almost Wellhausian disdain for ritual. This leveling of complex religious reality is used against both Jewish and Gentile denizens of Ragen's pages: for example, the preternaturally hateful Hassidic first husband of Ragen's heroine (Isaac ben Harshen) and the erstwhile Roman Catholic noviate who eventually gets the girl (the promisingly named David Hope). The key virtue of the latter protagonist is that he escapes all that churchly stuff that had him tied in knots.Caricature also appears in the clumsy reconversion of David Hope from the Church's bosom to the heretofore secret Jewish identity of his deceased mother, though this may merely be the quibble of a Gentile and Christian reader who must acknowledge that stories of conversion that run in the opposite direction are rarely handled any better.She has cast her academics in almost universally unfeeling and villainous form and located them in all the right places, Cambridge chief among them. I suppose it provides a convenient place for that.Finally, there is the unblinking romanticism of the book, whereby the appeal of strong feeling and its culmination in the girl getting the guy--and vice versa--are granted a self-authenticating absoluteness without the need for further discussion.So, if Ragen has written these several books within the cover of just one, how is that that this reviewer in the end finds himself strangely moved by the book and eager to move on now to the more mature Naomi Ragen?'Difficult to say. I think the young novelist touched a vein. She has taken the measure of religious bigotry in several of its guises and offered something that seems compelling and real in its place, even if one wonders how the dazzling Batsheva and her David got along after the rains returned to Jerusalem and the drains clogged from time to time.She has in the end told a good story, not with the character development of an accomplished novelist, but with enough justice that a chain of improbable sequences actually comes together as remotely plausible and--mirabile dictu--rather gripping.One actually lays the book down feeling rather fond of Bathsheva and David, shaken by their odyssey, and wishing them well.Only a novelist on the way to accomplishing her potential could have pulled that off for this grumpy old man. So let's give credit where it's due."},{"Title":"Jephte's Daughter (Readers Guide Editions)","review":"As a Hassidic woman myself, I found this book to be far fetched and unrealistic. The storyline was actually humorous because it is so far from the realities that take place in our community. When you read this book, realize that Naomi Ragen is biased (perhaps because of a negative experience) and not giving an accurate depiction or correct portrayal of the Hassidic society."},{"Title":"Jephte's Daughter (Readers Guide Editions)","review":"a friend lent me this book, i picked it up ad couldnt put it doen i was up the whole night reading its worth every penny i have read it so many times over its such a special book. i must therefore strongly disagree with the last two reviews. yes indeed some of the story may be almost impossible to understand, how can parents not listen to such a cry for help? how can a man change so suddenly or be so cruel? how can she not realise such basic things he duties? naomi ragen has given us the answer unfortunately the world is not sugar coated and no one is perfect. i think she made her characters all seem very understandable, the parents, - their expectations made them overlook the situation some people live in denial its their way its sad, it seems unrealsitic but it unfortunately does happen - ms ragen is simply opening our eyes to this. as for the husband - it is a common known fact that what is on the outside is not always on the inside from the start ragen introduced the character as somewhat ignorant to what a woman is and this is why he became what he was. the sages say that the lust for honour will bring a persons downfall is this not demonstrated so carefully by the author? finally Batsheva shows naivety yet she acts with such courage and wisdom, she made her mistakes - she was 18!...im sorry to have been so defensive and critical of the two previous editorials but this is my favourite book, it taught me alot about people and alot about the world and that naivety wont get anyone anywhere. its sad but true things like this do happen and people dont always deal with it the way you expect them or want them to.congratulations on this book - it was truely an absolutely fantastic work. i highly highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"Jephte's Daughter (Readers Guide Editions)","review":"This was a story I couldn't put down until I finished.

Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed. The fact that I felt sympathy for the books 'bad guy' (Bat Sheva's husband) but none for the heroine would easily indicate how bad the book is.Being Ragen's first book, I can accept less than perfect writing. My problem here was the plot consistency (or rather - lack of). On one hand, before marrying, Bat Sheva is described as this ultra orthodox, chaste girl who goes to a private, orthodox Jewish private school, only wears modest dresses, and is proud of her heritage. But all that heritage is quickly forgotten once she gets married. The strict dressing code (no pants for women, hair covered for married women) and food code (strict kosher rules), etc. - are suddenly all forgotten in Bat sheva's quest for happiness, simply because it's her new husband who represents them, and he, in turn, represents 'evil'. Even though the interpertation of religious laws can vastly differ between sects and groups within Judaism, I'd expect someone like Bat Sheva to comply with the basics, but she doesn't. She also doesn't try and understand her husband's &amp; mother in law's point of view, but expects everyone to understand her 'tragic' stance of the misunderstood newcomer."},{"Title":"Jephte's Daughter (Readers Guide Editions)","review":"Compelling story within the Orthodox Jewish Community and the struggle to find one's place within."},{"Title":"Jephte's Daughter (Readers Guide Editions)","review":"This was the fourth book I've read by Naomi Ragen. Initially I started reading them to gain some insight into the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, which may seem strange seeing that I am not a Jew nor do I practice Judaism. As a Gentile Christian, I have found that the beginnings of early Chrisitianity did face much of the same attitudes that are present in the ultra-Orthodox community.Aside from the religious angle, Naomi Ragen is a great story writer. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading each book, and heartedly recommend them."},{"Title":"Jephte's Daughter (Readers Guide Editions)","review":"For me, \\"Jephte's Daughter\\" is one of those books that I enjoyed reading, plot flaws and all. It concerns Batsheva, a young Orthodox Jewish girl who has been brought up in the lap of luxury in California. She's well educated and has been introduced to the outside world of non-Orthodox books and ideas by her tutor. Her world changes suddenly and irrevocably when her father arranges her marriage to a Hassidic boy of good lineage in Jerusalem. It turns out that Batsheva's father is the heir to a major Hassidic dynasty who renounced his own responsibilities by promising his daughter's hand in marriage to solidify alliances in the next generation. In other words, like Jephte in the Bible, he's sacrificed his daughter's future to meet his needs in the present. Batsheva tries to adjust, but finds herself locked in a marriage that becomes increasingly stifling and repellent. Her husband (& his mother's) brand of Ultraorthodoxy is far more restrictive than what she is used to. When her husband becomes abusive, she escapes to London with their young son and begins a new life. She gains success as a photographer and, eventually, falls in love with one of the least suitable men imaginable.A number of the previous reviewers have complained about elements of the plot that strain credulity. They're there, all right, and the fairy-tale ending is probably the biggest credulity strainer of them all. But I was able to suspend my disbelief enough to enjoy the book anyway. Ragen may not be a great writer , but she's better than many bestselling romance novelists. Her writing is highly readable, her characters are lively, and her settings are provide insight into what, for many people, is an exotic way of life. Ragen also has some major points to make with her story. The same themes run through \\"Jephte's Daughter\\" as through Ragen's later books--namely the enduring importance of Jewish tradition, the need to balance the past with modernity and the Law with compassion, and the position of women within Judaism. \\"Jephte's Daughter\\" is by no means a literary masterpiece, but neither is it complete trash."},{"Title":"Jephte's Daughter (Readers Guide Editions)","review":"This novel touched me with the exploration of a young woman's spirituality and innocence"},{"Title":"Jephte's Daughter (Readers Guide Editions)","review":"I bought her latest book called \\"Women Minyan\\" I totally loved it I was not depointed.I picked up this novel and once again I was not disapponted either.

At first she is portrayed as this ultra orthodox girl, but when she gets married she doesn't realize that she has to COMPLETELY cover her hair and wear skirts? Even I, as an unorthodox Jew know that much.... I don't think that a truely orthodox girl would put herself in certain situations the way Bat Sheva did - like going to an unkosher restaurant. And even though there is a little sympathy for her husband at first, after that he is portrayed as a &quot;monster&quot;, even though he had to face a wife that had values so different than he was raised to expect, and he just didn't know how to deal with her, and get her to understand the values he believed in. Doesn't he deserve some understanding for that?"},{"Title":"Jephte's Daughter (Readers Guide Editions)","review":"Jepthe's Daughter reveals much about a closed society.

The setting is the world of Orthodox Jews (which was fascinating to read about because it is such a closed society) but the narration style and the plot twists felt very 80's and loaded with cliches, cartoonist characters, and unbelievable \\"fixes\\" by the author.Also, the book dragged at the beginning, and the middle was not exactly a page-turner either.I think there were a few interesting ideas in this book, but I had issues with the heroine and the villain and didn't buy the Mr. Perfect solution at the end. I couldn't understand why the heroine (mother of a small child) feels she must immediately start dating when she's on the run. This didn't ring true to me at all, especially since she was an abused wife running away from her evil husband, not to mention her tendency to jump into cars at night with the most disgusting suitors. She was said to be smart but her behavior showed otherwise. Also, I couldn't understand why the author had to add insult to injury by making the husband a wife beater on top of everything else. He was awful to begin with. Why turn him into a cartoonish figure? I think the story suffered for this. Another thing that bothered me about the story was the author's \\"fixes\\". I had a hard time suspending my disbelief when the heroine uses her passport and is not found by her billionaire father. There were many similar problems with this book. Lastly, I felt that the whole story lost its hold on reality and took an eye-rolling turn into a fairytale when the \\"good guy\\" is introduced and up to the very end of the book.All in all, an easy read for the subway--but definitely not a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Jephte's Daughter (Readers Guide Editions)","review":"I bought this book on a whim while in Israel, having forgot to pack anything to read on my vacation. Pluses: Ragen knows how to keep the plot moving, and the book provides some insight into the world of the ultra-orthodox. Minuses: Awkward, occasionally excrutiating writing, huge plot holes, and ridiculous (yet utterly predictable and telegraphed) plot twists. How huge are the holes? E.g., at some point the heroine decides to fake a suicide-murder of herself and her son. No bodies, of course, are ever found, but her extremely wealth father never bothers to look into things further. How do I know? Because the heroine winds up in England, assumedly using her own passport! How did she get to England without anyone realizing that the wealthy heiress of a great rabinnic dynasty traveled abroad on her (and her son's passport). Geez, all they had to do was check the airline manifest, or with immigration control. Basically, if you read this book and you are halfway intelligent, you will feel cheated. The good news is that if Ms. Ragen was able to develop into a respected, famous novelist, there is help for us all."},{"Title":"Jephte's Daughter (Readers Guide Editions)","review":"I found this fiction both enlightening and startling.

What I know, for I have heard Naomi Ragen speak, is that this is a true story. \\"Batsheva\\" was a real person, who really did live this life (obviously this is a fictionalized account). This scenario is played out hundreds of times a day in the Ultraorthodox community both here and in Israel. Most women do not escape. In this so-called religious community, child abuse and spousal abuse are epidemic. It is all kept very quiet,and handled very quietly by religious and community leaders. This is a very closed society, where everyone is pressured to conform at all costs, and where everyone knows how to keep a secret. The real \\"Batsheva\\" did not escape, as the book suggests. The real \\"Batsheva\\" committed suicide.I do not really care that this is not great literature. I can read Dickens for that. I do care about this story.

As the senior editor of the Economist magazine, her analyses of world markets not just from an economics perspective, but from cultural, emotional and societal viewpoints is breathtaking. Distance will become irrelvant, she argues and it won't be long before people across the globe will organize their work on the basis of language and three time shifts - one for the Americas, one for Europe and one for East Asia and Australia. She discusses the implications of workers able to earn a living from anywhere and countries finding themselves competing for citizens as people relocate for reasons ranging from lower taxes to nicer weather. Cairncross discusses about 30 major changes likely to result from the technology-driven revolution including a shifting landscape in terms of freedom, privacy and intellectual property, the changing role of government and the implications for the concept of the nation state, citizenship, regulation and laws in a world without borders, in a world where distance is irrelvant."},{"Title":"The Death of Distance: How the Communications Revolution Is Changing our Lives","review":"In this updated paperback edition of the 1997 original, Frances Cairncross of The Economist expounds the theory that, with the introduction of the Internet and new communications technologies, distance as a relevant factor in how we conduct our business and personal lives is becoming irrelevant. This, she claims, will be the single most important economic force shaping all of society over the next half century.This revised version covers more topics than the original. It explores the rise and fall of the dot-com phenomenon, the spread of mobile telephones, the wave of hi-tech mergers, the lasting power of the new economy, trends in e-commerce, organizational restructuring to adapt to the Internet, the impact of patent law as it pertains to communications, and the democratizing effects of communications technology on worldwide societies as a whole.Francis Cairncross writes eloquently and convincingly about the cataclysmic changes sweeping through our means of communication. She discusses how the consequences of such changes will tilt the balance between large and small, rich and poor, as they influence where companies locate, what kind of work people do, how governments raise revenue, which businesses succeed etc.Amongst the most striking trends, she sees citizens with a greater freedom to locate anywhere, thus leaving governments to reduce tax burdens in an attempt to attract higher income-earners. She sees, too, the continuing rise of English as a global language in business and commerce. She foretells, too, of new opportunities and challenges we will face in a wireless world.I disagree with those who claim that, just because we have the ability to do something, doesn't mean we will do it and change society. If people don't want mobile phones, why do they buy them? If people don't like the Internet, why do they use it? My own experience (Brit living in France, working in various European countries, employed by an American company) tells its own story. Twenty years ago, my situation would have been considered almost unique. Today it is commonplace. AND YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHIN' YET !"},{"Title":"The Death of Distance: How the Communications Revolution Is Changing our Lives","review":"This book paints a bright, sunny picture of the Utopia that will be created by the spread of communications technology such as the Internet. Work will become more fun, governments will be forced to cut taxes, people will talk to each other more, and world peace and prosperity will soon follow. I don't buy it; the analysis is far too one-sided, and, while there will doubtless be benefits of increased communication, there will also be downsides (though it's probably impossible to say what they'll turn out to be) and it won't fix all the world's problems, as Cairncross seems to think."},{"Title":"The Death of Distance: How the Communications Revolution Is Changing our Lives","review":"This is an easy-to-read, interesting book for business people and others who want to know how the Interactive Age will change the world. Francis Cairncross, who writes in The Economist for people who think, has studied and thought a great deal, and it shows. Cairncross says that the improvements now being developed in telephony, television and the Internet will touch every single life within a few years. Fundamental changes in how we learn, get food, deal with friends, enemies and lovers, make money and pay for goods are definitely in the works. And that distance will no longer dictate how we communicate. This is not fantasy, this is the right stuff. Anyone who expects to be around longer than a very few years had better listen up."},{"Title":"The Death of Distance: How the Communications Revolution Is Changing our Lives","review":"Unlike the reader from Canada, I believe that Ms. Cairncross' assertion that distance is dying is quite accurate. The Internet, and particularly the Web, removes physical distance and allows people to communicate with each other in a way that is completely independent of where they live. It does not, however, remove cultural, emotional, intellectual, or spiritual distance. For this reason the advance of modern communications methods will never result in the homogeneous society many seem to fear. Our individualism will remain intact but our exposure to the world around us will continue to increase exponentially (both to our benefit and detriment). Ms. Cairncross has accurately grasped the true impact of the Internet and those who are able to leverage this impact will be the ones who guide the future of the medium."},{"Title":"The Death of Distance: How the Communications Revolution Is Changing our Lives","review":"I recently read this brilliant book before reading Cairncross' more recently published The Company of the Future. I highly recommend both and suggest that they be read in the order in which they were written.In this volume (first published in 1997), Cairncross carefully organizes her material within ten chapters following a Preface in which she observes: \\"The new ideas in this book are about the many ways in which the most significant technological changes of our time will affect the next century -- and your life. You will find a preview of the most important in 'The Trendspotter's Guide to New Communications' that immediately follows this preface; the rest of the book sets out to interpret and elaborate these key points.\\" in which she identifies and then briefly discusses \\"Ten Rules for Survival.\\" I have a minor quibble with the title because I think that technological changes to which Cairncross refers have not caused the death of distance; rather, they have re-defined it.With regard to the aforementioned important developments, Cairncross identifies and then briefly discusses 30 which range from \\"The Death of Distance\\" to \\"Global Peace.\\" All are valid even as some readers may believe that others should be added to the list or replace some of those included. There are several in which I have special interest, including #27, \\"Communities of Culture.\\" Cairncross suggests that \\"electronic communications will reinforce less widespread languages and cultures. not replace them with Anglo-Saxon and Hollywood. The declining cost of creating and distributing many entertainment products and the corresponding increase in production capacity will also reinforce local cultures and help scattered peoples and families to preserve their cultural heritage.\\" Once again, many readers who agree on the importance of such trends may disagree with the implications which Cairncross derives from them. Fair enough.In the final chapter, \\"Government and the Nation State,\\" Cairncross duly acknowledges that being able to communicate may not be enough to keep the nations of the earth at peace with one another \\"but it is a start.\\" Thanks to new technologies now available or which will soon become available, people will become less susceptible to, indeed dependent on propaganda from politicians who seek to stir up conflicts. Cairncross concludes, \\"Bonded together by the invisible strands of global communications, humanity may find that peace and prosperity are fostered by the death of distance.\\" She held out that possibility in 1997. Whether or not it remains a reasonable possibility is for each reader to determine. As I compose this review, violence continues to erupt in the Middle East and elsewhere; extensive poverty worldwide persists and could become even worse. Death does indeed have many faces."},{"Title":"The Death of Distance: How the Communications Revolution Is Changing our Lives","review":"Ms. Cairncross has done an admirable job of reviewing the essential building blocks of the Communications Revolution.

Just because we have the ability to do something, doesn't mean everyone will do it and thus change society.A book like Winston's &quot;Media Technology &amp; Society&quot; highlights, with academic integrity, how SOCIETY drives technological change, not some group of engineers sitting round 'inventing stuff'. This is surely the first revolution dictated by commerce &amp; economics rather than actual social need. As Nasdaq stocks fluctuate wildly, the crash and burn of Iridium surely shows that market driven technology isn't as simple as these types of books make it sound.This book provides nothing new to the topic and as one reviewer previously noted, fails to come to grips with the true power of money."},{"Title":"The Death of Distance: How the Communications Revolution Is Changing our Lives","review":"Francis Cairncross's book The Death of Distance is the best of a series of new publications (and articles) insisting that the ongoing communication revolution will shape a borderless, McLuhanesque world in which the &quot;tyranny of geography&quot; disappears. It is, simply, the death of distance. Attractive as this utopia is, it won't happen. The history of both communications and transportation argues against this dream. Distance did not disappear with the rapidity of the telephone, the simultaneity of television, or the universality of radio. Planes, trains and automobiles have not made Europe--or North America--into amorphous places. Even with high speed transportation, where one lives is still important. Language and distinct cultures of location persist. Distance does not die because of telecommunication. Distinct geographies persist.I'm part of another, contrarian tradition. One articulated in, for example, The Message Is the Medium (1996: Praeger books). It sees the new technologies as evolutionary, extending changes which have been ongoing in communications and transportations for at least a century. From this perspective, Caincross' vision, while well read and well argued, is utopian and if attractive, unlikely to be realized.Tom Koch, author: The Message Is the Medium. 1996."},{"Title":"The Death of Distance: How the Communications Revolution Is Changing our Lives","review":"This kind of book is likely to lead the reader in wrong and simplistic insights of what is going on. Yet the beginning offers a relevant overview of the evolution of communications, that is, the Telephone, the Television and the Internet. Consequently man can quite well understand that these three medias will merge in the future and that information will really overwelhm the customer. Nevertheless Frances Cairncross loses her relevance as soon as she tries dramatically to convince the reader of an happy end, a &quot;global peace&quot;, where most people are freed from policy.

Well, no full-on theorizing in this book, neither the depth not the elegant style of (e.g.) Nick Negroponte or George P Landow... but if your favorite aunt is a moderately successful businesswoman who thinks computers _won't affect_ our culture &amp; society, I suggest you give her the book as a present. david skreiner"},{"Title":"The Death of Distance: How the Communications Revolution Is Changing our Lives","review":"This is an up-beat view about how technology will ultimately transform every aspect of life.

In \\"The Grail: From Celtic Myth to Christian Symbol,\\" Roger Loomis convincingly argues (as the title might suggest) that the idea of the Holy Grail has its roots not in apocryphal Christian eschatology but in the Celtic myths of the British Isles. From the knights of the round table to Indiana Jones to Heinrich Himmler and everyone in between, the Grail has been a much sought-after artifact. The only question is \\"what is it?\\"According to Loomis, the Holy Grail is not the cup from which Jesus drank at the Last Supper, but rather a mistranslation of the archaic compound word \\"sankgreal,\\" meaning \\"royal blood\\" rather than \\"holy grail.\\" This will sound familiar to anyone familiar with the novel \\"the Da Vinci Code,\\" but this is more or less where the similarities end. Loomis does not view the Grail as an essentially literal object and says that it refers to a mythical bloodline. He further objects to the characterization of the grail as a cup, showing that before it was identified as a chalice, it had previously been portrayed as a flat dish and even a rock (!). He says that myth of the Fisher King lay in Celtic mythology and that Christian symbolism was later attached to it when the Grail myth hit continental Europe from a French monk and scholar living in Wales. The concept of the grail as an ever-replenishing source of sustenance is based on another linguistic misinterpretation that has an archaic Welsh word for \\"cup\\" being mistranslated into French as \\"body,\\" as in the body of Christ (i.e. a communion wafer). Loomis illuminates a consistent series of parallels between the circumstances of Arthurian legend and Celtic myth and shows how overlapping stories in the former are based on archetypal forms from the latter.Why 4/5? While Loomis presents a compelling theory, it is complex and at times difficult to follow despite Loomis' effort to make his book as accessible as possible to the average reader. Likewise, there is a fair amount of redundancy in this book that might turn some people off. Finally, the theory is so complex and each part is so dependent on the assumption before it that if one aspect is successfully refuted, the whole theory would be in jeopardy. Still, it's a fine book that advances an intriguing hypothesis about one of Western Civilization's most enduring symbols and deserves a thorough examination."},{"Title":"Summer Afternoon and Other Stories: And Other Stories","review":"Bailey White's tales of life in South Georgia are at once haunting and humerous. You'll find yourself laughing one minute and deep in thought the next. If you've ever sat spellbound in your car in the driveway listening to her commentaries on NPR at the end of your drive home, you'll enjoy this boxed set.My personal favorite is the forboding tale of the Titanic as told by White's frind Mrs. Bierce. The tale of a young woman's journey accross the sea as a young school girl. During her trip, she is summoned to the bridge of the ship by the captain late one night. The captain points out to her the Titanic passing quietly in the night. The tale of the two passing ships mirror Mrs. Bierce's later tumultuous experience in marriage.Some of Bailey Whites more humerous stories revolve around her experiences as a first grade teacher and what she goes through to get ther children to learn how to read. Any one who has dealt with a fickle first grader can relate to her."},{"Title":"An American Haunting: The Bell Witch","review":"I have only done minimal research on the Bell Witch or \\"Old Kate\\" so I really cannot vouch for the accuracy of this novel. True the introduction implies that this book is from a long lost document, a first hand account written by Richard Powell, for those of you who are familiar with the tale of the Bell Witch, Richard Powell was the school master who eventually married Betsy Bell. Betsy was the Bell Daughter who was most violently attacked by the witch.Though many of the accounts in this book mirror those that have been documented, there appears to be some creative license taken. So go into this book viewing as an interesting story BASED on events that may have happened. Some of the events that have not been verified but that occur in this book are the presence of Andrew Jackson and the rather questionable ending. Still this was a very interesting read, and I'm glad I finally sat down and committed to it. I have not seen the movie made from this book, but have been told it is a descent film.For those of you unfamiliar with the Bell witch tale, it takes place in Tennessee during the settlements. The Bell family found themselves in a financial dispute with Kate Batts, an eccentric neighbor who then proceeded to curse them in public. Soon after the curse, strange events began happening, first starting with noises then as the supernatural occurrence gained strength it began attacking Betsy Bell, the youngest of the daughters. As the poltergeist activity heightened, the towns people were brought in, many who witnessed events and even spoke with the \\"witch\\" which they referred to as \\"Old Kate\\" after the woman who they assumed had conjured the demon. The ghost or witch could at times be friendly and helpful and at other times deceitful and dangerous.The idea of using the teacher as the voice was a good choice because he was not a part of the family, so he was not privy to all of the ghost's deeds, but since both his home and the schoolhouse were on the Bell's property, he was present for much of the drama, and witnessed many of the events. Add into this the fact that although she was much younger than he - he was in love with Betsy Bell. This gave him a level of concern beyond that of curious neighbor.The voice of the book felt genuine, and as a reader, you do feel genuine concern for those involved. And at times you can't help but be enamored by Old Kate with her devilish attitudes and whimsical nature. I felt this was actually a more well written novel than \\"Amityville Horror\\" which was also supposed to be a \\"true\\" account of a haunting. This one was a far more enjoyable read and was extremely interesting. Though I'm not a believer or dis-believer in the Bell Witch or any other supernatural phenomenon, I would not hold this book up as accurate. Entertaining - yes, enlightening - no. Either way, it was fun to read."},{"Title":"An American Haunting: The Bell Witch","review":"I grew up near the Bell Witch area and was quite familiar with the story; when I learned that an authenticated account previously unpublished was available, of course I got it. This account tallies with the hundreds of eye-witness events, and has a stunning ending.Remember that this book was written in the early 1800's and will have the style of the day; also, the writer was not writing a fictional account for amusement--he was writing FACT. To my mind, it's an excellent read, and fascinating because, frankly, if it's not true, then literally hundreds of people were wrong. A must read for all students of the unknown!"},{"Title":"An American Haunting: The Bell Witch","review":"I want to visit and see how things were.

Determined to make sense of the haunting, Powell eventually learns the ugly truth from his own wife."},{"Title":"An American Haunting: The Bell Witch","review":"I thought this book was boring! It took me nearly a month to read it. It wasn't scary at all. If I'm reading a book about a haunting I want to be up all night!"},{"Title":"An American Haunting: The Bell Witch","review":"If you are a true ghost story and supernatural reader you will really enjoy this true story about the Bell Witch written from an eye witness view point. Some history included which I really enjoyed."},{"Title":"An American Haunting: The Bell Witch","review":"I am a bit surprised that there are no more than three reviews for the paperback version of this book, thus far--I do believe it emerged in tandem with the rather lackluster screen adaptation starring Sutherland and Spacek. Thus, I would have imagined that this printing of the book would have prompted more response from Amazon customers. However, since the movie was really bad, it may be that viewers were not motivated to seek out the book upon which the film was based.If so, that's a shame, because the book itself is actually one of the more compelling and well-written ghost stories in recent years. It is not scary in an overtly superficial way. Rather, it is a deliciously disturbing novelization of the famous \\"Bell Witch\\" incident and that strain of American folklore attached to the so-called haunting. Here, the story is told from the perspective of the local schoolteacher, who carries a torch for young Elizabeth \\"Betsy\\" Bell (object of the invading spirit's wrath). The novelization of a tenuously \\"true\\" story is fraught with difficulties in principle, but the reader wouldn't know it, from this rendition. Monahan truly manages to conjure a gripping account told from the first-person standpoint of the narrator, almost (but not quite) in a journalistic sense. It reads like an \\"olde worlde\\" investigative piece, which makes for a page-turner and holds the interest with admirable ease. The result is gripping material in the best sense. Monahan's narrator paints a very vivid picture of a mysterious and complex supernatural entity that afflicts the household of John and Lucy Bell and their family, as well as their entire community of Red River. \\"Old Kate's Witch\\" (as the offending spirit is called) comes alive with significant literary verve due to the author's careful, convincing style and craftsmanship of just the right words and atmospheres needed to delineate a tale like this. The Bell Witch herself is the star of the book--part ingratiating imp, part malevolent demon. The dialogues carried on between the spirit and the other characters are spine-tinglingly realistic at times. The whole effort basically \\"rings true\\" because of the author's method. The story has a definite aura of veracity, here, and for this reason it is highly recommended to all fans of well-written horror or ghost-story material, or even to fans of 19th century Americana, Southern Gothic tales. Quite smart and sharp...just like the mercurial \\"Bell Witch\\" herself/itself."},{"Title":"An American Haunting: The Bell Witch","review":"i can not begin to describe the utter boredom experienced while reading this book. i can not fathom how anyone would consider something such as a ghost who carries on conversations and does tricks for the family it is supposedly haunting a horror story."},{"Title":"The Boy Across the River","review":"This is a fun story about a father and daughter who travel from Virginia to Mississippi.

Bill happened to be sitting right behind me near the back of the audience. I briefly spoke to him and found out that he was also an author like myself.

It identifies the theorists associated with various performance styles, and relates major events in the history of \\"performance art\\".The style is reminiscent of Russell's History of Western Philosophy.

It contains 6 pages on taxonomy, 13 pages on a taxonomic key to species, and 160 pages describing 38 species of Trilliums. Each species is fully described by common name, scientific name, key anatomy characteristic, flowering season, habitat, geographic distribution (including a map of distribution), varieties and forms.The third section contains extra species information, glossary, and index.

It provides extensive information on parks such as Yellowstone, Grand Canyon, Great Smoky Mountains, Olympic, Yosemite and Zion. Repanshek details the pros and cons of each park with candor with helpful comments about what to expect from the weather, wildlife and crowds.Each chapter focuses on a different park. Within each chapter, he covers such topics as: geology, attractions, directions, fees, safety precautions, hikes, ranger programs, lodging, dining options, and other essentials such as post offices, lost and founds, etc. He writes in the first person, and often makes amusing commentaries about his own experiences and expectations. He does a thorough job covering each park - one can sense from reading that not only has he personally visited these places, but that he has returned to each a number of times and writes with the experience that is so valuable to those on a limited time schedule. He acknowledges that while each park could be a vacation of its own, many people can only spend a day or two at each place. To accomodate such travelers, he includes a section in each chapter on what to do if you only have one day to explore the park. This can be an incredibly useful tool if you are on a tight time schedule.Frequently in travel guides, one gets the sense that the author is either an avid outdoorsman bent on roughing it, or a once-a-year vacationer who would rather die than sleep in a tent. Not so here - Repanshek clearly addresses both groups. He details all the available campsites in a park, along with his opinions on how clean/quiet/developed each site is; but also lists hotels and motels in the surrounding areas, ranging from the cheapest to the swankiest of lodgings. Same goes for the dining options. I personally appreciated this a great deal - my trip was primarily a camping excursion, but every once in a while we decided to splurge on decent hotels and were grateful for his frankness in describing what we could expect for our money.My only gripe with this book is that it only covers 15 parks. Of course, due to its level of detail, it would be difficult to cover more. My hope is that Kurt Repanshek considers putting together two or more separate guides, for the Eastern and Western National Parks. He has a great eye for detail and leaves no stones unturned in his comprehensive tour of the American parks. I highly recommend this guide!"},{"Title":"Clinical Reasoning: The Art and Science of Critical and Creative Thinking","review":"In this book, the authors present and explain outcome-present-state model, &quot;a third-generation nursing process model that emphasize reflection, outcome specification, and testing, given the client's story&quot;. Given the inevitable trends and growing emphasis on outcome measures in the health care industry, including the demand to document what nurses contribute to health care, there is a need for nurses to develop clinical reasoning skills. They can start by reading about the OPT model in this book. The authors applied the OPT model and its concepts to selected health care issues and needs of clients in different health care contexts. Every nurse who reads this book can relate to the use of the OPT model in a care context similar to his/her respective practice setting. This reader thoroughly enjoyed this book.

The authors often talk about home schooling for moral reasons, praying on the matter, and utilizing the church. This happened to be a GREAT surprise for me as a Catholic, and the information in this book has a lot more meaning to me than it might for some.Religion aside, this book sparks some great thoughts about \\"should I\\" for the reader. For example, considering that each child has a learning style (and might not do well in a home-schooled environment at all!), how to get the curriculum, etc. It does NOT delve into the specifics, such as what the different types of learning are, just that different types of learning do exist. It basically tells you (or warns you?) what kinds of situations will come up if you choose to home school, and what information to start looking for from here.I guess I walk away from this book with a feel for what jumping into the homeschooling \\"scene\\" would be like.

This made me feel like the authors were truly trying to give the reader as muchinformation as they could on the subject, without being dogmatic about it. I've read a few other books that made me feel like I was a horrible parent if I didn't end up homeschooling my children, so this book was extremely refreshing. The authors are upfront about the fact that homeschooling may not be for everyone, but they are encouraging to those who are considering it. As mentioned in the previous review, the authors are Christians, which was what I preferred since I am also. But this book has wonderful information for Christians and non-Christian families alike in my opinion. If you're looking for a book to help guide you in your decision making, I'd highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Trout Streams of Northern New England: A Guide to the Best Fly-Fishing in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, First Edition","review":"Actually, I would normally rate this book a 4 but I thought the previous rating showing a 2 was too low. I found the book to be very helpful. Not being familar with Maine, VT, or NH, I was able to quicky determine not just where to fish but where not to fish. The book is targeted more toward fly fishermen (I am one of those) and it lists what hatches are on the stream. A familar fly fisherman knows roughly what month such hatches are around. I would highly recommend this book over a Maine Gazette map which will not give you the detailed directions to some popular fishing spots."},{"Title":"Trout Streams of Northern New England: A Guide to the Best Fly-Fishing in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, First Edition","review":"A nice collection of maps and general info, however, this title doesn't supply much more information than the NH Gazetteer.

The actions, styles and patterns have been really great for the work I have done so far BUT there were plug-ins that I used on previous versions of Photoshop that I miss such as Extensis PhotoFrame and pretty much once you use 7, you don't want to use the previous versions of Photoshop especially in Classic Mode.Well, on many projects, especially building advertisements, I'm always craving for something that can run on the latest Photoshop. Also, to save me time in making the ads. That's why there are downloadable actions that help speed that time up BUT unfortunately, I don't have the time to jump around websites and look for certain actions, styles, gradients, etc. If I need to create a marble background, a plastic, glass icon, etc. I would have to do it manually and it does take time.With \\"Photoshop 7 One-Click Wow!\\", this book/CD has eliminated that extra time in creating backgrounds, gradients or special effects. Also, you would save a lot of money compared to software plug-ins that would cost you close to a hundred bucks, you're saving a lot of money with this book/CD. The CD comes with over 800 one click makeovers for brushes, tool presets, patterns, gradients, actions and rollovers.Sure, for some purists, it's fun to challenge oneself to seeing how quickly you can do an effect but if you are a designer who has to deal with many deadlines and multiple projects, you need to eliminate as much time from creating these effects, so you can get some good night's sleep (sleep, what sleep?) or that extra hour to go to lunch or dinner.Pretty much install the WOW! Folders to the corresponding Photoshop folders and append them and it's all one click which you can adjust frame sizes and more.Jack Davis & Linnea Dayton have provided us with an awesome tool for designers. Beginner or advanced, this is definitely worth checking out!"},{"Title":"Adobe(R) Photoshop(R) 7 One Click Wow!","review":"The greatest value of One Click WOW is the CD which includes:* 60 custom brush presets* 300 styles for photos, type, and graphics,* 150 styles for buttons,* 50 styles for ImageReady rollovers complete with JavaScript code,* 40 gradient presets,* over 150 seamless pattern textures,* 60 actions,* 60 art media tool presets,* tutorial and sample filesOne Click WOW works on the Layer Styles in both Photoshop and Photoshop Elements. So you just install and you're ready to go. You really don't have to read anything, but I suggest reading the part where it explains resolution (all theirs are done at 225 ppi) and how to get the best results, how to scale their presets, etc.The book contains what seems like a zillion (technical term) sample images of the various styles, presets, patterns and brushes, gradient effects, photo effects... vignettes, frames, borders, tints, color effects, textures, patterns, grains and even various darkroom effectsYou can set some text or create a simple grayscale image, then click on one of their presets, and voila! You instantly have results that might have taken hours.They also give you presets to change the look of photos, like adding film grain, and, near the back, Jack includes a little tutorial on his amazing technique to turn your photos into paintings (using the brush presets on the CD)."},{"Title":"Adobe(R) Photoshop(R) 7 One Click Wow!","review":"Sure, if you know enough about Photoshop you could create many of these layerstyles, textures, etc. by hand. But why? It takes far less time and effort to load it off of a CD. The book includes photographic examples of the layer styles, actions, brushes, etc. as well as instructions and tips on how to use these tools. It is MORE than just a 'layer styles on a cd' book.For the price it is well worth it (I paid just over [price] for the book through Amazon).You can use this book if you have Photoshop 6, but certain actions may not work, and the brushes may not work. You need Photoshop 7 to fully take advantage of everything in this book, but it is still worth the price if you have not yet upgraded to 7.0 yet.I highly reccomend this book.Alex F."},{"Title":"Adobe(R) Photoshop(R) 7 One Click Wow!","review":"Adobe Photoshop 7 One Click Wowby Jack Davis and Linnea DaytonPeachpit Press90 pages, all in colorCD included with supporting files and samplesISBN 0-321-12531-2Review by: Wynne StevensOne Click Wow is one of those books we struggling want-to-be computer artists see in bookstores and fall in love with at first sight. The accompanying CD alone contains a smorgasbord of Photoshop styles, actions, and other effects that can make anyone look good with virtually no effort at all. Obviously true artists and Photoshop experts may look upon this with some disdain but there's no denying that One Click Wow exemplifies software automation and productivity to the delight of the unskilled such as myself.This book contains the tools to take a simple graphic and convert it to chiseled steel, chrome, plastic, glass, neon, wood grain, and on and on. Want a frame or special edge treatment for that photograph? How about textures, edges or photo enhancements? Need some dynamic rollovers? No problem.The authors present the various included effects with a simple clarity that makes it possible to start experimenting immediately. Once hooked, the process is addictive and a truly great way to explore the incredibly vast range of image effects that are possible with Photoshop.The main focus of the book is on Photoshop layer styles, various effects that can be applied or unapplied to individual or groups of layers within an image file. It starts with brief introduction describing concept and customizing in terms easily grasped by any novice. The reader is encouraged to load the styles and begin experimenting immediately and there is a tutorial for the timid.In the course of observing how each style (and there are literally hundreds) is constructed, and how components (opacity, pattern, shadow, stroke, texture, et. al.) are mixed, one really begins to understand the power of layer styles. Through experimentation, the book's styles can be altered and re-saved to suit any individual preference. This is where the real value lies -- one has both a vast library of new presets and the means to customize based on individual needs.But wait, there's more! There are tons of other presets, including over 60 actions, 40 gradients, and 150 seamless patterns with full color examples of how each is rendered on a simple graphic. It's a lot of fun and a great education for those of us who are unsophisticated in the many ways an image can be manipulated. The CD alone is worth thirty bucks -- the fact that there are 90 pages of text and color examples is a bonus.I recommend this book highly, especially to novices, as an excellent introduction to the power of Photoshop in image enhancement. Many of us have the program and don't really know all it can do. Spend a day with this book and you'll have a new appreciation. Definitely:MacMice Rating: 5 out of 5Author Jack Davis tells Book Bytes:I want to emphasize the Wow Art Media Brush Presets and the Wow Image Fix Brush Presets -- over 70 of the most mind-bogglingly useful brushes (and associated paper and canvas textures) for thoroughly exploiting the capabilities of Photoshop 7's new Brush Engine. Those topics start on page 78 of the book.Users of Adobe Photoshop Elements can participate in the Wow revolution by purchasing and using a companion book, entitled:Adobe Photoshop Elements One-Click Wow!by Jack Davis and Linnea DaytonPeachpit PressISBN 0-321-10847-7, 58 pages plus companion CD loaded with images and tools* If readers are using Photoshop 6, they won't be able to take advantage of the new Tool Presets on the Photoshop 7 One-Click Wow CD, but this would still be the book of choice because of the greater number of Styles.* If they are using Photoshop Elements, the Photoshop 7 One-Click Wow still offers more Styles, but the Elements One-Click Wow tells how to use Styles with Elements, which is a little different process than using them with the full Photoshop.In both cases, the printed book includes examples of all the Styles and tells how to use all the goodies supplied on the CD-ROM, including the tutorial files.Here are the differences in more detail:Adobe Photoshop Elements One-Click Wow! - which was the first one in this series - has more than 300 Layer Styles (instant stunning, practical effects for photos, type, or graphics) that can be used with Elements or Photoshop 6 or 7. It also has Recipes, which are exclusive to Elements (since Adobe has changed the way Recipes work in version 2 and the Wow Recipes were designed for version 1, the Recipes on our CD don't work with Elements 2).Adobe Photoshop 7 One-Click Wow! has more Layer Styles - about 250 for type and graphics and more than 75 for photos, all of which can be used with Photoshop 7 or 6 or with Elements. It also has 150 custom button styles for use in Photoshop 6 or 7 or ImageReady; in addition, there are 50 combined Rollover Styles, already automated for use in ImageReady. Besides more Styles, the other major difference about this book/CD package is that it takes advantage of Photoshop 7's support for custom Tool Presets. For instance, it has more than 60 custom art-media tools for turning photos into watercolors, oils, pastels, and other media. It also has photo-retouching presets: dodge-and-burn brushes, red-eye fixers, teeth-and-eye whiteners, and skin redness removers. There are also presets for the most-often-used cropping dimensions, more than 40 Wow Gradients, and over 150 custom seamlessly tiling Patterns and Textures. There are also Wow Actions for elaborate special effects and for common image-fixing and production tasks. (The Tool Presets and many of the Actions are specific to Photoshop 7 only, and won't work with Photoshop 6 or Elements.------------------------------------------------------------------------Wynne Stevens"},{"Title":"Adobe(R) Photoshop(R) 7 One Click Wow!","review":"I got this book and CD-Rom for Christmas 2004. The biggest advantage is the CD! It adds some cool stuff to your Photoshop 7. I wish the book had gone into more detail or given you more lessons, which is why I can't give it five stars.This sounds weird, but....in a way, the lessons are very helpful and in a way they're confusing. If you're a PS pro, experienced in the nuances of the program, you'll whiz through it like nobody's business. If, however, you are a rank beginner, it is a bit confusing and a bit overwhelming.PS is very intensive and such a User UN-friendly program to begin with that those of us starting out need all the help we can get!It certainly is a beautifully illustrated book but most of it is taken up with showing you the graphics you're getting on the CD-Rom.Still a worthy addition!! I just wish there were more!"},{"Title":"Adobe(R) Photoshop(R) 7 One Click Wow!","review":"It took me a while to get around to loading this program onto Photoshop 7 but after doing so I can't figure why I waited so long. It's easy to use and so-o-o forgiving. I particularly like being able to reset the copy and retain the total effect. Some of the effects are much better and more useful than others, but once you get past the fun of playing with the process it will save you hours in creative time and make your work more unique.

If you are famaliar with Photoshop's Actions, and Tool Presets, this book is probably not the one for you. The book will confuse beginners and be repetisious to informed users. The actual part that I did like is the easy way to edit text by using one-click instead of going thru all the steps. As for the other one clicks, I prefer to use my own methods.

Eugene Kryzynski, the bombadier, is my great-great uncle. I never knew the story behind his Silver Star until I read this novel.

Burda, an 18 year old navigator on his B-24, was first shot out of the sky by German fighters, then rescued by Tito's partisans. If that wasn't enough, Burda re-uped for another 20 missions after his tour of duty was over, only to be brought down again over the oil fields of Polesti. This time the crew ended up as POWs, waiting out the end of the war at the famous Stalag 13 of Great Escape fame. There are descriptive accounts of battles, avoiding the Germans with the partisans, and creative and humorous anecdotes from prison camp life.

Set during the French &amp; Indian War, or the War of the Austrian Succession as it was known in Europe, this book vivdly illustrates the differences between the Old and the New World. The seeds of rebellion are firmly planted among the colonials on both sides of the conflict. Great characters, royal spies and savage Indians led by Europeans gone native, drive the story as the English drive the French from North America. There are no lame skirmishes led by incompetent American Colonels ... just lots of intrigue and adventure culminating in the Battle of Louisbourg, Nova Scotia, the French stronghold guarding the St. Lawrence river, the gateway to Quebec. This book is part Last of the Mohicans, part Northwest Passage, but with a contemporary pace. Anyone who loves American History and adventure stories will love this. Its really unfortunate that it's out-of-print. Hopefully, some publisher will rediscover this so a whole new generation can enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Young Titan","review":"F. Van Wyck Mason's book, \\"The Young Titan\\", ranks right up there with Edison Marshall, Kenneth Roberts, John Jennings, and Dale Van Every's historical fiction for his skill in portraying early New England life prior to and during the American Revolution.

These books are especially interesting for those of us who live where so much of the history behind these stories actually took place."},{"Title":"The Young Titan","review":"I stumbled on F. Van Wyck Mason by accident on Amazon.com. I thought that anyone who wrote over 60 novels must have been a good writer, and I was right! All of his books are well written and keep the readers interest. But the \\"Young Titan\\" is in a class by itself. I don't know how it has been overlooked as a great piece of historical American Literature. The characters are vividly portrayed as are the scenes. Mason brings this era of colonial history to life again in this novel. Any reader who enjoys early American historical fiction should not miss this.

Such defence as existed in 1941, however, was far from adequate and the reign of the battleship came to an abrupt end.The Force of ships which included the Repulse and Prince of Wales was designated Force Z and this is the story of their loss. In a carefully research work, Bernard Ash appears to have left no stone unturned as he searched for the detail which makes this book so special.Well written and immensely readable, we are eventually taken through a blow-by-blow account of the loss of these two great ships through accounts related by those who were there and survived. Details of Churchill's reactions are also included.Before we get there, however, we are also treated to an account of the loss of both the Bismarck and HMS Hood in which both the Repulse and Prince of Wales took part.With only 7 photographs and two maps, this work has clearly stood the test of time and is thoroughly recommended to those with an interest in the subject.NM"},{"Title":"Vengeance of the Dancing Gods","review":"This was the very first book I read by this author, and it thoroughly hooked me on fantasy books from then on, even though it wasn't even the first in the series.

I was expecting the deck would have something to do with \\"angels\\". It had absolutly nothing to do with angels. This deck is basicly a Marseilles style deck. This means that the suit cards do not have scenes on them. They are basicly 1 cup, 2 cups, 3 cups, etc... The colors used on the cards are very dull and drab. The court cards do have an actual pictue on them. On the upper right or left corner is a symbol specifying which suit that particular court card belongs to. The majors are basicly identical to any Marseilles deck. Although I did enjoy the Devil Card (XV). The Devil is smiling in this picture and almost looks friendly. This card is pretty much the only card the sets this deck apart from any other Marseilles style deck. The pips (suits) are very basic. Although the number two card for the pentacles suit was rather attractive, the only problem was that on the S shape are the words \\"Manufactured by Angel Playing Cards.\\" I was rather disappointed that the publisher would put this statement on an actual tarot card. I feel, as a professional tarot reader, that if I were giving a reading to a client and they read this statement, it would seem very unprofessional and they would not take the reading seriously. The LWB (little white book) does explain their meanings for each card. There is a rather lengthy explanation on the history of tarot itself in the beginning. I feel this was unnecessary and this space could have been used to explain this particular tarot deck better. Overall I was disappointed with this deck. I felt mislead by the title \\"Angel Tarot\\". Again this deck does not show any Angels on the cards except for the traditional Temperance Angel.

But there is a threat to them that may be far worse than each other. The Silurians and the Sea Devils, humanoid reptiles who ruled the Earth in prehistoric times, are beginning to reawaken, and intend to wipe humanity out. The Fifth Doctor, who arrives with Tegan and Turlough, arrives in 2084 after the Doctor expresses a desire to show Tegan the near future. He has met the Silurians and the Sea Devils before, and though he is a peace loving man at heart, those experiences ended badly. Will the Doctor be able to reason with the Silurians, or will history repeat itself?I'm a big fan of the Silurians, and its nice to see them in a returning story. There's a monster character called the Myrka which didn't seem that interesting, even though it was a major part of the plot in the early part of the story. I liked the Cold War atmosphere, and Terrance Dicks' asides that flesh out the characters a little more. There is a tad too much wandering round in corridors and ventilation shafts, but maybe that's just me. It's worth a read for fans, though there are other novelizations I'd reach for first. I'll have to get round to watching the DVD of this story one day!"},{"Title":"Doctor Who: Warriors of the Deep","review":"Did you know that there was another race that ruled the Earth before humans did? No, not the dinosaurs, a highly intelligent race of sea creatures. They were amazing bioengineers who could change the life forms around them into tools for their own use. Turns out they put themselves in a state of suspended animation millions of years ago and have now awoken to find the human race misusing their planet. They are determined to put an end to it by using the humans own weapons against each other, causing humans to totally eliminate their own race. Can the Doctor, Tegan and Turlough do anything to prevent this? Should they, or would the Earth be better off without the human race?"},{"Title":"Doctor Who: Warriors of the Deep","review":"The TARDIS arrives above Earth in the year 2084, where things are quite tense. The world is broken in two hostile power blocs, fingers poised on their respective buttons. The TARDIS arrival is in the area under surveillance of an armed satellite, the Doctor dematerialises the ship and arrives in a Seabase, one of the lines of defence in Earth's cold war. There arrival corresponds to the plans of the Silurians and Sea-Devils, the original inhabitants of Earth...This novel by Terrance Dicks is based on the original script by Johnny Byrne, who previously wrote 'The Keeper of Traken' and 'Arc of Infinity'. While Mr. Byrne's scripts started out quite good, they deteriorated over these stories (and one must ask to what extent script editor Eric Saward played in this...).The problem with 'Warriors of the Deep' is that it is notionally a sequel to the Third Doctor stories 'The Silurians' and 'The Sea-Devils'. It contains references to previous encounters with these races - but which has no real resemblance to the earlier stories.Reading the book gives you a huge advantage over those viewing the TV serial - you don't have to look at the Myrka, and you can imagine a truly horrendous monster..."},{"Title":"BALTIC EPISODE - A classic of Secret Service in Russian waters","review":"Augustus Agar had a long and unusual Royal Navy career. Here, long afterwards, he recalls the shortish period after the Great War when the RN intervened to blockade and raid the Red Navy, based mainly at Kronstadt, off Petrograd. That was the naval base from which the most active Russian revolutionaries of 1917 came. Four years later they were to rebel against the Communist dictatorship. Halfway in between Agar was part of the force (led by Cowan) which raided it with fast torpedo craft, the \\"C.M.Bs\\". I would be spoiling the story by going further. Best get the book yourself. It's very readable naval autobiography, on a near-forgotten campaign."},{"Title":"Workplace Warrior: Insights and Advice for Winning on the Corporate Battlefield","review":"Kay Hammer is one smart cookie who didn't crumble. This is a brutally honest story filled with savvy advice and thought provoking wisdom useful to anyone who works. Anywhere. The principles revealed by Hammer are potentially life-changing for anyone who truly gives them more than a passing thought. I can think of dozens of people to whom I would tacitly recommend this book. It should also be required reading for every corporate HR department."},{"Title":"Workplace Warrior: Insights and Advice for Winning on the Corporate Battlefield","review":"Frankly, I like the book's content almost as much as I dislike its title and subtitle. Please, no more forced comparisons and contrasts between the battlefield and the workplace. Enough! With regard to the excellent text, as Hammer explains in the Introduction, one of her basic concepts is that there are \\"three stages of personal and professional growth.\\" All three \\"can be characterized by their attitudes toward risk and the need for approval. These three stages are those of the apprentice, the warrior, and the adventurer.\\" She has much of value to say about each, especially in terms of how each differs from the other two. Her larger objectives are, in my opinion, (a) to help her reader to decide which \\"battles\\" to fight as well as which to ignore, and, (b) to help her reader \\"win\\" more often on the \\"corporate battlefield.\\"According to Hammer, the defining characteristic of the apprentice is the need for external approval. The primary difference between the apprentice and the warrior is that the warrior's goals sufficiently compel her to risk disapproval and engage in conflict, while the apprentice is not yet either dissatisfied or secure enough to assume such risk.\\" While apprentices focus on approval and warriors on vindication, adventurers focus on challenge and discovery. \\"They value respect, friendship, and recognition, but they do not need these things.\\"In Section I (\\"Rules of Engagement\\"), Hammer examines specific issues when running a private company and then other issues when planning an exit strategy. Then in Section II (\\"Basic Training\\"), she discusses effective communication in the workplace, strategies for dealing with conflict, and acquiring allies. Having thus prepared her reader for \\"combat\\", Hammer concludes with Section III (\\"The Battle and Beyond\\") in which she explains how to maximize chances for victory, why we tend to love and fear authority, and what can be learned from loss as a precursor to success. In the Epilogue, Hammer suggests that \\"Our real challenge is to conquer our shadow enemies -- those that mask our fear and pain -- so that regardless of our success in the battles we wage in the workplace, we move forward with greater serenity and satisfaction.\\" If your own workplace often seems to be a battlefield and you feel ill-equipped to engage in combat, Hammer's insights and advice will be invaluable to you."},{"Title":"Workplace Warrior: Insights and Advice for Winning on the Corporate Battlefield","review":"Hammer's take is that you should recognize the potential battles that lie in the wake of working your way up in business and starting a compare. If you do this, she maintains, you stand a better chance of success. While some of the stories Hammer tells of her treatment among the executive ranks are pretty horrendous, they come off as a forthright take on what it's like in the trenches. In fact such details add to the overall value of the book. We read of the boss who humiliated her in front of her colleagues by forming a shadow committee to duplicate her efforts behind her back and then announcing the adoption of that committee's suggestions at a department-wide meeting. She tells of an employee she was mentoring who eventually tried to take over her job. Understanding the enemy, Hammer says, is the way to win in the workplace wars.Unlike other CEO books that make the journey seem all too pat, Hammer does a good job of painting a more complete picture, warts and all. The end result is a useful book for anyone working at a company or trying to make it with his or her own company."},{"Title":"New Routledge Dutch Dictionary (Routledge Bilingual Dictionaries)","review":"I highly recommend this dictionary over some others that are available.

This is a really good dictionary. But, it's not as small as I would have liked. It usually stays home, but I use it quite frequently, anyways. As we're driving around, I always write down Dutch words that I want to know about and look them up when we get home.

It's not the most comprehensive but it's set of words is fairly complete for non-specialized vocabulary. It helpfully gives whether nouns are common or neuter (use \\"de\\" or \\"het\\"), although if you're looking up a translation from English, you have to then look up the word by Dutch to see this info. The list of contextual examples of word use and phrases is also helpful. If you're trying to learn Dutch, I highly recommend this dictionary."},{"Title":"New Routledge Dutch Dictionary (Routledge Bilingual Dictionaries)","review":"Anne Cavendish, in her review of this dictionary, mentions the superiority of the Van Dale dictionaries. I have the 2006 pocketwoordenboek version of these dictionaries, and referred to it in evaluating this Routledge dictionary. I found that in the first few pages of the \\"A\\" section, there was exactly one difference in their chosen vocabularies. The Routledge contained the word \\"A4\\" (as in the size of paper). Furthermore, in picking several definitions at random, I found them to be identical in the two dictionaries (accounting for some slight formatting differences mentioned in some other reviews). Not only identical in definitions, but even in the illustrative sentences provided. In any other kind of work, that would be clear evidence of plagiarism. I don't know how one judges dictionaries in such matters. In any case, what matters to the prospective buyer is that on a cursory look, these dictionaries appear to be essentially identical. The van Dale is certainly more portable (with two separate volumes, one might even fit one in a coat pocket), and the Routledge is possibly cheaper. Decide for yourself."},{"Title":"New Routledge Dutch Dictionary (Routledge Bilingual Dictionaries)","review":"Excellent product and good value for money. However, a dictionary, given its intended frequent use, should perhaps have a hard cover."},{"Title":"New Routledge Dutch Dictionary (Routledge Bilingual Dictionaries)","review":"All in all, this dictionary is pretty fantastic. It's not the Van Dale, but it's bidirectional and contains a substantially large list of important vocabulary. In general, Routledge produces a pretty fine selection of Dutch learning materials [which should definitely be used in conjunction with one another and not individually]. That said, the farther along you get along in your study of the language, the less use you will have for it. In fact, it frequently lacks terms that can be required just to read a newspaper. Additionally, and I think this is essential as a learner, it doesn't always list words in both directions which can be problematic if one is trying to deduce nuance."},{"Title":"New Routledge Dutch Dictionary (Routledge Bilingual Dictionaries)","review":"This is the best Dutch-English dictionary I've seen. The other dictionaries I've looked at (and unfortunately bought) had one of several problems:1. not all relevant information was included (the NTC dictionary doesn't indicate a noun's gender, give the relevant article, or include irregular plural formations, all of which this dictionary does);2. the dictionary presumes a Dutch-speaker is looking up the words, and thus gives lexical abbreviations in dutch (i.e. 'zn' for 'zelfstandig naamvoord' = a noun). This dictionary very conveniently uses English and English abbreviations;3. the dictionary isn't comprehensive enough to be useful. This dictionary is extremely comprehensive for its size and also contains current words with their popular meanings (i.e. fritje oorlog = fries with mayo and peanut sauce) as well as colloquial examples of the word (i.e. the 'blikken' entry notes that 'zonger blikken of blozen' means 'without batting an eyelid' which is otherwise nearly impossible to find out).I highly recommend this dictionary to anyone. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the English is British and it's sometimes confusing when I have to remember that 'chips' are french fries and to spell my words differently in order to find them (donut = doughnut, etc.). Significantly, this dictionary does generally (though not always) include American words where they are different from the British in translation ('apotheek' is translated both as 'chemist's' and 'drugstore')."},{"Title":"New Routledge Dutch Dictionary (Routledge Bilingual Dictionaries)","review":"This is exactly the type of dictionary that I like and the kind that I would recommend. Not only does it show the grammatical gender for all nouns, but it also has a list of conjugations for irregular verbs. The best part about this dictionary is that every word is transcribed in IPA, and if you're really interested in getting the language pronounciation down, then I would highly recommend it. For those of you who are not familiar with IPA, it stands for the International Phonetic Alphabet, where the pronounciation of each word is clearly marked along with the stressed syllable.If you are looking for an inexpensive Dutch-English dictionary that contains more than just stupid words and phrases, then this is it. ALso, this edition is copywrited in 2003, so it's very modern it even has CD-ROM as an entry in it."},{"Title":"New Routledge Dutch Dictionary (Routledge Bilingual Dictionaries)","review":"This is by far the best English-Dutch dictionary available. It has several significant advantages over any of the others I have seen for sale: 1) It provides the phonetic pronunciation for every word; 2) It provides the gender and how to form the plural for every noun; 3) It's up to date and contains many more recent words and usages; 4) For many entries, it offers useful phrases or idiomatic expressions using the word; 5) For English idioms that can't be translated literally, it often provides an equivalent Dutch phrase. The dictionary is comprehensive, but still a manageable size. It's attractive and the printing is clear and easy to read. Don't waste your time or money buying anything else; this is reasonably priced and worth every penny. I only wish it was still available in hardcover because mine has seen much use."},{"Title":"New Routledge Dutch Dictionary (Routledge Bilingual Dictionaries)","review":"I found this dictionary to be useful up until the time I began an intermediate level language class in the Netherlands. It wasn't quite comprehensive enough, even for in-class assignments. My biggest complaint with it: many of the definitions given in the Dutch to English section were unfortunately not present from English to Dutch, making it great for looking up Dutch words that you don't know, but it left me frustrated when searching for the Dutch equivalent of many English words and phrases. That being said, I think that it is more than adequate to use as a pocket dictionary or for quick references. I use it when I read Dutch newspapers and novels. If you want to go for something with more in-depth definitions, invest in one of the Van Dale dictionaries. Their hefty price is well worth it."},{"Title":"New Routledge Dutch Dictionary (Routledge Bilingual Dictionaries)","review":"A reasonably comprehensive dictionary that is best suited to English speakers who need to translate Dutch words. It is more comprehensive than online translations at Babelfish.altavista.com or Systransbox. The English to Dutch section is much smaller than the Dutch to English section, but still adequate for writing letters. Usually gives several definitions and examples of sentances. The examples are valuable because word meaning can change with the context.My only complaint is it does not contain samples of regular word conjugations. It does have a table of irregular verbs, but I don't know Dutch well enough to know the standard conjugations. Like all language dictionaries, it does not give separate listings for standard variations, a real problem for beginners."},{"Title":"New Routledge Dutch Dictionary (Routledge Bilingual Dictionaries)","review":"Best dictionary that can be carried.

Years ago my career and life took me to Wyoming. Like many, I fell in love with the high country and soon realized that the only way to get to the best of it was with horses.

Somewhere along the way, I misplaced it. I'm glad to have it back.This book is more than informative. It delivers all its name suggests, telling all I needed to know about the tack, rigging and techniques of handling horses in a pack string. By simply following his advice, I found myself not only able to do it, but do it without embarassing myself in the company of real mountain men.Beyond that, Joe's earthy narrative and humorous, but informative, illustrations make the book a joy to read. Even after you read it cover to cover, you'll want to spend some time looking at the illustrations and re-reading the tidbits of wisdom.

Drabble endows her main character with a fierce, albeit flawed, sense of individualism and self-sufficiency. She tackles burdens and obstacles head-on and alone, even when help was available for the asking. Drabble also coveys the conflict present within her. Rosamund considers herself a modern and liberated woman, yet she is still bound by the Victorian sensativities she denounces. Her lifelong seach is for true love, but only does she find it in the place, or person, she was not seeking to meet. Commentary: There was a painfully obvious correlation between the rise of the welfare state and the decline of the family. Rosamund could have never done what she did on her own without the welfare state operating in Great Britain, with no welfare state, she would have had to maintain close ties with her family."},{"Title":"The Millstone","review":"I've just started reading Drabble and I loved this book.

Drabble spends the entire book developing these characters, yet the book ends with no sense of completion or closure."},{"Title":"The Millstone","review":"The Waterfall remains my favorite Margaret Drabble novel, but this one uses a faster pace and even more humor. That humor comes from timing and odd observations, rather than obvious attempts at making readers laugh. For example, just before Rosamund Stacey loses her virginity, her seducer asks, &quot;Is this all right? Are you all right, will this be all right?&quot; Rosamund then tells us &quot;that was it and it was over.&quot; You'll hate when this book is over. Rosamund seems like an old friend, and you'll enjoy your visit with her."},{"Title":"The Millstone","review":"This was my first Margaret Drabble and I was pleasantly surprised at the cutting but subtle satire of English manners of the 1960s. The theme itself -- a single woman's decision to have a child without a husband -- was rather in keeping with the sexual revolution brought about in the 1960s in Western Europe. The narration is light and engaging, in keeping with the best of the traditional English social satirists from Austen to Pym. For my taste the books loses momentum in the last quarter, but it is still a very intelligent rendition of manners and mores."},{"Title":"The Millstone","review":"This moving short novel portraits the rude awakening of a young woman, who after making love with a 'silly bugger' becomes an unmarried mother.The dreams of youth, 'I used to be so good-natured. I used to see the best in every-one', becomes 'my growing selfishness, this was probably maturity.' 'Life would never be a simple question of self-denial again.'There is also the chasm between the education's view of mankind and the facts of real life.Education was the cause of 'my inability to see anything in human terms of like and dislike, love and hate, but only in terms of justice, guilt and innocence', and 'the endurance of privation is a virtue.'However as an adult, she is confronted with 'resentments breed so near the craddle, that people should have it from birth'; 'facts of inequality, of the heart-breaking uneven hardship of the human lot. These things were as nothing compared with the bond that bind parent and child'.As another woman in the novel says: 'I haven't the energy to go worrying about other people's children. I only have enough time to worry about myself. If I didn't put myself and mine first, they wouldn't survive.'And finally, there is the unbearable burden of Victorian religion: 'the thought of sex freightened the life out of me.' 'If Octavia were to die, this would be a vengeance upon my sin.'In naturally flowing prose, Margaret Drabble paints a most human portrait of innocence and struggle for (emotional) survival, youth and adulthood and the mighty marks of religion (guilt) and 'unselfish' education.A masterly written short novel."},{"Title":"The Millstone","review":"But to call it a \\"treat\\" is to belittle this wonderful book. Drabble is an uneven author. Her Sea Lady is a brilliant novel that I highly recommend. Other of her works are indifferent or worse, e.g. The Radiant Way (see my review). Well, The Millstone by Drabble is one of the best novels I've read in years. Truly a surprise discovery that I highly recommend. This is a heartwarming and also somewhat tragic story that unfolds with humor, irony, insight, and empathy.The entire novel is told in the first person from the point of view of Rosamund. Rosamund is a diffident young literary woman living alone in London who gets pregnant the first time she has sex, and that quite casually with a casual friend. This book was written in the mid-1960s and reflects the developing and changing attitudes of that era toward sex and life, but still at that time having an \\"illegitimate\\" child was not accepted and expected the way it is now. Nevertheless Rosamund, through a combination of diffidence and courage, ends up having her child.Of course, since I was about the same age or a bit younger than Rosamund in the mid-60s, this story rattled my aging memories. It brought many a smile to my wrinkled face, and yes a tear too. Much has changed since the 1960s--Gosh, it was almost fifty years ago. Besides a glimpse into literary London, The Millstone is a depiction of the state of medicine, especially gynecology and pediatrics, at that time. Fortunately medicine has improved vastly both technically and socially. The Millstone paints a very depressing picture of the British National Health Service and the treatment of mothers to be and mothers with sick children. This novel is an indictment of nationalized medicine--but that is only a small part of the story.The best thing about this novel is Rosamund. She comes to life for the reader as a real human being. She is no cardboard character, but a real thinking, loving, fearing human being, as engaging as a character in a Shakespeare play. The Millstone is also a tender and moving exploration of motherhood. I am not familiar with any other work in English that so profoundly and lovingly describes this most natural and indissoluble human relation with such clarity and insight. This reader will not soon forget Rosamund and her little daughter Octavia. What is hard to remember is that they are not friends of mine but only made up characters in a book. Marvelous!"},{"Title":"The Millstone","review":"Rosamund Stacey is the first person narrator of her own story in the Millstone by Margaret Drabble. Rosamund is a single mother - nothing strange about that, perhaps, at least in a twenty-first century Britain where now half of births are outside of marriage. But in the early 1960s, when The Millstone was written, unmarried mothers were not so common and it was a status to which considerable stigma was attached.Consequently, when Rosamund visits hospital for her regular check-ups, she is summoned from the waiting room with a call of Mrs. Stacey in an attempt to maintain the privacy of her status. She longs for the day - and not too distant - when her thesis on Elizabethan poetry will be complete and she can prefix her name with Dr., thereby avoiding the deception.The Millstone is written in Margaret Drabble's conversational, yet dense style. The characters are highly complex and seem to live their lives with a devotion to intricacy. Not much happens to them, however, and events are few and far between. Rosamund's life is a case in point. It was Cambridge, of course, followed by the relative comfort of a flat in central London, an apartment provided by her parents calculatedly close to the British Museum, where she does most of her research. She is definitely not the run-of-the-mill young lass who attends university nowadays, our Rosamund. She has a boyfriend at college, of course, but they never sleep together, not even on the occasion they jointly plan to accomplish the act.Rosamund is not really into sex, she thinks. She has a tendency to see herself as an object from without, and her observation of the absurdity of various aspects of being human lead her to a life slightly removed from reality, lived apparently at arm's length from experience. Though she sees quite a lot of Joe and Roger - both quite different but eligible males - the idea of anything other than a chat and a drink appals her. Each of the two men, of course, think that the other is the boyfriend and so are loath to raise the subject.Then, for some reason hardly known to herself, she takes up with George, a gay radio presenter, and sleeps with him. Just once. And yes, Rosamund is definitively pregnant. As ever, she cannot decide what to do and, even when she eventually plans her course, she is blown off onto a different tack. She has read that drinking a bottle of gin in a hot bath might do the trick. She sets an evening aside. And then, just as the bottle is opened, friends turn up, she offers them a drink and they share the otherwise-ntended gin between them.Rosamund is thus never really in control, despite appearing to have a strangle hold on her life. Circumstances always seem to conspire to prevent her getting precisely what she wants. But this is eventually seen as an illusion. Perhaps she does get precisely what she wants, but does not tell us, or herself.And so Octavia is born. The baby is a life that Rosamund contemplated ending, but when the child is ill, the thought of her coming to harm is too painful to admit. A friend, Lydia, moves in, shares the costs and sets about writing a novel. When this is complete, an unsupervised Octavia tears much of it up, though perhaps not disastrously. Rosamund reminds us that babies are persistent, not thorough, so most of the pages are preserved. It becomes the mother's trauma, however.Rosamund could be described as measured, always apparently in control, yet always feeling she is swept along with the tide. Passionate she is not. When George, who still does not know he is Octavia's father, says she might do well with a husband, Rosamund agrees, but only because it would be nice to have someone who could help to fill in the tax return. George is no better, since for his the purpose of marriage seems to be to provide someone to iron his shirts. It's all terribly British.But the characters are beautifully drawn, expertly pitched against themselves and their relationships. The Millstone, thus, explores motivation and achievement, and the relationship between selfishness and selflessness. In the end, we are who we are."},{"Title":"The Millstone","review":"This was my second Drabble book and, I gather, one of her earliest works and it is a dilly. The young woman protagonist isn't all that likable but she has character and verve and the writing is excellent. Some scenes propel the reader into a vortex of emotions (watch for the episode in the hospital). What a great read this was!"},{"Title":"The Millstone","review":"Masterly written novel, following 1960s academic, Rosamund Stacey. From her privileged background - amusing, bohemian friends; use of a nice flat while her parents are abroad; male admirers (but nothing more) - she is suddenly brought up short when she discovers she is pregnant after a one night stand with (gay?) George.Suddenly she has to take on board a whole world to which she was oblivious: the badly dressed working class patients with whom she must now mix at the doctor's; the disapproval of her siblings. And whether to get back in touch with George and tell him of the fact.Interesting from a historical perspective - did NHS matrons really refuse to let parents visit their infants for a couple of weeks after surgery in case it upset them?!Rosamund doesn't seem to suffer the persecution that one equates with single-motherhood in this era; she acknowledges that this is due in no small part to her class background:'Had I not been who I am and born and reared as I was, I would probably never have dared: I only thought I could get away with it, to put it briefly, because those ambulance men collected me from a good address, and not from a bedsitter in Tottenham...So, in a way, I was cashing in on the foibles of a society which I have always distrusted; by pretending to be above its structures, i was merely turning its anomalies to my own use.'"},{"Title":"The Millstone","review":"There is a long tradition in English literature of novels about unmarried mothers, dating back at least to Elizabeth Gaskell's \\"Ruth\\" and Hardy's \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" in the nineteenth century. Yet the subject was still felt to be a controversial one, much more controversial than it would be today, as late as the 1950s and 1960s; Shelagh Delaney's play \\"A Taste of Honey\\" from 1958 and Lynne Reid Banks's \\"The L-Shaped Room\\" from two years later were both considered very \\"daring\\". \\"The Millstone\\" is another novel on the same theme from 1965. The title presumably relates to the way in which the main character's unplanned pregnancy hampers her life, although there may also be a reference to Christ's words about those who harm children, \\"It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones\\".Rosamund Stacey is a highly intelligent but nave and unworldly young Cambridge graduate, writing a thesis on sixteenth-century English poetry while living in a flat in London. In all matters political she considers herself to be highly progressive, but when it comes to matters sexual, however, she is highly conservative. When we first meet her, in fact, she is still a virgin. She is dating two men, Joe and Roger, but is sleeping with neither. (Each of the two believes the other to be her lover). Rosamund's first, and only, sexual encounter is a one-night stand with a third man, George, a BBC Radio newsreader, and it is as a result of this encounter that she becomes pregnant. (George is rather camp and effeminate in manner, and Rosamund believes him to be homosexual).In the latter part of the book, Rosamund's main relationship is not with George, or with either of the other men in her life, but with her daughter, Octavia. After briefly considering, and dismissing, both abortion and adoption, she decides to have her child and to raise it herself. She finds that being a mother brings her happiness, but this happiness is put at risk when Octavia falls ill with a serious, although unspecified condition. (Margaret Drabble does not seem to have researched the medical aspects of her book. Had she done so she would have realised that antibiotics are not prescribed for viral illnesses such as colds and, more importantly, that the code of medical ethics would have prevented Rosamund's doctor, an old friend of her father, from betraying her confidences to her parents).A word which other reviewers have used about the book is \\"dated\\". That is, in itself, not necessarily a criticism of a novel. After all, writers write for, and about, their own era, and they are not to blame if social attitudes change over the succeeding decades. Indeed, progressive writers like Ms Drabble are doubtless happy when the conservative social attitudes they describe later change in a more liberal direction.\\"The Millstone\\", however, often seems rather old-fashioned even for its period. Although the novel was written by a member of the younger generation (Ms Drabble was only 26 in 1965), and set in the \\"Swinging London\\" of the mid-sixties, there is nothing \\"swinging\\" about Rosamund. The Pill and free love have passed her by. Even her political ideals, which she has inherited from her parents, have more in common with traditional Fabian Socialism, than they do with the \\"new left\\" radicalism of the sixties. She comes across as a rather passive character, passionless and sexless, not unpleasant but uninteresting. The same could be said about the book itself, which I found slight, lightweight and a disappointment, given that it comes from the pen of someone widely regarded as one of Britain's leading novelists. It is occasionally well written but also at times boring."},{"Title":"The Millstone","review":"Did I really buy this? I could've sworn that somebody let me borrow their copy. Either way, I gave it away when I was done with it-- I really thought it belonged to someone else. That makes me kind of sad. I absolutely loved this book, and I wish I hadn't given it away. For those who are unaware, Drabble is the younger sister of the celebrated English author A.S. Byatt; however I'd say that Drabble should be the one being celebrated. Drabble writes with the intelligence and composure of Byatt, but she manages to avoid bogging down the novel like her older sister does. What I mean to say is, this novel has much better readability than the majority of Byatt's works; however, it is still crafted with the level of intelligence we've come to expect from these sisters."},{"Title":"The Millstone","review":"Right at the cusp of the period of Swinging London, Rosamund, the dissertation-writing heroine of THE MILLSTONE, sleeps with a man for the first time in her life and becomes pregnant. What would be a tragedy for many other young women becomes more of a comedy for Margaret Drabble's heroine: she is freed both from a need to pay the rent (she can stay for a year in her parents' spacious flat in Marylebone as they travel in Africa) and from the solicitations of the baby's father (a BBC announcer whom she suspects is gay and whom she rarely sees, and who has no idea of her condition). What then should Rosamund do?The novel is basically a gently comic and quite thoughtful look into how far British women's lives at the time were determined (or not) by their biological roles. Most of Rosamund's friends and her sister see the coming baby as a potential millstone, and urge her to abort the child, or to give it up for adoption, but Rosamund instead wants to see the birth and the raising of the child as far through as she can. The series of comic coincidences that serve to make it possible for Rosamund not only to have the baby but also raise it while completing her doctoral dissertation remind us of how unlikely it would have been for most women to do the same thing at the time as easily--despite the many tribulations Rosamund must face both from her country's National Health Care system and its sometimes obdurate practitioners, who refuse to allow mothers (let alone unwed ones) much respect or human consideration."},{"Title":"Origami: The Art of Paperfolding","review":"A classic book (originally of a set of four paper backs number 4 of which is quite difficult to get hold of!).

I originally began with \\"the Great Origami book & kit\\", but ... that book is too advanced for beginners.

The folds are very difficult for beginners and this book proceeds very slowly going over each and every tiny movement your hands must make. With origami..there can't be ANY mistakes. It is about perfection. If you are a fraction of a millimeter off on a fold, your product will not turn out professionally. I also recommend taking what I joke as \\"stress breaks\\" while proceeding. Many times I have become too frustrated, only to walk away from my project and return to see the mistake I made. My second tip is to BREATHE..the paper will not harm you, although at times you feel it's torture.

Unfortunately, she no sooner has her staff in place than the airline is targeted by a terrorist organization. The description of the head of the terrorists and how he functions doesn't even thinly disguise the fact that Reilly has Osama Bin Laden in mind. Phillips has to find a way to stop this man from killing people and her partner Rebecca is ready to help her. They get themselves involved in some pretty unrealistic situations, but this is a novel and it makes for great reading. If you've read the previous two books involving Kate and Rebecca, you'll see their relationship develop even further. This book is one that is hard to put down."},{"Title":"Storm Front","review":"This final installment of Belle Reilly's Orbis Airlines series is a significant departure from the first two books. It touches lightly on the deepening relationship between flight attendant Rebecca Hanson and pilot Captain Catherine Phillips, but mostly focuses on capturing a terrorist cell that has targeted Orbis.The basic premise is the terrorists bomb a plane with plastique explosive. Catherine is in charge of the task force assigned to investigate, and Becky insists on coming along to help. They follow all angles and eventually solve the case.In this reader's opinion, the book is too little romance mixed with too much action/mystery. It doesn't focus on the main characters, as is Reilly's usual style. However, with the addition of the crash investigation, the story has much more meat and depth than the first two books in the series. Depending on what you like, this will either be a big winner or a big loser for most readers. It's the conclusion of a fairly good series, so I recommend \`Storm Front' mainly to bring closure to the story of Kate and Becky."},{"Title":"Storm Front","review":"The author wrote this work some time before9/11 Terrorist attack.

When he is enticed into an adulterous relationship, he loses everything. Jack, Parst's son, is scarred by his father's betrayal and feels that God is no longer the god he wants to serve. SOMETHING THAT LASTS spans three generations as we watch how Jack, his mother, and Parst deal with \`the sins of the father'.This is not your typical \`feel good', \`everything is fine in the end' novel, which I appreciated, but it didn't captivate me life the novel FORGIVEN. I feel some of the emotional aftermath of Parst's betrayal is passed over too quickly and I didn't really feel myself attaching to the characters like I would've liked to. Still, SOMETHING THAT LASTS is a good read that deals with issues that continue to plague churches and evangelicals today."},{"Title":"Something That Lasts","review":"A moving story about how one wrong move can change your entire life. It helps us realize that no one can know the depths of our remorse and that people are not as forgiving as God."},{"Title":"Something That Lasts","review":"On the outside, Reverend David Parst has it all: a loving wife and son, a thriving church, and an adoring congregation. He is the epitome of the modern ministry success story: he's a man with integrity, ethics, a heart to serve the Lord, and a savvy business sense that's helped his church community grow.On the inside, however, a growing uncertainty troubles Reverend Parst. Caught up in the success of his ministry-related financial endeavors and the growth of his church, stuck in a rut from the daily grind and demands of ministry, he wonders if perhaps he was meant for more than just the humble calling of being a pastor, that there is a far more exciting, daring side of his life that he's missed in the pastoral lifestyle.For just one slip of a moment, he allows his guard to fall, feeding selfish desires rather than walking close to God. In his pride, he neglects his faithful, dutiful wife Sarah, and discounts the potential damage to the one person who idolizes him more than anyone else, his son Jack.One slip of his guard, several seemingly harmless, indulgent moments, and the great Deceiver rushes in. Reverend David Parst falls from grace, committing a tragic mistake that reverberates for several generations to come.Something that Lasts is James David Jordan's first novel, and it touches all the right heartstrings. It is difficult to read at times, especially if someone you know has suffered through the tragedy of adultery and been witness to all the damage it can bring to a family, both heart and soul.It's a story that all genders can relate to; giving a realistic warning to men about the legacy we leave behind for our children, and it can touch women who have been involved in such situations themselves. Also, true to the tagline on the back of the book - A Power That Reaches Across The Generations - it's a story showing that even though time doesn't always heal all wounds, the tender grace and mercy of a loving savior can.The novel does suffer some pitfalls in areas. Jordan creates some very poignant, touching vignettes, snapshots along the way, but some readers may find that these snapshots don't link up to a fulfilling story. The storyline spans almost thirty years, and you get the feeling that some vital parts that would've been very interesting are passed over simply for the sake of fitting everything into one book, which makes it feel like it lacks a little depth in some places. The work would've perhaps been served better to shorten the span of the storyline somewhat, and zoom in closer on a few incidents, rather than giving a broad panorama that's promising but ultimately a little unfulfilling.Also, the plotting feels scripted, formulaic. It's almost something you can imagine nine out of ten people sitting down and putting on a piece of paper: pastor is tempted by success, cheats on wife, does his penance while his son withdraws from God, and years later the whole incident replays or almost replays in the son's life, teaching him a lesson, and the father and son are ultimately reconciled.It would have been far more interesting to perhaps have the wife cheat on the husband, and examine things from the flip-flopped perspective - true, it's a rarer occurrence, but also by that account not nearly as talked about as much, nor used as frequently by writers and screenwriters.And, this is somewhat daring to say, because it's a risky thing to try and make a reader sympathize and relate with an adulterer....but Reverend Parst seems to fall far too easily, the blame solely attributed to his pride. In life, things are rarely that cut and dried.All in all, however, Something That Lasts is a good read - a panoramic view of God using even a tragic mistake to bring about His will, and a sobering reminder of the horrible consequences of sexual sin - especially those extending past just ourselves, but to those we love.[...]"},{"Title":"Something That Lasts","review":"David Parst is a popular preacher of a growing and \\"important\\" church in a St. Louis suburb. He has a quiet but loving wife and a son who adores him. Unfortunately, David's listened to one too many people speak highly of him and his abilities and has come to believe his own press.Believing he should have even more than he does, he makes a colossal, stupendous, hideously stupid mistake. This mistake-one made way too often by Christian men and women in the real world-is quickly revealed and David's life comes crashing down.It's not just David's life that is wrecked, though. His actions have managed to wreck the lives of his son and his wife. As David tries to put the pieces back together, the people he cares about most want nothing to do with him. The book delves into the ensuing years and the tremendous number of consequences wrought by a short period of succumbing to sin.The WritingJames Jordan has crafted a story about sin and forgiveness; how sin can destroy more lives than just that of the sinner and how forgiveness can give life back.Jordan is careful to detail that forgiveness does not always come quickly and rarely comes easily-especially when the hurt is so personal. Jordan is so meticulous in detailing the real-world trial of forgiving that the experience is extremely painful and taxing for the reader. Just when the reader thinks things are starting to turn around, the long-lasting effect of the original (as far as this novel is concerned) sin keeps rearing its ugly head.Jordan is a good writer and this book would be a great read for anyone having a hard time dealing with forgiveness. The consequences of the sin are so graphic that it's hard to imagine someone already battling with forgiveness issues making their way all the way through it, though. It will be so convicting-or they'll have convinced themselves that they're not as bad as the people in this story-that I can see them having difficulty completing the journey.Maybe this book will minister to someone on the other end; someone who has forgiven another person but has yet to receive any reciprocal grace. This book will help provide them with hope that the person who still holds the grievance against them will someday-through the grace of God-come around.Other people who should read this book are those (of us) who are getting close to a sin and listening to Satan's lie that-even if we're found out-the repercussions won't be that bad. Of course, no one ever thinks they'll get caught, but that's another novel.Other ThoughtsWe've all heard about \\"the sins of the father\\" and how they are visited on his children and grandchildren. This is, essentially, a long novel based on that concept. Too long, for my tastes. Jordan goes to such great lengths to make the reader feel the consequences of the father's sins, and does such a good job of writing about it, that it made this reader want to bail. Like Ebeneezer Scrooge begging, \\"Let me see some goodness in this world,\\" I wanted some glimmer that the characters were learning from their experiences but it took a long time before I was convinced they did. Call it realism-and I know a real life tragedy such as the one depicted here would have been even more painful-but by the time this novel got to the uplift I was so weary I didn't care."},{"Title":"Something That Lasts","review":"Wonderful read!

But he wasn't strong enough to resist the overtures of a female member of his congregation. Her husband finds out, and exposes his sin in the middle of an evening church service. Then he goes outside and commits suicide.From that moment on, David's life and the lives of his wife and son go in different directions. We get to see how their lives transpire over the next 30 years. And we get to see the powerful, redemptive, gracious hand of God at work in the most difficult times.This book is a powerful look at how a moment of irresponsible sinning can not only bring down our own lives, but it can adversely affect the lives of the people we love. It also shows how God is working behind the scenes in our lives even when we don't realize it.This is a wonderful debut book by James David Jordan, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Something That Lasts","review":"I couldn't put the book down!

Reviewers, please try not to ruin the book for others coming behind you!)This book, Something That Lasts, spans the 70's through the 90's, following one family's travails through three generations. One single event that happens to Rev. David Parst changes the trajectory of his whole family, and the rest of the book draws out the consequences of his actions. I don't really want to give more synopsis, as the book has a simple premise that is followed throughout the story.Even though the book stays true to this central core, it is an engaging read. He keeps the pace moving briskly, making one always interested in turning the next page. There is the potential to dwell and slow things down, but he does a good job of staying on target. He makes use of some recurring themes to speak into the lives of the characters. Baseball in particular is a lynch-pin, and it helps the theme resonate greater than if he had simply told the story without it.His characters are believable, and he shows honest progression through their lives for the most part. The ending turns are a little forced, but not so much that it throws off the finale.I think for a first time author Jordan has written a good novel. His description and characterizations sometimes suffer from the pace of the plot. He has a habit of returning to familiar images too often - I counted three separate characters who \\"shoved their hands into their back pockets\\". Some events were foreshadowed so that the outcome was easily predictable. However, it was an easy and enjoyable read in just a couple of days.Overall the writing is pretty well done, but I appreciate mostly what the author is trying to accomplish. I read elsewhere that he was tired of Hollywood and other entertainment showing certain mistakes without consequences. Jordan doesn't shy back from showing the problems of his book's premise, and it is a promising direction for a Christian fiction book to pursue."},{"Title":"Something That Lasts","review":"To all outside appearances, Reverend David Parst has life completely under control. In the mid-seventies, his congregation at O'Fallon Bible Church in a St. Louis suburb has continued to grow and the Post-Dispatch has named him one of the 50 most influential leaders in the area. A devoted father to 12-year-old Jack and husband to Sarah, David is tied up in a church budget meeting in the opening pages of SOMETHING THAT LASTS. Yet his mind is a million miles from this meeting, focusing instead on a planned coffee meeting with congregational member Erika Balik. David is telling his wife and others that the meeting is an innocent catch-up session for a committee member who couldn't make the church session. In reality, though, David is having a sexual affair with Erika.During the Sunday morning announcements, a seemingly harmless request to see if there is anything additional to tell the church suddenly goes in a different direction. Erika's husband Ted stands up and begins to speak. His wife tugs on his sleeve but he ignores her and continues. Instead of an announcement, Ted makes a speech. When David tries to cut him short, Ted accuses the pastor of sin in his life. Ted admits his suspicions that his wife is having an affair and that he saw David leave a motel and kiss Erika goodbye. The church breaks out in chaos and even young Jack attempts to defend his father. Ted then runs out of the church and commits suicide in front of everyone.David separates from his family and begs for restoration --- yet it never comes. Jack refuses to have anything to do with his father. Sarah doesn't permit her husband to return, but they never officially get a divorce. David loses his church and his family. Months later he begins to pastor a small church in Elsa, Texas. The story fast forwards to his 10th anniversary and a single-like lifestyle. Secretly he attends his son's baseball games in college and keeps track of his family in hopes of reconnecting with them.The story then shifts to Jack, who has become a corporate lawyer yet is tied up within a company scandal. He is consumed with his work and physically lashes out at his wife Katie, who fears so much for her safety that she takes their daughter Lynn to live in another city with Sarah. The overriding message of this book is the lasting effects of sin in the life of a Christian and the powerful chain effect from a brief affair.A Dallas attorney, author James David Jordan has written a solid page-turning first novel. The intense conflict of the characters and their search for something that lasts provides a solid message for anyone reading this book.--- Reviewed by W.

I want so badly to see reality portrayed through Christian fiction. I don't mind happy endings, and I love to see God's hand shown in people's lives, but I want all this to be shown alongside the heartache and questions that most of us experience in our lives.That said, my opinion of this book was filtered through a very personal reality: my own father did the same thing as Pastor Parst, losing his marriage and church due to an adulterous relationship. I was 18 at the time, while my brother and sister were closer to Jack's age. Perhaps my own experiences make a fair judgment of this book impossible. I'll admit that. On the other hand, I loved Francine Rivers' portrayal of a similar subject in \\"And the Shofar Blew.\\"This book just didn't work for me, on a number of levels. The writing is decent, and the characters seem credible enough, even if the dialogue isn't always believable. (I especially tripped over the mother's insistence early on that her son not say \\"freaks me out.\\" What?! This is the type of stuff that really causes problems for pastor's kids.) I appreciated that Jordan tackled difficult issues, from sin and disease, to unforgiveness and death, but I needed to see a few hurdles overcome along the way. For example, the pastor's simple move into continued ministry came with no show of repentance to his previously betrayed congregation.All in all, if the idea of this book interests you, I believe you'll find it worth your time. For those of us who have struggled through the darkest hours of such things, it comes off without enough grit to seem fully credible. But like I said, I'm coming from a skewed perspective."},{"Title":"Something That Lasts","review":"I don't read much fiction. Somehow I tend to feel that I need to \\"learn a lesson\\" to make reading worth while. If I had held to that silly idea, it would have been my loss. This is an enormously compelling book! Mr. Jordan's realistic portrayal of deep struggles of the heart will give all but the most casual reader reason to take a penetrating look inside. This is a story of the invisible but, very real and protracted war for people's hearts; it is about the battle for a heart willing to both give and receive grace and forgiveness, something that for me seems to come by the inch rather than by the mile.Although some of the characters' circumstances were more spectacular than I have experienced, their struggles of dealing with deep pain took me to places in my own heart I often prefer to avoid. Ultimately, however, it is both a book about the grace and forgiveness found only in God and, a reminder that only as we receive those gifts from Him we can give them to others and ourselves.If you are looking for some light entertainment, this is not the book for you. But if you start it, you'll not want to put it down until you're finished. Unless it's to probe your own heart with God's light."},{"Title":"Something That Lasts","review":"In the beginning, I found myself staying up till the wee hours in the morning unable to put the book down. It became a movie in my mind and the writing brought me through the emotions of anger, disappointments, tears, and ultimately joy. If you have experienced the devastation caused by adultery (the bitterness) and its effect upon the children, read this book. At times, the emotional anguish was recreated in me and I had to put the book down; still I felt compelled to find out what would happen next. The writer helps you heal though the actions of the characters in the book. It opened my mind and gave me a new perspective. This book changed me. My thanks to the author for being brave enough to remind us that Christians make mistakes and forgiveness is the answer and Christ will never leave or forsake us. In a hurting world, we need more books like this one."},{"Title":"Something That Lasts","review":"I admit I was initially dubious that I could become deeply involved in this story, and nervous about how heavy-handed the Christian themes might be presented. How wonderful that I was quickly swept away by a compelling, beautifully articulated, clever narrative, so consumed in fact that I forgot I was reading a book. It was hard to tear myself away, reading late into the wee hours to find out what would become of characters I suddenly cared very much for. Perhaps the characters could be fleshed out more thoroughly, but even so I readily empathized with each of them as they struggled through crises that profoundly affect relationships and family. I was moved to tears a few times. When it was time for me to return to my own mundane reality, I was surprised how frequently the characters and themes of the book persisted in my thoughts as if they were real and immediate.I admire the author's skill in tackling such difficult subjects - death, adultery, estrangement, the fallibility/humanness of family/heroes/leaders (religious or otherwise), loss of faith - with apparent ease, grace and clarity. Mr. Jordan's book gives the reader a lot to think about, forcing a self-awareness that is so evidently missing from the mainstream. And he conveys a positive, hopeful message without ever becoming cloying or beating the reader over the head. The book speaks to anyone - not just Christians - who has a family, who cares about doing the right thing, who struggles with relationships, faith, and the meaning of existence.I wish more novels had such an effect. A plea to the author, please publish more. The public awaits."},{"Title":"Something That Lasts","review":"Author James David Jordan is a Dallas, TX attorney. He doesn't make his living as a writer. His first novel, Something That Lasts, was a labor of love, a work that took a full eight years to complete. Jordan freely admits that with his novel he wanted to \\"confront this prevalent fallacy which methodically lulls viewers into thinking that adultery is normal and--perhaps even more dangerously--harmless.\\" His novel does, in fact, open with an act of adultery, one committed by an upstanding preacher who deeply values his family. The remainder of the plot centers around the decades-long fall-out from this indiscretion.The closest parallel to Jordan's novel is the plot of a Lifetime Original movie. Jordan has a great message, but it is packaged in a supremely melodramatic form. We have a preacher who commits adultery, followed by a public suicide in church, then a wife with a life-threatening illness, not to mention the son who almost dies trying to save his puppy in a raging storm, a near-deadly car-crash, father-son estrangement, and more. The novel spans decades (three generations) in the lives of the Parst family, through the highs, lows, and strained relationships. In the end, Jordan successfully conveys his message that faith can buoy a family through tough times. Faith can serve as something that lasts.This is a book for fans of Adriani Trigiani and Sue Monk Kidd. Pick up Kidd's The Mermaid Chair if you liked this novel."},{"Title":"Something That Lasts","review":"This is the story of the Parst family. David Parst was a minister in O'Fallon, MO who seemed to have everything and then he threw it away in one night. He committed adultery. The husband of the woman he had a one night stand with commits suicide on David's church steps.What follows is the effect that one act had on his entire family for the rest of their lives. His wife - didn't want to divorce him but couldn't live with him. Shortly after their separation she is diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. His son, Jack, who at 12 learns of his father's affair in the middle of a church service where his father is giving the sermon and then sees the dead man on the front steps of the church. He is sure that the failure of his family, the man's death and then his mother's disease is all his father's fault. Can he ever forgive him? David, himself, has failed God, his family and himself. Is there forgiveness?Something That Lasts is an excellent, well written story. It tells of the strong faith in God that Sarah and David have that carry them through more than 30 years of challenges and struggles as well as good times. Realistically it also shows the bitterness Jack carries with him towards God and his father.The third part of the book is about Jack's life with Katie his wife and their son. It is about their tragedy and the pit that Jack falls into after losing his son. This part of the book is very emotional but also very inspirational. It is a long struggle but with his family's love and faith Jack climbs his way out of the pit of despair he has fallen into.I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Something That Lasts","review":"The Post-Dispatch named Reverend David Parst one of the fifty most influential leaders in the St. Louis area. David has a loving wife Sarah and a delightful twelve year old son Jack. His flock at the O'Fallon Bible Church thinks the world of him. He has everything going perfectly.At church on Sunday David asks his congregation whether there is anything anyone had to say; a minor gesture that always resulted in accolades or silence. Not this time. Ted Balik rises and claims that David is having an affair with his wife Erika before walking out of the edifice to shoot himself. David is stunned as his wife demands he leave, his son is devastated, and the congregation fires him. Seeking redemption, David becomes pastor to a small church in Elsa, Texas.A decade later David still needs forgiveness from his family and the Lord, but has no hopes as he keeps track of them albeit from a distance like serendipitously watching Jack play college baseball. Jack has become a corporate lawyer who abuses his wife Katie; she flees with their daughter Lynn to live with Sarah.Though a deep Christian character study that looks closely at the impact of a major sin, the protagonist could have starred any person, regardless of religion, abusing their position of power that includes trust in the individual. Thus James David Jordan makes a strong case that a transgression involving trust can prove to be SOMETHING THAT LASTS for a lifetime (and more) as the sins of the father reappear in the offspring. Repenting and even redemption does not always erase the sin as life is not an etch a sketch; this is superior morality fiction as the key players involved with the scandal seem genuine at the time of the adultery and years later.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Something That Lasts","review":"Reverend David Parst has it all: a devoted wife, a loving son, a successful church and community esteem. But all is not enough for David - he wants more. Rather than getting what he wants, however, David loses everything when a member of the congregation reveals David's adulterous affair with his wife, then commits suicide on the church steps.David's adultery shatters his family. David moves south while his wife and son, Sarah and Jack, move north. David eventually constructs a cordial long-distance relationship with Sarah. His bond with Jack, however, remains broken for thirty years. In the meantime, David's only connection to Jack comes when he skulks in the stands to watch his son play baseball. David and Jack finally reconnect, tenuously, when David is on the brink of death and Jack's marriage is on the verge of collapse. Shortly before David dies, Jack gains the strength, wisdom and faith, most of it imparted by his long-estranged father, to pick up the pieces of his own marriage and avoid repeating the errors committed by his father. Thus, the book closes with David's failure being redeemed by his son's renewed commitment to his family.In his debut novel, James David Jordan poignantly conveys that adultery never involves just two people. In this case, one disastrous affair resulted in two destroyed marriages, a tragic death and the long-term impairment of family relationships.The story is well paced and the characters are compelling. They are not perfect but they are basically good people trying to live good, honest lives. Several of them are sincerely religious but they are neither fanatical nor stereotypical. The reader can't resist hoping that all of them will find happiness and success in their lives.Mr. Jordan does a good job exploring the complexities of David's relationship with Jack. Jack's rejection of his father is plausible, as is David's desire to reconnect with his son. One cannot help pitying David as he hides in the stands, aching to let Jack know he's there. The notion that it could take thirty years to rebuild their connection is not far-fetched. Some severed relationships take even longer to rebuild. And sadly, some severed relationships never rebuild. In this case, the relationship is restored but fragile when David dies.Mr. Jordan's handling of David and Sarah's relationship is less convincing. Their first encounter after the affair's disclosure is powerful. David is repentant. Sarah is angry. Not only is she angry, she is thoroughly repulsed by David, so much so that she cannot tolerate the feel of his hand on her shoulder. The next time David and Sarah interact, however, they have reached a rather amicable relationship. The reader cannot help wondering how the relationship progressed, magically it seems, from revulsion to amiability. Throughout the book there is very little interaction between these two. The relationship frequently is portrayed through third-person accounts rather than actual dialogue between the two characters. Even though David is estranged from Jack throughout most of the book, there is actually far more dialogue between them in the last few months of David's life than there is between David and Sarah over a thirty-year span.Mr. Jordan's apparent desire to explore the complexities of strained or broken father-son relationships is admirable. It's certainly a topic that needs sensitive examination. In a book in which the act of adultery sets the story's central background, however, it seems reasonable to expect more examination of the marital relationship than is undertaken here. David and Sarah's relationship raises many questions and leaves them unanswered. Mr. Jordan's failure to explore these questions is the book's greatest weakness.I highly recommend Something That Lasts to readers who are interested in topics related to family life, particularly the topic of fatherhood. Readers interested in Christian literature that avoids clich&eacute; characters will find this book refreshing and inspiring. Be forewarned: the story is incredibly moving; keep a box of tissues handy."},{"Title":"Something That Lasts","review":"This book was absolutely fabulous!

Often church members look up to ministers and their families as the model and ideal of Christian living, without realizing that ministers and their families are simply sinners in need of the same mercy and grace essential to the people sitting in the pews each Sunday.

It begins with private eye Mike Shayne's secretary, Lucy Hamilton, admitting an old acquaintance into her apartment. It turns out the young man is suffering a gun-shot wound, and when Shayne shows up, she hides the fellow in her bedroom. Police searching the apartment building are rudely ejected by Shayne, who has no idea a suspect is hiding out in the next room. Later Lucy tells him about it, he makes an anonymous call to the police, then discovers the visitor has been murdered - his throat slit, on top of the gun-shot wound - while they talked. One thing leads to another as he ditches the body and tries to determine whether the man was guilty of murdering a young woman earlier in the evening.There's a very interesting sequence about a payoff to a bad guy in the middle of the Miami causeway. There's also a clever clue in a ransom note near the end.In the movies, Mike Shayne was played by both Lloyd Nolan (A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, Island In The Sky, Airport) and Hugh Beaumont (Ward Cleaver on Leave It To Beaver).

At 12 x 9 inches and 4 pounds, it\`s a huge book which isn\`t appropriate for long journeys but it makes an excellent coffee table book.In fact, I think it\`s the most incredible achievement ever done to portray the nature of one country. Printed on black, very fine paper, it\`s a nice book looking through.The book is divided into the following sections : Seas, Islands & Littorals, Forests & Savannahs, Mountains & Inhabitants(which are actually a vertical journey through the land, from the bottom of the sea to the tops of the Andes). The vertical views of the colombian coast are absolutely gorgeous and awe-inspiring. There are also many majestic, almost poster-like pictures of pelicans flying towards the sky, inside caves and above the surface of the water. The closeups of many fishes are also a feast for the eyes, as are the beautifull flowers of the rainforest. The fantastic views of the Andes makes anyone wish they were there. And the first picture of the book on bromelias with the blue clouds and the sun melting down in the horizon will open more \\"wow\\" and \\"aahh\\"\`s than fireworks of the millenium.This book may be expensive, but if you come across a copy, do not hesitate to take it - it\`s worth the money, I promise you that."},{"Title":"Tropic: The Nature of Colombia","review":"I purchased this book for someone else, but I'm going to keep it and get him another copy.

The premise is that Kabbalistic thought, which is defined in the book as the development of a specific area of Jewish mysticism, arose at that time as a result of Moorish, Western and Jewish philosophical thought in an environment of oppression.

The story centers around a court case, in which a man and his father are being tried for burning an army jeep. The case is kept very low-profile, and the accuseds are not concerned at all by the charges, which seem suspiciously minor. Boll's finely drawn characters and dialogue make the story eminently palatable, as he asks the reader subtle questions about art and its place in the state."},{"Title":"End of a mission","review":"This droll tale of a father and son and their small German village is probably too slow for many readers.

(Isn't it wonderful that the book dealers who pay a nickle on the dollar for products they turn around and sell for exhorbitant prices have had their abusive monopoly over hard to find books busted by the Internet?) Anyway, climbing down from the soapbox, Amazon's treatment of this excellent edition is a very disturbing issue - considering this is a novel by Boll, and not one of Amazon's numberless legions of hack writers. Maybe the story is a little more subversive than I realized.In sum: A quiet underground tale on post war Germany (1965 to be exact) with a telling presentation of small town life. And in addition, Boll's flair for characters is on full display. Lurking around the edges is just a hint of Erich Kastner's sense of fun. Boll brings a little more to the table than the delightful humorist. In the case of End of the Mission the story's charm is undeniable, even as it serves, as so many of Boll's books do, as a sort of litmus test of the reader. Many books, overtly more serious, fall short of the subtle miracle Boll works here."},{"Title":"The Other Kingdom","review":"\\"The Other Kingdom\\" is a refreshing reminder of the days before world-class sport became a cold, professional exercise in earning money. It is unashamedly elitist, socially and intellectually as well as in terms of athletics, in a way that unmistakeably dates it. The protagonist's life, overshadowed by the reputation of a world-famous father, strikes an uneasy balance between his running, his girl friend, and his study of the German Sturm und Drang poets with their quest for heroism. At first glance, some of the athletics background looks to have been copied from real life - until you realize that this book was published in 1964, about the time of the Tokyo Olympics. So the runner who misses an Olympic medal by sprinting too soon, but later gets a European title, is not Michel Jazy: that didn't happen till 1966! Another amusing touch is the cover picture, which shows the young Herb Elliott. (If you're going to borrow from real life, why not borrow the best?)Courtesy of Amazon, you can read the first few pages here. Note how skilfully the author introduces all the main characters while describing a training run. This is easily the best account I have ever read of how it feels to run far faster than you ever thought possible. Something similar happened to Jim Ryun when he \\"unintentionally\\" broke the world record for the half-mile while competing in a collegiate event in 1966, leaving world-class rivals far behind without any particular effort. Ryun took nearly five seconds off his personal best that day, and soon after broke the world record for the mile.Bottom line: it's not a pure running story, by a long chalk. Instead, it shows convincingly how world-class sporting achievement must be rooted in a person's whole life."},{"Title":"The Other Kingdom","review":"Telling the tale of Colin Wornock, an Irish runner striving to break into the upper reaches of international track, The Other Kingdom does what many other books about running does not, it goes past just the running aspect of the characters life. The book has a number of sub plots that all interwind, that of Colin's mind, his realationship with his more exprienced lover, that with a family friend who doubles as an analyzing proffesor, his training partners and finaly his fiesty coach. At times the plot can be weighted down with hypothectical conversation about the nature of heroism and pushing oneselves but all in all serves a greater purpose of Colin's final victory over himself."},{"Title":"This Book Will Change Your Life","review":"This book made me laugh out loud on several occasions.

David Copperfield, if you are out there reading this or googling your name, please, read this book if you haven't already. You too, Madonna and Tiger Woods. This book will change your life.This is a funny, laugh-out-loud type of book. With 365 days of activities to change your life, the goal is simple. On Day 247, you should eat everything with chopsticks, and on Day 276, you should go to the zoo and actually feed the animals. I've always wanted to feed a lion, and this has given me the courage to actually go and sacrifice a gazelle to my childhood dreams. Not really, of course, this book is about the comedy and not about actually getting you arrested for something stupid. At least I hope not. But there are some fun activities to confuse and possibly scare people.With fun illustrations and comedy in small but heavy doses (if you do decide to just read one page a day, which I couldn't do because the comedy just kept driving me forward), THIS BOOK WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE will change your life, or at least give you ideas for silly things to do to annoy your friends and family."},{"Title":"This Book Will Change Your Life","review":"I bought this for a crush's birthday so that by doing the daily tasks, we would have something to talk about, and maybe have dates to do some of them.

Each day you are given a different assignment. Gatecrashing a funeral was weird yet extraordinary. Eating my meals with chopsticks proved a challenge while eating my salad and sandwich. Some assignments are downright dangerous or too boring to do but when I asked an Italian senior citizen marry me he said yes!(no I didn't marry him but he seemed really happy to be asked).This book gives you more meaning and excitement to a rather stressful or boring humdrum life. This book can last you years and one of the funnest assignments (in the Change Your Life sequel) has you eating just one color of food all day long to eat and drink. Highly recommend going brown and dieting on brownies, tootsie rolls and rootbeer all day long for bundles of energy and happiness. Have fun with this book but look around first so you won't get caught."},{"Title":"This Book Will Change Your Life","review":"This is a wacky gift book that would be great for the person you're not sure what to give. The book gives you instructions for living for the next 365 days. But the instructions are not like any mainstream Dr. Phil book. For example, one of the daily instructions is to make sure you have a friend from every racial/ethnic group. Call that something out of the ordinary! This book is not for the weak-hearted but will definetly get you thinking. Great for the intellectual in your group or just someone who likes to laugh."},{"Title":"This Book Will Change Your Life","review":"I purchased the book. I read the book.

I had passed on buying this book several times - but finally gave into my juvenile whims! It is silly and crazy - a fantastic conversation topic. I have tried to do some of the stunts. It really requires that you \\"put your self out there.\\" If you do all 365 of the activities, you would certainly be a different person."},{"Title":"This Book Will Change Your Life","review":"This is a great book. It's hilarious if you have a sense of humor or know someone who does. Just doing a few of the activites in the book brings back your childhood and makes you laugh. It's just a good time book. Even if you buy it just to lay around on your coffee table, it's a good ice-breaker!

It's filled with certain things to do, or objectives for every day of the year. While it probably won't change your life as the title suggests, it will give you some cool ideas. It is the perfect book to leave out on a coffee table or end table in your house and when you have guests over, if they happen to pick it up, it is a guaranteed conversation starter.

Each things to do is unique. They don't give you cheesy, boring or obvious things to do like go to the movies, learn a language or make a candlelight dinner for your date instead each one is very specific, interactive and guaranteed to bring instant enlightenment or give a jolt of creativity. For instance, consider the one where they tell you that you are legally entitled to buy a unit of an item from a package like you can open a beer from the box and buy it, and encourage you to do so and test shop owner's legal knowledge. Or how about the one where they tell you to collapse Bangladesh's economy? Or if you are an inventive type then how about that one where you invent punctuation marks. Telling you, this book is one of a kind!"},{"Title":"This Book Will Change Your Life","review":"This book was fun to start, but the farther I got into it the more I realized I need time and money to do most of the day to day assignments in it.

So before you buy this, make sure you're ready to book your trip to France."},{"Title":"This Book Will Change Your Life","review":"\\"This Book Will Change Your Life\\" may not completely change your life, but just flipping through the pages can still add a little pizazz in your everyday happenings. While the tasks are often extremely goofy--or too out-there to actually complete--I appreciate how it challenges you to live outside the box in small, silly ways: ways that that will make a difference over time or, if anything, make a good story to tell strangers/sinner party guests/your friends/your significant other's parents.

You really should stop inviting him to your dinner parties.Also check out Do Unto Others: Hilarious Ways to Screw with People's Heads by Heimberg and Gomberg.

Who among us can't use a push every now and then to break out of the humdrum routine of our daily lives? Some of the less far out suggestions in this thick paperback can certainly do that!

After spending a few minutes at UO, skimming the book, I thought it'd be a fun challenge to try to go all 365 days and complete all the things they tell you to do. I found some of the things in here a little strange, but I guess that's how they get you to \\"change your life\\". I found myself forgetting to do these activities after a couple weeks."},{"Title":"This Book Will Change Your Life","review":"I had high hopes for this book, if for nothing else, then as a chuckle-inducing bathroom read.I must say, I was gravely disappointed. The book literally did not elicit a single laugh from me, and most of the \\"suggestions\\" would only lead to you quickly becoming the supreme village idiot. The only reason I read the entire book was because I just had to know HOW bad this book could get. Quite bad, indeed, it reminds of a train wreck: so bad you just can't look away.Now, I consider my self to have quite the sense of humor, yet this book just did not deliver on any level. If you consider yourself levelheaded, I'm sure you will agree.If you want to read some real good chaff, go ahead and get this book. My copy is in the trash. I'm ashamed to have owned it."},{"Title":"This Book Will Change Your Life","review":"I have devoted much time to the exercises in this book and so far my life has not changed (drats!) but I have accomplished making a complete fool out of myself (which, to be honest, is no real change).So far I watched a movie starting with an \\"F\\" (Fern Gully), imagined everyone naked (which I do not recommend because it eventually becomes rather icky), ignored a day (more difficult then it sounds), glued a spatula to my arm (strangely no one noticed), managed to lure a fly into the box but missed, tried growing another toe (no luck, yet), went on a one minute hunger strike (more difficult then it sounds), applied for a knighthood (no response, yet), imagined myself as that old man of day 362 and realized that no I am not fulfilled plus I forgot to buy a copy of that weeks TV Guide, took the psychopath test (nope, not telling the results), discovered I am not symmetrical, attempted to invent a new color but only ended up with a mucky sort of beige, spent an entire day ticking off each minute (boring yet profound), and a few other things I cannot or will not mention.Oh! I even combined two days worth of activities by memorizing Aubrey's face and dressing like a tourist. I searched the city for her, while stopping at tourist attractions which made me recognize the need to move to someplace more exciting, but never found her. I really want to know that secret she is supposedly harboring. I feel it necessary to warn you that I truly believe the whole \\"Aubrey\\" thing may be a trick.Oh! A really eerie thing is that an actual photo of me is in this book. Yes, really! They must have \\"borrowed\\" it from a friend's website, that is the only way they could have gotten a hold of it. I tell you, it was quite startling to see myself on one of the pages - I didn\`t know whether to be flattered or not. Anyway, it gave me a great opportunity to take advantage of the suggestion for day 256 - tearing up all photos that make you look ugly - and ripped out the page for day 130. I request you do the same and forget you ever saw that picture, please. I look much better in person - I Swear!!!All in all, I suppose I must admit I've rather enjoyed most of the stuff I've tried. I am starting to feel a bit hysterical so I guess that is a sign it's working.

This humorous parody goes where no other book of its kind has gone before to lift you from your humdrum life. Each illustrated and eye-catching page gives a wacky daily suggestion, including such gems as inventing a new way of peeling potatoes, returning all your junk mail, using your left hand all day, and sticking a message on fruit. But amongst the silliness is some advice that makes sense, such as a weekend with no TV, expanding your vocabulary, or picking up litter in the street. If you follow the suggestions in this book, your life will surely change, although whether for the better or worse is up for debate. Read it and laugh!"},{"Title":"This Book Will Change Your Life","review":"I couldn't stop myself from chuckling - even laughing out loud - at times when I read this book. I chose it for our guest bathroom to give people some light reading while otherwise occupied. It's a funny, lighthearted book that has a very skewed way of looking at things. The daily activities vary greatly: some funny, some whimsical, some with that Huh? factor.The book is wonderfully laid out with a variation of design that makes for delicious eye candy and draws the eye in throughout the book. It's a great deal of fun and would be perfect as a silly gift for a birthday, secret santa or something to brighten one's day.**One word of warning for those with younger children - there is some adult humor of a sexual nature so don't put this in a place where young eyes can see this (if your house indeed has younger children). It's not too explicit but enough to instigate a \\"what does that mean\\" type of conversation."},{"Title":"This Book Will Change Your Life","review":"On a purely comedic level, This Book Will Change Your Life does its job and does it well. In coffee table/bathroom book fashion, it is eye-catching, diverting, and easy to digest in small, random doses. Also, since all 365 entries have their own look and feel, it will appeal to a variety of humors and tastes.Despite its obviously hokey premise, the book's aims are (for the most part) legitimate. At least, they take great pains for you to believe that they are. There are a few mostly impossible suggestions (very few people could manage, for instance, to spend an entire day underwater) which diminish any seriousness one might bring to the book's claims, but overall, I found myself wishing that I had both the time and the energy to put into motion the book's proposal of daily life changing.Ironically, I think the book's best impact would be on people who do try to live out the ideas mentioned in the pages, if for no other reason than it would make the humor in those ideas more poignant and personal. Things like going one day without your sense of sight, or mailing your picture and $5 to a random address, or fasting for one day are funny to read about, but their practice, I imagine, would provide one's life with a definite, if not brief, edge. Perhaps your life as a whole won't change, but that day will certainly be very, very different.Because the book's humor is so overt and, at the same time, subtle and invasive, it's a given that few people will try to put into practice the book's demands (even though mulitple entries promise fame \\"in the next book\\" for people who turn in their various results). This, I think, is a shame. Even if some of the book's suggestions are mundane (A \\"do it yourself\\" day suggests that you change a light bulb), unfeasible (again, all day underwater?), or a deliberate waste of space (I'm thinking of the gender specific entries, or the day that says, \\"ignore this entry\\" and has no suggestions), I would be pleased to see a world of Book Owners putting the ideas into practice. Not only would they get a kick out of it, but the rest of us might, too.On the other hand, it is much safer to just read the thing."},{"Title":"This Book Will Change Your Life","review":"This book will change your life. It is a list of 365 daily tasks, and if you complete just a few, you life will definitely change. Daily suggestions range from the practical (\\"leave a copy of your house keys with a friend\\"), to the silly (\\"tattoo a banana\\") to the bizarre (\\"bleed here\\"), to those that really make you think (prepare your famous last words). This book will help you get over fears, find yourself, make friends, increase knowledge. There's just so much I want to list, but not enough time, so go get your own copy!Just about any adult will enjoy this book. Some of the suggestions have very little writing and the entire book is full of great pictures, so even the non-enthusiastic reader won't be bored with it. The only warning I have is that this book includes some \\"naughtiness.\\" I would suggest it as a gift for a single man, but would be appreciated by just about any adult.

It will make you stop taking yourself so darn seriously. If you actually go out and do some of these things you will learn about yourself in ways that you wouldn't otherwise. This book will show you how to tattoo a banana (it's actually pretty cool!) and suggest you &quot;return to childhood&quot; for a day. There is even a handy 'pregnancy test' in the book, just in case you might need it. While most of these activites will suceed in making you laugh, a few are serious (or semi-serious) and are the ones that truly might change your life. &quot;Introduce yourself to someone you know but never speak to,&quot; &quot;Destroy all bad photos&quot; to release the bad karma,&quot;Treasured Memories Day,&quot; and Day 136 is truly the most important of all.

I was looking for daily prompts to guide my writing during dry spells, and while this book does have a fair few such prompts, it's not designed for lengthy responses in the book itself.Do NOT mistake this for a self-help or life-changing mantra kind of book; sorry about the title. Many of the prompts are not the sort of thing for a gullible reader looking for a self-help book, or even just a fun self-challenge-mix-it-up page-a-day book (Jour 209: Smoke 60 Gauloises is certainly an expensive challenge, to say the least. This book does not help you quit smoking).This Book Will Change your life is a fun read -- and I mean en-ter-tain-ing -- but it is not exactly inspirational writing material. While all the prompts are hilarious (see Day 53: Return Your Junk Mail), only a few (like Day 320: Posterity Day) might get your creative writing flowing.If you tend to write a long narrative or stream of consciousness journal, this book can help you get there, but you'll need a blank book (I recommend anything from Moleskine to Eccolo to legal pads) to flesh out everything you might like to say in response to things like Day 271: Today, Talk to a Child, or Day 349: Today, Don't Answer the Phone. The book provides small, post-it sized \\"Notes\\" areas, which again speaks to a fun read, but not much to write.The Writers Benrik get 5 stars for entertainment value, but I give this 4/5 because I was looking for more of a writing journal. On the other hand, if you need something to spice up a party or even just enliven your coffee table, enjoy!"},{"Title":"This Book Will Change Your Life","review":"I bought the book with the sheer curiosity of finding out how will the content of the book changes my life. After receiving the book yesterday and flipping through the pages, i concluded that im not a crazy person and i highly doubt that i will ever try any of the exotic things mentioned in the book.

I bought the book because I witnessed someone play one of the pranks, going into a police department, announcing you are turning yourself in and then not speaking for the remainder of the day.

I went out and got myself the Ball Complete Canning Book and it was fine, but it always seemed like I was missing a lot of information. All of those recipes were talking about small batches of things. I needed something that gave me lots of recipes that used lots of produce. That's when my mom handed me this book. Not only is the best damn pepper relish recipe ever inside these covers, but a wealth of canning, freezing and preserving information to boot. These are the canning recipes your grandma made. And every method of preserving food is here, too. I have used the revolutionary method that this book holds for making sauerkraut several times with great success. But it even has the old way too. And instructions for large batches and small batches. You wanna make pickles? Not only is there every kind of pickle recipe in the world in here but also different methods for curing, brining or quick processing.I feel like I am harping a lot on the canning section, but I want to say that the freezing section is just as in depth. One of the best stuffed zucchini recipes is in here and how to freeze it. Sauces, make ahead meals, meats, vegetables, soups, and stews they are all in here and directions on how to freeze properly.There are also parts of this book I haven't even read yet!

However, my enthusiasm for the old recipes and methods is restrained by the fact that they use chemicals and food substances that today we know contribute to disease and illness. For example, corn syrup. Another one is \\"salt\\" depending on the type of salt used. Refined sugar is another ingredient to avoid. We have new, natural food substances that are substituted for the old-fashioned ingredients: coconut for sugar (corn syrup) and oil, sea salt or Himalayan salt, to name a few. Food coloring tests positive for causing cancer. Otherwise, the classic recipes can still be enjoyed without health concerns.

Lee,\\" four volumes, published 1934-35, winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1935; \\"Lee's Lieutenants,\\" three volumes, published 1942-44; \\"George Washington,\\" seven volumes, published 1949-57 (the final volume completed posthumously by his assistants), winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1958.These fourteen thick books are not only good in themselves, they have virtually set the playing field for all subsequent histories. To a historian, Freeman is simply there, and he cannot be avoided by anyone studying Lee or his army, or George Washington or his. This is not to say that Freeman is either an ultimate authority or that he is infallible. Progress has been made and new information has been discovered since Freeman's time. (For example, modern metal detectors have established that a few battles and firefights actually took place in locations where no surviving written records had put them.)Nevertheless, any historian putting notions to paper in contradiction to those of Freeman must do it consciously and only when fully prepared to defend his departure from Freeman's well-known line.In his forward to \\"Lee's Lieutenants,\\" Freeman wrote that after completing his biography of Robert E. Lee in 1934, he began to collect material for a biography of George Washington, but he \\"found that mentally it was not easy to leave the struggle about which one had been writing for twenty years and more. A question plagued and pursued: In holding the light exclusively on Lee, had one put in undeserved shadow the many excellent soldiers of his army? 'Stonewall' Jackson undoubtedly has won a permanent place in the history of American wars; Longstreet and \\"Jeb\\" Stuart probably have, but at least a score of other able officers who fought under the same leader and added to his fame, rapidly are being forgotten.... [I]t did not seem permissible to pass to another period of military history until that company of gallant gentlemen had been placed in their proper relationship to their chief. It was beyond one's capacity to paint all of them fully, but it might not be impossible to prepare, so to say, a succession of sketches. In June of 1936, this was undertaken.\\"...It was assumed that this work could begin with a brief review of the status and personnel of the Confederate command on June 1, 1862, the date when General Lee opened the headquarters of the Army of Northern Virginia. Before inquiry had proceeded far, it became apparent that many of Lee's problems of personnel were set for him in advance. His hopes and plans were circumscribed by appointments and by organization, good and bad, that went back to the spring of 1861. Command was not created but was inherited by Lee.\\"After years of research, Freeman admitted that he had found no proper way to present his information: a history of the Army of Northern Virginia would be too much a rehash of his \\"Robert E. Lee\\"; a series of separate biographies of Lee's subordinate commanders would involve endless duplication and repetition. At length he recalled a letter from Lee to John B. Hood, that Texan, the bravest of the brave, who had lost so much of his anatomy in the service of the Confederacy (and, alas, would soon lose Atlanta, too). \\"Lee answered: 'I agree with you ... in believing that our Army would be invincible if it could be properly organized and officered. There were never such men in an Army before. They will go anywhere and do anything if properly led. But there is the difficulty--proper commanders--where can they be obtained?' Enough was known of Lee's difficulties to make it clear that he constantly was seeking 'proper' commanders. Was not that,\\" Freeman asked, \\"a possible basis for a study of Lee's Lieutenants? Might not the book be a review of the command of the Army of Northern Virginia, rather than a history of the Army itself?\\"In three massive, dignified, black-bound volumes containing 2395 pages of text plus CXLIII pages of introductory material and photographs, Freeman demonstrated that the answer to his rhetorical question was a resounding yes!This is a magnificent collective study of the strengths and weaknesses of as remarkable a group of men who ever trod on American soil: Joseph E. Johnston, Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard, James Longstreet, Thomas Jonathan \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, \\"Jeb\\" Stuart, Richard Ewell, Ambrose Powell Hill, Daniel Harvey Hill, Jubal Early, John Bell Hood, John Brown Gordon, Fitzhugh Lee [1865, Major General, Confederate States Army; 1898, Major General, United States Army] and many, many of others, perhaps a hundred and fifty in all. It is a headlong tale of bravery, occasional cowardice, steely competence, painful incompetence, dogged determination, selfish politicking, glorious triumph and, of course, total ruin.This is an American epic, told in the heightened, formal and very wise words of an American Homer.Five brilliantly shining stars with appropriate drum rolls and flourishes!LEC/AM/8-08"},{"Title":"British Tommy 1914-18 (Warrior)","review":"This volume covers much of the same materiel that was included in the British Infantry Equipments, 1908-1980 and British Army 1914-1918 titles in the Men At Arms series.It also covers much of the same as in Chappells own publications in British Army in the Twentieth Century.

Her dad, an apothecary, has just taken on a new apprentice, Raz Songsterson. Raz is clearly keeping something hidden away.And, like in many fantasies, the world is in danger. Dulcinea must use flute magic (better description in the book) to rescue peole from a dragon, who was conjured by the evil Society of Mages. When Dulcinea's father realizes that Raz is a talented, skilled mage, he acidently involves himself and his daughter in a power battle that risks the entire world. All standing between them and possible chaos is three magicians, including heroine Dulcinea...I'll admit it. I'm a sucker for stories about magicians and people discovering new powers, such books as Diana Wynne Jones, TA Barron, and Jane Yolen's &quot;Wizard Hall.&quot; I was not disappointed by &quot;Dulcinea,&quot; and I doubt other wizard-fans will as well. (I especially liked the concept of flute magic...)Dulcinea is a very cool heroine in a genre where too often the heroines are Buffy-types or weenies. She manages to be precisely what is expected in this situation -- a teenage girl who ends up in a power struggle with the Society, and who grows in personality throughout the book. Her changing relationships with her father and Raz were genuinely intriguing. Raz and Dulcinea's dad are equally realistic as their perceptions change (and I honestly did not know for a while what was up with Raz)This is not a dumbed-down book in style (one paragraph contains &quot;apex&quot; and &quot;inanimate&quot;). It's very descriptive and the author does not skimp on complexity or unique ideas. Such creatures as dragons and wizards are given new spins in this book. (My only quibble would be that in tense situations, a little too much notice is paid to details, but that's a small one)Definitely a five-star book. Fans of Harry Potter or Diana Wynne Jones would love this magical tale."},{"Title":"Dulcinea","review":"I'm not a big fan of fantasy fiction although I did read one Harry Potter book because of all the hype last year. I like to read books in different genres though and so I was intrigued by this book by Shalanna Collins and was immediately drawn in to her fantasy world where a teenage girl is grows up with a father who is a practitioner magic in a town where such things are taken for granted.Dulcinea's world is a fascinating one and the many descriptive details made me marvel at the skill of the author who set the stage for a struggle between good and evil, while, at the same time depicting the up and down emotions of Dulcinea's coming of age. I particularly liked her relationship with the young man magic maker who is forced to appreciate Dulcinea's skill in making magic when she saves his life on several occasions. There's a dragon in this book as well as a cast of characters that spring full-blown from the author's imagination as well as a sense of tension throughout. And the author's sense of humor kept the whole reading experience fun. My only criticism of the book is that it was a bit too wordy for my taste and I would have liked to see it edited down by 50 or more pages. However, I know this book will appeal to fantasy fans, and especially to young adults."},{"Title":"Dulcinea","review":"Fantasy, I believe, needs a special touch. That touch needs to be light. I can't imagine Tom Clancy writing successful fantasy, unless your idea of the genre is blowin' things up real good. Steinbeck tried a form of it and flopped mightily. Too heavy, too earthbound. Shalanna Collins needn't worry. She has the gossamer touch, the light-as-helium way of putting things that suspends the disbelief lurking inside many readers. She draws on legends and beliefs at least as ancient as the nebulous beginnings of Freemasonry; Mozart drew from the same well in his masterpiece opera, &quot;The Magic Flute.&quot; But if I'm going to draw musical analogies, the composer Shalanna Collins brings most to mind is Felix Mendelssohn, especially as he was at seventeen, writing the overture to &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream.&quot; Shalanna shares the same fleet, quicksilver turn of a phrase, the same infallible instincts for rhythm and pace that set Mendelssohn -- and Mozart -- apart from their more ponderous brother-composers. Dulcinea the Character acts sixteen. That's a neat trick for a writer whose adolescence was left behind at least a decade ago. Add to that Ms. Collins's deft handling of the heavier characters, such as Raz and Dulcinea's stern, somewhat duplicitous father, and it starts becoming plain just how much talent went into the creation of this shimmering, magical tale. I expect to encounter many more Shalanna Collins books in the years ahead, and I have every reason to believe each new one will be richer and more lovingly crafted than the one before."},{"Title":"Dulcinea","review":"I've read a lot of fantasy books...A LOT...and I like them all. Yes, I've even read the famous Harry Potter series. But when I read Dulcinea, I felt a breath of fresh air. I started reading and I couldn't put it down! I finally conked out in the early hours dreaming that I was Dulcinea, and that there was someone like Raz who liked me and was there for me. And yes, I am a sucker for intelligent romances such as this. But more than that, Dulcinea is a great, intelligent fantasy story that doesn't put down the reader...rather, the reader is taken along as an interested observer of all the goings-on. Everyone who reads this will find it easy to relate to Dulcinea. Seeing her deal with new situations, growing up, discovering the power she had in her and having confidence in herself, is a real treat. All in all, reading Dulcinea, has been a wonderful ride and I don't want to get off! I wish I had Dulcinea's Dragon in my hands right now! Hats off to Shalanna Collins for writing this book!"},{"Title":"Dulcinea","review":"Okay, she's a little older than Harry Potter, but she's just barely old enough to be coming into her magical powers. But Dulcinea Brown still gets to save the world!This book is a romp, a thoroughly enjoyable light fantasy with a great deal of charm -- *but* it also works on a deeper level. You can read it as a lighthearted story, or you can let it make you thoughtful as it raises issues. Sixteen-year-old Dulcinea Brown has discovered a new branch of magic, which she uses when she plays her flute. She's overprotected, the daughter of an apothecary who's a magician as well. Her father takes on a mysterious new apprentice, Raz, who appeals to her as no young man has done before. Raz is not who he seems, and the three of them are dragged into an intrigue. They have to foil the plot of the Society of Mages to conjure magical dragons and attack the city at festival time. It's more than that, because if the dragons are brought from their plane to the physical plane (unbeknownst to the Society), the very fabric of reality may be torn, and all the energy from that plane could rush to the physical plane and destroy the world.All through the tale, even during the opening scene, Dulcie and Raz have some innocent romantic tension (she has an admitted crush on him, while his feelings toward her are more restrained). Dulcinea's relationship to her father changes as he realizes she is becoming more powerful than he, plus he gets put under a spell for most of the book and is unpredictable. Dulcinea doesn't know how far she can trust Raz, either, so has to learn to rely on herself, as in any coming-of-age tale. The characters are very real people, and their relationships and reactions to each other are complicated and not always easy to define (just like real life). All the characters change by the end of the tale, even the baby dragon they rescue from the evil Society of Mages. It's set in an intriguing version of Colonial times.I don't want to give too much away or scare anyone off, but I'd think that if you enjoyed Harry Potter, Diana Wynne Jones, or maybe the &quot;Redwall&quot; books, you would enjoy this."},{"Title":"Dulcinea","review":"This book hooked me from page 1. I didn't want to put the book down. My rating is only a 3 because I feel that the book fell apart in the last chapters. While, I like happy endings, this book wrapped things up in hardly more than a paragraph."},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"The heart and soul of a champion: his life, his career, and his game. To understand basketball, you have to understand Larry Bird. Arguably the greatest all-around player the game has ever known, he led the Boston Celtics from the basement to three world championships, collecting three NBA Most Valuable Player awards along the way. Yet, despite these massive accomplishments, Bird has rarely talked to the press, and much about the man has remained a mystery. Now in Drive, the long-silent superstar sets the record straight, revealed a side of himself, and of basketball, you've never see before. Larry Bird grew up in the small town of French Lick, Indiana. His family was not very well off. Infact, they would occasionally stay at his grandmother's home. When Larry was twelve he found that he had a God-given ability to play basketball. He knew he was blessed and knew he had to do something about it. Everyday Larry would practice, practice, practice. Shooting foul shots, threes, it didn't matter, he just love the game. Even when he broke his ankle he would still shoot free throws every day. Larry's father committed suicide when Larry was still young. This broke his heart, but he knew his father did what he thought was best for the family. Bird was a celebrity on his High School basketball team in French Lick. The population of the town was only 2,100, but 4,000 people attended his last HS game. After high school he enrolled at Indiana, but never played, dropping out and then hitch-hiking home. He waited a year to be eligible to play at Indiana State. He brought respectability to the Indiana State program which ended in losing to Magic Johnson's Michigan State team in the NCAA Tournament Title Game in 1979. Larry left Indiana State with a career scoring average of better than 30 points a game, fifth all-time in NCAA history, and a 3-year school record of 81-13. Larry was named the 1978-79 Sporting News Player of the Year and won the Naismith and Wooden Awards. He was the number six pick in the 1978 draft by Boston, as a junior, but he joined the team a year later, because he chose to stay in school for his last year of eligibility. His stellar play in his first year led to his Rookie of the Year selection in 1980.We all remember his ability to hit the remarkable shot and don't forget his commercials with Michael Jordan where he makes the unbelievable shots. NBA players probably still have nightmares of his smooth jumper that would fall with deadly accuracy from ten feet or twenty feet. There may never be another with such a consistent sweet stroke. However, the legendary Celtic charm could not jump. He was slow, uncoordinated, but if you gave him a locomotive to pull he could do it for you. I'm not saying he was buff or strong or anything, I just mean he was a workhorse. He would not give up. Bird's all-time stats are an impressive: 21,791 points (11th. all-time), 1,556 steals (8th all-time), 0.886 FT Percentage (fourth all-time), 8,974 rebounds, 5,965 assists and 897 games played. He has a career 24.3 scoring average to lead the Celtics all-time list. Larry Bird was a successful player due both to talent and hard work. He was usually the first Celtic to arrive on game day when he would practice hitting jump shots for hours from everywhere on the floor, including dozens of free throws. This effort and ethic of work that he showed is an example I would like to follow. After reading this book I thought to myself, am I going to play varsity this year, and I going to achieve this goal and be able to dunk on DEC. 20 this year. Birdman has gone from a small town gangly country boy to an impressive person and player. The time he put in, the commitment he showed to his team. He played his entire career with the Celtics. This shows me how a player should be, faithful to your duties, contracts, and other commitments. He didn't just give up on basketball after his marks forced him to drop out, he prevailed and continued basketball and then went to college.As his marks were so poor this shows me another basic fundamental to make it far in basketball, grades. Although my goals say I will play at college level, I will never be able to achieve this without the proper grades to do so. Academics are a very important part of my future.This book is and awesome book in which I give five stars to. It was well worth my time to read and I hope to read it over again. It has inspired me to do my best and anything is possible if you work hard enough for it"},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"Well, I loved this book. I love basketball and everything about it so of course I'm going to love a book about one of the greatest players of all time.The book was about Larry Bird and his life. It turns out, that Larry Bird was very poor as a child. His favorite thing tho wear was a pair of overalls. He wore them at least 4 times a week and did not wear anything under. That is how poor his family was.I like how he tells things like this because it shows alot of reality. He really doesn't sugar coat anything that he says in this book. He tells everything like it is and I tend to like people like that.

Bob Ryan (the actual writer) is a long-time Boston Globe columnist and a terriffic writer. He captures the essence of Larry Bird, from his childhood to his journey through high school and college to his emergence as both a basketball legend in the NBA and a larger-than-life sports hero in Boston.

He came from a very poorfamily of six. I chose this memoir, because I love basketball, and was interested in LarryBirds his life. My thesis statement is, if you work hard, and keep pursuing your goalsyou can achieve them.Larry grew up in a poor family, his mom always had to work hard andnever got anything in return. She was a working mother who worked two jobsand had to hold down the house. \\"Money was always an issue in our life. There were sixkids and we just didn't have enough\\".\\" Mom worked all the time as a waitress or a cook,sometimes working two jobs\\". \\"Mom never spent any money on herself; any thing sheever made she spent on us kids\\".Larry always hustled the most and worked the hardest. He came in early to the gymand left late, he took the most shots in practice and always gave one hundred and tenpercent. Working the hardest was really important to Larry because he knew he wasn'tgoing to be the fastest or be able to jump the highest. So if he worked the hardest, andshot the best he knew we would be able to compete. \\"I would play (basketball) at sixA.M before school. I would duck into the old gym in between classes to get a few shotsup and play again after school into the early hours of the next morning, feeling that sleepwere rude intrusions on my practice time\\".Larry in the end of his book he looks back on the different cities he went to, thereferees, the players, and the NBA career. He learned that if you really want something inlife you can accomplish it with hard work."},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"The book &quot;Drive&quot; is an autobiography on one of the greatest basketball players and legends to ever step on the court and play the game of basketball. This book is about how Larry Bird grew up in the small, poor town of French Lick, Indiana. His father, Joe Bird, was a hard worker who bounced around from job to job just to keep his family above water, while Larry's mother, Georgia Bird, worked and took care of the family. Both parents worked eighty to ninety hours a week for $100 to $150. This was hard for Larry growing up because he wasn't able to spend time with his parents in his childhood. His parents were soon divorced so they wouldn't need as much money for the family with his dad gone. They would now have money from child support and money coming in from Georgia Bird's two jobs. Among the entire family troubles, Larry's father, Joe Bird, committed suicide in his parent's house with a shotgun.When Larry was younger he never really liked the sport of basketball. He was more interested in baseball and football. The two sports never ended up working out for him in the long run. Larry didn't start to take an interest in basketball until he was about thirteen years old when he was shooting around with some kids from his grandmother's neighborhood. He realized that basketball was his true love when he wona big game for his team as a sophomore in high school. By his junior and senior year in high school he was nery successful, scoring 40 points a game. He was the team's savior. After high school, Larry went to Indiana University and after a few weeks of being there he left. A while after being out of school he was invited to work out with the Indiana State University's basketball team and decided to go. He instantly knew he would fit in with the teammates and knew it was going to be good competition, which is what he liked. He later enrolled himself there. At the end of his junior year in college the Boston Celtics Franchise chose him sixth in the 1978 NBA draft. He decided to stay in school and graduate instead of going to the NBA. During his senior year, he led his team to the NCAA championship game against Michigan State University and his soon to be rival Magic Johnson. His team lost the game. Larry was the first Bird to graduate from college. After graduation he negotiated a contract with the Boston Celtics Franchise. During his career he won numerous amounts of MVP awards and several championship rings with the Celtics.This book had many things that made it great, but at the same time there were also things that took away from its greatness. In the beginning the chapters were very short but had a lot of detail of how he grew up and the problems he faced. As for the words he used and the flow of the sentences, it was well written. There are quite a few misprints in this book but it is still easy to understand and follow. Overall this book was very easy to understand and Larry describes the things him and his family and team went through thoughtfully. It was well thought out and had great detail.As I said, there were things that worked and things that didn't. The thing that irritated me the most about his writing is that in the second half of the book when he is talking about his career, he talked too much about the other great players in the league. Sometimes, full chapters at a time. The last thing that didn't work was that he wouldn't state what year he was talking about in his career. For example he would be talking about his rookie season and then wold go to talk about a season five years down the road and you wouldn't even know it until a few chapters later.Overall, this was a great book and I would recommend it to anyone. I would recommend it to not only athletes but also non-athletes because it shows how if someone works hard and has good work eithic and determination that it will help them succeed in life. Larry Bird thought that when he was resting someone, somewhere, was working hard to be better than he was. So he was always working to be the BEST."},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"this is a Great Book on one of Basketball's Greatest Player's&amp;minds.Bird tells of his Nba Career&amp;His Relationships with Indiana State,The Boston Celtics,Magic Johnson&amp;His View on the NBA on a Whole.Bird was something else on the COurt&amp;Off as a Coach.A Must Read."},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"Book outlines apparently the life as Larry Bird as written by him. Pretty basic stuff here. A good read if you were a Bird fan back in the past. Of course I emmulated my game after him while playing in two leagues as a teenager, now don't care much about basketball. So for me, it was somewhat of an enjoyable read. Didn't take long went right through it. Some interesting things about him was that his dad killed himself, and Bird's deep attitude about not being superficial I found especially interesting. However, he tries not to make any enemies here and there's nothing to controversial to be found. Interesting to see how someone of his stature kept his head together."},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"As a fan of Larry Bird, I found that this book did not meet my expectations. As one of the best trash talkers in the game, I anticipated a larger degree of wit among this writing. Unfortunately, although detailed, Bird's story comes off somewhat bland and does not encompass much of Bird's state of mind; instead focusing merely on citing the events in his life.For those seeking to learn about the life of one of the NBA's greatest champions and who also have an interest in basketball, there are some good nuggets of information available. When Bird first came into the league, for instance, he considered the three point shot as something that was well out of his range, the distance too great. Revelations such as this will come as a surprise to those who only know of his champion style heroics. Had the book contained a more significant amount of this new and fascinating information, it certainly would have rated higher.Bird certainly provides a behind the scenes look into basketball; however it lacks any noteworthy reflection from Bird on the topic. If you are looking for an inspirational piece from the mindset of one of sports great champions, you will be rather disappointed."},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"Book review on DriveDedication, spirit, and heart are some of the words you can use to describe Larry Bird. Larry is a small boy growing up in the rural town of French Lick, Indiana. He never thought that one game of basketball would change the course of history and send him on the road to stardom. This book takes you on a journey inside the game and the life of an N.b.a. superstar. I recommend this book to basketball fans of all ages.The combined themes of sadness and irony make this a great and unique novel. An example of irony is when Larry enrolled at Indiana University. He spent less than a month there then hitch hiked back to French Lick. An example of sadness happened when Larry was 19 years old. His father committed suicide so his family could have the money from his life insurance.There were many characters that Larry talks about in his book. He talks about his first basketball coach Jim Jones who taught him the fundamentals of the game. He talks about his siblings Mike, Mark, Linda, Jeff, and Eddie. He talks about his teammates Kevin McHale and Robert Parish. He even talks about his opponents (Ervin Johnson, Moses Malone, Julius Erving, and James Worthy to name a few).When he played in the N.B.A., he traveled across the country playing basketball. Therefore, their were many settings in this book. The main setting was Indiana. It was very hot there and most of the men around where he lived were farmers. Another main setting was Boston, Mass.I recommend this book to any basketball fan wanting to know about the game. This book brings you closer to the game and shows you the life of a basketball star. The main lesson in this book is that nothing comes easy in life. It's hard to realize how much work it takes to become successful. Read this book and you'll find out."},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"Larry Bird is truly one of the greatest that ever played the game. With the help of Ervin &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson, he not only managed to resurrect the Celtic dynasty, but also the entire NBA, which was teetering on the brink of ruination. Now, we get to hear the man behind the legendary exploits on the court. This book not only tells of his career and accomplishments, but also gives a truly touching account of where he came from, where he's been, what he's been through, and what it took to become possibly the most legendary, if not talented, athlete ever to step on a basketball court. This is an inspiring, breathtaking story, and is deeply motivational. Bird is a living example that a combination of hard work, self-sacrifice, never-say-die ethics, and a selfless sense of team play, whether in a sporting venue or in ANY situation life has to offer, invariably leads to not only success, but also excellence. Recommended reading for all aspiring athletes, young people, and anyone else in need of inspiration."},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"&quot;Drive&quot; is the autobiograhy of Larry Bird, the NBA's best basketball player of all-time.

The book also talked about many of his memorable moments throughout his basketball career and all of his triumph's that brought him fame. Towards the end he gave us some personal thoughts about what he thought of himself and his relationship with his family.One of the things that I liked about the book is that he earned what he got due to hard work and dedication.

Most people know that he was raised in a small town in Indiana and came to be the player for the Celtics in the 1980s. One thing Larry Bird cannot do though is write a book. The book is littered with grammatical errors which quickly become a detriment to the content. He does make some interesting comments in here which I think would be good for those who are fans of Larry. He talks briefly about his daughter he had in college which he so rarely references and about his brief stint at Indiana. He also talks about some of his teammates in a light that few people have seen them before. All in all, Larry wrote the book before his career ended which was in fact premature. In addition, his co-writers should have had more influence in this endeavor not to mention the editors. Not bad if you like Larry but I am sure there are better."},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"Larry Bird- Drive: The Story Of My LifeLarry Joe Bird was born in West Baden, Indiana on December 7, 1956. Although Bird was born in West Baden he grew up in French Lick. He had three siblings: One sister, Linda and two brothers, Mark, and Mike. As Bird grew older he realized that he was falling in love with the game of basketball. He attended High School at SpringsValley (which was in French Lick). After High School he went to Indiana University for about 3 months and played basketball but then dropped out because he thought that the schoolwork was tough. He went home for about 2 months but tried college again but attended Indiana State University instead and thrived there at the game of basketball. The Boston Celtics drafted him in 1979. He went on to win 3 championships for the Celtics and played from 1979 to 1992. He was and still is one of the greatest all-around players the game has ever seen.I liked this book a lot because of the way it was written. It was pretty easy to read and understand. I liked how Larry Bird wrote the book in that he explained how he became good at basketball. He would get up every morning before school at about 6 a.m. and shoot free throws on his basketball court. He even got to the point when he was at school of sneaking in the gym in between class and shooting some jumpers. It also had a lot of comical stories in the book. For example, there was one story that made me crack up. I quote: Once I was coming down on the (fast) break and pulled up for an eighteen foot jumper and my basketball coach yelled, \\"No, no wait for the other guys!\\" Just as I released the ball I said, \\"Too late, coach.\\" The ball hit nothing but net. K.C. Jones just sat down.I disliked this because of Larry Bird's life when he was growing up. When he a little boy his family did not have that much money. His father was lucky if he made $120 in one week. So he did not a lot of things he would have liked to have. When he was 19 years old he was starting at I.U. and he learned that his dad committed suicide. When he went to I.U. he only brought about 5 pairs of clothes because he did not have much money. His buddy, Jim Wisman who he was rooming with said, \\"You can borrow all of my clothes if you want.\\" And Larry did end up wearing all of Jim's clothes. One last thing that I did not like was all the mistakes I found in the book. I found about 6 fragments. But, other than that it was a great novel."},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"This book is great for any fan of Larry Bird. But, if you are not, you will become aggravated by reading this book. Grammatical errors and poor writing are littered throughout this entire book.

Rich Garces is so good."},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"It is quite likely that this bloke from absolutely nowheresville Indiana's picture would be next to a dictionary that had an entry that said 'White Men Can't Jump'. If you can do everything else though, you can win a lot, and even get some of those Championship type ornaments to hang in your stadium and about your preosn."},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"Don't get me wrong. Larry Bird's playing career in Boston--especially his 3 consecutive MVP seasons from 1984-1986--were the most exciting Celtics seasons ever since I started following the NBA--and Dave Cowens and the Celtics--in 1973. I loved the 1984 Championship Finals, the 1985 Finals, and THE 1986 FINALS--WITH BILL WALTON!!!But as exciting a player as Larry Bird was, DRIVE:THE STORY OF MY LIFE is boring, and just another life story by an athlete on his way out. In fact, Bird's career was marred by injuries after the end of the 1987-88 season, and he never played in another NBA Final after 1987. So after 1988, he was really coasting on his past performances.The two most interesting parts of DRIVE are Bird's stories about Bill Walton's time with the Celtics, and a brief mention of his heart racing during the 1986 Finals against Houston, the best series I've ever seen. I wondered why his heart would be racing, and later when Bird's heart trouble was revealed it all added up--athletes conceal their health problems just like the rest of us.But Larry Bird after 1988 was just a shadow of his former self, unable to dominate, unable to run, and unable to carry the Celtics back to the NBA Finals. In fact, a book about the Dream Team had a chapter that called him THE GREAT WHITE HASBEEN, and that echoes Dennis Rodman's comment in 1987 that Bird was overrated because he was white. Before 1987, I've never seen a player--particularly a white player--who had to be guarded as much as Bird--forget about him scoring, coaches like Pat Riley just didn't want him to have the ball! But Bird lost a step in the 1987-88 season--ironically, the year he started serious weight training--and the Detroit Pistons' braintrust saw that!--and that was the beginning of the end for Bird, even though he scored the highest average ever for a Celtic that year, 29.9 points per game.From 1980 to 1988, Larry Bird was the greatest forward in the history of basketball. But after that, he was just another player. This book rambles and avoids that, and doesn't deal with some of the questions about the Celtics like what really happened to Coach KC Jones--how many coaches quit after 4 NBA Finals appearances in 5 years?--and why the Celtics didn't know that 1986 #1 draft pick Len Bias was a drug user, before he overdosed on cocaine.If you want to read a great basketball book by a former Celtic, read Bob Cousy's THE LAST LOUD ROAR, or anything by Tommy Heinsohn. Their books go into more detail, have better pictures, are surprisingly candid about race and the Celtics-- which is an unavoidable pairing--and are more interesting. Larry should have passed on this one.Chari Krishnan RESEARCHKING"},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"This is definitely the book I needed, but was not happy with the condition it is in.

Obviously written by one of the NBA's greatest players, you get to be in the mind of Larry Bird, and see for yourself what he was like, from his point of view. The book spends the majority of the time on his NBA because of the success he had as a player. I really liked the fact that Larry gave his respect to his opponents and their fans, and that he didn't write from a egotistical stand point. There were only two things that I think could've been better the book, the first was that it didn't really talk too much his work ethic in his high school years. It did mention it occasionaly, and obviously we know he had a great work ethic, it just didn't mention it much. The other thing was the Indiana State-Michigan State rivalry.

It pretty much tells the story of Larry's life in monotone, without evidencing much emotion one way or the other. To be truthful, love him though I do, it reads exactly in the same flat sense as Larry interviews: without much emotion, steadily, even-handedly, and passionlessly. There is no gossip or bad-mouthing whatsoever in this book, to the point where you start to question the Birdman's candor, since he can't find anything bad to say about anyone. The name dropping got to be too much, too, until you were awash in characters (many of whom were just mentioned once or twice, never to show up again), and had trouble remembering which guy came from where. [Lucky for me I remembered a lot of the Celtics games from being a Boston fan back in the day- I can't imagine the torture of sorting out the names for the uninitiated.]The end seems rushed, too, and drops away from the linear style of the rest of Drive, lapsing into stream-of-consciousness essays on a random variety of topics. It is filler, really, to achieve a certain number of pages, and the book would have been better if Larry had waited a couple of years. That way he could have written about his career's end and filled the rest of the pages of his autobiography with a recounting of actual basketball tales and events, instead of hollow ruminating on topics any number of players could have commented on in the same fashion."},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"The book Drive by Larry Gird starts off by talking about his close friends and what is was like for him to grow up.

Told in the first person--but greatly helped by the journalistic skill of Bob Ryan--Bird doesn't hide anything. If he doesn't like something, he tells you. And this gets to the heart of the man, do him wrong and he never forgets; do him right and he's loyal to the end.The early portion of the book deals with the poverty of growing up in French Lick, but yet Bird saw himself as blessed and enjoying life. His older brothers were his heroes and buddies. His grandmother the stable influence and quiet soul. With her working multiple jobs, his mom the courageous and selfless glue. In the most heart-breaking section, Bird talks about his father and his father's suicide when Bird was 19.The book picks up with Bird's time at Indiana State. He realizes how good he is and soon the legend starts to grow. At Boston, Bird realizes that he again can play with anyone. What remains from French Lick to Boston is the competitive drive and relentless to be great."},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"While reading this book I learned what hard work will get you. In this book I learned more about Larry Bird and his life story. I learned of Larry's college up and downs, his relationship woes, and his professional basketball experience. While at Indiana University he played basketball with his new friends but the upperclassmen never let him play with them. He left the campus after an ankle injury. When he finally got home, he had a very life changing conversation with his mother. Before any of this happened he had another life changing experience when his father committed suicide when Larry was still young. His father believed that his family would be better off. They were always low on money and his mother was working multiple jobs to create some income for the family.Larry's first marriage was a longtime friend and they had a child. The relationship ended up not working out so they got divorced and Larry stayed out of his daughters life. After awhile Larry found somebody else and they got married and have been together ever since.After waiting his one year for his eligibility to play at Indiana State, he almost left because he was to good. While his time at Indiana State he helped bring a little college into the national spotlight. Then he got drafted by the Celtics and had the daunting decision of finishing college and get his degree, or go to the NBA. He ended up staying and taking his team to the NCAA Finals against his rival Magic Johnson and Michigan State.When he went to the NBA after his final year of eligibility at Indiana State and lead the Celtics to the biggest turnaround in wins. He ended up winning the Rookie of the Year his first year in the league. He was always told he was slow, could not jump, and uncoordinated but he played through it. At the end of the book it talked about all the places that he likes and does not like to play at, the referees, the coaches , and the players he liked and did not like. He had to put in so much time to get his basketball status to where it is now-One of the Greatest Ever. His jumpshot, sense for the game, and his love for the game helped him continue playing through back injuries, hand injuries, and shoulder injuries.This book has given me more inspiration to do what I want to do. It has given me an example of what hard work is and what you have to do to complete you dreams. This was terrific book in which I gave five stars.

Bird discusses growing up in French Lick, Indiana, recalling how he became enamored with basketball but also discussing some of the hard times he had as a youth. Bird temporarily put Indiana State on the national college basketball map, and the Sycamores' road to the 1979 title matchup against Magic Johnson and Michigan State is traced.Bird's NBA career is recalled, including the stories of the banner-raising '81, '84 (when they beat the Kareem-Magic Lakers), and '86 title teams, as well as the unforgettable and inspirational '87 team that never quit and fought hard to the bitter end, outlasting Milwaukee and Detroit and taking the Lakers to six games despite its many injuries. Bird closes his autobiography by offering observations on NBA cities, referees, fans, and Red Auerbach."},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"This is primarily a jock biography, but a nicely engaging one. Despite a lack of speed, Larry Bird was one of the greatest NBA players ever due to intelligent play, hard work, and constant practice. In short, he had lots of drive. Here he tells his story, beginning in rural French Lick (and West Baden Springs) Indiana where he group up in a poor home with five siblings. Young Larry favored baseball, but his love for hoops grew in his teen years as did his height and overall ability. Bird describes playing briefly at Indiana (and Bob Knight), before switching to Indiana State, where he led the Sycamores to the final game of the 1979 NCAA tournament (losing to Magic Johnson and Michigan State). Then it was on to the Boston Celtics, who had actually selected him in the draft before his final year. On Boston he soon emerged as one of the league's top stars - arguably it's best player before injuries slowed him down. Bird provides an insightful view of life on the great Celtics teams of the 1980's, playing alonside such stars as Tiny Archibald, Kevin McHale, (Chief) Robert Parrish, Bill Walton, etc. The Celtics won three NBA titles (1981, 1984, 1986) and were runners-up in 1985 and 1987. Bird provides an inside look at each series. In fact, he focuses heavily on the playoffs. Nor does this modest star shy away from his shortcomings, both on and off the court. Published in 1989, this book is no deeply analytical treatise, but readers should enjoy the sporting insights from this modest yet very talented player."},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"My 12 year old son enjoyed this book about the life of Larry Bird.

Larry's father, Joe, worked for little money at a shoe company. This was hard for Larry, but it got worse. His father committed suicide when he is young, which forces his mother to work two jobs.Larry didn't always love basketball. His first love was baseball. He also liked football, but these two sports didn't work for him, so he decided to play basketball. Larry didn't really start liking basketball until his sophomore year, but then he starts to live for the sport. His high school coach helped him improve his skills and during Larry's junior and senior year he goes to the state championship. After high school Larry goes to Indiana State University, where, during his senior year, they go to the NCAA championship to face Michigan State and Magic Johnson. Unfortunately, Larry lost in the most watched final ever.My favorite part of the book is the Foreword by Magic Johnson because it explains how Larry Bird changed the game of basketball forever.This book is similar to with other sports biographies. It shows how Larry worked hard to get where he is similar to Bo Knows Bo by Bo Jackson. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys sports and is a fan of Larry Bird"},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"Book ReviewThe book I chose to read was Drive a biography about Larry Bird and written by Larry Bird and Bob Ryan. This book was made in 1989, the book includes a forward from Magic Johnson and a description of each city Bird played in.A summary of my book is about the life and the career of Larry Bird. Larry Bird was the best professional basketball player to ever live, he also had more work ethic than 99% of the people who ever lived. He would stay after a game for like 4 hours until he perfected whatever he did wrong that game. He would wake up at 6 in the morning to shoot 500 free throws. He grew up in a small town in Indiana, he was very poor and all he did was play sports. I guess coming from a poorer family people usually have better work ethic because they have to work for everything they get and earn it. Bird played Varsity basketball in 10-12 grades and then he went to Indiana to play for Bobby Knight who obviously didn't see talent in Larry. So Larry transferred to Indiana State and brought them to the national championship. He then got drafted by the Boston Celtics and played there until retirement and having one of the greatest rivals in sports history with the famous Ervin \\"Magic\\" Johnson, and the rest of the Lakers."},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"THIS BOOK IS A GOOD READ ABOUT THE LIFE OF THE NBA SUPERSTAR.

I play basketball regularly. After reading this book, it REALLY encouraged me to practice more to become a better baller. Larry Bird mentions that he wasn't gifted with ups, but he practiced his tail off to compensate for his weaknesses. Bird also mentions and I quote, &quot;I play the game to have have that one moment where I just take over the game...&quot; That and his work ethic served as a foundation for me to aspire to become good at basketball. In fact, the form of my jumpshot is emulated/dedicated to him. Thank you Larry Bird."},{"Title":"Drive: The Story of My Life","review":"A lesson that I learned from Larry Bird was that if you put your mind to something and give it your all ,you will achieve it. Larry Bird would set goals for himself to help him become better at basketball. He would practice everyday and all day to achieve those goals on the basketball court. He would get up in the morning to practice free throws, he would shoot between classes, and then he would have basketball practice after school. When Bird got into the NBA he had to establish himself as a good basketball player all over again, so he worked harder then ever to compete and then to dominate his opponents. Larry Bird's success proves that if you set your goals and be hard working and persistent then you will achieve those goals. Larry Bird's mentor was Jim Jones, his high school basketball coach. Jim Jones guided Larry Bird in his first years of playing basketball. Coach Jones taught him the basics of basketball and helped him correct his mistakes. Jones was a father figure to Bird when he was going through tough times when his dad committed suicide. Bird has kept in touch with his former coach throughout his life, and now they teach basketball camps together. I have a good opinion of this book. I like this book because it is mainly about basketball, and I love playing basketball. It also showed me how hard work can pay off in such a big way. I think it is very interesting because I was reading about one of my idols and learning the obstacles he overcame to get to where he is now. If you like to read about basketball and want to learn about Larry Bird, you should consider reading this book."},{"Title":"The direct-mind experience: Lectures","review":"This is a perplexing book. Entertaining, inspiring, and perplexing. Mix the gentleness, humor and compassionate affection for foolish, suffering mankind of Ramana Maharshi with the confrontational, heaven- and earth-moving directness of Hui-neng or Huang Po and what do you get? A very inadequate description of the remarkable character of Richard Rose. Let me begin by admitting my bias, which is that Rose is light years beyond any other human being I have met, in terms of my respect. He is the man who accomplished what I believe we are all here for, what we are all striving to do, consciously or not -- and that is to define ourselves, to answer the riddle: Who am I?, to find the way back along the projected ray of our existence to the source of our essential being. The Direct-Mind Experience is a collection mostly of talks given by Rose at universities -- not academic lectures but talks, amazingly, organized by students who wanted to share their &quot;find&quot; with their fellow students. They range in time from a WKSU radio interview before a talk at Kent State in 1974, a talk at Boston College in 1975, and a lecture on &quot;between-ness&quot; at Ohio State University in 1980, to informal talks given at the rural retreat center Rose established at his farm near Wheeling, WV in 1982 and 1983. Along the way were lectures on such topics as &quot;Moods&quot; and &quot;The Psychology of Miracles.&quot; Having been present at some of those talks, I can tell you that they caused consternation -- Rose probably never gave a public talk where some listeners didn't get up and leave out of anger at what they heard; dismay -- when the realization sank in of how deeply cemented we are into our habitual mode of viewing and action; and effervescent hope -- from hearing the testimony of a man who had cut the Gordian knot that prevents finding the answers, and who testified that anyone of average intelligence could find the answers, also. What would it take? Not post-graduate work in accumulating more and more knowledge, because Truth is not something that a person can learn. What it takes, Rose said, is a change of being. And how is this change of being accomplished? Through the direct-mind experience. What, then, is direct-mind experience? My immediate response is to recommend that you read what Rose had to say rather than relying on some garbled version that I could present to you. My understanding is that returning to our true nature, our innermost being, involves a transmission of Mind -- a viewing of the earth-man, and the dualistic mind we now experience, from a deeper perspective. Boddhidharma's four pillars of Zen (a special transmission outside the scriptures; no dependence upon words or letters; a direct pointing at the soul of man; and seeing into one's own nature and the attainments of Buddhahood) also represent this &quot;out of the box&quot; experience. Zen masters sometimes referred to the mind as a bridge to cross. What takes us across is, in my understanding, the direct experience of the One Mind which is our source."},{"Title":"The direct-mind experience: Lectures","review":"This is an example of the teaching style of a truely great man. Richard Rose was one of the greatest spiritual advisors of all time. I recommend reading this fine selection of lectures and talks of Mister Rose in his prime.

I can relate to the students asking questions at the lectures. I feel this speaker is right on target. This guy knows something.Like the best NOVA special on esoteric philosophy, or a search for truth, 'The Direct-Mind Experience' is undiluted and to the point.At the front of the book are good introductions to the six lectures (given at various universities) by Richard Rose. After the talks, there is a chapter about points of reference for a spiritual searcher. He concludes with a one page statement directly to the reader."},{"Title":"The direct-mind experience: Lectures","review":"It is interesting to read the author as he interacts with questioners.

How sad that he knows nothing of his success, though he is not yet deceased. The person I read about is a stranger to me though I was wife #1(there's a #2 as well) from 1950 thru 1974(a marriage that produced 3 children). I will grant that he was a brilliant &amp; imaginative man, though perhaps a bit psychotic. I caution to beware.

There are no pictures and not much textual material beyond the recipes. The recipes are quite good though."},{"Title":"Civilizations","review":"Fernandez-Armesto's venture into environmental history extends his reputation as the leading scholar producing large-scale history. In \\"Civilizations\\" he classifies civilizations according to the general type of environment in which they arose, thrived and (often) declined. He then analyzes their ability to adapt to those conditions, as well as exploring other influences. The result is an ambitious if not wholly successful work, but still a notably thoughtful one. Among other merits, his fine discussion of the thorny issue of defining a \\"civilization\\" is both sensible and relaxed, unlike some more overrwrought treatments (Spengler, Toynbee, Huntington). Like all his work, \\"Civilizations\\" is studded with insightful comments and distinguished by sparkling literary style. That said, there are some flaws. Some alternate typologies for categorizing societies and cultures are equally valid, and despite his best efforts, this work does not completely escape the shadow of determinism. This otherwise well-illustrated book is not well-supplied with the maps, diagrams and statistical tables that are very helpful in dealing with environmental data. Finally, the author relies almost exclusively on published primary and secondary sources, but this is really a necessity in writing history on such a huge canvas. It's the only way to avoid the \\"Lord Acton Trap:\\" that famous Victorian historian sought to narrate the whole history of human liberty entirely from manuscript sources, and as a result he never completed a single book. Write on, Dr. Felipe!NB It's perfectly legitimate to use one's own earlier material in subsequent works, with proper citation. The best remedy is for buyers to examine the second book fully---or else read the first more carefully!"},{"Title":"Civilizations","review":"I read this book and Jared Diamond's Guns Germs and Steel back to back, and they're really similar books about the relation between civilization and the environment. But Civilizations looks at history from a historian's perspective, and therefore it brings specific insights from historical anecdotes, rather that something akin to Diamon's grand theory. I have a beautiful hardcover, and it's still nice to break it out once in a while and reread it."},{"Title":"Civilizations","review":"This book is great if you are preparing for a history quiz. I'm glad I bought it, but only because I also have access to google. The writer touches on various events without discussing them in sufficient detail. The book is organized by geographical elements, which is novel. But it fails to dwell. The fleeting descriptions may be ok for someone who is a history student at Oxford and already knows enough, but not for me. Like I said, I ended up googling more content than what is presented in this book."},{"Title":"Civilizations","review":"&quot;Civilizations is a radical cultural history of mankinds fragile relationship with nature (...) Felipe Fernandez-Armesto closely examines the world's societies, from the maritime civilizations of the Polynesians to the Dawada people of Sahara. (...) The book concludes that societies CAN be judged on how civilized they are, and this decision can only be made by investigating their interaction with their own envirnoment. This conclusion is illuminated by wonderfully anecdotal historical insights and brilliant analysis.&quot;As everyone knows, back cover blurb should not be taken too seriously. Even so, I would like to make some comments on the quotations above.Fernandez-Armesto examines quite a few ancient and more recent civilizations, and he certainly does so by providing &quot;wonderfully anecdotal insights&quot;. In fact, this is probably what I liked the most about the book. F-A is a splendid writer, among other things showing a talent for producing stunning one-liners like &quot;Culturally, Las Vegas has never really ceased to be a desert&quot;, making most of the book both readable and enjoyable.As for &quot;brilliant analysis&quot;, I'm not so sure. Most of the discussion concerning what civilizations are and how you can judge them is concentrated to the beginning, and no clear &quot;conclusion&quot; is reached either. As it is now, you feel like you (or perhaps the author) lose the thread a couple of times before you've read all the 566 pages. (The author admits that his work is &quot;experimental&quot; though, so I guess it can be excused.)BUTThe lack of focus was partly explained when I started reading \\"Truth\\" by the same author some time after finishing this book. For some reason, parts of \\"Truth\\" struck me as familiar, though I had never read it. After some checking in \\"Civilizations\\", F-A proved to be an accomplished master when it comes to using the Ctrl + C command. He has copied whole pages of his earlier work and put it in \\"Civilizations\\". Parts concerning the Polynesians are the same, the part on the 6th century philosopher Boethius is the same etc. There are numerous examples. I found it really annoying.Now, \\"Truth\\" is the only other book by F-A that I've read. I hear that he has written a book or two about Columbus. There are some pages about that guy in \\"Civilizations\\". Were they copied too? Were other parts copied from other books he has written?Then make it 1 star. It should have been 3.5 stars, because I did enjoy reading the book. I just don't like paying for the same text twice without knowing that I do."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"The formatting on my Kindle 2 looks good.

My guess is that it's about fifty-fifty. What I'm certain of is that they are worth reading, and they will remain worth reading.However, I prefer the edition in which all the Mowgli stories are in one book and all the other stories are in a second book. The stories not involving Mowgli have no particular order in which they should be read, whereas the Mowgli stories should be read in order, with no other stories between them.When I was five years old, my grandfather died. Among the things he left us was a complete set of Kipling. Where we lived there was no library, and my parents could afford very few books, though they managed to get us the old red Childcraft (it was new then) and Uncle Arthur's Bedtime Stories. But the main result was that from the time I was five until my mother gave the books to a library when I was twelve, I read Kipling constantly.

Alas, Dover hasn't manufactured paperbacks that way in years, but this clothbound edition looks every bit as durable as it is beautiful. Many will find it an attractive alternative to the Borzoi Book (Everyman's Library) published by Knopf; the paper is finer, and the illustrations (by the Detmold brothers) are reproduced in full color. This book is not, however, a facsimile reprint of the Macmillan edition of 1908. As the publisher's note explains, the plates have been \\"reproduced from an extremely scarce, original portfolio of watercolors, and have never before appeared on this scale in book form.\\" From these remarks one gathers that the illustrations are larger here than in the 1908 edition, some of them spread across two pages. Unfortunately, the binding (unlike that of the Knopf edition) is too firm for the open book to lie flat, so several of these two-page presentations (notably that of Kaa on pages 64-65) are spoiled by the heavy fold down the center. Moreover, in spite of the \\"elegant new type design and many additional decorative elements,\\" it is annoying to find Kipling's verses centered line by line instead of systematically indented according to their rhyme schemes.

It was one of the first books I read when I graduated to chapter books and even today it remains a favorite.

I felt as if I wasn't being talked down to like in so many other children's/young adult books and to me that was important. It's somewhat misanthropic (when Mowgli is thrown out of the village) but I think it does have more redeeming values then most. I am proud to have a copy of these stories sitting eloquently on a book shelf where no other Children's/Young Adult books keep it company. I think even if you're an adult, if you've never read this book it's a must! The Disney movie made loosely, extremely loosely, on Mowgli's adventures always makes me want to scream.

He has been fully engaged and followed the story, asking questions about the jungle, and learning words he's never heard before. He's asked questions about Mowgli and Baloo during breakfast and played like a panther at preschool. The drawings are simple and I think having one picture for every page of text has been helpful in holding his attention.While I love this book, it is very condensed from the original and lacks the vivid descriptions and insight to the characters that the original provides. But that is also part of why I purchased this version... my son isn't old enough to understand much of Kipling's old English grammar and complex thought.

And in the Jungle Book I found absolutely nothing, besides what I venture to mention, that slights my opinion of the quality of Rudyard Kipling's writing. I felt that in this book Kiplng was trying to exercise a mode of writing that was supposed to be at an elementary level, and therefor more suitable for children. I claim the same excuse for the length of the book. Yet I feel that Kipling's mode was not the best that could have been chosen. Instead, the book seemed to have a choppy quality, let me explain myself by saying that one chapter was used on a small event in Mowgli's life, and then several years were skipped, so the contents of the next chapter forced you to use an element of brain power for comprehension. I do not know the reader's, nor the general public's, feelings toward this use of brain power, I only know mine, which are that this usage distracts my from the story, and slightly takes me away from the spell any good book ought to have. I do not for one minute say that any of the contents of the book, extracting to the very singular word, were not put down without great thought, creativity, and originality, which all together produce a degree of brilliance. That degree, however, may alter, and I feel that although the brilliance is most definately there, it is not at it's utmost level. I find no fault of that with the author, except that of Kipling's trying to overtake a goal so difficult even he, with all his brilliance, was not able to peform to allow it to be rated as high as five stars. I do, though, sincerely applaud Rudyard Kipling's, original and, absolutely, in every possible way, amazing work, although I feel it to contain too many small faults to call it equal to its extroadinary reputation. I place the fault of it's too high reputaton sincerely upon those who read the book without knowlegde of it beforehand."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"It depicted the culture and feelings of different animals standing on their sides.

All one has to do is read the original Pinocchio, Peter Pan, or, supposedly, Bambi, to berate them for destroying classics. I probably should be bothered as well by their Jungle Book, except that I think that it was one of the cases where the marriage of animation, story and music achieves more than the original. Without the source material, it would be nothing, of course, but the wonderful songs (who can forget \\"Bare Necessities,\\" \\"Trust in Me,\\" or \\"I Wanna Be Like You\\"?) and the structure that turned Kipling's short tales into a two-hour movie create a gestalt that I'm not sure Kipling's tales do by themselves. This is probably sacrilege to the ears of the true Kipling fan, but I'm nothing if not opinionated.The stories that make up the Jungle Book aren't solely about Mowgli, though, and it's the others, especially \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,\\" that make this a definate must have."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"It is a fine book.

She liked it, so I guess its a great book."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"In the deep jungle of India there was a little boy name Mowgli. Mowgli is an Indian infant who is lost in the jungle after Shere Khan (the tiger) kills his family. Mowgli was raised by a pack of wolves and is taught the laws of life in the jungle. His closest friends were Baloo, (the bear) and Bagheera (sleek black panther). Mowgli learns how to speak to the animals his childhood seems pleasant. Shere Khan is a dangerous tiger that is seeking revenge on Mowgli. Shere Khan is the enemy and is feared among all of the animals in the jungle. Mowgli was taught there was a certain place in the jungle that he was forbidden to go to. Bagheera and Baloo are trying to teach Mowgli the Laws of the Jungle for his own good. They are having a difficult time with him because he is small and young. Bagheera is more concerned with Mowgli being on his own because he has not learned how to kill his own food. And they are worried that Shere Khan will come after Mowgli and try to kill him. Riki-tiki-tavi is a mongoose, a hunter, and a great fighter. Riki-tiki fought anything that came in his way, but when Nag and Nagaina (the cobra couple) approached him it was different. Rikki-tikki felt his eyes growing red and hot (when a mongoose's eyes grow red, he is angry), and he sat back on his tail and hind legs like a little kangaroo, and looked all round him, and chattered with rage. But Nag and Nagaina had disappeared into the grass.I really enjoyed reading The Jungle Book. Kippling had a great imagination, especially since Mowgli could talk to animals. I thought the characters were shown though their actions throughout the book. Rikki Tikki Tavi has always seemed to me to be one of the great heroes in all of literature."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"I have to say, I like Disney's version of Mowgli's story better. This story is good, and has some humor, but it is defiantly harsher, especially the second part. Just in case you didn't already relies this, this book contains many stories, including the story of the white seal, which I like better. As for the tale of Riki-Tiki-Tovi, I liked some parts of it, but as a kid especially, I didn't like all the snakes in it. Tumi of the Elephants is a bit strange but Her Majesty's Servants is much better. Being interested in armies, I found it to be fascinating as well as funny. Perhaps if you are not interested in armies you would not find it to be so good, but if you like to wonder what animals would say if they could talk then you still might. In fact, the whole book is primarily on talking animals, so if you like reading about that, this is the book for you! Even if you don't, you should probably still read it, it's being a classic. However, if you're just looking to read something by Kipling then you should read Kim instead; it's much better."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"Ms. Burns brings little dynamism to her reading.

Real life is illustrated here, not white washed Hollywood stories where nothing really dies but the interaction between predator and prey is ever present.Kipling in today's world is not something allowed in schools, more the pity.

Mowgli, a human child in India, is rescued by wolves and raised by them with wolf brothers and sisters by wolf parents, after an evil lame tiger chased away his human parents. The tiger who not only kills humans wants to control the wolf pact. He tells the wolves insistently that Mowgli belongs to him. Mowgli has many adventures among the wolves and later among humans. Once, for instance, he was captured when he was ten or eleven years old by monkeys, who are portrayed as stupid forgetful creatures in the book. He is saved during a lengthy battle by Bagheera the black panther who loves him and by Baloo the bear that is his instructor, as well as the python Kaa who respects him. Mowgli leaves the jungle and goes to live in the human village. He thinks that people act and think strangely, speak foolishly, and believe that they can change things, which Mowgli knows cannot be changed. These are just some of Mowgli's many adventures. The book also contains exploits by many different animals, such as the story of the white seal that saves other seals from being killed by men for their skins, the mongoose who rescues a family from husband and wife cobras, and a boy who sees elephants dance."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"Everyone knows this is one of the most amazing books of all time, so I'm not going to waste your time by reviewing the stories.

I had purchased one of Calla Editions' classics (Poe's Tales of Mystery and Imagination)to satisfy my impulse to revisit some of my other childhood reading, and when I saw this edition of Jungle Book among Calla's newer publications, I couldn't resist. I'm glad I didn't. Rikki didn't disappoint my memory of him(though the story seemed a lot shorter with the passage of years). What knocked me out are the incredible color plates by two Edwardian-era brothers--Edward and Maurice Detmold. A little Googling informed me that they'd worked together for a relatively short time before one committed suicide in his twenties; the other followed suit later on. What tragedies! The Detmolds' artistry is stunning. Mowgli is depicted as he always should have been--nude and without shame among his animal protectors, and Mowgli's antagonists--Sher Kan the tiger and Kaa the python are sinister in the Detmolds' potrayal of them. Calla has elected to run some of the color plates across two pages, which adds to their impact. Somebody at Calla must love the look of fine, old hardcover books, because they're making them available at prices within reach--and with the look and feel of the originals."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"I grew up reading and re-reading theses stories.

While the Disney interpretation is fun and enchanting, it makes a dramatic departure from the actual stories and takes considerable creative license in telling just a part of the Kipling stories. Even what we get from Disney falls considerably short of the applicable parts of Kipling's original that Disney used. What? Kaa, the snake, as Mowgli's friend and powerful ally? What? A deeper story of Mowgli's experience as a wolf and his relationships with Mother wolf and Father wolf? Oh yes, much, much more.Kipling's original masterpiece also includes several other wonderful chapters about the continuing adventures of Mowgli and also adds the marvelous tale of \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,\\" the heroic mongoose whose battles with wicked cobras in an Indian garden easily matches Mowgli's showdowns with Shere Khan.The book also includes the tale of \\"The White Seal.\\" This short chapter of \\"The Jungle Book(s)\\" provides a wonderful commentary, in the form of animal parable, on human society, competition, male ego and human pride. Our hero, Kotick, the white seal, through his fearless explorations and his willingness to fight for a dream, changes the minds of his parents, his peers and his society for the better. The invitation to each of us is very clear to find and free the white seal that exists in all of us.Don't get balled up in the notion that \\"The Jungle Book\\" is just for kids. A look beneath Kipling's wonderful prose reveals, like most great children's classics, that the author is using the unintimidating forum of children's literature to speak to kids of all ages with the hope that somehow we'll all finally get it.Buy the book, read it, read it to the kids you know and learn the lesson.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"This is a beautifully designed book and the quality is excellent. Dover seems to have corrected the earlier problem they had with a few of the books in this series, where the text quality was faded and inconsistent in spots. This book has sharp and consistent text and photographs."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"If you were to ask anyone to describe \\"The Jungle Book\\", they would probably take their cue from the widely knownDisney film, and say that it was about a young boy who was raised by wolves in the jungle, mentored by a bear and a panther, and who eventually kills a dangerous tiger. In this they'd be right, but they'd only be describing the first three chapters.The rest of the book is a series of unrelated short-stories about other animals, and which are not necessarily set in the jungle either. I was surprised at this, as although I knew that Disney had extensively reshaped the story, I had no idea that Mowgli's story was such a comparatively small part of the book. To my knowledge, Rudyard Kipling's characters have also featured in an anime series and alive-action film, and in both cases there has been no indication that the source material involved anything other than a boy called Mowgli and his adventures growing up in the jungle.Though I had known that Disney had extensively reworked Kipling's book (as Disney is always accustomed to do with its film adaptations) it was surprising to find out the real scope and beauty of the original collection of stories, and just how deeply the film had permeated public awareness of what the story involved. Here Mowgli's story doesn't end when he rejoins the man-village, Kaa the snake is not an enemy but an ally, Shere Khan is not defeated with fire, but with a well-strategized buffalo stampede, and there are no vultures that sound like The Beatles (though you probably had that figured out on your own). If there's one thing that especially stands out, it's that Mowgli in this story is much more likeable and intelligent than the loathsome little brat of the film.After Mowgli's father is killed in the jungle, he is raised by a wolf-pack as one of their own, called \\"the frog\\" on account of his gangly limbs, and tutored by Baloo the bear and Bagheera the panther in the ways of the Jungle Law: the fair but sometimes harsh edicts that make up life among the animals. Having escaped captivity at an early age, Bagheera in particular is serious about Mowgli's education, hoping that when he finally returns to his own people, he can take knowledge of the Jungle Law with him to teach his fellow man.Yet Mowgli is not easily accepted by either beast or man. Not only are the young wolves threatened by their inability to look him in the eye, but Shere Khan the tiger considers Mowgli his rightful prey. Likewise, the men and women of the village find the boy disconcerting in his habits and strange upbringing, making Mowgli quite a tragic figure in his inability to find a true home among either animals or mankind.The first three chapters of \\"The Jungle Book\\" revolve around Mowgli's story: his upbringing in the first chapter and defeat of Shere Khan in the third, leaving the second (rather oddly, considering it's out of chronological order) to deal with his kidnapping at the hands of the Bandar-log: the Monkey People. Kipling is wonderful at capturing the mystery and atmosphere of the jungle, as well as the fundamental character traits of the animals (the thoughtless monkeys, the malevolent jackal, the wise panther, the complex wolf-pack dynamics). He introduces concepts such as the Jungle Law and the Red Flower, the animal etiquette used in the sharing of hunting grounds and the way in which they address each other, and each species' unique customs and idioms. It's all fascinating stuff, carefully strewn throughout the story to provide a rich background to the world that Mowgli inhabits.The stories that follow are not quite as memorable, but still hold up well, and a couple have been published separately as their own books (\\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\" and \\"Toomai of the Elephants.\\")\\"The White Seal\\" involves the birth of a strange white seal called Kotick who - after witnessing the mass slaughter of his fellows at the hands of sealers - takes it upon himself to traverse the seas in search of a safe beach that has not been discovered by man. It takes several years and a visitation with the mysterious sea-cows before he can finally return to his people and tell them of his discoveries. It's at this point that a certain sense of values dissonance kicks in. Does Kotick convince his fellow seals to follow him to the promised land through his strong leadership and rousing speeches? No, he beats them all to a bloody pulp and insists on them following him once they've all been defeated.Outside of Mowgli's chapters, \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\" is probably the most famous of Kipling's short stories. A mongoose is adopted into the home of an English family living in the jungles of Sugauli cantonment, where it soon learns that a cobra and its mate are planning to kill the little boy in the attempt to drive the family away and reclaim the bungalow for themselves. Aided by other animals in the house and garden, Rikki-Tikki-Tavi prepares to defend his home and family against the snakes with a series of ambushes, tricks and his instinctive fighting abilities. This is definitely the most appealing of the stand-alone stories.\\"Toomai of the Elephants\\" concerns a young Indian boy who works with his father in the rounding-up and breaking-in of elephants for the Indian government. Having grown up among them, he has no fear of the elephants that he can control with simple words and hand gestures. Though his father prefers camp life, it is Toomai's greatest ambition to go hunting for the elephants in the jungle, though he is told that this will only occur when he \\"sees the elephants dance\\" (that is, never).But one night Kala Nag and the other trained elephants are acting strangely, and when several manage to break free of their pickets, Toomai climbs aboard Kala and is taken to mysterious clearing where elephants from miles around have indeed come to dance...In many ways \\"Her Majesty's Servants\\" feels like the odd one out in this collection. More for adults than children (who may find it rather incomprehensible) Kipling provides a first-person narrative account of a British soldier who eavesdrops on a number of animals in service to the army. As each one tries to explain, justify and comprehend their roles in the service of mankind, the listener is struck by the differences between each one, and their understanding of the world they inhabit.Up until this story, Kipling has managed to steer surprisingly clear of imperialism and unfortunate implications; here however, there is mention of \\"savage men and savage horses from somewhere at the back of Asia\\" and \\"a wild king of a very wild country,\\" as well as ending the story on a note of British superiority over the disorganization of its colonies. For these reasons, \\"Her Majesty's Servants\\" doesn't hold up as well as the other stories.As well as the seven short-stories, the book also contains several poems, songs and chants, usually said to be performed by the animals themselves.Just as many readers are unaware thatLittle Womenis composed of two books (Little Women and Good Wives) and that most of Alice's famous adventures took place in the sequelBehind The Looking Glass, it's a relatively little known fact that there was a sequel to the Jungle Book. Known simply asThe Second Jungle Book, Kipling includes several more Mowgli adventures in it, as well as other stand-alone stories and poems. Many editions of \\"The Jungle Book\\" combine both the first and second book into one volume, though it's difficult to tell which is which considering Amazon.com has grouped all the reviews together, regardless of what edition is being discussed. It's hard to know exactly what you'll be getting when you make the order, so keep in mind that it's easy to miss out on the sequel. There is also the risk of buying an abridged version that cuts out stories or tampers with Kipling's use of language (his use of the archaic terms \\"thee\\" and \\"thou\\" in discussions among the animals), so please be careful in deciding which edition to purchase.All in all, \\"The Jungle Book\\" is still a rich and intriguing read, with only a few dated passages. At the very least, it's worth reading in order to get an understanding of the source material as it was before Disney put its stamp on it."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"It's a very good book, and as far as I can tell it's very close to the original which was apparently a problem with some of the other printings."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"This is amazing.

However in some ways that can be interesting as it provides an unintended glimpse at how attitudes and points of view have changed i.e. Kipling's unconsciously blithe racism which often comes across as patronisingly affectionate. Kipling was, after all, a product of his age. Much of the story telling is truly calssic, beautifully written and a great read (especially the Mowgli stories)."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"Got this book for my stepdaughter, i consider it a classic, so i want her to start reading an collecting this type of books... a must have in my opinion!"},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"This is a very amazing book anyone who hasnt already should definantly read it.

If you haven't read this book before you will get confused with the setup of the book on the kindle, especially when you go from chapter to chapter, for example: the author starts the second chapter \\"Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack\\" with a poem, the title of the chapter is inserted as though it were part of the story in the first chapter and the poem is formatted like a text without commas or dashes to separate lines.The Story: I re-read this book after about 10 years and was pretty disappointed. The story really wasn't that well written. I feel like the story was very jumpy and did not flow from one idea, sentence or chapter very well. It's interesting to read in comparison to the fluffy Disney adaptation but that is really all I found this useful for. I appreciate that the author continually noted man's follies through the book by making Mowgli extremely hard headed and naive through his youth while commenting on the childish nature of humans in general. If this book was intended as a child's tale when it was written I think it is now out of it's era and the disney version is more up to par. This book may be good for a teen but may be too adult for anyone under 10, both linguistically and thematically.

The book consists of 7 short stories, separated by seven poems. The first three stories involve Mowgli, but the other four stories are not part of that series, nor do they all take place in the same jungle or any jungle at all. What these stories do have in common is the anthropomorphizing of animals as characters in these stories. As with all fables, these stories impart a moral message to the reader.\\"Mowgli's Brothers\\" is the first story in the book and was originally published in January of 1894 in \\"St. Nicholas Magazine\\". The story is about Mowgli being adopted by the wolf family which then raises him. With Shere Khan hunting in their area of the jungle, the Father Wolf (Akela) and the mother (Raksha) find and take in a human baby. At the wolf council, Baloo speaks for the cub, and Bagheera buys his life with a fresh kill. As time passes, Shere Khan turns most of the wolves against Mowgli, and they plot to overthrow Akela as the leader. Mowgli is then sent away from the wolves, vowing to return with Shere Khan's hide. This story is followed by the \\"Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack\\".\\"Kaa's Hunting\\" is a short study from March-April of 1894. It takes place sometime during the period covered in \\"Mowgli's Brothers\\", though it isn't mentioned in that story. It is a story about Mowgli's abduction by monkees, a.k.a the Bandar-log. Baloo and Bagheera, rescue Mowgli with the aid of Kaa. This story is followed by the \\"Road Song of the Bandar-Log\\".\\"Tiger! Tiger!\\" was a short story published in February of 1894 in magazines before being published in this collection. This covers the confrontation between Mowgli and Shere Khan. Mowgli has been kicked out of the jungle and has been adopted by a couple who believe he is Nathoo, the child that they lost. Mowgli tries to fit in, but he alienates himself from the others because he doesn't accept their misconceptions about the jungle. Shere Khan returns and is plotting to kill Mowgli, but he is warned by one of his wolf friends (Grey Brother) whom he goes to visit regularly. Mowgli comes up with a plan to kill Shere Khan, but when successful he gets into an argument with Buldeo, the hunger. Buldeo tries to take Shere Khan's skin, but Mowgli refuses to give it to him, so Buldeo turns the entire village against him and Mowgli finds himself an outcast of both the jungle and the village. This story is followed by \\"Mowgli's Song\\".\\"The White Seal\\" is a short story published in August of 1893. The story is about Kotick, a rare white-furred seal who spends his life searching for a home where seals will not be hunted by humans. He is isolated from the other seals by his goal, but he finally discovers a place that the Sea Cows know which is free from man. This story is followed by \\"Lukannon\\".\\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\" is a story from November of 1893. In this story an English family save a young mongoose (Rikki Tikki) who becomes their pet. Rikki Tikki first saves the families young boy Teddy from a dust brown snakeling. Rikki Tikki takes to patrolling the house while the family sleeps, and it is during this that he is warned by Chuchundra that there are two cobras (Nag and Nagaina) that are planning to kill the family. Rikki Tikki first takes on Nag, waking the father who kills Nag. Nagaina then swears vengeance, but Rikki Tikki gets help from Darzee (a tailor bird) and locates Nagainaj's nest and then uses the eggs to distract Nagaina to save Teddy again. This story is followed by \\"Darzee's Chant\\".\\"Toomai of the Elephants\\" is a short story from the December of 1893. In this story little Toomai is told that he cannot be an elephant handler unless he sees the dance of the elephants. When the great elephant Kala Nag hears the call of the elephant from far off in the jungle, he goes to find the elephants, taking little Toomai with him. This story is followed y \\"Shiv and the Grasshopper\\".\\"Her Majesty's Servants\\" was originally published in March of 1894. This story is about the various animals used to support Her Majesty's armed forces in India. The animals discuss their roles in the army, each taking pride in the function they perform. This is followed by \\"Parade-Song of the Camp Animals\\" which closes out the book.This is a good collection of short stories, though there is a definite variability in the quality, and of course they don't all take place in the jungle. Rudyard Kipling wrote poems, short stories, and novels. Having lived in India, England, and the United States, and also spent a fair amount of time in South Africa. He drew on the rich cultural history that he enjoyed to create some wonderful tales. He remains one of the best known writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \\"The Jungle Book\\" is one of his best known works, though most know it through films which do not accurately represent the stories within. It blends his short fiction with some of his poems, but I find it a bit too uneven to give it five-stars."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"This is the book to get-- Kipling's original. It's got the Mowgli stories, Rikki Tikki and more. It's light on illustrations but you can find supplementary illustrations online. This edition is small, complete, and highly portable."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"I can't begin to count how many times I've read this book from one end to the other--still less the times I've dipped in just to reread a favorite tale over. It may be Kipling's defining juvenile book, in part because it's written for a slightly older audience thanJust So Stories, with more violence and a more mature level of language (the Mowgli stories particularly feature dialogue written in \\"the vernacular,\\" a rather formal kind of speech used by native speakers in India).Most of the 15 stories are set in the Subcontinet, where Kipling was born and to which he returned as a man; the rest (\\"The White Seal,\\" \\"Quiquern\\") take place in the Far North. Eight feature Mowgli (Hindi for \\"frog\\"), a gypsy child whose parents were frightened off by Shere Khan, the lame tiger, leaving him to be rescued and adopted by a pair of wolves. He is raised in the jungle (\\"Mowgli's Brothers,\\" \\"Kaa's Hunting,\\" \\"How Fear Came\\"), learning its laws and speaking the languages of its creatures, until at the age of 10 he is caught up in a sort of palace coup engineered by the tiger and forced to leave his pack. He stays among humans for four months, kills Shere Khan (\\"Tiger! Tiger!\\"), is driven out by the villagers and ultimately pays them back in spades (\\"Letting in the Jungle\\"), then returns to the wolves, has various further adventures (\\"The King's Ankus\\"), and ultimately saves the pack from invading dholes (\\"Red Dog\\") before his human instincts at last him force him back to his own kind (\\"The Spring Running,\\" which invaribaly makes me tear up). (If you want to find out what happened to him afterward, read \\"In the Rukh,\\" which can be found inMany Inventions..) Featuring such creatures as Mother and Father Wolf, Gray Brother (the oldest of their pups), Baghera the Black Panther, Baloo the brown bear, Kaa the Rock Python, Hathi the elephant, Chil the kite, and Akela, the Lone Wolf who leads Mowgli's pack for years, these stories are about as far from the Disney version as anything you can imagine, and to my mind far superior. (I wish some studio would take them up as Harry Potter was, and do them accurately: the animatronics and CGI that gave us such caracters as the ice-bears inThe Golden Compass (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)and the farm animals inMist: The Tale of a Sheepdog PuppyandBabe (Widescreen Special Edition)would bring them to life as never before.)\\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\" tells the story of a young mongoose taken into a human home and how he fights a pair of cobras in the garden. \\"Toomai of the Elephants\\" features Little Toomai, whose forebears for three generations have been the mahouts of Kala Nag, the great work elephant, and how his friendship with the pachyderm leads him to see \\"the sight that never man saw,\\" the elephants' dance. \\"The Miracle of Purun Baghat\\" is about a high-ranking native official who forsakes position and honors to become a mendicant holy man, and how he saves a tiny hill village from a catastrophic landslide. In \\"The Undertakers,\\" a man-eating crocodile, a jackal, and an adjutant-stork discuss the vagaries of humanity on a sandbar. \\"Her Majesty's Servants,\\" a story particularly suitable for reading in a multicultural society like that of the U.S., eavesdrops on the conversation between a troop-horse, two mules, a baggage-camel, and a pair of gun-bullocks on the night before a great troop review. In \\"The White Seal,\\" Kotick, a fur-seal born snow-white, sets out on a quest to find a place where his kind will be safe from human fur-hunters. \\"Quiquern\\" tells of a young Inuit hunter and how he and his dog save his people in a time of starvation.These stories should probably be read aloud first, since their rather formal language will make them difficult for the younger independent reader to follow, particularly in these days of dumbed-down readers (although the homeschooled may not have as much trouble). Kids of 11 or 12 should be able to read them alone. Despite Kipling's occasional imperialistic chauvinism (hardly unique to him in that time and place), he had a real knowledge of India, its creatures, and its people, and he loved them all, with an intensity that comes through in every tale; and his language, as well as his characters', often approaches the poetic (he was, after all, a noted and prolific poet aswell as a fictioneer). No English-speaking child should reach his teens without coming to know the book."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"This is a classic tale of course, the thing I like about this copy is the quality for the price.

And so much more enjoyable for it.Also included are the tales of Rikki Tikki Tavi, the Elephant Dance, and the White Seal. I would have to say that my favorite is Rikki Tikki Tavi, he's just so loveable and wonderful. There is a sense of magic in Kiplings animals, every reader will find themselves dreaming of being raised by wolves and taught the law of the jungle by Baloo.I know that this was written as a children's book - but I have a hard time believing that my 11 year old son would be able to read and enjoy it, the beauty of the language will be lost on many of the younger readers who are used to the forward speaking newer YA books.

The Jungle Book is, of course, a classic and not in need of a review; however, if your only exposure to the Jungle Book is Disney, please give this a try. I wanted to commend Sterling Publishers on making a quality, affordable edition of this and other classics. The paper quality was nice, not thin or translucent.

Over the years I have purchased many copies of each as presents. Both can be difficult to find in versions unaltered from the original. I have found this to be particularly true in the case of The Jungle Book. Some folks just don't seem to get that Kipling had a pretty good handle on what he was doing. One does not tamper with a Masterpiece.This version is the real thing. It reads word for word the same as the tattered, 40-year-old copy that I first read when I was eight years old.

Rudyard Kipling dug deep into the tales of the jungle from his years living in India, and drew from them the kinds of stories that live forever.\\"The Jungle Book\\" is more than how Mowgli, the man cub, learns to live and survive amongst enemies like Shere Khan. The intense mongoose vs cobra \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,\\" also well-known, is here, as are several lesser-known and unrelated adventures.Richly written, with details and contexts unfamiliar to Western readers, \\"The Jungle Book\\" lifts imagination and language beautifully. Poetic, and written in a literary style, it shines above most modern prose.This is the stuff of afternoon stories read to older boys and girls. Young teens will while away rainy evenings, unwilling to part until finished. Sometimes scary and always exciting, Kipling also uses the book to teach lessons much greater than a jungle in India.When chapters were first read to me many years ago, I listened gawk-eyed, listening intently for as long as my mother would read. I read it with different eyes now, but no less a young boy as I worry how Baloo will handle the Bandar-Log monkeys.It isn't perfect. A few scientific details are fudged (wolf pack breeding structure, for example), but nothing that matters in the big picture. Kipling will have you in the palm of his hand, even though it was first published over 100 years ago.May \\"The Jungle Book\\" by Rudyard Kipling be as amazing to you as it has been to me.--Brockeim"},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"I own several titles in the Calla Editions' series of books, i.e.East of the Sun and West of the Moon: Old Tales from the North (Calla Editions),Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Calla Editions),Stories from Hans Christian Andersen (Calla Editions), andThe Knave of Hearts (Calla Editions). They are all of superior quality in terms of binding, paper, as well as illustrations. The book is larger than a regular hardcover, and this particular title \\"The Jungle Book\\" weighs about two pounds. This 2010 Calla edition is a republication of the edition originally published by Macmillan and Co. in 1908. The paper is of heavy stock, one can literally feel the heft of each page! The color of the paper is ivory (or something close to it), and it is bound in pearl linen. The font used is Kennerley Old Style and Michelangelo, and apart from decorative borders on the pages, the highlight of this book is the 16 color plates, some in two-page spreads by twin brother artists Edward and Maurice Detmold.According to the information provided within the book, these illustrations are \\"reproduced from an extremely scarce, original portfolio of watercolors, and have never before appeared on this scale in book form.\\" I believe it! They are truly beautiful and exquisite, and incredibly detailed, almost life-like. There is one illustration featuring an unclothed Mowgli standing alongside the Lone Wolf, and the rich earthy tones in the picture are brilliantly depicted. There's another illustration (two-page spread) titled The \\"Council Rock\\" which has a magnificent Bagheera and I swear the glint in his eye appears very real!The depiction of Kaa the Python is also stunning.

These stories are great reads, enjoyable by all ages.Fans of the movie will find a more complex work here -- not \\"darker,\\" but more ambiguous; the three stories from this collection that have generally been adapted into other media, and that most readers think of when they think of \\"The Jungle Book\\", focus on outcast human infant, Mowgli, who is abandoned as an infant in the jungle and raised by wolves, and primarily tell the story of his search for a \\"place\\" within the wolf pack, the Jungle, and the human world, and his outsider status in all three realms. Perhaps because they focus almost entirely on the Indian jungle, or perhaps because they're aimed at children, these stories are also largely free of the undertone (overtone?) of imperialism that runs through much of Kipling's work for adults.It has, of course, been massively influential on later writers, from Edgar Rice Burrough's _Tarzan_ to Neil Gaiman's _The Graveyard Book_. The various morals contained within the \\"Mowgli\\" stories were also taken as a motivational book within the Scouting movement (reading this helped me understand why I had to memorize \\"Akela\\" when I was a cub scout).While only three stories in this collection focus on Mowgli, Kipling did write a second collection, \\"The Second Jungle Book,\\" which is almost entirely comprised of Mowgli stories, and which I would highly recommend if you like these tales. If you want to read more of Kipling's work for adults, I'd recommend either \\"The Man Who Would be King\\" or the short story collection \\"Plain Tales from the Hills,\\" both of which should be available for free online.As to formatting of this kindle edition: there are blocks of Kipling's poetry in between the stories, some of which was difficult to read as the formatting had not carried over well to this Kindle edition. Not a critical issue, but Kipling's poetry is excellent and the formatting errors were annoying."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"I evaluated three series of abridged/paraphrased classics: Great Illustrated Classics, Stepping Stones, and Classic Starts. I specifically read Treasure Island in all three versions, but also evaluated the Jungle Book and other stories in at least two of the versions.The Classic Starts version of the Jungle Book and other stories is the most complex in language and sentence structure. It's not as easy for a beginning reader to read as Stepping Stones or Great Illustrated Classics, but offers a much better story by virtue of more adjectives, adverbs and clauses in the sentence structure.With these paraphrased versions, there is always the dilemma one faces: whether to wait until the genuine, original story is accessible or risk turning the reader off with a poor paraphrase that lacks the vibrancy of the real thing, but possibly gain the enjoyment of a classic gem much earlier than the original text would afford. In the case of the Jungle Book in particular, you also have the movie. I imagine it would be hard to follow the real story after the movie. I'm glad my kids will have heard Kiplings version before Disney's.Personally, I bought the books intending to read to my kingergarten age children, rather than have them read. We found the Classic Starts to have by far the best versions of the stories, notwithstanding the originals which are just too long for us, in language that is hard to be understood. Since I am reading them aloud, we've forgone the simplest versions which are perhaps a bit too butchered to really stand out as the excellent stories the originals gained a reputation for. I feel that the Classic Starts are rich enough that they easily match original versions of simpler tales like The Little House on the Prarie or Charlotte's Web.So far, with the children, we finished Call of the Wild, are half-way through the Jungle Book, and started Treasure Island. Then we're on to The Odyssey, Moby Dick and Tom Sawyer. Move over Pippi Longstockings and Amelia Bedelia! Previously we've read books like those of Beverly Cleary, the Little House series, Milne's Pooh, and Horrible Harry, besides hundreds of basically picture books (think Virginia Lee Burton, H. A. Rey etc.) The classics have a little bolder story lines, and these abridged series make them more accessible."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"Legends are made from legends. Rudyard Kipling dug deep into the tales of the jungle from his years living in India, and drew from them the kinds of stories that live forever.\\"The Jungle Book\\" is more than how Mowgli, the man cub, learns to live and survive amongst enemies like Shere Khan. The intense mongoose vs cobra \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,\\" also well-known, is here, as are several lesser-known and unrelated adventures.Richly written, with details and contexts unfamiliar to Western readers, \\"The Jungle Book\\" lifts imagination and language beautifully. Poetic, and written in a literary style, it shines above most modern prose.This is the stuff of afternoon stories read to older boys and girls. Young teens will while away rainy evenings, unwilling to part until finished. Sometimes scary and always exciting, Kipling also uses the book to teach lessons much greater than a jungle in India.When chapters were first read to me many years ago, I listened gawk-eyed, listening intently for as long as my mother would read. I read it with different eyes now, but no less a young boy as I worry how Baloo will handle the Bandar-Log monkeys.It isn't perfect. A few scientific details are fudged (wolf pack breeding structure, for example), but nothing that matters in the big picture. Kipling will have you in the palm of his hand, even though it was first published over 100 years ago.May \\"The Jungle Book\\" by Rudyard Kipling be as amazing to you as it has been to me.--Brockeim"},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"The Jungle Book is now one of my all time favorite books. When you read the book it makes you feel like you're there too. I like the way Rudyard Kipling has the animals talk. The main character in the story is a boy named Mowgli. Mowgli was abandoned by his mother and father and raised by wolves. I thinkMowgli is the perfect character for the story because he is brave, smart, and kind.The part I disliked the most in the story is when they keep going to the council rock. I thought it was boring. I liked the excitement in the book and the cliff hangers. Once I picked up the book I couldn't set it down again. I definitely recommend this book to anybody who is in for a challenge!"},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"kipling is great of course, but part of the story is missing, the chapters run together, and there is no table of contents"},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"Since he wrote these stories during the several years he spent in Brattleboro, VT, we of the North Country have a particular affinity for Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Books. The most familiar are the Mowgli tales, basis for the very good Disney movie. Mowgli is an Indian infant who is lost in the jungle after Shere Khan (the tiger) kills his family. Bagheera (the black panther) places him with a wolf family that has a newborn litter. Mowgli's new &quot;parents&quot; and Bagheera and Baloo (the brown bear) sponsor him for membership in the Wolf Pack and, much to Shere Khan's chagrin, he is admitted. Mowgli is raised according to Jungle Law, but all the while Shere Khan is plotting his revenge and ingratiating himself with the younger wolves. Eventually, he leads a rebellion against Akela, the pack's aging leader and attacks Mowgli, who beats him away with a burning firebrand. In these and the several other Mowgli stories--there are some prequels--Kipling strikes a nice balance between anthropomorphizing the animals and understanding Mowgli's natural superiority.Also appearing in this collection is a story I've loved since I first saw the Classic Cartoon version--Rikki Tikki Tavi. It tells the story of an intrepid young mongoose and his life or death battle to protect an Indian villa from a couple of particularly unpleasant cobras. Rikki Tikki Tavi has always seemed to me to be one of the great heroes in all of literature.These are great stories for young and old. For folks who worry about Kipling's potentially imperialist, racist or racialist overtones (see review), rest assured, these tales are free of such themes. They offer an excellent opportunity to introduce kids to the work of a true master storyteller.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"I have never seen The Jungle Book movie, I just wanted to understand a bit of what might have captured the imagination of people 100 years ago (and how they might have written stories). The Jungle Book is not a happy story about people bopping around in the jungle, it is about life and death and honour and character and discipline in a pitiless world. Because it is written in a dense style by Rudyard Kipling almost 120 years ago, it is not easy to follow, but it does tell in eight chapters and eight poems interesting tales of the deep jungle. First of all it tells the tale of Mowgli, how he's rescued from Shere Khan the tiger by Mother Wolf, and championed by Akela, and then it goes into his education, his abduction by the lawless monkey tribes, his confrontation with the Jungle council, his re-emergence into human society, and his final revenge on Shere Khan. The story continues on The Jungle Book 2, but we also have non-Mowgli stories: the amazing tale of Riki-Tiki-Tavi (which I saw once on TV as a non-Mowgli Jungle Book animation), as well as a really wonderful story of a white seal trying to save his seal-mates from perpetual exploitation and hunting from the nearby Russian communities.Some of the stories are not so great - I didn't really understand the point of \\"Toomai of the Elephants\\" or \\"Her Majesty's Servants\\", but on the whole it was a great, if somewhat incomprehensible, book."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"Free is good but some quality control would have been nice.As it is, chapters and even complete stories flow over in each other without any non-literal clue."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"The Jungle Book is a classic we all know, however Robert Ingpen's illustrations bring this book alive.

It is a very special addition to anyone's collection."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"If your only experience with Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book is through the Disney version put that completely out of your head. Besides the title of the book and the name and species of the animals the two have almost nothing in common. Disney took the very kernel of the story and then bled the heart and soul out of it. At least they didn't give Mowgli a cute but endearing sidekick.The Jungle Book is the story of a young Indian boy raised from infancy by the animals of the Asian jungle. The concept shares similarities with Tarzan of the Apes but preceded the Edgar Rice Burroughs classic by nearly 20 years. They differ in that Tarzan was fully an adult and not able to hold full conversations with the animals. Mowgli is capable of having sophisticated discussions with his panther friend Bagheera and bear Baloo about the laws of the Jungle. Kipling doesn't shy away from violence as this is the jungle but even the human characters see more than a few deaths. In the one scene in the Disney version that actually semi relates to the book Mowgli is kidnapped by the Bandar-log (monkeys). In the movie he's rescued by Bagheera and Baloo who bop the Monkey's and send them scampering on their way. In the book Bagheera, Baloo and Kaa the python (yes, in the book Mowgli and Kaa are good friends) slaughter the monkeys. At the end of the fight Kaa utilizes his hypnotic powers, influencing the Monkey's into walking straight into his gapping mouth. It's a rather horrifying scene and the only time where he uses this hypnotic talent.The Jungle Books is a classic that lives up to the name classic. Kipling has a wonderful poetic style that seems to be lost on today's writers. Only about half the stories concern Mowgli but almost all feature conversations between animals. These aren't technically talking animals since they cannot communicate with humans other than Mowgli but they can communicate amongst themselves. In one short story that I particularly enjoyed various domesticated animals in the British military discuss their roles, trying to promote their own importance while diminishing others. Some stories take place outside of India including several in the arctic. The Jungle Books also contains the story of Rikki-Tikki-Tavi which was animated by Chuck Jones. Kipling excels at setting moods and creating compelling dialogue. Mowgli's stories both begin and end the collection of short stories and by the end of the book I was saddened to leave his jungle home. The Jungle Books is classified as for young adults but the beauty and sophistication of the writing would keep just about any adult satisfied. Just make sure you get the actual Kipling book and not a watered down adaptation."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"Rudyard Kipling's mastery of the English language is wound throughout the pages of this book.

I will."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"There were some things I didn't like in the Jungle Book and that was that some people discrimanted at Mowgli because he was a human and not an animal. For example, the big elephants always didn't like Mowgli because he was a human but the little elephant always stayed his friend no matter what. I like the part that the little elephant was his friend but what about the others. His friends see whats on the inside and not what's on the outside.Also we see how the bad guy wants to get the good guy. But it's not only in Jungle Book it's always. This book shows the ignorance of people towards animals. We see how different things show new things in life. For example, you can't be plain and boring all the time, you have to try new things in life to explore. But it's not only about life but also other things.It's sad to notice that sometimes in life, people take advantage of you and in the Jungle Book that is clearly stated. You can see the love between animals and humans and that is what I think is the most important part of the book. The monkeys say thier Mowgli's friend but they aren't there when he needs them only the bear, Baloo is. And I think kids should be read this book becuase, It shows that if you try anything can be overcame. I loved this book, it was one of the most exciting and interesting books I have read in a while."},{"Title":"Jungle Book (Templar Classics)","review":"This book was many short stories in it; most of the stories are about Mowgli and a few of them are about other animals and their adventures. My favorite one was Rikki-Tikki-Tavi.Since this book is mostly about Mowgli, I should say something about it. Mowgli is a boy who was adopted by wolves and grew up to live with them all his life. He can speak their language and they love him. But Mowgli has one enemy, a lame tiger named Shere Kan. The Mother wolf had saved Mowgli from the evil tiger so Shere Kan hates him. Of course, there's a battle at the end. It is a pretty interesting story or, more like, pretty interesting stories.My favorite story, like I said before, was Rikki-Tikki-Tavi. Rikki, the mongoose who is washed out by a heavy rain and is found by a human boy named Teddy. Rikki is cared for and soon becomes healthy and fit again. One day, Rikki goes out to the large and rather uncultivated garden when he hears two birds chirping sadly. Rikki asks what had happened and one of the birds, named Darzee, tells him that one of their eggs had fallen out and was eaten by the black cobra Nag. At that moment, Nag comes out and tries to kill Rikki by making him pay attention to him while Nagfs wife, Nagaina, creeps up on Rikki. At the last moment, Rikki notices that Nagaina is behind him and he runs away.After that incident, Rikki vows to kill the two evil cobras. One day, Rikki overhears Nag and Nagaina discussing on how to kill him. They plan to break into the house, kill the humans with their deadly bite, and then, kill Rikki. Rikki quickly runs back to the house and waits till nightfall. Soon, he hears a drainpipe rattling and sees Nagfs hooded head creeping towards him with Nagaina right behind him. Rikki hides and waits till Nag comes out. When Nag turns his head towards the beds, Rikki pounces and bites Nagfs head. Rikki is nearly killed then, but the master of the house, Teddyfs father, wakes up from all the noise and shoots Nag.Nagaina, seeing all this, slinks back to her nest. While Rikki regains his strength, he finds out that Nagaina has eggs in her nest and starts searching for her with the aid of Darzeefs wife. When Rikki finds her, Darzeefs wife pretends that her wing is broken and hops around Nagaina. Nagaina moves to kill Darzeefs wife when Rikki runs from behind and takes one of the eggs away. Nagaina turns and tries to strike out at Rikki but Rikki breaks all of the eggs but keeps only one egg unbroken. Rikki threatens Nagaina to get away and Nagaina obeys him. As soon as Nagaina moved away, Rikki breaks the last of the eggs. Rikki and Nagaina battle, both finally falling into Nag and Nagainafs hole.Will Rikki win? Will he survive Nagaina's terrible strenght? If Nagaina wins and is still alive, would she marry again with another black cobra and lay eggs? You'll have to read the book to find out.....This story was sooo fun and exciting. That is mainly my reason for liking this story better than the others.

Indeed the language is one of the most delightful parts of the book. I wasn't as happy with the novel's plot, and I thought the ending was somewhat weak, but I got a lot out of the picture of the society and the discussions.

She addresses several of the gender roles in patriarchy in the context of unavoidable biological differences. Some of the issues she adddresses are sexual objectification and social oppression. Brantenberg uses a creative role reversal to accomplish this. She makes female issues, like menstruation and childbirth, most important socially. She also presents sexual objectification from a matriarchal perspective. This book makes you more aware of the social issues and patriarchal ideals that have been traditionally overlooked and need to be dispelled in modern society.

I wanted a happy ending for him.There were some elements I could do without... There is a rape, and the relationship between these young Egalian men and their older wom's felt creepy to me. The one teacher who hooks up with an ex-student, likewise.

Or even tolerable."},{"Title":"Egalia's Daughters: A Satire of the Sexes","review":"This book is both hilarious and makes you think. It's subtitled \\"A satire of the sexes\\", and that basically says it all. It's an upside-down society, in which men are repressed and taken advantage of, and women have all the power. There men wear the skirts and have to cover their unattractive, flat chests, while women wear the pants and can walk around topless if they want to. And the men take care of the kids, once the woman has decided she wants to have one. The whole language reflects this society's views, e.g. by referring to humanity as Woman, rather than Man. It's written in Norwegian originally, and I really feel sorry for the translator who had to find culturally and linguistically comparable expressions. I've read the original, and the language \\"switch\\" is even more successful there. (... that \\"history\\" was left in the original form, which it should rightfully be, as this has nothing to do with the pronoun \\"his\\") It does lose a bit of the wordplay-effect of the original, which is inevitable. Still I think the translation is good, considering the differences between the languages.Because of the \\"creative\\" language it's a bit heavy to read, especially in the beginning. At least I found myself trying to \\"translate\\" back to the usual way of saying things - the patriarcaic way. But if you're looking for a book out of the ordinary and don't mind the effort, this is an interesting read."},{"Title":"Egalia's Daughters: A Satire of the Sexes","review":"Although the English version has about twenty to fifty editing errors and is not the original language it was written in, Egalia's Daughters by Gerd Brantenberg, is a highly inventive study of female oppression through every stratum of society, down to the smallest detail, such as how women are oppressed liguistically. The english language denotes girls as females and women and denotes boys a simpler version or primary version of those words, male and men. Thus Egalia equates women with wym and males with mafeles, making the every word (except history) switch to give women a dominance over males.The most interesting part, however, is not the lurid sex scenes, which are probably more accepted in Norway(is she from Norway?) or the hard to grasp linguistic switch Gerd presents, but rather the success of the menwym (men) to find freedom and some level of equality within an obviously biased and completely unfair society in which menwym are nothing more than sex objects.I would suggest this book to anyone who does not agree with feminist thought. If you think women are treated fairly, read this book. It's not only completely entertaining, but educational as well. It made me think thrice."},{"Title":"Egalia's Daughters: A Satire of the Sexes","review":"This book describes a world in which gender roles have been reversed and in particular the fortunes of one &quot;masculinist&quot; boy who tries to fight against the opression of his gender.When you first start reading it lots of the reversals may seem artificial and a bit trite and you might think that this is nothing more than a feminist take on the UK comedians the two Ronnies' long run sketch &quot;the worm that turned&quot;. Even at this level it is very much worth reading if your sense of humour is in anyway childish and scatalogical.This book goes further than this in two ways.First it has brilliant justifications for why women (or wim) have the power in the society described in the book which are just as convincing as the usual psuedo-biological &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; type arguements most recently put forward by a certain US law professor. This undelines the point that a story consistent with the facts is not necessarily &quot;true&quot; , even if a &quot;true&quot; story could be used as justification for the status quo.Second, by ascribing to the men in the book the characteristics usually asociated with women (so men are now from venus and women are from mars!) it also undermines the 70/80s feminst view that a society run by women would be much &quot;bettter&quot; than a society run by men.While none of this points are very profound it is after all a novell rather than an essay in feminist theory, it is a brilliant satire and should definately be read."},{"Title":"Egalia's Daughters: A Satire of the Sexes","review":"Although you have to adjust to the pronoun reversal in the book (women=wym, men=menwym, history=herstory), I found it easy to get past this quirk and really enjoyed this book. I especially liked the fun that was poked at particular gender-specific activities: The traumatic rite of passage of buying a first bra is transformed into buying a first \\"pehoe\\" or penis cover; in hot weather, those with mammary glands are free to go about without a shirt, while those with hairy chests are forced to keep their clothes on; it takes hours to groom a beard and properly adorn it with beads and ribbons. These and other clever satirical twists make the book very effective in pointing out gender inequalities in our society. My reading group had a great time discussing this book."},{"Title":"Egalia's Daughters: A Satire of the Sexes","review":"A couple of things other reviewers haven't touched upon:-Brantenburg presents a compelling illustration of the popular view that one must choose between being a Marxist and a feminist (or a Sparksist and a musculist!)-The self-referential ending is a clever and extremely effective literary technique. It adds richness and interest to the story, and powerfully defends the book against some well-anticipated criticism.Anyone who does not think that women continue to be oppressed in Western societies needs to read this book.Brava!"},{"Title":"Egalia's Daughters: A Satire of the Sexes","review":"Gerd Brantenberg's Egalia's Daughters creates a world where the women are in charge, and matriarchy exists. The women are the heads of the household, the breadwinners, while the men stay at home and take care of the children. If there is a party, the women have to convince the men to go along. However, the reluctant men worry that they do not look nice enough to go to parties, and complain of being too tired after doing housework. They do not want to spend time dressing up and fixing their beards with ribbons. Moreover, in this fantasy world, the language is completely different. The women are called wim and the men, menwim. This change enforces the idea of women being superior. Also, common last names include Lizdaughter instead of Johnson, emphasizing the feminine world of Egalia. This book satirizes our world in many ways and forces us to pay attention to the patriarchal society we live in."},{"Title":"Egalia's Daughters: A Satire of the Sexes","review":"This book is thought-provoking; men who just can't understand women's viewpoints no matter how hard they try (but are you really trying? I want to ask) should read this book and put themselves in the male protagonist's shoes. Another plus for the book is that it shows that a society run by women won't be much different from the one we have now, because for one sex to be dominant the other has to be oppressed. The book makes an interesting read and some very good points, so you probably won't find yourself bored. Try it, and after that I recommend discussing it with a member of the opposite sex."},{"Title":"Egalia's Daughters: A Satire of the Sexes","review":"This book is a captivating story about coming of age and a profound statement about gender divisions in human society. Brantenberg artfully tells a story about growing up and questioning the social roles and expectations encountered along the way. The history and social structure of an imaginary society are developed and brought to life in this book, to the point that I had trouble putting it down for curiosity about what would happen next."},{"Title":"Egalia's Daughters: A Satire of the Sexes","review":"After reading Egalia's Daughters, I realized that the author, Gerd Brantenberg, has many recurring themes which relate to the oppression of men in a woman dominated society. In my view, the language, family structures and the entitlements women are given for having children, are the most important topics in the satire. I am amazed by the language in Egalia's Daughters because the author chooses to go outside the norms when using this language, ignoring traditional uses of the English language (maybe due to the fact this language is translated from the Norwegian language to the English language). In my opinion, Brantenberg uses women-centered language to add to the satire of her work and also to point out the male-identified nature of language in our society. I agree with the author's choice to provide the reader with examples of the rationalizations the women use to support their positions of power and control. They are similar to the rationalizations the men use to support their positions of power and control in today's society. I also agree with the author's choice to award the women a palace where they can go and give birth because this is a form of respect given to the well-deserved hardworking women of the Egalsund sociey. I really enjoyed reading Egalia's Daughters because it really gave me a sense of the things our society takes for granted in women from another female's perspective."},{"Title":"Egalia's Daughters: A Satire of the Sexes","review":"Brantenberg shows us the ridiculousness of our own gender troubles by constructing a society that is or own stereotypically gendered opposite.This book will make you look not only at society but the very basics of language in a different way.

While Dabrowski devotes considerable attention in the text to the initial prototypes of this one-time competitor of the Messerschmitt Bf 109, he hardly discusses the ensuing (albeit limited) production run of the He 112B model, not to mention the He 112's operational service with several air forces. Furthermore the book does not include any technical specifications for the aircraft (even those as simple as engines used and armament!) which is highly unusual in a book of this nature. Finally as a translation into English, the text is awkward in several spots.\\"Heinkel He 112\\"'s only redeeming feature is the wealth of photographs it contains, including many that do not appear in the usual sources of German World War II military aviation. For those interested in learning more about what could have been the standard Luftwaffe fighter if not for the more successful Bf 109, however, this is not enough."},{"Title":"Load Testing for eConfidence","review":"I believe this originated as Stefan Asbock's dissertation. In any case, he looks at performance testing in a mature and thorough way. The book points out that systems can be overloaded in many ways. The simplest is to exhaust their connections to the outside world (so no one can log on). But the people who are logged on can overload the system by exhausting its memory, exhausting its storage (disk space), exhausting connections to internal resources (such as a database or a printer that you can access after you log on) or exhausting the processor's ability to keep up with requests. Different types of users will make different types of demands on the system. We can model the performance demands on a system by thinking in terms of several types of stereotypic users and then sampling percentages of each type. Thus if the user base is 80% heavy-database users, we might be able to handle only 10 simultaneous users, but if the user base is only 10% heavy-database, maybe we can handle 100 simultaneous users. The clarity of his presentation of the need to develop weighted models of user types influenced many budding performance testers in the 1990's. I think the book should be seen as a classic."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"This book is an interesting anthropological work. It has a lot of observations about family life and how parenting practices in this observed population are somehow optimal in the opinion of the author. A lot of people have taken these as recommendations, or as something to emulate.Whether or not you choose to emulate these practices, you should consider that this is not a parenting book, and most importantly the author is not a parent. She does not pretend to understand what parenting really consists of, so no reader should ascribe that authority to her.Some statements in the book, like that these babies whose \\"continuum needs\\" are met do not cry, are patently unscientific and extremely misleading IF you take this to be a parenting book. Of course these babies cry. Other anthropological studies have shown that babies that in traditional and \\"primitive\\" cultures, babies who cry more have a lower risk of infant mortality. How does that square with these simple observations? They don't.So while this book is interesting and a good read, take it with a grain of salt if it has been recommended to you as good preparation for parenthood. It is NOT preparation for parenthood in a technologically advanced culture, and in fact I consider it harmful because it sets up expectations that are completely unrealistic for the majority of parents who would be reading a review online."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"This is one of the major keys to illiminating and illuminating the the mass trauma of our small intertwined humanity.

I read the book and met with the author in the 80's. There is no doubt in my mind the awesome power present in a baby and the tremendous influence a baby's environment/treatment is. Ask for science to explain why there is \\"anything\\", never will science or God know who or what is responsible for the beginning of everything. Science is a handy tool but the greatest minds consistently decentrate (Russell Cosmology) into silence and allow inspiration direct their scientific pursuits. For the critic regarding homosexual comments by the author...I have no need to support the author's opinion but you might research the latest research in Epigenetics and realize that science is barely scratching the surface of what truly provides for our lives. This is from Jan 2013, \\"The Scientist\\" article titled, Can Epigenetics Explain Homosexuality. ...\\"The model was developed by William Rice, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of California, Santa Barbara; Sergey Gavrilets, a mathematician at the University of Tennessee; and Urban Friberg, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Uppsala. The notion that epigenetics, rather than genetics, is the primary force promoting homosexuality sprang from several observations, explained Rice...\\"If you want a related example of the capacity of a baby to energetically READ everything going on around it and how critical that becomes to its behavior throughout its life...read and view Cesar Millan's work with dogs...unless you think a human baby is somehow less evolved than a dog when it comes to knowing energetically how to fit into its environment. Notice how messed up dogs are when they do not receive what they need and how quickly they respond when they are given that...and Cesar demonstrates over and over it is a matter of presence/energy that the dog senses essentially immediately.

A lot of primitive stories and encounters in the book rather than the parenting sides of thing.Just not my style."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"A slow read that I am still working on, but I like the attachment parenting concepts and plan to finish the book."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"The beginning is a bit boring. Once you get to the meat of the story, it's very wonderful to read."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"Let me get two caveats out of the way (and forgive the narcissism of my mini-bio):1) Most of the reviews I have seen on this book seem to come from parents and are testaments to the validity or lack of validity of the continuum concept. I am not a parent*. I have no immanent plans to experience parenthood (or to not experience parenthood) at this point and I am painfully nearsighted on this issue. So I have no desire to debate whether the Continuum Concept is 1) the right way to raise a child in this culture, 2) if its feasible or 3) what to do about modern dangers that exist outside of the environment that man evolved under, etc. I read the Continuum Concept at the suggestion of a friend who is a psychoanalyst. I read it for the insight it would give me into my own life and childhood. It is the similar soul that this review is directed toward: the reader who simply wants to understand their own past and present in light of the concepts that Liedloff puts forth.2) I try not to write reviews just after finishing a particular book. I find that I am still 'impressionable' and it takes a while for me to let the subjectivity of the author pass out of my system. It takes a while to integrate my identity with any new thoughts or perceptions that arise from reading a new book.With that said, I read The Continuum Concept earlier this year and I am amazed at how much the thoughts and ideas that were bubbling in my mind at the time I read the book are still present in my conscious mind. If you want to read a book that will bring your opinions about your upbringing and the whole western system of values under scrutiny, this is the book for you. It's dangerous literature for anyone who is happy with the status quo, but my assumption is that the reactionary reader will simply dismiss everything in the Continuum Concept as invalid.To accept the validity of The Continuum Concept really changes so much about our perceptions of the modern world. It has been quite some time since the seventies when this book was much more revolutionary, and now there is plenty more research and science to corroborate Liedloff's claims. Perhaps she idealized these people that she lived with in the rain forests of South America. But even if she has waxed a tad bit romantic in her opinions of the Yequana (sic) we can still learn something from her observations. The truth is that far too few of us question the system of baby-care in western culture in its totality. We debate how to discipline a child and the proper age to begin potty training and when to wean the child (after we have solved the debate over whether to breastfeed or not). But there are deeper questions we do not ask...and the obvious question that arises from reading Liedloff's book is \\"are we doing our children a disservice by using any modern child-rearing techniques at all?\\" Other questions soon arise such as \\"Are most of us victims of an incomplete childhood?\\" \\"Is the average member of westernized society simply trying to fill some unnatural emptiness created in its earliest and hardly memoralbe experiences?\\" \\"Is every aspect of our modern culture infected with our skewed beliefs (e.g. happiness is elusive and only to be pursued but never attained)?\\" Is the most exhilarating experience in life \`falling in love' or is this just a brief lapse into the state of being we should be living our entire lives under?\\" These are all very interesting questions and if this is the kind of psychological and philosophical introspection that you like to engage in than this is the book for you (and please send me and e-mail because I am generally better for knowing people like you).The book led me to the final question which I am still trying to answer. \\"Is the combination of our modern upbringing and the modern world we live in so grossly mutated from the environment that mankind evolved in, that there is no way to adapt and find our way back to intuitive living, and the kind of self acceptance (being comfortable in our own skins) that so many of us strive for?\\" I guess this is a question (like all profound questions) that must be answered through experience, but I am thankful for this book for at least coloring some of my experiences with a new hue. My hope now is that I can get my mother and twin brother to read this book as well, and we can all dialogue about what it meant for our pasts and what it means if anything for the present and future.I gave the book a five star rating because it made me think and it stretched my mind to new dimensions, which gets harder to do as I get older and older.Serenity*[side note: I can see how this book could grossly misfire in the hands of parents obsessed with raising perfect children. I think the idea should be to provide the best environment we know how to for the child and let the child become what it will become without any preconceptions about what a perfect child is like. After all, its questionable if the emotionally unhealthy and stunted are even prepared to recognize the signs of emotional health.]"},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"My husband and I read this book 9 years ago, before the birth of our son, and it spoke to our hearts. Employing the simple idea that a baby who starts life in the womb shouldn't be abruptly separated from the mother after birth, we maintained almost constant contact with him for the first few months. I was amazed at some of the resistance, resentment, even hostility, people sometimes demonstrated when informed that we slept with our newborn and never left him to cry. All their protests were based on nothing but groundless fears -- &quot;You'll roll over and smother him! You'll 'spoil' him!&quot; Etc. Well, he became naturally more and more independent and separate at his own pace, not an arbitrarily imposed one (that's the &quot;continuum&quot; part), and weaned himself from the breast at 11 months, rather than at a time decided by the &quot;experts&quot; or demands of employment. He is now 9 years old, and is a wonderful, happy, secure, well-adjusted boy, and I never cease getting compliments from everyone who meets him on how considerate, engaging, empathetic, kind, and well socialized he is. I credit Liedloff's book for all of this. If I could give one message to all would-be parents, I would say: Don't buy into the lie that material things are what's important to provide your child, and if you yourself are so wrapped up in financial gain that you won't temporarily sacrifice it to bond with him the first year of life, you're selling yourselves short. Invest the first 6 months to 1 year of his life raising him in your arms, and you will be giving him, and yourself, more than a billion dollars could ever buy."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"A friend told me that this book picks up where Spiritual Midwifery leaves off. So, I read it while I was pregnant. Where the former book completely changed the way I view childbirth, Continuum Concept radically altered my view of childrearing. I knew I wanted to parent my child in a way that was very different from how I had been raised, but I wasn't sure just what to do. This book taught me to trust my heart and intuition. It taught me to know that if I listen to my son and learn from him as much as I teach him, then he will grow up strong and secure and loving, despite this crazy world. Her observations of the indigenous family structure were profoundly insightful, showing us that, sadly, we have lost a great deal in our material culture. True, there are many books related to parenting out there, but I encourage all parents to read this one. I have given a copy to every pregnant friend for almost 10 years now, and everyone has loved it and passed it on. Few investments are this worthy."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"Somehow I had the impression that Jean Liedloff's diamond-in-the-rough work was a comparison of modern day parenting to that of primitive tribes in general; instead, it is primarily her observations on the Yequana tribe of Venezuela. It's obvious that Ms. Liedloff has a great affection for these peaceful people, but that positive bias is apparent, and eventually weakens her argument. It is also often necessary for the reader to make decisions about whether the author, writing in 1975, should be forgiven for her (currently) strange ideas -- using the universal &quot;he&quot; and &quot;man&quot; can certainly roll off one's back, but proclaiming that male homosexuality is the result of a mother's demanding and overattentive nature and female homosexuality the result of cruel or unloving fathers is not so forgivable. If this theory were true it should have better predictive value, yet who today believes her assertion? In addition, Liedloff avers that children's accidents and burns are not caused by children's physical or cognitive limitations but primarily by subconscious suggestions from the parents, even relating (and she should be ashamed) the story of a toddler who died in a drowning accident that was, according to her, caused not only by the parents' admonitions to stay away from the pool but also by their installation of a security fence around it. Furthermore, roller coaster devotees are actually attempting to capture the experience of adventure denied them as children (I can attest from personal experience that this is not the case), and criminality and addiction are explained by the lack of in-arms time, as are child abuse (discussed solely in terms of women abusing their children), promiscuity, martyrdom, acting, academics and compulsive travelling. Neat trick, if you can make it work. I didn't even know compulsive travelling was a problem. That said, this is the theory as created *and interpreted* by Liedloff, and her misapplication of the continuum concept does not invalidate the theory, any more than Sigmund Freud's personal problems invalidated his few brilliant insights into the human psyche.The author's positive bias also shows up in her willingness to view every act by the Yequana as positive, including parties and work sessions at which all tribe members, including children, drink to drunkenness. She lauds the Yequana's lack of parental guidance, saying that praise and scolding are equally corrosive to the child's ability to function later in life. I disagree with that assertion. I believe feedback is important, and I believe in praise and encouragement.The author shrugs off anomalies such as the Yequanas, despite their having achieved perfect serenity, nonetheless having a mythology of a fall from grace and a yearning to achieve a better state. She also ignores contradictions, stating that modern humans search for physical contact because we were denied it in early life, but the Yequana enjoy physical contact because .... this is not explained. These particular passages convince me that the Yequana probably have a more realistic self-regard than does Ms. Liedloff. Reading this, in it's unfinished, untested, doctoral-thesis-that-never-got-turned-in state, you can see why scientific methods, for all their limitations, are valuable.Having criticized, I will say that when the author gets it right, she gets it profoundly right. Simple statements she makes are well stated and ring true: The intellect is not always our only, or our best, guide. There is an evolutionary dance, informed by experience, between expectation and design. A spirit of competition is not always appropriate. We need to make the assumption of innate sociality. Happiness should be a normal condition rather than a goal. Parents do not own children. Children, though less physically powerful, are no less human and have no fewer rights than adults; consequently, children should be treated with respect and dignity.While the Liedloff version of the continuum concept had little predictive value in the area of social science, she shows some timely insight into what was then becoming cognitive science, and offers some fertile material for artificial systems modellers.As a parent, an education librarian and a substitute teacher, I thoroughly enjoyed the author's introduction of the ironically radical underpinnings of attachment parenting concepts as well as her suggestions for social change. As a cognitive science researcher and an optimistic populist, I was nonplussed by the lack of any bibliography or research -- just opinion and anecdote. There are some tremendously valuable insights here, but the author has slathered it with her own problematic conclusions. For pity's sake, ignore her advice about child safety, which is not appropriate for 21st century parents. My advice is to read this book with an open heart and a sharp mind, and to cull the wheat from the chaff."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"My son was born with what pediatrician William Sears calls a \\"high needs\\" personality. From birth, if I set him down for a second, he would cry and protest loudly. He could only tolerate his stroller for 15 minutes and he turned shades of red and purple while riding in the car seat. He needed to touch my body or be held in-arms to sleep soundly. I carried him in my tired, aching arms the first 4 months and refused to put him down, because it never felt right to me to let him fuss, become agitated and cry. Finally, a mother at a local La Leche League meeting showed me how to use my baby sling (OTSBH, then Maya Wrap) when he was 4.5 months old.I read this book when my son was about 5 months old. While I never consciously worried about my son's fussy disposition, I was relieved to finally recognize that my baby was perfectly normal. I thought that \\"normal\\" was a baby lying in a crib most of the day staring at a mobile, or one that was carried around in a baby seat or \\"Moses basket\\" as I attended to other things. Read OUR BABIES, OURSELVES by MEREDITH SMALL to learn about how culture influences baby care and how human biology is at odds with Western expectations for baby care. My son was just expressing a very strong craving for vestibular movement and appropriate sensory stimulation. Being wheeled in strollers and carried in cars seats for the majority of the day in infancy (a trap I would have fallen into if my baby wasn't so fussy) is NOT good for human development. (Check out the Amazon reviews for SENSORY SECRETS by Catherine Chemin Schneider.) \\"High need\\" babies are simply born experts at getting their developmental and emotional needs met.This book convinced me on the spot to stop trying to use the stroller completely. That in itself was freeing to me as I had no idea how much my expectation to use the darned thing was making me tense and frustrated. Once I let that go, and thanks to the baby sling, things became much easier. Basically, Liedloff argues that time spent \\"in-arms\\" in infancy is what helps make happy, well-adjusted, non-neurotic adults. A baby should be carried until he expresses a desire to go down.She argues that the reason so many adults are unhappy is because they are endlessly searching for something outside themselves. People use excitement (i.e., bunging jumping, dangerous sports, dangerous treks, endless traveling, etc...) to fill a void, none of which are good enough and they keep trying to top their last exhilarating experience. Or they turn to shopping, or drinking, or drug use (anything in excess) for that something they missed in infancy... feeing whole and connected to something: ANOTHER PERSON. A mother, father, a caregiver... somebody who carried them around where they felt peaceful for the majority of the time. By being carried the baby experiences inner peace and there is no continuous anxiety, where the baby is begging or signaling with smiles and seemingly happy gestures to be held.Essentially, Liedloff showed me that instead of the mother centering her life around the baby, the baby should be in the center of the mother's life/activity. So I went about my daily activities (which included social outtings with new mothers) where he was a happy and peaceful observer in the sling. He was always in the middle of my activity, taking in the sights, smells, real world sounds, feeling swaying gentle movement and generally at peace. My \\"high touch\\" in-arms parenting helped my son to feel loved, secure and calm and he settled down considerably. He never cried or fussed in restaurants. Car rides even became easier. Thanks to the baby sling, I never felt like a shut-in with a miserable baby. He learned that happiness (not want) was the normal state of being. My first year was so easy just because I carried him in the sling all the time. Yes, at times it felt exhausting, but I mostly I found it exhilarating to carry and hold my precious baby. It never felt like a burden to me because I knew I was doing right by him, largely thanks to Liedloff's book. In fact, my son's first year was one of the happiest times of my life, thanks to the wonderful bonding and sense of peace that resulted from \\"babywearing.\\" I never had to deal with frustration, disappointment, feelings of resentment or guilt for having to choose between meeting my babies needs and my own. We were a traveling and peaceful unit.In addition, I highly recommend THE VITAL TOUCH by SHARON HELLER and MAGICAL CHILD by CHILTON PEARCE. Heller presents an abundance of scientific research that explains the biology and importance of touch and the great influence it has on the babies growing brain, body and nervous system. I recommend Heller's book (which essentially validates Liedloff's theories) to any skeptic. Pearce's book expands further on Liedloff's concepts and is a wonderful companion."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I came to this book while pregnant with my first child. I enjoyed it very much and took it to heart. However, as the realities of our new baby set it, many of Liedloff's generalizations about the right way to raise a baby came back to bother me. This book tries to import a very cultural specific way of raising a baby to our modernized society. And while I have no objection to this in the purely theoretical, it is important for readers to keep this in mind. What works for people who live in the forest, within a tribal support system, without walls of privacy or electricity, may not translate as well to a mother and baby, alone in their house full of lights and machines. In my own life, I found many of the things I enjoy, like reading and sewing were not mobile enough for my daughter. She craved movement. Of course when I was up and doing things around the house, I would carry her in my sling, but I just didn't DO enough. For the mother who is constantly moving and strong enough, exclusively carrying the baby for the first 6-8 months may be feasible. But I am not this mother. Another important consideration is sleeping. When darkness falls in the deep forest people go to sleep. In our culture this is not the case. We utilize electricity to keep the day going long after the sun has set. And while my daugher would sleep on and off in the sling, she soon became aware that we were not sleeping and the light was on. She began to sleep less and less in the sling and even less in the night with us. I don't think tribal parents have to deal at all with sleeping issues, not because they are super-parents but because the low-tech environment they inhabit mandates sleeping patterns for everyone. Overall, I began to resent the feeling that I was doing my daughter a disservice by not being \\"primal\\" enough. In the end I think if you carry your baby as much as you can, feed her breast milk and give her all the love you have, then you are doing your best. I think this book may leave mother's feeling like they can't measure up to the perfect tribal mothers. It is important to realize that their world and our world are VERY different and because of this we may have to amend some of Liedloff's suggestions."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"The back cover of The Continuum Concept by Jane Liedloff categorizes this book as \\"Parenting/Anthropology\\". An interesting combination, in my opinion, but hopefully one that won't turn away too may readers. Most people looking for parenting books don't have much time for anthropology, and there isn't a great demand for anthropology books on their own--it's a suprise this book ever gets read. But Liedloff doesn't seem too interested in parenting fads or commercial success, and we are all better off for it. This book presents one simple concept, carefully wrapped in the diaper of a discussion of hunter-gatherer child rearing, that just might live up to the quote on the front cover: \\"...it could save the world.\\"On the surface Liedloff presents an examination of the differences between child rearing behavior of remote indian tribes of the Amzaon rainforest with modern America. A fascinating if sometimes long-winded account, she explains the \\"in-arms phase\\"--how the Yanoami and other hunter-gatherer tribes maintain constant physical contact with their newborns until they voluntarily crawl away, and the resultant lack of both psychological neruosis in their populations and post-partum depression in mothers. To say that such isn't exactly the case in America would make the Brittish look like a culture with a chronic tendancy to exaggerate.The core concept referenced earlier lies in the reason Liedloff gives for this difference: Over millions of years, humans (and precursor species) evolved to function properly within specific physical, psychological and social parameters. The needs of human genetic ontogeny are sometimes (often?) at odds with the needs of the civilizational machine (where humanity doesn't evolve) that replaced the hunter-gatherer tribe (where they do). Many cultural and personal problems result from the acendancy of the civilizational need over the genetic need--and their solutions may lie in discovering where these needs are in conflict.The applications of this theory are widespread. Liedloff leads the charge with psychological problems stemming from child rearing practices not in concert with \\"the continuum\\" of human evolution. Consider, for a moment, how many other things are required of us from \\"civilization\\" that we are uniquely maladapted to through evolution: separation of labor into simplistic and repetetive tasks, processed diets high in simple carbohydrates and low in fiber and fresh vegetables, lack of exposure to the unique light spectra of the sun, moon and fire, forced interaction with group sizes far larger than a \\"tribe\\", sleep schedules and activity cycles not in tune with nature, the extension of \\"childhood\\" years past the clear evolutionary onset of adulthood, a dominion over rather than communion with nature, the list goes on and on.Liedloff makes a convincing case that any parent raising their child outside the \\"continuum\\" is doing the child and society a great disservice...I'm happy to say that I know of at least one couple whom this book has influenced to choose to reject society's standards and raise their child \\"in the continuum\\". While the books drags at times, and fails to make the theoretical connection between the continuum in child-rearing and in all aspects of life, it is a definite must-read AND must-do. Hopefully the intrepid reader will realize that its true value lies in providing a new framework for looking at life--if we examine our wants and desires within the context that they orriginated to serve either evolution or society, but not us, we can for the first time truly choose for ourselves."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"This is a fascinating book, and asks some compelling questions about what is 'normal' and 'desirable' in parenting. Much of it is good, common sense dialogue on what is biologically appropriate for children.On the other hand, it has to be taken with salt. 1) Leidoff is/was not a trained anthropologist, and it would be far too easy for an outsider to make critical mistakes interpreting a vastly different culture. 2) Liedoff did not/does not have any children, which would likely change her perspective. 3) There is a strong emphasis on trusting your instincts (good), but not if it disagrees with the way Yequana do things (bad). 4) Her attitude that children and babies should be trusted to look out for their own physical well being (i.e., they don't need gates or to be watched closely near water, etc) incorrectly assumes that all babies are born with the same high level of self-preservation. While babies who had a lesser sense of safety and danger may have been 'naturally selected out' in tribal cultures, I don't think most people would (or should) willingly embrace 'survival of the fittest' among their own offspring.There's more, but in short, I think that while Leidoff was/is really onto something, she's too enthusiastic to be thoroughly objective. Be careful of taking too much at face value."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"With this book, Liedloff offers many penetrating insights into child development. It is a profound work that should be read by everyone living inside Western Civilization. However the book does not not come without a few problems. For starters, Liedloff fails to make clear the debt she owes to the Yequana Indians from whom she gleaned the \\"continuum concept.\\" To recognize this debt, the book might better have been titled \\"The Yequana Concept.\\"Similarly, the original intent and purpose of Liedloff's foray into the South American rainforest is horribly suspect. She went there to discover and plunder diamonds. This is not to discount the knowledge and wisdom she gleaned from the Yequana, but it does display Liedlof's ignorance concerning native land and resource rights, not to mention what possible affect diamond poachers like herself might have on local cultures. These issues never seemed to have entered her mind.Finally, the actual content of the book itself is often repetitive and over-simplified. Having recognized that, unlike Westerners, Yequana are a happy, well-rounded, neurosis-free people, Liedloff asks why. Her answer, that all Yequana babies experience 24-hour in-arm care from their mothers, is insightful, but partial and lacking. Clearly, Westerns have a lot to learn from the Yequana about childcare, but I believe it takes a lot more than in-arms care to produce a happy, healthy society. The success of the Yequana does not hinge on one variable. To understand their success, we must look at the total culture and its environment.Unlike Westerners, the Yequana still live within the bounds of and draw support from Mother Nature, via the surrounding rainforest. Westerners, on the other hand, grow up in concrete jungles, divorced from the living, biological world. Nor do Yequana have to endure the relentless nine-to-five, junk food, population pressure, or any of the other ills of modern civilization. Moreover, although Liedloff never mentions this, the Yequana are by no means unique. All indigenous cultures are sustainable and remarkably free of neurosis.Before coming into contact with West, every indigenous tribe enjoyed high standards of health, wealth, happiness and security - standards which we so-called \\"civilized\\" people continually strive for but fail to achieve. If you are interested in learning more about non-Western cultures and their success, there are a number of authors I can recommend, such as John H. Bodley (Victims of Progress, Cultural Anthropology, Power of Scale, etc), Chellis Glendinng (My Name is Chellis), Daniel Quinn (Ishmael, the Story of B), and Robert Wolff (Original Wisdom). All of these authors and their works come highly recommended.A great book, but don't stop here."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I read this book while I was pregnant and it totally changed the way I thought about parenting. I am so happy to be the parent I am, and this book has a lot to do with it. My baby is now 9 months old and is very calm, happy, and just such a joy. The bond we have is incredible and we have no struggles around eating, sleeping, separation or anything else! I know what he needs and am happy to meet those needs. Parenting is such a joy when you understand your child so well."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"Did you know that Dr. Sears' first book was essentially an instruction manual on applying the Continuum Concept ideas to modern parenting practices? Although it fell short in achieving its own goal, it nevertheless became the seed of his Attachment Parenting movement. Well, if you have found AP practices to be helpful or even just interesting, why not go back to the true original? There are biologically-correct ways to apply AP philosophy, and then there is \\"helicopter\\" and \\"martyr\\" parenting that can disrupt the continuum just as mistreatment and neglect can.Babies and children's primary role is to learn how to be adults. It is very important for them to observe adults carrying on in the normal course of their day. They must be integrated into the family and community, not the other way around. Near-constant babywearing and holding during the \`in-arms phase' provides the appropriate foundation for learning how to be an adult, but only in combination with the activity and community that supports it.Have you ever noticed how calm babies are when being worn? Liedloff explains that their energy is \\"discharged\\" by the energy field of the person wearing them, so they can go into observation mode, which is their biological expectation of the role they should be playing at that stage. When not in arms, they have to discharge their energy through activity and jerky movements. Plus, they are constantly trying to signal that something is amiss. And in reaction to the signaling, we tend to talk to them and make them the center of attention, leading to more signaling that something is not right.This is just one example of the amazing insight Liedloff provides into the world of babies raised in a biologically- and evolutionarily- appropriate environment, the Yequana tribe of South America.

Even if you never have children, this book will amaze you, as it can give you a startling-yet-inspiring new way of looking at yourself and at the problems of civilized society."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I am a big believer in attachment parenting concepts. I came to this book expecting to be further enlightened or inspired.Unfortunately, I came away frustrated and frankly disgusted. Liedloff is neither a mother nor an anthropologist, and her observations and conclusions about a tribal group are based on her uncontextualized understanding of what she saw happening around her. I think it's likely she missed seeing everything around her due to her lack of experience or observational training.For example, she claims that \\"continuum concept\\" parents are hands-off. Well, I can tell you that many non-parent friends will watch me interact with my baby son for hours and come away thinking that my son is so calm, happy, and easy -- they've told me this. What they apparently haven't noticed is that I am constantly tending to him in very quiet, unobtrusive ways: slightly bouncing him on my knee, nursing him when he's hungry, shifting his position, putting him down when he wants it, picking him up when he wants it. It is a very intuitive, non-verbal form of communication and likely to be missed by the uninitiated.But, even worse to me was the idealizing of a native people whom Liedloff was simultaneously exploiting. Really, the ethics at work here are highly questionable. And, I have an innate mistrust of anyone who glorifies indigenous cultures. People are people. Certainly some societies have better tools for parenting and creating peaceful communities -- I believe she did see some amazing examples of parenting. But does that mean that these people represent some sort of unbroken, untainted line of perfect parenting knowledge? Hardly.Finally, the book is just plain unpleasant to read. There's no clear organizational structure or overall goal. It reads like several random brain dumps all stuck together in one book.I gave it two stars simply because it was interesting at times and I managed to persevere to the end (fortunately it is not overly long), but I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"Jean Liedloff has done lots of thinking and experiencing that everyone should read about.

I think she ignored a major factor in her \\"studies\\" - being outdoors in nature. Have you ever noticed how calm your kids are when they are outside in the peace and quiet of nature? While attachment parenting/baby wearing did make my children happy, nature did even more for my kids. Anytime they got cranky (while following all of her principles), all we had to do was take them outside and the world became right again. I highly doubt that these Native Americans she stayed with, stayed in their homes all day long. From the way she describes it, they were outdoors all day long.

I've passed-out dozens of copies to friends and random 'expecting' couples, as a 'service to a needy world' if you will. Feedback has been very positive with some exceptions. Not surprisingly, these less positive responses came from very 'modern' individuals, such as women who were convinced that single parenthood IS the way of the nineties and beyond.Similarly, I'm not surprised at the rather angry tone of those reviewers, who refer to the latter part of the book re: their mention of Liedloff's &quot;homophobia&quot;. Not surprisingly, in current times gay parenthood is more and more accepted, just like single parenthood. But that still does not change a jot on how the 'continuum' expects a child to be raised - ideally 'in arms'and by two parents. We tend to accept as normal that, which we have no inclination to change. The horrendous consumption of the planet's resources for mere wants as opposed to needs, is one example. We have 'created' a society based on excuses, losing more and more touch with reality, justified by handing out degrees in fields, which hardly provide any purpose at all.One who addresses this entire topic in a more scientific, complementary and eloquent way, is author Joseph Chilton Pearce in his books. His &quot;Magical Child&quot; makes a wonderful companion to Liedloff's work and can be read to back-up a lot of what you'll find here, perhaps convincing even those, who had harsh comments elsewhere."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"My opinion: This book is one of the most importants to be read not only by (future) parents!

(Continuum Concept parenting and Attachment Parenting are not the same thing, but there is some overlap.) Though the book does contain many intriguing ideas, I found myself overall quite disappointed.The book, written in 1975 (with an introduction added in 1985), is based on the author's experiences spending extended time with an indigenous people in Venezuela, the Yequana. Based on her observations, she concludes that their way of life is more in harmony with the natural way that humans are meant to live, in accordance with the evolution of our species, than the lifestyle of modern Western society. She claims that the natural state of the Yequana is happiness, a primary example being that they do not have a word for \\"work\\" and they enjoy everything they do. The cause? She places huge emphasis on the importance of infants being held in their mothers' arms, 100% of the time, during the first 6-8 months of life, and attributes most of the unhappiness of modern civilization to the fact that infants in Western society are largely deprived of this \\"in arms\\" experience. She devotes a significant portion of the book to describing the subjective experience that she imagines an infant in each respective culture goes through, and the remainder of the book critiquing specific aspects of modern child-rearing and explaining how specific personality characteristics and modern problems are specifically the result of being deprived of the \\"in arms\\" stage.The fatal flaw of this book is that the ideas presented are purely the theories and opinions of the author. The author has absolutely no qualifications other than her personal experience with this particular group of people: she is not an anthropologist, sociologist, psychologist, scientist, researcher, doctor, or any other relevant qualification. Throughout the entire book there was only one citation. In fact she is overtly anti-intellectual, stating that our overuse of intellect in the modern world has, to our detriment, taken over our natural instincts as humans. There may be some truth to this, but I found it ironic that someone writing a book primarily about the importance of following one's instinct in the care of infants is not even a mother herself. There were certainly several parts of her book that my \\"motherly instinct\\" just flat out rejected. Some of the claims of the author have since been shown to be true by research, however others contradict the findings of research. Her own cultural bias is apparent in her assumption that homosexuality is a pathology and the assumption of the existence of \\"God\\". However the opinions of the author in this book are presented as if they are objective fact. It would have been more accurate if every sentence in the book was preceded with \\"I think,\\" \\"I believe,\\" or \\"My theory is.\\"For instance, the lengthy descriptions of an infant's experience in the indigenous and then the modern world are presented as factual descriptions, when in fact they are her interpretations of her observations, colored by her opinions. In short, they stem from her imagination. Maybe there is truth to them, but maybe not; there is no way of knowing. I wonder if Yequana mothers, let alone infants of either culture, would agree with these descriptions. While interesting to think about as a hypothesis or possibility, they don't have much value beyond the speculative.Another big problem with this book is that all of the author's assumptions about human nature and what is natural to our species come from her (unscientific) experience and observation of just one indigenous culture. Anthropologists have shown us that there is actually quite significant diversity among indigenous cultures, and Liedloff herself comments how different the neighboring indigenous cultures were from the Yequana. All cultures are unique, and adapted to their particular circumstances. She clearly idealizes all the features of the Yequana culture and assumes that modern culture would be better off by adopting them, but this is not necessarily the case. For example, she critiques parents for \\"chasing\\" their toddlers to keep them from harm or from wandering off, and the example she gives is of seeing modern parents do this in New York's Central Park! Maybe if I lived in an indigenous village surrounded by familiar places and trusted community members I could allow a toddler to wander as they pleased, but in a dangerous urban environment like NEW YORK CITY, I would definitely be keeping a protective watch on my child. The comparison of such different settings just doesn't make sense.A specific critique I have of the parenting style that the author advocates is her critique of modern Western parents being too \\"child-centered.\\" While I agree with the importance of a child being immersed in the normal life of adults and society, I don't think this should be done at the exclusion of direct interaction and attention, which in my experience babies both need and thrive on. In addition to some \\"out of arms\\" time being important to physical development (such as learning to crawl and sit, which start gradually from a very young age), I think that direct interaction and attention are a quite natural way of welcoming a child into the family and community, and communicating to them their inherent worth as a person. The way Liedloff describes it, she seems to advocate just completely ignoring young babies as one goes about their daily life. Not only do I think this is not healthy for the baby or the parent-child bond, but anyone who has ever had a baby can tell you it's not realistic. Babies have constant needs and are completely dependent on their caregivers to fulfill them- eating, sleeping, comforting, and toileting, are all things babies cannot do themselves, let alone laundry, bathing, and other tasks that are inherent to baby care. But the biggest disagreement I have with the author's criticism to being \\"child-centered\\" is that it directly contradicts one of the most central aspects of Attachment Parenting, being responsive to your child. Research has demonstrated the importance of caretakers being attentive to an infant's cues and responding in a caring, consistent way in order to establish a secure attachment. It is one of the central tenants of Attachment Parenting and its importance has been demonstrated in psychological research.That said, I did find many of the author's ideas quite intriguing. For example, I agree with the author about the importance of keeping young babies close to their mothers' bodies at nearly all times. Indeed, the importance of this has been demonstrated by studies done on touch, attachment, co-sleeping, and so forth. However, I think she isolates this particular issue excessively, rather than acknowledging it as one ingredient in an overall approach to parenting. Other important factors include growing up in an environment of unconditional love, acceptance, and belonging, caretakers who respond in a consistent and caring way, positive examples and relationships with family and community, breastfeeding, and a positive birth experience, to name a few. Just carrying your baby all the time is not enough; all aspects of parenting have an impact on babies and the adults that they grow into. I thought her interpretation of personality quirks to be very interesting, for example a person being very messy because they are seeking the fulfilment of deprived infantile needs (though someone taking care of them and loving them unconditionally despite their flaws). My subjective opinion (note my qualification!) is that this might very well be the case for some people, however it must be considered in light of the whole person, which is complex and individual.Another idea I liked about the book was the concept that children, like all humans, are social animals and they do what they think is expected of them. They instinctively want to fit in and please their parents. She gives an example that sometimes parents give them messages like \\"Don't touch that, you'll hurt yourself\\" and the message the children hear is that the parent expects them to hurt themselves at some point, and so they do. I do think that expectations are powerful and the language we use is important. But again, this is one factor in a complex system of influences, and needs to be considered in context.It appears even the things I like about the book have serious qualifications. So if there is so much to criticize about this book, why does it have such a strong following? What made it so popular?I think the reason is that it makes the reader question the status quo of the way we treat babies in our society in a powerful way. This was probably groundbreaking in the time it was written, and is still groundbreaking today for people who haven't been exposed to ideas outside of the mainstream. Just the idea of putting oneself in the \\"shoes\\" of a baby and imagining what they might go through is important. Asking the question of how humans evolved and how this impacts the needs of babies is important. Questioning our cultural practices and considering more traditional practices, like slings instead of strollers, or co-sleeping instead of cribs, is important. So in summary I think this is a great book to open minds and get people thinking, but because it is so grotesquely subjective and unscientific, it should not be looked to in itself as a source of information or a guide to parenting practices. Fortunately there are many other books available now which cover these topics and make use of more objective research methods through fields like anthropology, psychology, evolutionary biology, and neurobiology. For instance, I recommend Our Babies, Ourselves, which is a more scientific version of the topics broached in The Continuum Concept."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"The Continuum Concept helped me reframe my naturally harried perspective. The author visits more grounded cultures and explores how we as humans evolutionarily expect to be treated once we enter this world. I highly reccomend this to anyone who has an open mind and wants to be respectful of thier children."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I read this book 20 years ago when I was pregnant with my first son. The book felt \\"right\\" at an intuitive level -- perhaps because my mother, who was born in China, raised me using continuum methods. My family moved to the US when I was 5, and I assimilated quite thoroughly in American culture. But 30 years later, when I read \\"The Continuum Concept\\", it was easier for me to shrug off western norms of child rearing than my husband, who had initial concerns about a family bed. I have to admit that carrying a baby around all day took a lot of effort. We tried several baby carriers before finding one that worked. And we took consecutive leaves of absence from work because we had no family nearby to help. Now, 20 years later, our oldest son is in college. I'm starting to read articles, like the one in Time magazine, that question the value of \\"attachment parenting\\" (aka continuum methods) and I feel compelled to come to its defense. With the benefit of experience, I see that attachment parenting does instill a great deal of security and empathy in children. Our oldest son was a high need baby who cried constantly, and a demanding toddler. Relatives and friends often expressed surprise at what a fine young man he's become -- confident, calm and considerate of others. It pains me to read about kids who were raised in orphanages and suffer from attachment disorder as adults. Some critics say that attachment parenting demands too much from mothers, and this is a fair criticism that points more to the lack of society's support for mothers. The fact is that raising mentally and physically healthy children requires effort and sacrifice -- especially in the first few years, but then it gets much easier. As parents, and as a society, we have a choice of either paying a modest price early, or paying later in spades. The rewards of attachment parenting are immense, for families and society. I now give \\"The Continuum Concept\\" to new parents. It's not a perfect book, but it's an inspiring book that connects us with the parenting wisdom of our human ancestors."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I'm sad that this book isn't more popular. It surprised me greatly to learn it was written in the 70s, and I wish this was something all new parents read (I certainly wish this was the book my mom picked up instead of Dr. Spock's, and I wish I'd found it before my first baby instead of my second). It should be handed out at baby showers right along side of the What to Expect series... Although most of this book is theory, her theory strikes a cord that resonates in all of us. Listen to your baby! More than that - listen to your heart, to your own insticts! If only more of us were simply told that to begin with, there might be a little less emotional pain / antisocial behavior in the western world. Although not everything the author says makes sense in the civilized world, the concepts are brilliant (yet basic!) and if we all applied as much as we could, I have no doubt the civilized world would be an even better place to live."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"TCC is one of a trilogy of books I recommend as required reading for anyone wishing to understand how our culture came to be so confused and destructive.

Don't think, though, that Liedloff is homophobic or hates gays or anything..."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"If a book could be a mother, then this would be mine: you know, the place that feeds you in a seemingly hostile universe, enabling you in turn to be a source of sustenance --and yet--and yet, all the while you keep a mental list of her every shortcoming, memorize her flaws. This book was hugely important to me following the birth of my first child almost 4 years ago--one of those \\"Velcro\\" infants with a particularly sharp continuum instinct who screamed if I put her down for a second--and what surprises me re-reading it now, on the birth of my second, is both how thoroughly I absorbed its content and how antithetical my parenting experiences have been, i.e., those in-arms, continually-carried infants remained FUSSY.I don't for a moment dispute Liedloff's concept of continuum, the evolved expectation of every infant, for example, to an in-arms phase of social interaction, co-sleeping, breastfeeding on demand, the associated sense of \\"rightness\\" when the continuum is respected, the difference between evolution and change; what I question, especially in light of my experiences parenting two very different gifted, highly-sensitive, introverted infants, is how to translate Stone Age parenting practices to the present; in particular, I disagree with the rather trendy interpretation that being \\"child-centric\\" is wrong, because in socially-isolated suburban American culture, I don't see a better alternative for meeting the psychological needs of one's child. My child has no \\"tribe\\" to observe, so if I choose to mop the floor, she is left with what--to observe?Can this margin even be bridged? Rather ironically, since he has no stated interest in parenting, I think Ken Wilber's all-levels-all-quadrants theory is helpful here. Wilber describes a huge evolution in human consciousness during the past ten thousand years in his stages of human development, and his survival clans and tribes with their archaic and magic premodern worldviews seem correspondent with Liedloff's happy, non-neurotic Yequana. When Liedloff describes Yequana waking in the middle of the night to share jokes, everyone laughing then resuming sleep, I'm chilled (as someone whose unusual sense of humor is not often appreciated) by this example of collective consciousness. I'm paradoxically in the position of someone trying to find her way back to the continuum yet aware that I'd have been the first one moving my sleeping mat out of the hut, so to speak.As someone of idealistic temperament, I worry sometimes that a book like Liedloff's is mind candy to me, and so I'm working hard to treat it critically. I look to Vico on the evolution of consciousness and the danger of idealizing Stone Age Indians or \\"gentes\\" and on the evolution of the social self, to Harold Bloom on Shakespeare's changing, self-overhearing \\"I\\" and the evolution of human nature as we know it. I try to remind myself whenever I hear educators quoting too much Piaget that Rousseau cruelly abandoned his half dozen illegitimate children to the orphanage. At one point Liedloff makes, to my mind, a critical error in equating bliss with the animal state of consciousness, and my reaction is to celebrate neurotics with Proust if this is the only alternative. Good old Wilber comes through in a pinch with his application of holons, and my conclusion is that the modern mother should keep the nurturing, in-arms childrearing practices AND suffer through the discomfort of culturally-unsupported, child-centric parenting where no other choice exists; if that means living drained of chi or core energy, feeling sometimes like the knight's torso in a Monty Python skit, in order to meet the insatiable need of one's toddler for imaginative games and meaningful discussion, so be it.Despite my caveats, I'm left with an uncanny sense of this book's primal truth. (A nice parallel book would be Price's \\"Nutrition and Physical Degeneration,\\" also written by an amateur anthropologist, which has spawned equivalent thinking of the nasty?--brutish? short?--variety.) Harold Bloom, his Gnosticism showing, writes that Shakespeare contains us all--and if a book could be a father, then his \\"Shakespeare\\" would be mine--but I'm not so sure. He writes the following: \\"\`Nothing begets nothing' could be the pragmatic motto of fatherhood in Lear's play. Only Cordelia could refute that despair...\\" In Liedloff's book, I sense the antidote to such despair."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"The ideas are very challenging, but the book is very hard to be red for non-english reader!

Is she an anthropologist? A mother? I think she is neither. I'll concede with her that nurseries are not ideal places to leave babies - I kept my own with me contantly during my hospital stay. But realistically, how many mothers in the West have the luxury (or the strength) to carry their babies constantly? She's advocating a culture of total motherhood and inducing guilt in the stressed and overworked mother for not being 110% responsive to her child. What she sets out to condemn is really the nuclear set up of modern society, and if she made this more explicit it would have been kinder on poor mothers reading the book! Venezualan Yequana's could carry their young precisely because they had the support structures we lack - on hand community support, a village existence, not an industrialised, isolating, urban existence!I'm tired of books that suggest we can easily transplant the styles of parenting prevailing in non-Western cultures easily into our own. How romantic! I had an extremely demanding baby, colic reflux, you name it. I carried him as much as I could in the sling, but there were times when I simply had to leave him to cry just so I could eat and meet my own BASIC physiological needs. I don't like being told that by doing so I 'tortured' my baby (as she claims) and that in years to come he will be neurotic! What an unsubstatiated, biased and unscientific claim! I noted she barely referred to any academic journals or anthropological/peadiatric works. If she did a study with controls over time to assess the advent of neurosis relative to parenting styles I'd be impressed. Instead she makes wildly polemical claims that reflect her own archaic mentality."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I had heard so much about this book, I was very eager to read it. I was finally able to get a used copy and dove into it. I made it to the middle of the second chapter when I decided to stop reading. The way the author writes is very complicated. Her sentences are very long and she uses words almost just because they sound good and definitely not to convey a clear concise message. English is not my first language so I started to wonder if it was just me and I had my husband (a published writer himself and American born) read a few excerpts and he completely confirmed that the style was pompous. I agree with the general philosophy of carrying your child as much as possible but I think the book is poorly written. I must also agree with the other reviewers who are questioning the validity of her conclusions. Definitely not very scientific. She just throws assumptions as to what a newborn feels and thinks. I am not impressed.I think Dr Sears books are definitely a better investment, with very clear, concise, practical advice about attachment parenting."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"This book has some very nice ideas and supports a truly loving nurturing environment. I'm sure there are some parents who treat their children as the author describes as common in our society, but I have not witnessed it. Perhaps these attitudes were more prevalent when this book was written. I was born in 1965 and I was held almost all the time as a baby. While I appreciated the hold your baby message as well as other, I truly did not like all the conclusions that were drawn from the author's observations. In most cases she offered no supporting evidence other than her observations and I found myself thinking of numerous other causes/effects for the behaviors she described. I found her unscientific conclusions to be irresponsible and just plain silly at times.

This \\"Miss Know-It-All\\" which her only credentials by her own admission are being tapped to be a Dior and Vogue model and being a university dropout also has a very very strong and illogical bias against Western society and civilization in general which causes her to idealize and romanticize the lifestyle of the few Indian tribes that she happened to come in contact with during her trips in the Jungles of Venezuela. Her starting premise is that we in the civilized world have lost our way and because we have interrupted our evolutionary path by our practices and presuppositions we are sure to be doomed. Unless we learn from the simple and \\"intuitive\\" methods of primitive tribes people and \\"unlearn\\" our presuppositions and abandon our misguided ways!!Now why these primitive tribes people's lifestyle or philosophy of life is any superior to ours, why we should emulate them, and whether we even can manage to import their methods to our very different society and lifestyle are things that are not even discussed. They are fore granted because the writer is so unabashedly biased. I for one want to know how on earth a person who hardly knows the language of these tribespeople and isn't even trained in anthropology, psychology, or sociology and has had all but a cursory shallow contact with these tribes as an impressionable visitor can with such conviction decide that they are so much better off and happier and psychologically better adjusted than us in the \\"Civilized\\" cultures so that we have to emulate their philosophy of life and child rearing methods and abandon our own!! Just because these tribes people were jolly-sounding fellows who enjoyed cracking a joke from time to time while working by no means proves that their life philosophy and child rearing methods are superior to ours.Hasn't it occurred to the author that maybe the fact that her fellow Italian travelers were not as jolly and good humored in the middle of the jungle as their Indian fellows was not because of their inferior life philosophy and corrupted Western upbringing, but simply because they were in harsh conditions which they were not accustomed to in a faraway land in potentially dangerous unfamiliar surroundings while the Indian tribesmen were used to the harsh conditions and physical work and were in their homeland and native environment so they felt more relaxed? The way she extrapolates from her cursory and frankly trivial and insignificant observations to her grandiose philosophical theories and pretentious psychological conclusions is simply amateurish, childish and outlandish and follows no logical path at all!I for one am very proud of our achievements in the \\"Civilized\\" society and even though it is really non-PC to say that out loud these days I see no reason why we should be so self-loathing. No offense to those nice and peaceful Indian tribespeople, but we are not so bad ourselves either! And I for one would never want to live in their conditions for any extended period of time. Even our enthusiastic, idealistic, naive author admitted that after half a year of living in the jungle she was ravaged by Malaria, lost enormous amount of wait and was ready to give away her diamonds for a glass of orange juice!! Also she mentioned in her beginning chapter that one of the tribes that she had visited during one of her earlier visits was on the brink of extinction due to outbreak of disease once she visited them again a few years later! Which one of us really honestly wants to live like that?!! And doesn't it occur to her that maybe our competitive, goal oriented culture which values independence, rules, laws, efficiency, science, logic and intellect over pure instinct has brought us such a level of comfort and safety that we actually grow to old age gracefully and see our children and grandchildren grow and enjoy our parents for many years till they and we are both really old and we don't have to live in constant fear of disease outbreaks and wild animals attacking and lighting striking!?? What is so bad about that? We must have done at least something right after all to have been able to achieve all this! So her starting premise that we in the Western civilization have gone terribly wrong is unsubstantiated and just a matter of her own personal opinion and preference which I for the above mentioned reasons disagree with strongly. She is entitled to her opinion but I am also entitled to mine and don't have to accept her premises right off the bat! She has to prove them to me which she fails to!As far as her opinions on child raising go, I must say they are exactly just that! Her \\"opinions\\" and her explanation about how she arrived at them were also unscientific, anecdotal, and frankly sometimes very bizarre. The way she demonizes some very benign and neutral Western child rearing practices as inhumane and damaging is nothing but hysteria and storm in a tea cup and pure sensationalism! For example giving your child a teddy bear to sleep with or rocking his pram to put him to sleep instead of always holding him in your arms is considered to be causing the child a cruel depravation of physical contact with his mother which will cause him to compensate for it later by becoming neurotic or psychologically damaged! This is scientifically unfounded and there isn't a shred of evidence supporting it!! Or her silly connection between our babies throwing up after nursing and them being gravely stressed because of our way of treating them, unlike those loved and pampered tribes babies!! Totally fabricated out of thin air!!!Her hysteria about these little and frankly insignificant details in a person's life such as whether his mother rocked him in her arms to sleep or rocked him in his pram, and claiming that it will make or break him and cause him irreversible and serious psychological damage is not only unscientific but is frankly irresponsible and cruel towards new and vulnerable mothers who might think by not breaking their back and carrying their babies around 24/7 or by daring to tend to their own needs from time to time or God forbid by going back to work after a few months they are causing their beloved babies grave harm!! Nobody says we shouldn't hug and hold and cuddle our babies and even bigger kids a lot and giving them a lot of caresses and kisses every single day. But to make such dramatic all-or-nothing claims as this book does are simply sensationalism!She is neither an anthropologist, nor a psychologist, nor a child developmental expert of any kind and not even a mother with experience of raising her own children, for crying out loud for her opinions to be of any specific value worthy of her reader's valuable time and attention much less carry with them any objective authority what so ever!!! Her credentials as I said in the beginning are being a former model and university dropout! Not very impressive and trust-inspiring to rely on her personal opinion for my beloved child's upbringing. If you happen to already share her anti-Western, anti-civilization, \\"Mother Earth\\" worshiping, Tree-hugging, Primitive-tribe-romanticizing tendencies and/or you are just curious to hear what a person like her who has spent some time with the Indian tribes of South America thinks about the topic of child rearing and human development in general then by all means read this book and have fun. But if you don't share her biases and starting premises and are looking for some serious and well-founded guidance in the upbringing of your children then I suggest you find yourself a more scientifically oriented book written by a real expert in the field and with some real research as its basis and stay away from this pretentious anecdotal pseudoscientific rant!"},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"As a fierce advocate for many of the basic \\"attachment parenting\\" concepts, I read this book with much interest.

The homophobia is offensive. Yet, it's an interesting read about how we have lost sight the simple pleasures in life."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I recommend that everyone read this book. I agree that there are some concepts presented that are difficult to translate into our \\"concrete jungle\\" without having the benefit of the entire Yaquana way of life and environment. For example, a Yequana expects her child to follow her if she walks away and she doesn't wait for him to do so, yet I can not get in my car and drive away from my child, expecting him to catch up. However, I feel that the main point of this book is not just, \\"carry your baby in arms and the world will be a better place.\\" The message is to follow your instincts. A new mother instinctively does not want to put her baby down. A mother instinctively goes to her baby when she cries. A mother listens to her baby's reactions and respects her dislikes, dicomforts, and fears. What I took away from this book was not a critical examination of whether or not Leidloff had any right to be looking for diamonds or that she was focusing on one tribe in a bigger picture, but that she found an example of people who do not raise their children according to Dr. Spock or Dr. Sears or Dr. ANYONE, but according to their own inborn wisdom, biolgically passed down to them by others who parented this way with sucess. What I took away was a self assurance that I DO know how to raise a child without a doctor telling me and that if I feel uncomfortable with the latest fad in child rearing, I don't have to follow it. It is okay for a parent to parent in the way that feels RIGHT to her. There are obviously some aspects of parenting that one must learn and through generations parents have learned these things by example of other parents. Leidloff is not trying to tell anyone HOW to parent, just giving permission (which many feel they need) do do what FEELS right."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"Liedloff's &quot;continuum concept&quot; is a description of the development of human life: humans, like all other life forms, exist within a continuum of nature, and we survive and thrive best when we behave in ways closest to our natural heritage. The Continuum Concept is an application of this basic idea to childhood development and to human psychological development, based on ideas that Liedloff developed while she lived with a group of South American Indians called the Yequana. She found that their children matured easily and were independent and secure in themselves and in their relationships with others. She saw no strife or real unhappiness in the Yequana, despite the primitive quality of their existence.This book contains many wonderful insights about human development. The author proposes that many in Western culture are touch-deprived in infancy - a critical period she calls the &quot;in-arms phase&quot; - and that this deficit carries over into adulthood, in the form of the yearning for love, the need for other forms of security like money and possessions, etc. In essence, because our childhood was robbed of love and security, we seek it for the rest of our lives.The solution is to do as the Yequana: to hold and be with our babies all of the time; to be passive but available agents, giving the infants the independence and self-responsibility to explore, but with a secure parental base as anchor. Liedloff speaks of the harmony of the Yequana people, their lack of competition, their tremendous ease with the world, their sense of humor with each other, their lack of peer pressure or expectation.Some of the auxiliary ideas are interesting but not as well-founded. I disagreed particularly with her idea that homosexuality was one consequence of a lack of love; that's one idea that could bear updating (this book was written in the 1970's). She tends to overgeneralize or exaggerate a little bit when she speculates on how exactly the continuum concept impacts people in our society or in the Yequana's. The writing is simple and flows easily, but because of this and because of some of the generalizations, it begs for more detail and perhaps more backing, if not through experimental research or correlation with other cultures, then at least with examples and anecdotes. Unfortunately there are fewer than I would like.Overall, though, this book introduced me to some profound ideas I'd never encountered before. This is definitely one book I plan to refer to when I start raising children."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"As an advocate, of natural lifestyle and childbirth, babywearing, attachment parenting, and co-sleeping, I was strongly attracted to Liedloff's book. Her opportunity to fully engulf herself in indigenous cultures allows a perspective that is rare to many Westerners. Though the intentions to have babes in-arms and tend to their needs is a basic desire and understood ideal, the fact that the author has never had children herself (as stated in the book) can upset someone trying to mimic these life choices. Her concept, and any theory for that matter, must be taken in context of their surroundings and culture... We don't have the opportunities to have baby in arms -at ALL times (i.e carseats, out of home jobs, etc). We also don't have the opportunity to let our crawling toddler find his own boundaries like the people in the jungle can in their surroundings. They aren't battling threats automobiles and other modern dangers.What she witnessed must have been awesome! But, don't feel guilty because you can't replicate it here in 21st century modern society. Continue to do your best... Allow yourself to open up to your baby and love entirely - not limited by external pressures, magazine articles, and questionable stairs. Like she advises in the book, you intuitively know how best to raise your child. If it doesn't feel right in your soul, dismiss it- for such things are true."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I agree with the late homeschooling champion, John Holt's, review of this book, that if any one book could save the world, this would be the book; not in any superficial, faddish manner, but in a dramatic, spiritual, world-shattering manner. Everywhere one looks, from beautiful little towns to the fatigued, suffocating cities, suffering that is unneccesary groans and writhes along daily. But in our routines, our desensitized, consumeristic, addiction-driven eyes, we don't even realize we are suffering and we take for granted that life does not HAVE to be this way. This book explains why and how Western children and adults scream out for the intense mother-child attachment that is their birth right by resorting to the negative, aggressive and apathietic behaviors that permeate this society. The average \\"content\\" American has no idea of the agony children feel when in infancy their cries are unheeded, when, as babies they are put in a carriage or crib, when the toddler is shamed and punished, when the older child is locked away in the prison of public school, when the older child is treated as a savage slave and cut off from nurturance and emotional support, when the adolescent is patronized and treated like a useless enemy and when the young adult is cast off alone to fend for him/herself. This book was heart-wrenching to read, and can make the wounded and defensive parent very rejecting of it in their shame. However, this book isn't about shaming, in fact it enocurages the oppoiste... This book is about making peace with ourselves and freeing ourselves from the hell in which humans trapped themselves the moment a society first decided to put down an infant into a basket rather than keep the infant in-arms, first struck a child to \\"punish\\", first decided that it is acceptable to coerce and force another human being to do something against their will, whether that be to \\"learn\\" something, work or act in a certain way... This book is about the deletarious consequences to humanity of the moment when a society decided that it was best to move out of harmony with nature, out of harmony with human instinct, out of harmony with everything that is in the best interests of the body, mind, spirit and the individual, the family, the community, humankind, animals, nature and the earth. The saddest aspect of this book is that it goes unread by those who need its wisdom the most, those who agonize the most in their cycles of aggression, anger, apathy and lifeless routine. Please share this \\"life manual\\" with everyone you know!"},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"While pregnant with my first child, I had the extraordinary good fortune of running across the Continuum Concept on a shelf at the public library. Initially, I was skeptical about the seemingly extreme, inflexible advice. And ever since, I've felt a little embarrassed about associating myself with Liedloff's anthropological approach. I'm sympathetic to criticisms along these lines.However, The Continuum Concept is neither a parenting book nor a work of scholarship. Its power lies outside the details of the advice and the anthropology. Liedloff's narrative introduces the possibility of finding within radical difference a new freedom to act in and to interpret our own lives. This in itself is worth reading for, even if you go on to decide, say, that early body contact is not a major factor in human happiness.For parents, the Continuum Concept also has unique practical value. To my knowledge, Liedloff is the only writer to clearly articulate the idea that physical contact (carrying, nursing) with minimal direct attention (e.g. eye contact, bouncing, focusing on baby while suspending other activities) -- the opposite of the more familiar western pattern of a mother cooing at a baby who is lying in a carseat or bassinet -- is the ideal way of meeting the needs of a young baby. Liedloff's ideas about energy discharge and the sturdiness of the newborn also amount to a practical possibility most western parents would neither witness nor hear about anywhere else. Certainly, Liedloff's view that parents' adult life can and should go on relatively unimpeded (without neglect!) in the presence of children of all ages is almost unheard of in a culture that often imagines difficulty and sacrifice as normative ideals for parenting.Now that my daughter is almost 2, I am very grateful for both the interpretive framework and the simple but rare practical principles that have made our life together so smooth and joyful, and by extension, continue to deepen my understanding of what it means to live in family, in community, and in my own body."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I am not a mother, but I am a doughter (26 years) and a human being. From this perspective I have the strong feeling that Jean Liedloff's findings touch the deep truth of our souls. I was an extremly difficult child for my parents to cope with. They had to get up about 10 times a night because laying alone in my bed I was screeming and vomitting. The doctor could only tell them that I was a nervous child. All my youth I lived with the belief that I was a difficult and somewhat bad child. After all, from what people would judge, I have developed into a quite decent person, anyhow. Nevertheless, I feel that Jean Liedloff's idea of holding a new born child and submitting unquestioned support and love by this, brought into action by my parents, would have saved my family a lot of stress and would have given me a much better basis for my live. Emotionally, I can remember the feeling of being left alone and I know that it still affects me in my life today. I don't know yet whether I should give the book to my mother, for she would hate herself for the way she treated me, although she always had the very best intentions. I only know that I am convinced about this way of being there for your children physically and that I will act in this way if ever I become a mother. All parents or future parents should read this book to at least be inspired to think over their ideas of parenthood. Living by Jean Liedloff's findings should not become a dogmatic rule but a support for a better direction in parenthood. What would probably be important to parents, I could imagine, is to be able to exchange their experience, to get practical hints (this is something the book could have focused on some more!), and generally to live in a society that respects and supports children and their parents more."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"The simple truth that we (humans) &quot;need&quot; to be physically held &quot;in-arms&quot; as infants [by our mothers], to complete a phase of developement crucial to our individual &quot;well being&quot; the rest of our lives, is the crux. And that if we &quot;don't&quot; get this vital &quot;in-arms&quot; we will search for it all of our days, feeling unfulfilled, desperate and needy. It is funny how when I read this book back when, and tried to implement the process, by breastfeeding and carrying my kids in slings till they became too heavy or wanted to be down, it also evolved into the rest of their lives as well,(and my own). I ended up not ever wanting or needing to be away from my kids. A commitment to continue being there for them, was natural for me, and ultimately progressed to home schooling etc. or whatever you want to call it. I am available to them, and in essence free. Free to live, and love. I recommend this book to one and all, if you desire to know exactly what you need to do, to be a &quot;good&quot; mother. What is healthy and &quot;meant to be&quot;."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"This book changed the way I viewed parenting. I was fortunate enough to read it shortly before the birth of my first child, and then I read it again, and then I got rid of the crib, baby swing, feeding chair--all &quot;necessary&quot; baby equipment, with the exception, of course, of the car seat. My son was in contact with a loving human (myself, my husband, or his grandparents) for about 95% of his pre-crawling life, including sharing our bed at night. (At two and a half, he is making a smooth transition to his own bed.) I received countless comments from other mothers about his quietness when in arms, and his general contentment which seemed to surpass that of their children. Aside from the terrific ideas presented in this book, the writing itself is highly readable and extremely interesting. I give this book to anyone I care about who is expecting. I am eternally grateful that my midwife loaned her worn copy to me. Vive Liedloff!"},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"The core concepts of this book are very worthy. I do believe that many Western parents ignore their instincts, all in an effort to conform to rigid societal standards of acceptability. This book is valuable simply for the alternative perspective that it provides modern day parents. However, it is clear that the author has a profound bias which should really be acknowledged while you read the book. She idealizes the culture that she observes a and demonizes our own a bit too much. It oversimplifies the issues at hand.People object most to her dire predictions of what happens when one doesn't follow the \\"concept\\". This is always off-putting in any parenting book. It assumes too much. I was pleased to learn that the author has removed the offensive portion about the causes of homosexuality. That really degraded the overall message of the book.Another objection parents have is the descriptions of children being left to play around fires, cavernous pits and rusty knives. The implication being that children need not be minded 24/7 because they have an instinctive survival mechanism that we modern parents stamp out with our obsessive worry. Hmmmm. Interesting, but the truth is we don't all live in jungles with an entire village to help us watch after our children. Isn't it possible that our instincts adapt to our environment?But, beyond these criticisms I would still recommend the book. It offers a unique and interesting perspective to an important topic. It is refreshing alternative in a sea of books that try to tell you how to \\"control\\" your infant and child. Leidloff reminds us that child rearing need not be so complicated. This really is a case when less can be more."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"Probably the most powerful book I have ever read; a book that questions today's societal values concerning convenience and tecnological advances. As a future educator and community volunteer, I witness decay that begins in the family and spreads into society. We live in a society that creates people who are afraid, self-conscious and irresponsible. Liedloff gets to the source of these problems - problems that stem from the very beginning of life. After reading the book, I felt guilty and embarrassed for straying from common sense, but Leidloff provides the reader with the courage and power to return to common sense. I have seen the concept's impact: youth are much more self-confident, responsible and independent - traits that everyone should possess. It is definately a concept well worth considering and implementing."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I absolutely hated almost every minute of this book, but it changed my parenting for the better. I don't think I could have gotten quite that paradigm shift any other way.But I agree with some other reviewers who called Liedloff hyperbolic, and I found her overwhelmingly fundamentalist, in the sense that she presents things in black and white, with little room for variation. The Yequana are living rightly, and we are living wrongly, and this is the cause of our suffering -- this was a particularly ingratiating point of view. I found some parts of this book completely unbearable and ridiculous, such as the loong description of the 'horrors' a child suffers at the hands of a mother who leaves him alone to cry. I find it horrible to hear a child cry uncomforted, and I don't need pages and pages to learn that. Maybe it's because I'm parenting 30 years after this book helped catalyze a parenting revolution?The idea of a 'continuum' being our natural state of being and set of needs for our environments was a revolutionary idea for me even though I had already been \\"attachment parenting\\" for years when I read this. Before I read this book, I had a vague idea of how our culture is particularly hard on mothers and children, but now I have a real framework for understanding why it is and how to grow through it."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I encourage every parent-to-be and parent to read this book and take from it what you may.Your children will be grateful.On the other hand, I think it is very, very important to be realistic about the environment in which you are raising your children and never to use this book as a bar you set for yourself which can only cause frustration and disappointment. The people described in this book are supported by an entire culture. To live in our world and hold yourself to this standard is to set yourself up unnecessarily. Take what is valuable here to inform your choices, but be kind to yourself and realistic. And keep this in mind; Jean Liedloff had no children of her own!!!Goddess bless you and your children!"},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I found out about this book from reading Daniel Quinn's Ishmael. He credited this book for some of his thoughts. I wish that I had this book 25 years ago when raising my children. I always had an inkling that how I was told and what I read was not the best way to raise children. Reading this book just proves to me, even more, that we should listen to our instincts more carefully. I have already told my daughter to get the book and to tell her friends or give it to them as a gift. I hope that parents and parents to be get a chance to read this book, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"This book is remarkable and I think it should be mandatory for new parents. If we still treated our children in this way, perhaps they would not be bringing guns to school or abusing their bodies in the search for the love they never received from their parents."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"Parents, would-be parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents, anyone who knows children, anyone who was a child... you get the idea. EVERYONE should read this book.Keep in mind these are theories of one person. You do not necessarily have to agree with everything she says, but everything that is said in the book is worth reading and contemplating.This book shed alot of light on my own character and actually made me understand myself better, as well as understand how my actions affect my children. I am much more conscious now of decisions I make everyday that affect my family and people I come in contact with.It is not an easy read (not terribly difficult either) but it's worth every minute you spend on it.Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"This book is thoughtful and exciting. Will most likleychange your whole outlook on child growth and life itself.Seems to contain minor contradictions but its main messagecomes through strongly.If you ever plan to raise a child, or have ever been one,read this book!"},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"The above title is Bruce Lee's saying about learning martial arts but it applies to everything. Some people focus on what is wrong with a book and can miss the good stuff in it. Also people need to put relative values on different things said. You cannot expect people to be perfect. I have found really stupid things that brilliant people have said. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity was proven as a fact and he became an overnight celebrity the day after. But he said that people would never be able to use the energy in the atom. So even the guy recognized as having the most brilliant mind, made a mistake.With Jean's book, the version that I read did not have the thing about homosexuality in it. But that was not the whole point of the book. If it was, you could not remove it. Arnold Ehret wrote a book about health around 1900. It was very popular in the 1970s and many of the ideas in it became part of the accepted view of health. For example, the stuff about mucus forming foods. But he did say something strange but no one ever repeats it. He said that the moustache was a secondary sexual organ.But that was one stupid sentence in the whole book. You do not judge the whole book on that one sentence with nothing else ever mentioned about that again. Just like you do not judge Albert Einstein on his one sentence that turned out to be totally wrong. I have found other really stupid things that brilliant people have said but it is probably due to personal issues that they have. So you can ignore the minor things.I have read some of the others reviews. Ehret's book on health was not about moustaches. Jean's book was not about what category it should be placed in to sell well. It was not about homosexuals. I must admit that maybe people's reviews had caused her to fix some things in the version that I read. But it was obvious that she got this from the Yequana tribe and she did compare it to modern parenting, unlike what some reviews said.The basic idea Jean's book was that it was better for the infant to be held than to be left alone as some people believe. Another example of mistakes is Dr Herbert Shelton. He wrote many books on health and treated 40,000 people with serious health problems. Now there are many MDs and other health care professionals that follow his teachings that at one point were called \\"Natural Hygiene.\\" This is the basis of the 2 \\"Fit for Life\\" books on health. Yet this brilliant guy said that infants should be left alone and not bothered.Jean taught that a baby left alone in a playpen is not going to learn much compared to a baby that is brought into the daily life of the adult. Most Americans have a lack of self-esteem that would be a result of the baby not being held much. So this is the basis of the whole book, not all these minor things. Also the idea of sleeping with the baby was different than modern methods.Dr Martin Seligman was president of the American Psychological Association and is now director of the Positive Psychology Network that studies how everyone can be happier. He wrote many books on psychology including \\"Learned Optimism.\\" In his book, \\"Authentic Happiness,\\" he mentioned that he and his wife (with psychology degrees) slept with all 4 of his children.Someone mentioned that she said people want to be touched since they were not held enough as babies, but babies being held a lot also want to be touched. So this was mentioned as a contradiction. But people who are depressed and have lots of mental problems want to be happy. People who are happy and without mental problems also want to be happy. That is not a contradiction. So you can say that the default nature of the human being is to be happy and to be fond of touching.I have done many personal growth seminars in Philadelphia. I was very surprised to see that almost every person had a problem with self-esteem when I did not have that. So I figured that I was just different. But years later I read The Continuum Concept and that explained it. My grandmother would hold me all the time when I was a baby since it was her favorite thing to do.Jean also explained that people want to hold babies. Again this is what the whole book is about. I was babysitting a baby and sat down with a group of neighbors outside. I was sitting next to a 6 year old girl. She kept grabbing at the baby. So I said \\"Would you like to hold him?\\" The mother said \\"Are you crazy?\\" I replied that I would also be holding the baby. So she held the baby for a few minutes and was happy. Then the mother asked to hold him and she held him for 5 minutes. The other 4 women all did the same thing one after another. Now HOLDING A BABY has nothing to do with category, homosexuality, looking for diamonds, playing with knives, playing near a bottomless hole, giving credit to the Yequanas and other things mentioned about the book."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I personally thought this was one of the most amazing books I have ever read. It opened my mind to many things that I never realized about my own childhood and the way I was brought up. I know now that when my first daughter was born constantly going with my instincts was the way to go. This book just backs that up. If more people were to read this book and listen to what it really says the world just might be a better place for all of us."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. Liedoff makes numerous unsubstantiated statements such as, &quot;The continuing need for the missed experiences of the in-arms phase leads us to some very bizarre behavior...our taste for roller coasters, loop-the-loops and Ferris wheels.&quot; She essentially blames every adult's idiosyncracies (and even some behaviors that I consider normal) on not being held enough as a child. Liedoff simply blows me away with her Freudian-style judgments, which claim that we (adults) all suffer because of our parents' (however well-intentioned) child-rearing practices. The author doesn't make a single citation or have a bibliography, but simply presents her opinions as facts.So here's the GOOD NEWS: There is wonderful book by Meredith F. Small, an anthropologist, called &quot;Our Babies, Ourselves&quot; about attachment parenting that is well-written, precise, and backed by numerous references. Furthermore, Small's background in the field is extensive, having lived and studied numerous traditional societies for years. Liedoff, on the other hand, bases her entire book on one experience with some South American &quot;Stone Age Indians&quot; (can we be any more condescending?). And as far as I can tell, she doesn't have any children herself.Liedoff's writing style is loose and imprecise and her claims unfounded. I discourage readers from buying this how-to parenting book written by a novice, and instead go for &quot;Our Babies, Ourselves,&quot; which is ten times more satisfying."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"This book changed my whole view on child raising. In the west child raising is often perceived as a contest or a war. The more you 'win' from your child, the better parent you are. The end goal is to control the behavior of your child as much as possible. When I discovered I was pregnant, I felt hesitant and non-enthusiastic by the forecast that I had to be strict and consistent for the next 20 or so years.Jean shows in her book how you can raise a child with empathy. How wanting to be held is a genuine human need. Not something you should unlearn your child asap, in order to prepare them 'for the real world'. This book shows you how to live with a child. How you can be loving, empathethic and truthful and not 'spoil' your child. She challenges you to assume, just for a minute, that a child is social by nature. It is not an anti-social creature that needs to ne socialized.Another wondeful insight she offers is not to be child centered. The child is looking to you with wondering eyes, because it wants to be shown how live is lived. Just go about your life as much as possible and let the child be an observer. Gradually, when it's ready, it will start contributing and helping the family or tribe that she was born into.Finally Jean is showing us that babies are actually very wise creatures and deserve some trust. Don't hover around your young ones, but exude that you trust them. When they fall and cry, don't make it worse than it is by projecting your fear all over them. Just observe and be there for your child. Trust them.I could go on and on. This book is my gem. I love it. Please read it."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"So many adult problems, personal and societal, can be traced back to the formative years of childhood. If anyone asks me for a recommendation on a good read or one of the most informative books on childraising...this is it. Brilliant, the way the author unveils the relationships within our culture and what we do to our children, and what we are becoming if we don't do something about it."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"It is a book with some great and some not so great ideas on raising a baby. It does make sweeping assumptions about human life in general. It feels like author is very inexperienced in raising children herself, so you won't find much of the practical advice.There are many great practical books out there about raising kids bonding style, so I would just cherck this one out from the library, if you are curious."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"If I could have given this book 3 1/2 stars I would have, because though I think it's above average, I found a few of her more outdated ideas a little hard to swallow (such as her theory about the causes of homosexuality). However, the overall thesis of the book is very compelling and thought-provoking. Though she relies heavily on her experience with only two tribes of hunter-gatherers, so one could argue that her conclusions can hardly be considered universal, it is still an interesting book, inviting readers to consider child-rearing practices in a cultural context."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"The Continuum Concept for me opens the door to a deep gratitude to my parents and grandparents and all my ancestors for being who they were."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I believe that this book is extremely important for our time. To me, the overall premise is that our species has developed an intuition through the ages of how to live happily and sustainably, but we have abandoned this inner wisdom to the god of \\"science\\". Science constantly makes mistakes however, and our view of development at any cost has brought us our modern miseries, and indeed our proximity to mass extinction.I'm not crazy about the writing style-I find it stiff but the content is so important that I still awarded it 5 stars. In my opinion, it is a must read. Most of the criticisms of this book focus on the fact that she doesn't offer scientific proof of her principles-but that's the point!

After her return home, she wrote this book: a comparison of child-rearing and health between tribal cultures and modern culture while calling for reconnecting with a lost continuum humans followed for millions of years. Liedloff points out how humans in tribes remain healthy and sane while civilized people are full of neurotic tendencies and seem bent on destroying themselves. A vital read for soon-to-be parents and those concerned with the human future. (Final aside: I find some of her psychological evaluations toward the end to be out-dated; perhaps a new edition can be updated...?)"},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I so appreciate Ms. Liedloff's book....I only wish I had read it sooner. Her style is poetic and yet scholarly. I was thrilled that she gave voice to those of us who knew &quot;continuum&quot; or &quot;attachment&quot; parenting was right but felt like we were alone in the world (and sometimes in our own home!) I was also left with hope that it's never too late.... Despite the fact that I've only partly continuum parented due to external, intellectualized objections I rejoice that I'm learning (from my children) and now have global/ethnographic support for doing so."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"However idealistic and romantic Liedloff's work is, I was profoundly moved. She admits to never having the intention of writing a &quot;how-to&quot; book for child-rearing, but the unforeseen following of her child-care pontifications forced her to look again at how her message was received, and how she could possibly be considered an &quot;expert&quot; in light of her first-hand experiences. I first read the book when my two children were toddlers, and I saw many, many points of interest that were right on with my own attachment-parenting style. However, I still never caught on with referring back to this book for discplinary concerns. In the 21st century U.S., if I allow my young children to wander up and down the streets or into the woods without &quot;supervision&quot;, I could be arrested for child neglect and/or endangerment. So, it doesn't matter whether I agree with her parenting theories, they, in some part, would be punishable by Western governments, and since I choose to remain a U.S. citizen, I need to abide by federal and state laws. The &quot;in-arms&quot; phase was one I thoroughly enjoyed with my babies, and perhaps it is a shame that our current society remains as one that does not trust the child's instinct and process as valid, but we, as parents are responsible for introducing our children to live and contribute to the culture that WE live in. It does more harm than good to raise children with a sense of anarchy toward our current culture, even though we may disagree with its mandates. The freedom and representative vote that we can access allows us to introduce philsophical concepts such as this into Western culture not as an ideal (almost all parenting books read as idealistic, by the way, and they're all different), but as an option. We are seeing this more and more with the continuing rise in acceptance of homeschooling and non-punitive parental discipline. It's important to remember that this concept might still be in a process, and that parents can still be forcibly separated from their children by authorities for sleeping with them, by continuing to nurse into elementary school age, or by letting them roam. That being said, I still look at this as an incredible philosophical and visionary piece of literature. And that is how I encourage any reader to approach the book: read and ponder, since this is not a research find but a poetic and beautiful experience that changed Liedloff's outlook on life. It had an impact on my life, and it can do the same for you."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"The simple and pure continuum concept will stay with me throughout my parenting years to come. I am very glad to have read of it before my first child is born. To hold your children, partner and friends in need, and to restrain from labelling them, makes wonderful sense to allow for their free, confident yet supported development.However, the book contains some unworthy and potentially dangerous tangents, which are ignorant and poorly researched. The most harmful is the negetive view of homosexuality and ignorance about its causes. The damage done by expressing unsupportive and negative views about a sexuality different to your own could wipe out any benefit of having used the continuum concept in all else.I am also not comfortable with the implied strict division of male and female roles. Although most children will fit into these expectations conveniently enough for narrow minded parents, we are all at different points along a spectrum of male and female behaviours, and should not be pigeon-holed. Other primative cultures do allow for this, and one of the benefits of the modern world is that we are relatively free to find our own place in it, and I celebrate this.This book would be much improved by thorough revision and complimentary scientific research (which does not seem to have been done for the 1986 revision on reading the reviews here). It could then become a truly inspiring work.So, to whoever reads this book: please watch out for its flaws for yourself and do not to take every word as the truth, but distill and absorb the beauty at its core."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"Reading this....changed the way I think about childcare. Thebook is intelligent and emotional as it tries to express what feelsright in a &quot;continuum&quot; society and what feels terribly wrong in our own.I do think the book has its share of flaws. It is somewhat influenced by Liedloff's romanticized impression of the jungle and of the indigenous people, which is okay, except that it makes it questionable as true anthropology. Some of her conclusions are really not supported by science and are offensive today, like the ideas of how gay and lesbian people are produced (bad parent relationships). Please, Liedloff, rethink these things and print a new edition!It's for a good reason that this book is called &quot;almost the companion book&quot; to _Ishmael_, by Daniel Quinn. Both see something of great value in indigenous societies, and make an essentially successful attempt to show it to us. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed _The Continuum Concept_ and would recommend it to anyone expecting a child."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I read Jane Lieloff's book about a year ago. Where I first heard about it was at the Ishmael Community.What I got from the book was that humans have expectations that have been passed on from our predecessers that need to be met in our human experience. Unfortunately due to our culture's mythology's about child rearing a lot of the human expectations go unmet in our human experience.Liedloff pointed out to us that the Yequana still use the child rearing instincts of our predecessers. And as a result their children behave a lot differently from the children raised in civilization. And all in all the people of the Yequana tribe are more content in their living situation than we in civilization are.A different cultural perspective on child rearing. Everybody who was raised and is raising children in our Taker Culture should read!!!"},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I've read it 3 times and keep talking about it. This book gives you the exact idea of how to raise children the right way. It gives you strength to understand the people around you, and gives you hope for a better world.

Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"The ideas in this book are at the same time obvious and natural and completely revolutionary from the point of view of our cultural norms in child-raising. I found myself moved by the possibility that we can learn to raise our children so that &quot;normal neurotic&quot; is seen for what it is...the evidence of a childhood of profound lonliness and trauma. I heartily recommend this book. Especially if you've ever wondered what being an infant may be like from the infant's point of view.."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I give this book 4 out of 5 stars because it isn't wonderfully written, but the ideas in it are important. Based on some of the other readers' opinions, I gather that people are unaware of the situation Jean Liedloff was in when she wrote the book.Let's address the \\"politically incorrect\\" charge laid on this book. It was originally written back in 1975. Back in 1975, an untrained (or even a trained) anthropologist would not have used politically correct terms to describe tribes living in South America. I hate when people don't bother to look at the details and put things out of context.The other charge, that she went to the forest as a \\"diamond plunderer\\", then condemns her for it, totally misses the point of her book. Yes, she went there in a state of total ignorance. The whole point of her book is that by living with \\"primitives\\" she became aware of the artificiality, the dreariness of Western society. Her book reads like exactly what it was--a polemic written by a young woman who had a zeal to change the world, who was so full of the ideas and insights she learned from leaving behind her Western-centric view that she must share them with the world. Yes, her book is at times heavy-handed. No, it's not full of references to other books because, again, this is HER experience and she is not trying to rely on the opinions of \\"experts\\" to bolster her view. I did not at all get the impression that this was a professional ethnography. When I read the book, I got a sense of a woman who believes she has valuable information that she wants to share with the world and wrote a book to do so. By doing so, she certainly opened my eyes. I never knew that these tribes living out in the wilderness were happy and free in a way contemporary \\"civilized\\" societies never seem to be.A very good book to read alongside this book is \\"Nutrition and Physical Degeneration\\" by Dr. Weston A. Price. He tackles the health and happiness of \\"primitive\\" tribes from a nutritional standpoint. Reading them together should prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, what we are doing wrong as \\"modern\\" peoples and what we can try and do to correct and overcome our mistakes. Of course, no one is advocating a return to the forests to live like our ancestors, but for heaven's sake, we can certainly adapt what our tribal cousins know but we somehow forgot.Is it possible that wars, disease, and social unrest might be caused by poor nutrition as Price suggests or failure of parents to keep their babes \\"in arms\\" as Liedloff suggests? I think it is.Just be forewarned...\\"Nutritional and Physical Degeneration\\", written in the 1930s contains similar politically incorrect terminology. If you are going to judge a book by how politically correct its terms are, you might as well stop reading anything classical or anything older than 1995.Just give the book a try and try to keep an open mind as Liedloff and Price did."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I read this about a month after my son was born. I wish I had read it sooner.I just read several comments that pointed out that many of the philosophies in the book are not supported by scientific research, and some pointed out that the author doesn't have children so her opinions must be invalid.As I read the book, all of it just made a lot of sense to me. I do think it is missing a little bit of \\"proof\\" or whatever you want to call it, just to reassure the readers and whatnot. But since so much of it made sense to me, I tried it for myself, and fully believe in what she's saying. And she doesn't need to be a mother in order to know what she is talking about.What stuck with me the most is it made me not feel guilty for taking care of my son and not \\"letting\\" him cry himself to sleep. How backwards is society that I get flack for carrying my 3 month old in my arms instead of a stroller and for always fulfilling his most basic needs?So while the book is by no means perfect, the message is good, and I think everybody (and I mean EVERYBODY) should read it."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I read this book and started crying because we're all broken. I didn't cry just for me, but for everyone I knew, everyone I love, everyone I could have loved, had they not been so hell-bent on being unlovable in order to demand being loved in spite of it. You need to read this book. You don't have to agree with it, or do anything differently, but you might decide to anyway. It's only important that you read it because you can't possibly make an informed decision about how you want to be happy (or helping anyone else to find their happiness) until you know what the possibilities are."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"Did you know that Dr. Sears' first book was essentially an instruction manual on applying the Continuum Concept ideas to modern parenting practices? Although it fell short in achieving its own goal, it nevertheless became the seed of his Attachment Parenting movement. Well, if you have found AP practices to be helpful or even just interesting, why not go back to the true original? There are biologically-correct ways to apply AP philosophy, and then there is \\"helicopter\\" and \\"martyr\\" parenting that can disrupt the continuum just as mistreatment and neglect can.Babies and children's primary role is to learn how to be adults. It is very important for them to observe adults carrying on in the normal course of their day. They must be integrated into the family and community, not the other way around. Near-constant babywearing and holding during the \`in-arms phase' provides the appropriate foundation for learning how to be an adult, but only in combination with the activity and community that supports it.Have you ever noticed how calm babies are when being worn? Liedloff explains that their energy is \\"discharged\\" by the energy field of the person wearing them, so they can go into observation mode, which is their biological expectation of the role they should be playing at that stage. When not in arms, they have to discharge their energy through activity and jerky movements. Plus, they are constantly trying to signal that something is amiss. And in reaction to the signaling, we tend to talk to them and make them the center of attention, leading to more signaling that something is not right.This is just one example of the amazing insight Liedloff provides into the world of babies raised in a biologically- and evolutionarily- appropriate environment, the Yequana tribe of South America.

I tried my best to keep my baby as close to me as possible at all times. It wasn't really that difficult; my heart told me it was the right thing to do. Of all the things we can do for our children when they are babies, keeping them close physically is one of the most important."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"This is a book everyone should read - not just parents. It is one womans account of the life of the Yequana Indians and how they interact with their children. It is not an insruction booklet or a scientific research project but it is worthy of attention. If you can get over the writing style which is a little old fashioned and look at the core message you will say - YES - deep down I know this to be true.

Just be forewarned that it can make you feel guilty (I'm sure this was not the author's intention) for not providing your child with a perfect babyhood. Liedloff paints a picture of an utopic society that seems impossible to replicate if you don't actually live there. But, we try. I have tried to apply the principles of this book to my parenting, and as long as I don't look for perfection, it works out really well. People are shocked at some of the things I do as a parent, but this book helps me stay strong in what I believe is a very wonderful way to raise a child. I feel the basic concept of the book is to TRUST YOUR BABY.Aside from the parenting aspect, this book helped me see clearly that so many of us have issues handed down to us from our parents, and our parents' parents and so forth, and no one is really to blame for our hurts. When I fall short as a parent, I know it is because my parents weren't able to provide me with everything I needed as a child. I know it's not my fault that I'm imperfect as a parent, but it gives me hope that if I try hard enough to give my son what he needs, then he will be able better off than me and do a better job with his own children one day."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"This is one of those books that jumped off the shelf, or screen, at me and I am so thankful.

Read it and pass it on, please."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"Unfortunately, I am beginning to see the results of Miss Liedloff's views on raising children in my grandchildren. I feel sorry for them.Miss Liedloff was ashamed to admit to the Indians in South America that where she comes from 'women do not feel capable of raising children until they read the instructions written in a book by a strange man.' She does, however, want you to accept the views of a strange woman who has never had children and whose only direct experience comes from 'parenting' an anteater(!) and allowing a small monkey to sleep with her. She assumes that her views derived from analyzing mentally disturbed patients can be applied to all mothers in this country.Modestly, she lets us know that Dior wanted her to model - but she refused, although Vogue also managed to snag her for a short period. The idea of the 'jungle' fascinated her, and when she arrived in South America she observed a perfect, primitive society not as an anthropologist, but rather as an impressionable tourist. In this perfect society when things go wrong people laugh. The only people who cause problems are those who stupidly have left the tribe and have had contact with civilization. Unfortunately, they even learn a few words of Spanish. Children, even when they are old enough only to crawl, understand danger and do not need supervision.Miss Liedloff knows why people take drugs, what causes homosexuality, and of course how to raise children.Please look elsewhere on how to raise children."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"This is the most important book anyone in Western society could ever read, whether or not they have children.If only I could buy a trillion copies and drop them out of an airplane, blanketing the earth!You must read it to know what I mean."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"Hello! This women hasn't got any kids! Don't take parenting advice from people who don't have kids! Seems elementary, but OMG -- when my kids were born back in the early '90s, I knew parents who were trying to do this. Their kids were like little bats attached to the mother's chest 24/7. One thing it might be useful to point out is that in cultures where this is still practiced, the men hold all the power. The women are basically farm animals, and their children are the product -- belonging to the farmer. If you want any power of your own, Girlfriends, you have to put down the kid now and again.

That's impossible. We can hold our babies quite a bit of the time, but how about driving a car, bathing, etc...

A little drawn out out for me, but amazing, I wish I had read years ago. Thinking of buying a copy for all my adult children! Read it!!!"},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"Jean Liedloff was a New Yorker who went to Europe and pursued modeling and journalism work. She met some Italians who were leaving for the jungles of Venezuela to hunt for diamonds. On a whim, she joined their expedition. Over the course of five expeditions, she spent two and a half years living with Stone Age people. As she bounced back and forth between the modern world and wild freedom, she became acutely aware of the staggering differences between the two ways of life.The natives were \\"the happiest people I have ever seen.\\" She found their lack of unhappiness to be spooky. The adults maintained a high state of social harmony -- even when everyone was drunk. Their children were all well-behaved, never argued, never hit each other, never had tantrums, never suffered boredom, and were never punished by their parents.Returning to the modern world was always a ghastly experience, because the people were so strikingly unhappy. Why? Liedloff explored this question in her book, The Continuum Concept. It compares wild people to civilized people through the eyes of an eyewitness reporter, and tries to explain how communities of the same species could be as different as night and day.Liedloff observed that the misery of civilized people began shortly after birth, when the newborn was immediately carried away from its mother, placed in a crib in the nursery, and left to scream. Welcome to civilization, Bubba! The sense of wellbeing enjoyed in the womb came to an abrupt end at birth, and most of these kids would never again recover it.The Indians, on the other hand, raised their children in accordance with ancient instincts -- a specific sequence of normal developmental experiences that Liedloff called the human continuum. From the moment of their birth, newborns were held and nursed and loved -- and this warm, secure, continuous contact lasted for months, until the child indicated that it was ready to begin the creeping and crawling phase. Raised in the Indian manner, the kids lived with a sense of wellbeing throughout their entire lives. They were happy.Our animal instincts are very much in tune with our evolutionary journey. In the civilized world, \\"primitive\\" instincts were disregarded, and society was dominated by intellect. The Indians were intelligent, and they knew how to reason, but for them intellect was a servant of instinct. The rise of civilization corresponded with the rise of intellect. Unbridled intellect is the father of unstable societies, like the one outside your window.Today, civilized mothers are so removed from natural life that they actually have to read books by childrearing \\"experts\\" like Dr. Spock to learn how to raise their young. But when these non-continuum instructions are followed, civilized mothers \\"produce children they cannot love, who grow up like themselves, anti-self, antisocial, incapable of giving, destined forever to go hungry.\\"Indian children, raised via time-proven instincts, develop normally, in a sequence designed by evolution. Civilized children do not. We miss vital developmental steps in childhood, and this frequently leads to adults who have infantile components in their personalities, for their entire lives. Here is the most striking paragraph in the book:\\"Man can \`survive' in appallingly anti-continuum conditions, but his well-being, his joy, his fulfillment as a whole human being, can be lost. From many points of view he might be better off dead, for the life force, in its ceaseless tending toward repair of damage and completion of developmental phases, among its instruments employs anxiety, pain, and an array of other ways of signaling that things are wrong. Unhappiness in all its forms is the result. In civilization, a frequent outcome of the operating of the system is constant misery.\\"She wasn't fond of modern society. Liedloff eventually became a psychotherapist, and she used what she had learned to help some people reduce their inner pain. She didn't discover miracle cures, but she believed that some degree of healing was possible for some people. Her book has helped many new mothers avoid making some of the classic mistakes.She presents us with compelling descriptions of both ways of life, and these fit nicely with studies done by many others. The symptoms of our illness are numerous and easy to see. But her diagnosis is primarily focused on the child-rearing process, and I suspect that this might be too narrow.There are many other major differences between wild societies and civilization. Wild people live in wild lands filled with wild animals, and they spend most of their time outdoors. They rarely experience strangers, crowds, or machines. They are not controlled by others, they are free. Their sense of rightness is not suffocated by contact with school systems, corporate systems, religious systems, or greedy, exploitive, dishonest people. Civilization damages us in numerous ways, throughout our lives.The good news here is that we can quit blaming our parents for screwing us up, because the entire society is screwed up. \\"All one can discover from horizon to horizon are victims of victims.\\" The bad news is that we are locked into powerful, unhealthy patterns of living, and damaged parents create damaged children. There are no simple solutions. The good news is that Peak Cheap Energy is going to disrupt our patterns of living, and one of the possible outcomes is positive, beneficial change. Liedloff provides us with some important pointers for the road ahead.Richard Adrian ReeseAuthor of What Is Sustainable"},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"This book gave me so much insight not only into parenting, but into the hearts and minds of everyone around me. The world would be a better place if everyone read this book."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"One aspect of this classic book that I haven't heard much about is the extreme homophobia it contains. Liedloff suggests the likelihood that homosexuality is a result of ill child-rearing and unhealthy relationships with opposite sex parents, as well as some other very stereotypical nonsense. This was ignorant to say in the seventies, but in the late 1990's, it is extremely insulting and disrespectful. An updated edition is needed, as well as a discussion about how very insightful ideas can be attached to very ignorant ones!"},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"Let me begin by saying that the very basic principle in this book is one that I agree with. Babies need your support and affection in order to become happy little monkeys. There is a library of literature that covers this topic that is well researched, argued, easy to read and intelligent (see Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt for a fantastic example). Cuddle your baby when it needs cuddling! Easy, and lovely.Now that that's out of the way...This book is the worst sort of supposition, opinion and romanticism dressed up in pseudo-scientific, ill-fitting clothes.The premise is that the author (who has no qualifications in anything but presenting opinion) spent time with ONE tribe of South American natives and from that, decided that their way of life is superior and that we should emulate them. Wonderful!She argues this be saying that we are beastly (we apparently tie our children to their cots and never console them when upset), while the \\"continuum\\" people are just so lovely and happy.She then goes on to talk about children raised by wolves (citing a discredited example as truth) and tells us that she believes in psychic powers, communing with the dead and random feats of super-strength. I am NOT making this up.The writing style is repetitive, constantly pounding home the same statements, trying to get you to believe them to be true, but there is no research here beyond her experiences with this tribe. She hasn't read, or cited, anyone else's work (barring the Indian wolf-children) and hand-wavingly talks anecdotally about anything that could have been researched.It's a TERRIBLE, LAZY, superstitious, look at child-rearing and, even though I agree with the conclusion, her argument is so shoddy, childish and self-indulgent that I would never recommend this to anyone. You owe it to yourself (and your children) to read ANY other book on this subject so that you can understand not only HOW to treat your baby, but WHY. A proper \\"why\\", not just some bizarre opinion piece.Please don't buy this book.

For parents who are already familiar with attachment parenting theories, the book merely uses a different approach (the tribal customs) and is at times over the top.In my life, the book was an eye opener and I was so thankful to read it. It paved the way to a solid, close relationship with my baby."},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I read The Continuum Concept 3 years before my son Zachary was born, 21 years ago... Little did I know at the time that Jean's words would powerfully impact my life in such a way that it profoundly affected how I birthed, nursed, raised and nurtured all three of my children. This one work caused a complete paradigm shift in not only my beliefs on parenting and family - but on how I viewed the world as a whole.Jean inspired me to dig deeper, to make choices that were often out of the \`status quo' or norm, and I am eternally grateful. I chose to homebirth, to practice extensive breastfeeding, to not vaccinate, to homeschool, to travel the world with my family and to love them unconditionally for who they ARE rather than to hold to any expectations of who I may have wished them to be. I learned to look within for inner guidance and to trust that the instincts within were much stronger and rooted than anything that modern \\"experts\\" may suggest and now, I am very proud to say, that it was the very best choice I ever could have made. All three of my children are amazing and awesome, filled with light, love, consciousness, awareness and common sense. They are incredibly intelligent beings who are sensitive to others and who carry an empathy so lacking in today's world.Jean's work in The Continuum Concept completely changed so much about my perceptions of the modern world, and I was in constant contact with my children providing an extension of the womb long after they were born. In modern and materialistic society, so much energy is spent in denying the child any freedom to explore out of our own fears. Jean inspired me to be brave and to trust the Creator, the Universe and my own instincts when it came to my children. What I appreciated the most was that her work opened up the possibility of my rethinking not just the way we are taught to parent, but to question everything. Her work is as important as Original Wisdom: Stories of an Ancient Way of Knowing, Ishmael: An Adventure of the Mind and Spirit, the works of Joseph Chilton Pearce and Ashley Montagu.Rest in Peace Beautiful Jean...You were a shining light and an inspiration to so many!"},{"Title":"Continuum Concept","review":"I read this book in two days.

The book is geared for all non-profits, with good general information but with no special tips for those in education that seek grants. The second chapter, Who are the Grantors?, defines foundations, corporations, religious donors, and government agencies. The section on Religious Donors highlights a donor group that is frequently overlooked. Zimmerman outlines the methods used to obtain information on the grantor - an important step, since a key to funding is to know what the funder is interested in supporting. He offers information on the key resources: the Foundation Grants Index, the Foundation Directory, the Foundation 1000, annual reports, tax returns, and the foundation libraries, but also features the Foundation Grants Index quarterly and other periodicals, and some tips on obtaining information about corporate giving programs (Taft is really the best resource for this, beyond the corporations themselves). He identifies the elements of a research profile outline, and outlines methods of online research, a relatively new tool for grant writers. Most beginning grant writers make simple mistakes that can be avoided, if only they read the directions and plan their project carefully. Beginners also tend to focus too much on the writing (even worry too much on the writing) and of the entire 48 pages of this book, only 13 are given to the writing of successful proposals. On the one hand, people in search of specific help in writing may consider this a weakness of Zimmerman's guide; on the other hand, his de-emphasis of the writing process focuses attention on the process leading up to the grant should be a good clue to the beginner: the process is key to success in the grants world. The attention paid to detail ahead of time is as important -- possibly more -- as the final product. Finally, if an aspiring grant writer is working in education, for example, running acorporate and foundation relations office or a government grants office at a college or university, this book is very elementary - it will only take the novice a short distance of the total he or she needs to go to learn the profession. However, it is ideal for the small non-profit, looking at writing one or two grants over a period of a couple years."},{"Title":"Tormenta roja","review":"A Masterpiece of the Cool WarUna obra maestra de la Guerra Fria.

She reluctantly agrees that the notorious rake might prove to be the only viable solution to her current situation. They get married and surprisingly fall in love with each other. However, some unknown assailant is unhappy with the nuptials and plans to put an end to them as soon as possible by any means necessary.BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN is a typical Regency romance that fans of the sub-genre will enjoy. However, what makes this novel live up to its title is the growing relationship between the charming two lead protagonists. Their witty interplay is extremely jocular as both adapt to love, turning Julia Quinn's book into a wonderful historical romance worth reading.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"this is not her best book, but this is also a great &amp;must read book... I highly recommand everyone to read her books, including this one =)"},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"Brighter Than the Sun is a sweet charming book. Yes like the other viewers I agree there is not much of a plot and this is not one of Julia Quinn best. But I still loved the characters in Brighter Than the Sun. The best word that I could use to describe this story is \\"lovely\\". It is worth the time spent to read it and will leaves you smiling in the end. Julia Quinn stories are humorous, romantic and interesting - and she is excellent and creating characters that are real, interesting people. There certainly was a great amount of humor which I loved and Ellie was so cleverly funny that I found myself chuckling quite a bit throughout the book."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"having read many julia quinn books in the past, i was looking for one i hadn't had the pleasure of reading before, and came across brighter then the sun. wow, this was awful. so awful i never finished it i was THAT bored. [and i will finish anything, just because i can't bear to leave something incomplete.] i am really stunned that this was published or that julia herself considered it worthy of her name and talent. such a disappointment and waste of time. sigh:("},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"This book was pretty good, and if I were reading Ms. Quinn for the first time, I might have given it five stars. But I've read the Bridgerton series, etc., and Brighter Than The Sun didn't quite measure up. It certainly started out well, but if you're going to have a heroine who is so independent and out-of-step with the mores of the regency that she would cut off someone's boot, let them lean on her as they walk, and go to a bachelor's residence alone, then you really shouldn't change her into someone who is constantly bickering because she's uncomfortable with the marriage of convenience she's made. Yes, parts were amusing, and I found Charles (especially his lists) to be endearing, but I got tired of Ellie's little snits and spats. When are authors going to learn that that behavior is for junior high students? Anyway, in reading this review, it sounds pretty negative, but in spite of that, I think you'd enjoy this book or I would not have given it four stars. It's funny, it's good, the love between the two characters is certainly believable, and the hero is pretty delicious. My negativity really only stems from the fact that the author is Quinn, and I expect more from her."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"This is a lovely book to read to waste away some hours of your day. I found myself laughing alot at the characters and at the banter they kept throwing at each other. I felt Eleanores character was believable and i loved her strength i thought Charles character could have been done a bit better especially at the start of the book he didnt convince me with being a full fledged rake. I thought the suspensful moments especially the one at the end were roughly put in and very typical.. (dont want to ruin it for those that havnt read it)I didnt feel it as much as other books i have read of JQ but it was a good read."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"As opposed to the dozens of people who loved How to Marry a Marquis (another novel published later than Brighter Than the Sun), I set the book on my bookshelf and never looked at it again. But browing through my bookstore, empty-handed and desperately craving a read, I spotted this one and decided to give Ms. Quinn another try. From the first page, I became involved in the book; Charles and Ellie meet under certainly unconventional circumstances, and their banter throughout is light and amusing. My one issue was the &quot;villain&quot; element: it seems as if it was thrusted in at the last moment with little thought to provide denouement in the last few pages, and at first I didn't even recognize who the villain was as the villain was only mentioned once or twice, briefly. However, my problem aside, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Brighter than the Sun. It's a delightful, frothy read perfect for those days you'd like to relax, and although I have to admit it certainly isn't one of my favorites it has redeemed Ms. Quinn in my eyes."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"Another good book by Julia Quinn. Not her best, but definitely a notch above what others are writing. If you like Julia Quinn, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I got to 44% and could not take any more and returned it. Ellie marries the earl and his jealous cousin is mystically present at every disaster that follows her around damaging her new home as she insists she did not do it. He does not believe her and thinks our intelligent lady to be remarkably inept. This is interspersed with their constant bickering and topped off with too many grammatical errors in need of editing. I loved the Bridgerton series but this book is not a winner."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"Even better than &quot;Everything and the Moon&quot;. While Robert and Victoria were starcrossed lovers, Charles and Ellie seem to be on a &quot;collision course&quot; with destiny. I loved Charles and the &quot;lists&quot;.

In BTtS, we meet up again with Ellie, Victoria's little sister from Everything and the Moon, and watch her make her way through a marriage of convenience with Charles Wycombe, Earl of Billington. Both characters are fairly likeable in typical JQ style. The plot is just a little thin and the nearly constant stream of injurious incidents can get a little irritating. However, it is a light, fluffy read that may see you through a rainy afternoon. And if you are a JQ fan, you will probably want to add BTtS to your collection anyway, so who cares if it's not up to speed with the Bridgerton books and How to Marry a Marquis? It's still head and tails above much of the rest."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I started to get a little annoyed that Ellie just didn't sleep with her husband. I thought that slowed the plot down otherwise very good book."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The characters were amusing and it played in just right with the story line. I thought it funny when a rectors daughter married a rake.

But then again I could be bias."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"This book was one of the funniest I have ever read! I enjoyed it from the start. It was so awesome to read a book that was refreshing and funny throughout.

Definitely a great book if you are looking for something that is not serious or dreary."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"Honestly, this book is SUCH a great pick-me-up when you are feeling down and in need of a hearty laugh. Quinn's dialogue simply sparkles, her characters funny, likeable, and all too human. If you haven't read any of her others, please, I implore you, do. You won't ever go back!"},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"i loved this book, one of my fav. Julia Quinn books, it is laugh out loud funny. The bannter is witty and delicious I could not but it down!"},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"Julia Quinn's books are all very appealing - she has great characters whose verbal fencing is generally very amusing. You don't read her books for historical accuracy - this is certainly not her strong point - but they are fun and enjoyable reading.\\"Brighter Than The Sun\\", like her other books, has a feisty heroine, Ellie Lyndon, who finds herself in a marriage of convenience with handsome rake Charles Wycombe, Earl of Billington. But can she reform him and can they learn to live together happily despite some strange occurrences that seem to be causing them danger.The overall plot of this book is pretty thin - the marriage of convenience turning to love, and various acts of sabotage against both Ellie and Charles - but that's not really the point of the book. Julia Quinn seems to delight in writing amusing dialogue between her characters and this book feels almost as if it's entirely made up of conversation; there's very little description, we learn about most things through our characters' words. Of course they're speaking in a 21st century voice most of the time, no Georgette Heyer-esque Regency accuracy here. Still, it's fun to read and both characters are very charming, Charles particularly. I think the earlier Bridgerton stories are probably better than this (which is, I believe, an older novel reprinted) but this is still an enjoyable read for a lazy afternoon."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I adore Julia Quinn's Bridgerton series, so I had high hopes for this one. However, this turned out to be a HUGE disappointment - so much so that I ended up skipping after 100 pages to the end because I just couldn't take it anymore. The heroine, Ellie, is extremely annoying, whose personality apparently dictated that she act like a waspish, humorless shrew towards the hero, who was nothing but kind and charming to her. Also, there were huge chunks of the book where NOTHING was happening except for the boring and increasingly annoying back-and-forth dialogue between Ellie and Charles, which did nothing to advance the story. It got to be so annoying that I had to stop. You could tell Ms. Quinn was trying very hard to be witty in these passages, but it fell spectacularly flat. Would not recommend."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"In about two weeks time, Charles Wycombe, Earl of Billington, must find a bride and be married to her. Not an easy job when one is NOT in London. Even if he were, he can't stand the young simpering, just out of the schoolroom chits!Miss Eleanor Lyndon needs to find a new home as fast as possible. Her father, the town vicar, has deceided to remarry. However the woman he has picked, Mrs. Foxglove a widow, can not stand Ellie. Actually they both feel the same about each other. INTRUDER!!!One day Charles literally falls at Ellie's feel, he sees the perfect answer to both of their pressing problems. They should just get married. After all, Ellie is the first marriagble girl he has come across and can actually stand being in the same room with her alone for more than ten minutes. Not to mention that she really isn't asking for that much when they marry. That is until she informs Charles that they won't consumate the marriage until she's ready to do so. But surly that won't take very long will it? No woman has ever been able to resist his charms. However, he's never wanted any woman like he wants her. And the worst part is, is that he can't figure out why or how he can want someone the way he wants her.Mrs. Quinn has done a great job with this book! It is loaded with excitment from cover to cover. Whether it's abduction you like or suprise kitchen fires, you'll find it all in this book! I'm not quite sure I have ever read a book with more excitment in it than this one has! And what was really great was that the events were spread out throughout the entire book. Which then in turn made the book a total page turner! Also what was nice, was that even though this book was in connection to EVERYTHING AND THE MOON, you don't have to read that book to understand this one. Mrs. Quinn does refer to the other book but also explains it to an extent not to bore the reader who already read the other one. I give this book 5 stars because it really was THAT good! And I will recommend this series to many people!!!"},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"The heroine was probably written as a smart, independent but spirited young lady. Instead, she comes off as a shrew who constantly bickers with the hero. I just didn't see what his attraction would be to her. And likewise, he came off as just wanting to jump in the sack instead of taking his time to get to know his new bride. I usually live Julia Quinn books, but there was just way too much bickering in this book for me! Avoid at all costs."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"The first page of this book is a note from author Julia Quinn in which she explains that this is a \\"marriage of convenience\\" story, the type of story she's always loved and wanted to write. I, myself, am a big fan of those stories, so I was looking forward to reading Quinn's take on a classic plot. The plot left me a bit deflated, and I'm sure if any other author attempted this story, it would have earned fewer stars.Ellie is minding her own business when Charles Wycombe, Earl of Billington, falls out of a tree on top of her. Ellie doctors his ankle and helps him home. Along the way, he proposes to her. Why not? He must marry in the next two weeks, or he loses his fortune. Ellie, on the other hand, is being hassled by her soon-to-be stepmother, who gives her two choices: work to earn her keep or agree to marry one of the men she has doomed acceptable (a horrid list, to be sure). Both Charles and Ellie stand to gain much from a marriage of convenience, and so the two are soon married.In the rest of the book, the two get to know each other better, discover a plot to kill Charles and steal his title and wealth, and of course, fall in love. In the end, it's very predictable and a bit frustrating. Charles and Ellie fight constantly. She behaves like a teenager instead of the independent woman she supposedly is. There are, however, beautiful moments that make it all worthwhile, along with Quinn's talent for witty dialogue. Fans of Quinn's will likely find it moderately enjoyable, but not quite on par with some of her better works."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"It makes me truly sad to give a two star review to a book written by my favorite author, but i honestly felt discontent with this book. BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN, appears to have been written by a rookie in the genre, and not by an author who brought us wonderful stories like THE DUKE AND I, THE VISCOUNT WHO LOVED ME, AND ROMANCING MISTER BRIDGERTON. I finished the book just because it was a Julia Quinn's piece, but i have never been so disappointed with a story before. The main character, Ellie, was an annoying girl, she appeared angry through out the whole book, and Charles just never really stood out. Ellie wanted to have her way (no highway option) all the time, and Charles just wanted to have sex (plain and simple). The story line, was very dull, nothing to look forward to, also i must mention something another fellow reviewer wrote about, what is up with them getting injured in every chapter? my goodness how annoying it got.!!!!!! I love Julia's writing, i think it's superb, no wonder she is my favorite, which is why i would put this book where i may never see it again."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"This book was not up to Julia Quinn's usual standard.

I'd recommend you read it only if you have absolutely nothing else to do."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"If you are in the mood to read, there is no better way to spend an evening than with JQuinn. Her books are populated with the most interesting, funny, quirky people. &quot;Brighter...&quot; is brighter than most other books."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I've read all of Quinn's books and I usually like them enough to give them a 4 to 5 rating, but this one is just plain boring.Although the idea seemed decent(the main characters marry before they really know each other), it was just poorly executed. Charles and Ellie get married within first 50 pages of the book and the rest 330 pages or so is just constant fighting. In the last couple of pages they do 'realize' that they actually love each other and they live happily ever after.I know that Quinn's trademark is humor, but it seemed that it was just overly done in this book. There is no real romance,no real character exploration, no real plot, no building up etc., just (cheap) laughs and some sex."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I must say, as someone who has always enjoyed Julia Quinn's writing, this one came across wrong from the very start. The characters are not believable, let alone likable, the plot overused, and frankly, a \\"hero\\" who is drunk off his feet the entire first chapter was more than enough to turn me off the entire thing."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I loved this book. The main characters Ellie and Charles were made for eachother. I love the fact that Ms. Quinn allowed her heroine have such a strong backbone. I hate books that make the heroine too reliable on their men. The couple were always supportive of eachother. The lists that they put together were very funny.

I did not want to put it down."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I loved Ellie! She is so smart and sassy! I love the fact that she didn't just fall into bed with Charles, who needed the lesson. I also thought Charles was highly appealing. He seemed like an overgrown boy, singleminded in his endeavor, but he came around. I won't forget Ellie or Charles, or Judith either. I'm still curious as to what was stuck in the chimney though...Thanks Julia! Another keeper!"},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"This is Regency romance at its worst. The characters are unappealing and unrealistic. Can you imagine a lady, especially a vicar's daughter,chattering to a stranger familiarly,cutting off his boot from his injured foot and letting him lean on her shoulder to limp back to his carriage?I was particularly upset by the scene in which the heroine walked in heavy rain by herself to the Earl's home. She turned me off by not only looking bedraggled and dishevelled, but by seeking out a bachelor in his home to discuss their marriage.She even changed into his married sister's clothes. No lady of good upbringing in polite society at that time would ever stoop herself or be brazen enough to compromise herself in this way. The whole story sounds unconvincing because there is no chemistry between the Earl and the lady.I got some very enjoyable books based on readers' reviews but I didn't get it right this time. Bad luck for me"},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"This for me is the worst Julia Quinn novel I have ever read. As much as I love Julia Quinn, I'm now ashamed of recommending all her books as a guarantee, this one fell so short of all my expectations.Fortunately the first Novel I read from Julia Quinn was the Duke and I, and after starting out so high I felt the need to get all of her books. But starting with the last two (Francesa and Hyancith Bridgerton) Bridgerton series, this book and the one preceeding it my disappointment in her writing skills started to mount.My biggest problem with all the books mentioned is Ms Quinn's formular of letting the Hero and Heroine argue in witless banter, for PAGES and PAGES at a time in the most juvenille manner unbeffiting two adults. Moreover these arguments have nothing contributory to the story line.This is the most disappointing read of all, there was no chemistry between Ellie and Charles, the plot was weak and need I mention again the annoying bickering between the two just gave me headaches.I have not yet read minx, how to marry a marquis or it's sister novel and they are all in my personal library as I type. I have no desire to read them. Hopefully if I'm ever in the mood to kill myself with boredom, I'll give a go at them, till then I'll stick with the likes of Gaelen Foley, Sandra Heath, Johanna lindsey and Rhonda Woodward."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I have read almost all of Julia Quinn's books and this one tops them all.

While Everything And The Moon fought against social norms and stereotypes, this story did the total opposite and instead made it seem like norms and hierarchical structures where indifferent. In addition, I think the emotional development wasn't as strongly created as Victoria's story - of course it wouldn't be as this is more focused on convenience rather than a struggles against all odds for true love."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I love Julia Quinn. She does a great job keeping the reader interested all the way through the book. I always know it will have a happy ending."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"After reading all of her books some of them seem to blend together, and this book was one of them. If you like her as an author you would like the book. If you are looking for a new romance author to read she is good. Stories take place in the past, usually poor girl, or working girl, or girl who has a problem meets a man that can help, or loves her, or wants to take care of her. They are an easy read that are enjoyable."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"Reviewed by Suzanne & posted at Under the Covers Book Blog3.5 Stars'Husbands don't grow on trees...but apparently they fall from them, especially when roaringingly drunk. This is something that Miss Ellie Lyndon finds out the hard way when Charles Wycombe, Earl of Billington, falls from an oak tree and straight on her toes, then not long after proceeds to make an offer of marriage. Although completely foxed Charles thinks the very prickly but lovely Miss Lyndon will make a perfect wife, especially as he only has a few weeks to find one before he loses his fortune, but even he is taken by surprise when she accepts his offer and the marriage takes place. But as time progresses, they find that this marriage of convenience could be much more then they ever expected.I find it so hard to rate a Julia Quinn book, I believe I have, without fail, enjoyed every single one I've ever laid my hands on. I know exactly what I will find when I draw back the cover of one of her romances; a quirky lovable heroine; a charming and cheeky hero and dialogue that is bound to leave me with a massive smile on my face, as well a sweet love story that is pure and brilliant brain candy. These books are never going to change the world, but they are well written and whilst I am reading them I can't put them down and I always enjoy it. So that leaves me with the problem, what shall I rate it?I decided 3.5 feathers is best, Brighter than the Sun made me laugh and Charles and Ellie were so adorable together and their banter was witty and well written. But, will I remember this book in 6 months time and be desparate to reread it? Probably not. But don't let this put you off, it is a great book, it is the marshmallow of the book world it is fun, fluffy, sweet and would go great with a barbeque on the beach!*Complimentary copy of the ARC provided by Publisher in exchange for an honest review."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"After reading a lot of historical romances lately it was nice to have one set in the country instead of London. Great characters and secondary characters."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"Making due allowance for it being an early novel [1997] I can rate it a 2 star. It does exhibit JQ's gift with dialogue which on its own hovers near a five star.However there are innumerable sloppy parts where one feels almost insulted that the author and her editor have failed in commonsense.Firstly anyone who has read the first book in this series will be left wondering why the heroines dear sister has left her as a menial drudge to her father whilst departing to warmer climes for several months with her baby and her husband Lord Macclesfield. One cannot but feel that a decent sister would have either paid for servants for her father, and certainly taken her 23 year old sister away to a role which might give her chances of marrying. A more glaring hole in a story is hard to imagine.On more practical grounds. The most obvious.- Can drunks climb 15 ft up oak trees?- Whiskey is not the drink of gentleman until 1880's.- Birds do not hatch broods in the autumn.- Poor widow villagers are unlikly to have bottles of brandy. Gin was widespread for the poorer people.- The villain is hardly likely to sabotage a ladder on the off chance the hero may climb it to a villagers roof- Sending servants to the local town to buy berries to make jam just would not happen. In autumn the hedgerows are over-run with blackberries and there would be no effective market for them. What the locals could not afford easily would be sugar and that is what needed to be bought.If I seem slightly hard on JQ perhaps consider that it is her editor who is paid presumably to stop crass errors. James Thurber, the humourist, claims he read a French western novel where the Indians pursued the settlers into the fort. All was saved when the drawbridge was raised in their faces. Yes quite!"},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"The two main characters, Ellie and Charles, argue and bicker with all the maturity and absurdity one would expect of 12-year olds. Occasional wit made some of the dialog fun, but overall, it was an eye-roll. The book was pathetically short on plot. And what little it had encompassed the cliche elements of \\"someone\\" trying to create accidents designed to kill the Earl. Charles is forced to marry Ellie, a complete stranger, to save his inheritance per his father's will. And, oh my, how coincidental that Ellie has a soon-to-be stepmother who is forcing her out of her father's home and into marriage with anyone who will have her. I do enjoy some of Julia Quinn's books, but this one was not at all credible and was a waste of time to read."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I have enjoyed several other novels by Ms. Quinn but couldn't force myself to get past the first 200 pages of this one. I thought the beginning was interesting, but the vast majority of the book so far has involved the protagonists arguing with each other or falling down. A lot. Clumsy characters and clumsy writing."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"This book had a pretty good story but it was kind of lame. They didn't really seem all that compatable. There should have been more time spent on building their relationship instead of showing how well the can make each other mad. The romance was not there and neither were the love scenes. I have like other books of her, but this was a let down."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I think this book is great. I read it over and over. The romance between the characters is sweet and just left me sighing in the end. I liked this book better than Everything and the Sun. I think in general, this is a cute story. It's nothing intense or passionate like the other books I've read but it's still lighthearted and sweet."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"then this is the book for you. I usually love Ms. Quinn's books. This one was well written and witty. The only problem is that through the many incredibly stupid &quot;mishaps&quot; that move the plot along, all the two main characters do is argue, bicker, argue and fight. I read to escape this sort of childish bickering. Also, these characters behaved completely wrong for the genre.The book had some very bright moments, but overall, it gave me a sunburn."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"This humerous and light-hearted novel was the third book I've read by Ms. Quinn, and it doesn't dissapoint me one bit. Keeping with her knack for witty dialogue and compellingly fun characters, she has created a wonderful book. I think the conversations between the hero and the heroine were the parts I liked the best. The heroine is refreshing, as she isn't annoying and can be actually quite funny at times. The hero is &quot;a compulsive list-maker,&quot; and some of the lists that he writes are hillarious. There wasn't a single part of the book where I found I disliked him, because he really does come across as a laid-back and wickedly charming guy (If only men were really like that...). In all, this book is one that I could recommend and be fairly sure you'll like it.Be sure to read all of Julia Quinn's books, they're all very entertaining."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"Victoria Lyndon, our heroine from Everything and the Moon, has a younger sister Eleanor, who is equally independent and feisty. Ellie is walking in the countryside near her home one day when a very handsome and very drunk man literally falls into her lap from a tree.Charles Wycombe, the rakish Earl of Billington, must marry before his upcoming thirtieth birthday or lose his inheritance. When he meets the vivacious and outspoken Ellie, he realizes that this very attractive miss is the answer to his prayers. No, he has no intention to actually love her nor any other woman. But she would make a suitable enough bride and mother to the heir he must produce while he goes on living his dissolute life just as before.Ellie is very attracted to the Earl but would never agree to such an outrageous and hasty proposal except that her soon to be stepmother promises to make her life a misery. Also, by marrying she will gain access to the 300 pounds she's made through prudent investments in her father's name, and Ellie is a wonderful businesswoman.So Charles and Ellie marry-and the fun continues as, amidst a host of mysterious accidents, they come to care for each other. Secondary characters are pretty good, except the impertinent and demanding little Judith, who fails to come off with the charm she's clearly supposed to have.There are a lot of problems with Brighter Than the Sun. For the first two hundred plus pages, Ellie is nearly always angry. This gets very tiring and seems childish, making her somewhat unlikable. In addition, Charles and Ellie constantly getting injured or sick really starts to wear on the reader. Some plot variation is desperately needed, especially some real action to balance all the domesticity. The identity and motives of the two antagonists is apparent from the very beginning, so their revelation doesn't provide any excitement or much needed plot twists.Everything is so predictable, and the sameness between the protagonists here and those in Quinn's earlier books starts to wear. While her main characters look physically different and have just a few key personality differences, they are all at the core the same. It is hard to believe that every principal character would be witty in the same way. Not every protagonist, for example, should speak in understatement. Quinn's characters need to be more distinctively drawn.Still, the last hundred and fifty pages of dialogue between Charles and Ellie is mostly fun, and their penchant to produce lists in also fun. If only their cute repartee were a little different from the cute repartee in her other novels-i.e., revealing of a distinct character. In addition, the tone here is so light that their emotions are not explored to a satisfying depth. Quinn has a lot of talent, and I hope she can find a way to broaden more in subsequent novels."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I was looking forward to this book based upon the first book I read &quot;How to Marry a Marquis&quot; from Ms. Quinn. This book fell very flat in terms of plot - no intrigue, no chase, and no thrill. However, I am still willing to consider reading other books since I thought her dialogue was well written and clever."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"This book grabbed me from the first page with its sharp, amusing dialogue and warm characters - and I couldn't put it down until the end! Ellie and Charles constantly kept me smiling, and do on every subsequent reading. A great book by my favourite author - Julia Quinn's books never disappoint, and all are &quot;keepers&quot; on my shelves. Brighter than the Sun is an absorbing, charming romance without the dark, tortured plotlines some historical novels find necessary. A pleasure to read from start to finish!"},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. The pace is fast and keeps your interest all the way through. I like my female lead characters to have spunk and hold their own against the male characters in the book. No missish misses for me thank you. Julia Quinn writes a well written story with plenty of laughs and very interesting plots. Julia Quinn has a wicked sense of humour which I really appreciate and I'd recommend her books to anyone who enjoyes a good laugh."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I just loved this book! It was so funny. I found myself laughing out loud throughout the entire book! I loved how light-hearted things were throughout most of the book. It was rather refreshing reading a romance that was more on the side of pure fun than stiff seriousness. Although for those who have not read this novel the characters do find themselves in a serious situation at the end.You've just got to read it! I'm having trouble now deciding weither BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN is now my favorite Julia Quinn novel or if it's still THE DUKE AND I.~*sigh*~ Desisions... desisions...Thanks again Julia! As always your books are wonderful!"},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"By the end of the first half of the book - I was ready for the ending. I didn't feel any chemistry between the two characters. I have read and enjoyed the books of Ms. Quinn', esp. The Duke and I, but this one was not up to snuff."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I was going to give this book 1 star but added an extra one, because for all the deficiencies, JQ really IS great writer. Her dialogue is witty and positively sparkles.That said- Ellie is an annoying shrew and the hero Charles was like every other hero in every other JQ book. And I have read them ALL. (With the exception of Phillip I guess, in Sir Phillip with Love but I digress. )JQ uses as her plot,one of my pet peeves with Regency romances. We have a simple country Miss, with no prospects and no funds (that she can legally get her hands on , since we ARE in the 19th century where women were not equals).She and the Charles- a Duke- enter a marriage of convenience yet somehow she wants to control their relationship. She made a clear stipulation that Charles should not kiss/try to seduce her...because he does not 'love' her... What is up with superimposing 21st century romantic ideals in a mariage of convenience ?!Where does LOVE come in a marraige of convenience?And why would Ellie think she can refuse her husband the marital bed ? And why would he agree ??Who are these people , and why are they masquerading as Regency people ?Gah!"},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I agree with the other review. The heroine was a shrew of all shrews. I could only read 54 pages of this novel it was so bad, irritating and grating on my nerves. I think most people read regency romance novels to fall in love with both the heroine and hero. This book is written like a script rather than a novel. All the descriptions of the heroine Harrumphing, stomping her feet and stomping off made me think of a child. The heroine did not seem very intelligent so I found it hard to believe she made money on the stock exchange. The hero wasn't any smarter than her. So maybe they do deserve each other. Why was he drunk in a tree? Just sounds really stupid not someone I would want to marry. The dialogue between these two was so irritating and grating. In fact out of the 5 or 6 Quinn novels I have read the dialogue is always the most irritating and gets in the way of potentially good stories. The heroine drops him a couple of times while he is injured and then when they are engaged he is so stupid he crashes their curricle and while he is lying injured she walks off in a huff leaving him for dead. Surely this man can do better than this shrew. I can't imagine why he would want this shrew of a woman. She also gets in to an argument about the color of her hair with him. She says it is red and he says it is strawberry blond. She gets angry with him for calling it strawberry blond so he does the gentlemanly thing and concedes that it is red and then she is upset that he didn't put up a fight and call it strawberry blond. Again, why is he marrying her? Oh and then she decides they shouldn't consummate their marriage but he is welcome to try to seduce her. Even though I have not read further than 54 pages I have a feeling this shrew will refuse him the marriage bed and then get very jealous and upset when she thinks he is running off to his mistress or paying attention to other women. She is the type of shrew who would do that. Ugh. If you want a good marriage of convenience story go to Mary Balogh or some of the other writers of the 80's and 90's."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"Some of the reviews on here run hot and cold. I love Julia Quinn and also love a good 'marriage of convienence' story. Yes there was a lot of bickering between Ellie and Charles but I found it entertaining most of the time. I laughed a lot during this book.The most refreshing part of the entire book was Charles. In most of these stories, the rake gets married with preconceived notions of having a wife that will look the other way and leave him alone. Then they find themselves falling in love with thier wife and do the craziest things. They run from them. I read one book (which was horrible) where he wouldnt talk to her during the day because that might stop him from falling in love. But in this one, he doesnt try to avoid it. He just deals with it. There are no major games going on.Ellie has her moments of childishness, but overall she treats thier relationship with a lot of maturity as does Charles. I realized after I finished the book, I didnt know much about the backround of the characters. You dont really have any idea what Charles' childhood was like but honestly I didnt care. I was entertained enough that I am considering re-reading the book some day."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"Eleanor Lyndon is minding her own business when Charles Wycombe, the Earl of Bilington falls out of a tree very drunk. Both Charles and Ellie are trying to deal with there own problem when they realize by getting married will slove their them. They marry but they don't really know each other. But dark forces that could end it for them.\\"Brighter than the Sun\\" is the first book that I read by Julia Quinn and I really liked it. Ms. Quinn gives her readers charming characters and romance.

I loved it."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"That's about all I can say about this book. It had a few moments, but nothing to keep me interested through a whole book. I've read one of her other books and loved it. It's a good thing this wasn't the first of Ms. Quinn's books I've read because if it were, I never would have bought another."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"This book was very funny! It made want to turn the page and read on forever!! A very clever story that makes you feel as if you know the charactes personally. I think that it was very interesting, but not as great as Julia's To Catch an Heiress."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"\\"Brighter Than the Sun\\" was as cornballish as they come. The whole book went pretty much like this \\"Yes you do...No you didn't...Ohhhh why I never! You want to kiss me?!\\" Save yourself some time, reread the last sentence but let Ellie and Charles take turns saying it and abracadabra, you've just read a novel in record time.I'm a big fan of Quinns; 5 of her books are included in my short list of only 44; 5 Star \\"All-time favorite reads\\", but goodness the last 2 or 3 I've read by her have been snoozers with a capital S, and with only a few in my Quinn collection left to read I have to say I'm really not looking forward to them.Instead of this one, try...*The Viscount Who Loved Me*The Duke And I*Romancing Mister Bridgerton*When He Was Wicked (My Favorite!!!)*How to Marry a Marquis"},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I have read all of the Bridgerton series, and a few others (such as To Marry a Marquis), and LOVED all of them. This one I found extremely disappointing. No chemistry - at least on her part - and as others have said, it is just not realistic in terms of behaviour in the period. I never would have pegged this as a Julia Quinn book. I guess I would recommend buying it based on the many reviews that are far more positive than mine (and about 3 or so others who felt the same way!)"},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"The main characters Ellie and Charles were witty dialogue and fun characters. They had me smiling quite often. It was good to read a book where both characters were equal in strength of personality. I hope more of her books are as good. The added quick mysteries just added that little extra. A Book to add to your list to read!"},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"I found myself laughing out loud in some chapters....very light-hearted. I have read several other books by Julia Quinn and they all have been entertaining."},{"Title":"Brighter Than the Sun","review":"If you like romances that make you laugh, cry, and touch your heart you'll love this one. You will never want to put this one down, or want it to end. Its enchanting, and will keep you spell bound to the last page."},{"Title":"Visual C++ 6 Unleashed","review":"This book provides a clear, comprehensive, yet resonably in-depth introduction of typical topics about Visual C++/MFC programming, with plenty of code examples, including advanced topics such as Internet programming, HTML support, STL, MultiThreading, Database Programming, COM, ActiveX, ATL. Overall it is a very good book."},{"Title":"Visual C++ 6 Unleashed","review":"This is probable one of the most incoherent books on programming that I've seen in a while. I am an experienced C++ and Java developer, but I have never used Visual C++ before. When I buy a book I expect both a coherent explanation of examples, and when buying a book this size and cost, also a thorough, understandable reference section. This book provided neither of these.The examples were incoherent, there was very little continuity, it jumped around. Also, there was no easy way to find out about certain functions or tasks. I highly recommend you don't buy this book."},{"Title":"Visual C++ 6 Unleashed","review":"I have not found much use for this book. It provides a rapid-fire introduction to many VC++ topics, but not much more. Several important details are left out, there are quite a few errors througout the book, and the examples are of no real value. I have tried to use the book as a quick reference many times, but have given up entirely and gone quickly to Richter, Swanke, Prosise, or Solomon. I was able to use it recently to add some wieght to a linoleum patch I applied to the master bathroom floor - no kidding.Knowing what I do now, I wouldn't waste my money on this book. Instead, check out Prosise MFC 2nd Ed. (indispensible), MFC Internals (misc. authors), Jeff Richter's (superb) Win2k references, Swanke's VC++ MFC by Example, and Solomon's Inside W2K. Each text mentioned is a must-have, IMHO, with special mention of Swanke's MFC by Example, which has earned me a couple of &quot;cool, how did you do that&quot;s from fellow developers.Hope this helps and good luck."},{"Title":"Visual C++ 6 Unleashed","review":"This book has lots of errors in PART IV, and author show you nothing, MSDN reference has all of them and useful, The examples are trivial. It is not for beginner or experienced reader. Professional MFC with Visual C++ 5(wrox)is much better than this one."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"TY for Taylor Caldwell. Mooooore please. How about Grandmother & The Priests and especially some of her older works. Thank You again"},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"This was a sweeping masterpiece of 1st century Rome and early Christianity. The novel follows Lucanus (St. Luke) from his early years as the son of a freedman (former slave) to his eventual encounter with Mary, the mother of Christ, and his writing of the Gospel of Luke. Taylor Caldwell paints a very human portrait of the evangelist--including loves found and lost, his adoption by a Roman patrician who mourns the lost virtues of the republic, and his sporadic encounters with men who know about or have seen the Man purported to be the Messiah. As a physician, Lucanus fights to stave off death and wrestles with the concept of a Deity who could allow such suffering. It details Luke's quest for the \\"unknown god\\" of the Greeks and his growing disillusionment with the hedonism of pagan Rome. His journey culminates with the discovery of the God-Man who conquered death itself. This is truly a novel for our time. Both 1st century Rome and today's \\"post-Christian\\" era are amazingly similar in their decadence...as is the Answer to it. Must reading for anyone who wishes to steep themselves in Christian history."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"This book is to be read and re-read!!!

I think that this is one of the best, most well-written book that I have read, and I look forward to reading more of her books!"},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"This is an account of the life of Lucanus the physician, better known as St. Luke. Ms. Caldwell has an uncanny ability to make the character so real he almost leaps off the page; his struggles regarding his personal beliefs/disbeliefs in God may very well mirror your own. An excellent book for anyone interested in learning about the life of this particular saint"},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"I thought that this book was extremely well-written and captivating. When I picked it up for the first time, I thought that I would get stuck in the middle and not want to finish it but. . .let's just say that I have it as one of my most read books. This book showed my a side of St.Luke that I never would have thought of before, and it always inspires me to live for my Heavenly Father. My favorite parts are the miracles that Lucanus performed and when he found Arieh again. Fabulous book!!"},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"Good book.

I would recommend the book to anyone interested in either subject."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"Taylor Caldwell is possibly one of the best writers I have ever read, and I read a lot. She writes of different times in history, yet they read as if they are written of today's world. Her books keep me reading for hours, until I am done with any of her books, a cannot put down read.This books is another of such great reads, and I cannot reccomend it highly enough. It is of the period that I love best, the times of Christ, and of His works and the people who knew Him closest, although with Luke, it was word of mouth. It has given my faith a new energy, and given me a reason to read even more of Taylor Caldwell's books.Reading this writer's books is a pleasure, and a trip back in time as well as a history lesson, or perhaps many lessons in history. And in many ways, lessons in today's world, and todays world affairs.I can only say that I will want to buy more of her books, and read everything she ever wrote. It is a pity that she is not still alive and still writing, for the world is not the same without writers such as Taylor Caldwell."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"This book was the most complete story on the Luke who wrote at least 40% of the New Testament in the Bible."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"I am exceptionally well educated in the historical material of this book, I believe that it could be called historically factual for the most part. It is presented in a manner that keeps me listening way beyond what is good for my health. I just can't put it down and I am listening to it for the third time in a year. I have it unabridged on tape from Recorded books and it wasn't cheap. I paid 15.00 for the used book so as to be able to go thru and make notes for further research.

Taylor Caldwell is one of my favorite authors and all of her books are worth taking the time to read"},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"I was looking for some contextual reading to help bring the Bible to life. It feels like \\"magic\\" sometimes and the people in it seem like \\"characters\\" and not people who shared this same earth. Well, this book did that. This novel about Luke - whether fictional or partly true, is so moving, so real. I love his struggle. I love that his emotions as a physician back then are so close to my emotions as a physician today. He seems so human to me- and clearly blessed and called by God. I love his \\"human -ness\\" and God's \\"Godness\\". I love how he misunderstood God and had such conflicting feelings about life. I love God's understanding, patience and gentleness with him. I love how he crosses path with people (formerly know to me as \\"characters\\") in the Bible. I am not sure what type of impact it will have on someone who is not a physician, but as one, a very \\"ordinary\\" one , compared to Luke, It's the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"This novel deserves to be placed perhaps not among the best pearls of great catholic literature, but as a book really worth reading because of its spiritual message and because it is very entertaining one. That 572 page brick invites to a very exciting journey in time, at the coming dawn of the Roman Empire and the very beginnings of Christianity. S:T Luke, or as he is called here Lucanus, is a Greek gentile, born of freed slaves. He is a physician and wonderworker. We follow him on his path of life, in his search for the ultimate truth. Lucanus is in his early childhood initiated into some secrets meaning of which eventually is revealed to him later. Prior to that our hero goes through many sometimes very dramatic episodes. He tries to escape his destiny and denies the call of God in his soul. Overhelmed by the body of evidence which he experienced through his very adventurous life he finds finaly the ultimate centre of all his passions and longings. The book continues in S:T Lukes Gospel and Acts of the apostles.This work is written with a glow charasteristic to Taylor Caldwell. The style seem quite often naive and overstuffedwith details describing the surroundings. Maybe it was the author's intention to be historical, but sometimes it can be too much of that kind of credibility. Definietly recommendable book for both children and adult reading. The catholics will like it, and perhaps very many physicians too."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"The story of St. Luke, one that is so believable that it probably is true.

I read it in under a week. It is a wonderful story, not overly religious. A fascinating look at life 2000 years ago."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"This book is REALLY awesome. I like how Taylor makes St. Luke ( Lucanus) like a real person instead of some holy guy that you can't relate yourself to. It's full of Israelites, Romans, and Lucanus' quest to find who he is and what God calls him to do. It's truely hard to put down and is a beautiful story. I'm 13 and I reccomend this book to kids my age and up. If you want a really good book to read... this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"This is one of my absolute favorite books.

Fascinating!"},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"It is a classical for me. I have read it several times, and continue to be amazed at the exact description of historic details of places and people.

It is literary jewel for which I always have an special place on my library."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"I read this book 23 years ago and this fall I read it again. It moved me 23 years ago and did so again this year. It is a glorious book about the life of St. Luke and it is a wonderful book to read if you are struggling with anything, not just your faith. The love stories also stayed with me over the years. Taylor Caldwell also shows that not much has changed in politics and society over the centuries. A must read!"},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"I have read this book 3 times. The first time I read it I was going through a major life crisis.

Caldwell's gifted illumination of the life of St. Luke is as compelling as any from the biblical texts and probably just as inspired.

I think what I enjoyed the most about them was that the authors' skills placed a human into the skeletal narrative of the bible's description of these people.The narrative, while entirely fiction, does a good job of describing the plausible experiences of a bible writer's life.As Luke was author of the gospel of Luke, and the book of Acts of the Apostles, and his academic experience was that of a medical doctor, he was aptly suited to live such a life."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"I had read Dear and Glorious Physican many years ago and decided to reread it as our Bible study group was studying St Luke's writings.

Taylor Caldwell did a massive amount of research spanning years to cobble together this narrative. By adding her own touches of dialogue, it becomes both moving and fascinating at the same time. St Luke never saw Christ and spent forty years battling God before finally coming to His Son.I think anyone could enjoy this book whether a \\"believer\\" or not. The glimpses into Rome and Alexandria and the Holy Land for that period make it a historical joyride.St Luke's story couldn't be in better hands."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"I got this book for my son who is a Peace Officer 20+ yrs.

The story of Saint Luke is a tale of love and compassion."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"I really liked \\"Dear and Glorious Physician\\" because it made the Holy Land and the people that lived there more realistic for me. I can relate more to what they lived through and how they yearned for a better life. It amazed me how much Luke sought God before really knowing him. I like how Taylor Caldwell put the story together so that I could learn of the times and get more of an understanding of the life of Luke.I highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"I picked this book up at random. It was sitting on a coffee table and I knew not how it got there. I have great appreciation for Taylor Caldwell, both her work and the exceptional life she lived. In classic Caldwell style she paints every scene so as to place the reader in it. Caldwell is surely 20th a century rival to the likes of Hugo. You can actually smell the pomegranate in the Roman gardens while reading her book. You get a real sense from this book that the wealthy of Rome had many of the luxuries of today's modern man. The missing mechanical inventions of the 19th and 20th centuries were simply replaced with slaves and servants. Lucanus, the Physician and main character was the son of a Greek freedman. From that perspective the reader gains a purely neutral view on the strife between Jew and Greek or Roman gentile. Caldwell never speaks directly to it; however the reader, late in the book, begins to sense that in too many cases that the Jews though good people were their own worst enemy when it came to integrating with other cultures.As the story the story goes: Lucanus the young boy of a freed Greek slave still serving the son of his one time master Diodoris was a prodigy philosopher, though after reading his scripture not a very good writer, aspiring to be a physician. His mentors early on were a Roman tribune, a Greek record keeper, and a Greek tutor. The first two were both frauds in their association with their social setting which was a fraud in itself. In spite of those mentors, Lucanus pursues the one unknown God of the Jewish religion.Mid way through the book, as Lucanus prepares to leave the Alexandria school of medicine, a graduate Physician, his Jewish teacher bids him farewell and tells a story of a boy born under a star in the East. The teacher predicts that Lucanus shall seek this boy and its only then that this reader of the book has the epiphany; Lucanus - Luke. It allows the author to make Luke an objective critic. An interesting twist of events exposes the Jews as the first to discriminate against the black man, by Caldwell's reference to the legend of HAM. It is also the Jew who doesn't recognize Christ as a messiah but is the Jew who is the early physician/scientist. Karmaiclly it is the Jew who has witnessed a millennium of Diaspora and its discrimination. In a few places the book Caldwell implies that the fate of the 'Diaspora' Jew was of his own making.While early on Caldwell uses Lucanus to examine a merciless and hateful God, later she introduces the evil man as an alternative. Within the evil man is greed and envy where it's envy playing the evil role over a wealthy man who found his wealth through generosity? Generosity is hinted as being the channel to wealth as a generous person is a good steward of money. This reader was receptive to this hint because of outside influence. It is at this point that the light begins to come into Lucanus's life that perhaps it is not the vengeful God, but vengeful man at the root of his depressionCaldwell provides a narrative, through the voice of Lucanas's brother Priscus, the Roman Captain who supervised Christ's crucifixion the telling of that event. The story rivals all I had previously read in any Catholic program that I was raised in. This mainly speaks poorly upon my study. Lucanus's reaction is a revelation to the tormenting he had bore through his life. It was his 'born again' moment where, albeit only implied by Caldwell, that Lucanus became a Christian. Interestingly enough in that moment Lucanus tells his brother of the resurrection purely out of internal conjecture. Lucanus in Caldwell's book had no fact or word from anyone that Christ had risen.The first theme of the book is the search to define God.

What a great writer! Her work is in such great detail and the descriptions of places, people and events is beyond anything I have ever read. No wonder it took her 25 years to complete it. The human and spiritual insights just grab your mind and drive you to re-read some parts. They are \\"glorious\\" in and of themselves. I wish I had read this book when it came out in 1959, but I was far too young to have appreciated it. At 67, I love it! Caldwell Taylor is the best! I found myself standing with Lucanus in every scene. The spiritual underpinning from the start through the middle to the climactic close was so powerful that it made you sense the spiritual power grow in yourself - overpowering story of St. Luke."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"...a truly absorbing read. Caldwell shines in immersing us in the life of Luke and his era. I recommend it to anyone Christian or otherwise."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"Just finished reading this thought-provoking novel by Taylor Caldwell, a favorite of mine for a long time. The detail can be a bit excruciating;however, it is amazing that so much research has gone into the life and times of Luke. Certain passages on the rights of women were a bit hard to read in 2009, but the opinions must have accurately reflected the opinion in the Roman Empire. Love the politics and the deeply spiritual emphasis. It is a good read for those who love historical fiction. Inspired me to read Luke's own writings in the Book of Luke and Acts."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"Luke, like all of Taylor Caldwells heroes, is a well developed, multi-faceted character. This book is not an easy read, but it fills the senses with the color, corruption and intrigue of the ancient world. I am a Christian and after reading this book, I had a broader view of the context of Scripture at the time of Christ, regardless of whether every single fact is accurate. This is a challenging, beautifully wrought book!"},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"I read this book 10 or 15 years ago, and it has been always a source of peace and tranquility in my life. I really recommend it, as well as many of the books of Taylor Cadwell. Her narrative style, contents and knowledge of human feelings and behavior is great. I have read almost all the books of her."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"That's how I felt when I finally finished this book. It was LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG. And easy to put down. And difficult to pick up again.

Christ draws the reader to Himself today even as he did Luke over 2000 years ago. After reading this book go to the gospel of Luke and Acts in the Bible and read one of Luke's own letters. Luke was a physician by profession but he was primarily an evangelist of the good news of Jesus Christ. MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BOOK! A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"It was in great condition and made an excellent gift for my grandmother"},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"Taylor Caldwell was a very talented writer. Reading a book about Luke the Evangelist I expected more solid information instead of speculation."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"I read this book years ago, as a teenager struggling with my own inner demons. It was one of the few books that made me cry, there were so many beautifully crafted scenes of humanity and redemption that resonated with what I was going through at that point in my life. Luke's mixed feelings and sometimes disdain for his father echoed some of the same feelings that I had for my parents, and woken me to the shame of having such unworthy feelings. Luke's lost of faith echoed my own inner struggles for identity, my constant feelings of inadequacy and unworthiness, and my then slowly dying faith in Christianity. My favorite scene in the whole book was a little story Mary told Luke: Lucifer, the Morningstar (portrayed here as an infinitely beautiful angel whose perfection is only marred by his own pride), took a clump of soil from the earth and showed it mockingly to Jesus, indicating that everything Jesus strives for is nothing more than dirt. Jesus then took up another clump of soil, and a plant grew and blossomed in his hand. Somewhere along the way, during those difficult years, I had also come to realise that this world, this life I've been given, is full of beauty and worthy things to struggle for and cherish, if only I would open my eyes and see them. I loved this book. BUY IT if you wish to read a fictionalised but touching account of St. Luke's life."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"This novel is reminiscent of those that James Michener or Coleen McCullough write--that is, big, sweeping novels with historical content. Caldwell really brings Luke to life, from his beginnings as the young son of a greek freedman in the Roman Empire, to his ultimate search for Christ. Luke's spiritual search begins as a young child and continues throughout the Roman Empire, from a meeting with mysterious Chaldean priest, an encounter with Emperor Tiberius, up to his meeting with Mary, mother of Jesus. The background makes the Roman empire and the holy land in that time come to life. If you like historical novels, you can't go wrong with this one."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"This is not only a great period read, but a truly outstanding novel. I thoroughly enjoyed every page of this book. Caldwell's research of the time period helps make the novel more believable, and makes the reader feel as if they were in the first century Roman Empire. Caldwell pays fine attention to detail when describing her settings, emotional natures, and physical traits of her characters. An example can be found on page 493; &quot;The earth danced in heat waves; the sea flashed like blue fire.&quot; Here Caldwell personifies the earth, and uses simile to provide imagery of Lucanus's searching, and his attempts to record the life of Jesus. Again in the journey narrative, Caldwell uses metaphor to bring an ominous atmosphere to the mind's eye saying, &quot;The moon was a yellow skull in the dark sky.&quot; Caldwell is careful not to clutter the work with description; she develops the plot well. I found her writing style easy to follow, which engages the reader and keeps them wanting more. There is no overwhelming theme of the novel; the book follows one man's journey, Lucanus (St. Luke), to come to know God and document the life of Christ. Although the book is religous in nature, Caldwell gives an objective perspective and does not preach to the reader. This is a great novel for people of all walks of life."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"Taylor Caldwell's book on Luke the physician who in his later years traveled with St. Paul and who is believed to have authored &quot;the Gospel according to Luke&quot; is a masterpiece. The time Ms. Caldwell spent staying in and studying the Mediterranean world as well as absorbing all the information she could find about Luke paid off. This book is absolutely fascinating -- full of action, very well researched and written so vividly as to make the reader feel that he is living right there with Luke and accompanying him on his journey through life, his search for meaning in life and his first-century A.D. world. The problems of the physician in those times weren't much different from today in terms of trying to cure disease, bring new lives into the world and help the dying to leave it with as little pain and suffering as possible. What is very interesting is how much the physicians of his time did know, knowledge which was much more than our 20th-century generations give them credit for. However, for a man who outwardly had a very successful life, the real meat of the story lies in his feelings of being unfulfilled in his work and his constant seeking and yearning for deeper meaning to his life. Where he travels, whom he meets and how he finally comes to the discovery of this meaning bring the inner man to life and give us an excellent insight into this most special physician. I could hardly put the book down and and have lent it out so much that it is falling apart! Was delighted to find a hard-cover version for my library on Amazon.com."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"Reading Dear and Glorious Physician moved me and has re-kindled my own passion for my faith in Christ-God. As a literary piece, I find it to be full-bodied, rich in texture and brings to life the life and times of St. Luke. Caldwell successfully stimulates the senses as she brings to the fore the smells and scents, the sights and sores, the music and chaos in those times. Burrowed in the pages, I am always transported! What else can I say? Oh Yes, I read up to the Acts of the Apostles, as she intimated."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"I have loved Taylor Caldwell for 25 years, since I was in my teens. This book is hands down my favorite. She brings Luke and the historical events surrounding him to life with her stunning prose and descriptive text. I have read this book no less than 4 times and each time enjoy it more than the last. It renews my faith and brings me closer to God with every read through. I also recommend Great Lion of God, The Earth is the Lord's, and I Judas."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"This book, which tells the life of St. Luke from a young boy through adulthood, was one on the defining pieces of literature in my life. I read it at age 15 and am now reading it again with my 10 year old son. Beyond the spell binding story, vivid descriptions, and high drama are themes of perserverance, kindness, humility, and above all, humanity. This book should be required reading for anyone considering a career in medicine."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"Love this book about the physician, Luke, who wrote the Gospel according to Luke. Fiction, yes, but such an accurate depiction of the human struggle for spiritual relevance and the rebellion of the human soul. The detail and depth of characters, the complex and rewarding plot and the historical accuracy make this one of the finest works ever done by any author, in my opinion. Rarely does reading the last page cause such a sigh of satifaction. I am buying another because I've loaned mine out so often."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"To read this book is to walk in the shadow of Luke as he grows, learns, and practices medicine. You FEEL his love of God and his loves and heartbreaks.I also strongly recommend Taylor Caldwell's &quot;Great Lion of God&quot; (St. Paul-first enemy of Christ then THE Apostle to the Gentiles) and &quot;I, Judas&quot; (Judas-the follower who became the betrayer because he did not understand/agree with the divine plan. Meet all three of these men on a very personal basis.

It had a profound effect upon me then and continues to move me to this very day. Ms. Caldwell's soaring prose and well researched knowlege of medicine in biblical times draw one into the world of Luke the gospel writer and keep you there. This book brings the like of Luke and the life of the Christ home to the reader and encourages one the reach farther and look further. It deepened my faith . With all the fuss concerning Mel Gibson's new film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; it is good to read something that brings you a greater understanding of the sacrifice made for us without the visually distressing pictures."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"An absolutely delicious read.

GOOD READ!!!"},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"Beautifully, touchingly, searingly, hauntingly written. Luke, handsome, talented and bitter, vows to fight against death, disease and God. Unknowingly, he becomes a divine instrument, performing miracles among the sick and even earning the respect of Ceasar.Along the way, he hears amazing stories that he recorded down. Finally, without ever having met the Man involved, he writes one of the most powerful and compelling Gospels, and the only one that contains the Magnificat - the Gospel according to Luke.Taylor Caldwell wrote this book at an era when people had more time to read; today it may be a little long-winded. For those of you who have no time, you can actually skip the long descriptive scenes and go straight to the action. It is just as compelling and inspiring.An author can write about the sun by observing its shadow. You don't need to be religious to read about the Divine.Dear and Glorious Physician, A Novel about Saint Luke"},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"I'm surprised by how many reviewers read this book in high school. I think I read it in 8th grade. I also reread it within the last couple of years (over 40 years later). For me this book still had a great impact; I know I never forgot it. Caldwell was a great story teller and the forces at odds in Luke as he travels the road from angry nonbeliever practicing medicine in the Roman World to a man of faith who eventually writes his own gospel is a wonderful journey for the reader. I was pulled into his struggle like I have been in few other books. So the book stayed with me, but the second time I read it, I thought it would make a great movie directed by Martin Scorcese. I remembered his Last Temptation of Christ from the late 70's. I've tried to find a way to contact Scorcese to encourage him to do the movie, but was unsuccessful. If anyone reading this can get through to him, you might suggest it would be a great opportunity for him... (I think Leonardo Decaprio would make a great Luke). Anyway, the book is currently out of print; if somebody would republish it, I'd give it to everyone I know. The used editions have actually gotten a little pricey. But, I encourage everyone to read the book. On many levels, it's a great read. Finally, one of the best and most moving parts of the book is when Luke interviews the Virgin Mary and the Apostle John for his gospel; coming near the end of the book, these episodes raise the book above conventional historical fiction and make it somehow a spiritual reading experiance."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"OK, so all Caldwell's heroes are Christian Birchers. She was still the best-selling novelist of the late 1970's-early 80s &amp; this is one of her best, while her Christian faith was still intact. Questionable history, hard-core Catholic theology, purple prose &amp; still one of the, by God, best tales of our struggle with God, Christ, Faith &amp; heartbreak. Demand it get back into print &amp; that someone does the movie!"},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"Like the previous reviewer, I too read this book in high school and have just re-read it, 30 years later. It has not aged well, to me at least. It is the fictional story of St. Luke, the Greek apostle and author of one of the 4 gospels, whom St. Paul called \\"my dear physician Luke\\". Luke's gospel and the Acts of the Apostles, which he is credited with writing, are two of my favorite books of the Bible so I was looking forward to re-reading Caldwell's fictional portrayal of Luke and his times. There are some things about it that are interesting; in particular, Caldwell did a lot of research about ancient medicine and that added quite a bit to the story. However ... I found a rather distressing tendency towards what I call the \\"Aryanization\\" of the characters--that is, Christ, Mary, and Luke himself are all blue-eyed blondes, and many of the \\"good\\" characters in the book are also blue-eyed and/or blonde. It detracted enormously from any sense of historical authenticity, which I feel good historical novels should have. Also, on a couple of occasions Luke (called Lucanus in the novel) airs his political views and contrasts Rome, with its messy democracy and smelly mobs, to Greece, where things were run by an educated and aristocratic elite who clearly ought to be running the show. I greatly dislike it when writers use characters as a mouthpiece for political or social views that clearly reflect the author's personal opinions. There is also quite a bit of ham-handed foreshadowing, and as I don't want to give anything away I won't go into details. Suffice to say that Caldwell constantly is dropping characters into Lucanus' path who then turn up 200 pages later at key points in the plot. It is quite difficult to write realistic novels about Biblical characters, I know, but I was really surprised, and saddened, at how badly 'Dear and glorious physician' has aged."},{"Title":"Dear and glorious physician","review":"I am both a physician and a Christian. Before I was either, I was deeply moved by this book. After my conversion to Christ I found this book incredibly inspiring. Now, as a more mature disciple of Christ I find this accurate portrayal of Luke the physician and apostle to be one of the finest books that I have ever read. I highly reccomend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Triumphs of the Human Spirit: Real Cancer Survivors, Real Battles, Real Victories","review":"November 9, 2003To see the words of what you have gone through in print, you have to wonder why some are speared from this disease.

Bradley Smith notes in the Preface, \\"This account of Miller's life was talked out word for word over many a gin and tonic... Our talks, which were prologues to the hours spent in the conversations that were put on tape, were invariably interrupted... When I first suggested an autobiography to Miller, he said, 'But I just finished making a motion picture of my life...' When I objected, saying that a book was not a film and that I hoped to have him retell the story of his life, he reluctantly agreed... our conversations were like continuous explorations into the reality of the past.\\" (Pg. 4-6)Miller says, \\"Actually, you don't have a choice. We THINK we have choices, but your temperament, your character and your previous mode of living---everything that you have done in your life---dictate what you will do, whether you like it or not.\\" (Pg. 11) He explains, \\"I am a man who's constantly falling in love. People say I am an incurable romantic. Perhaps I am. In any case, I'm grateful to the powers that be that I am that way. It's brought me sorrow and joy. I wouldn't want it any other way. People work better, create better, when they are in love.\\" (Pg. 17)He suggests, \\"I don't think what is called the work of the world, this everyday work that is glorified, is really so important. It would be much much beter if people were told to be lazy, shirk their jobs, be idlers, enjoy, relax, not care, not worry. I think we'd get all that work done some other way.\\" (Pg. 21) He says, \\"I am a film addict and a book addict, too, but they are not equal in effect. The film satisfies something in me which books don't... [but] a film doesn't stay with you as a book does. A book is real meat and substance... A film, if it's a good one, is something which gives you a few wonderful moments and then fades away.\\" (Pg. 28)He admits, \\"I struggled in the beginning. I said I was going to write the truth, so help me God... I found I couldn't. Nobody can write the absolute truth. It's impossible. Your ego won't permit it. I think the truth is something that slides through your fingers... I think we live lies. All of us. We never live face to face with the reality about ourselves.\\" (Pg. 42) He later adds, \\"No man is as full of chaos as I am. People think I am an orderly man. My house is orderly, and my work table is orderly. But inside I'm a raging chaos. I don't think I could be creative if I weren't so chaotic.\\" (Pg. 90)He observes, \\"It's a hard thing for some people to understand, how one can enjoy life when living at the bottom of the pile. Yet I think that that is the most important thing that ever happened to me, to be without anything, no crutch of any kind, cut off completely from all help. You have to FIND it every day, this help; you have to learn to live from day to day. Sure, you suffer and you're miserable, but it's so interesting and so fascinating that you become thoroughly alive.\\" (Pg. 104)Real \\"fans\\" of Miller will want to read the complete work, rather than just this abridgement; but this shorter work is interesting in its own right, and provides insights into the man and the writer."},{"Title":"Super Reading Secrets","review":"Super reading secrets by Howard Stephen Berg is a book that is supposed to help increase you reading and it will do just that and so much more.

You are not taught to just speed-read but to comprehend as well.After reading this book I have gained a real insight into how to read effectively and to comprehend more if what I have read, berg has done a great job. Berg is able to convey his message in a clear, concise manner without boring the reader.If you want to save hundred of dollars on those seminars that may or may not help, spend less than $6.00 and get yourself a copy of this book, you won't be disappointed.

All I know is that I am hooked and will put in all the work required.Hope this helps some of you. Thanks."},{"Title":"Super Reading Secrets","review":"I am an undergraduate student in Electrical engineering in Purdue University and i bought this book a few weeks back. Although this book advertises itself as 'Super reading', but I think the title maybe more apt if it was 'Super Skimming and Test Question Spotting.' I do admit that skimming is one of the techniques the author discussed in his book, but those techniques are,in my opinion, only valid when: 1. You want to pass the exam ONLY, OR 2. You are reading for fun. With regard to reading technical stuff. I just tried the techniques he offered but all in vain. Technical, 'dry' materials cannot be learnt that way. Moreover even you manage to pass the exams by guessing/spotting questions, you land yourself on a very shakky ground when you do higher level course work since all those courses do depend on the material from previous courses.(And the lecturers expect you know the materials in the courses you have taken, even they were not tested in the exams.) So, Mr. Berg's 'superb' achievement by learning a subject in 7 hours, spotting the questions, ignoring materials he thought wouldn't be tested and got a B+ in that exam totally defeated the purpose of an examination. My final advice: Save your money."},{"Title":"Super Reading Secrets","review":"I recently took a class with Mr. Berg at the Learning Annex in Manhattan. Seven hours long!... It was very interesting, and yes my reading speed did double within the first half of the day, and by the end of the day I was at about 800 words/minute. Mr. Berg is an extremely wise man, very enthusiastic and encouraging, and I'm glad I did take the class which gave me some practice, making it a lot easier for me to understand his ideas in the rest of this book on my own time. Only a little disappointing was the fact that in both the book and the seven-hour lecture I experienced, the focus did seem to be on studying and special techniques for recalling and the like. He was able to answer any and all questions asked during the class, and I really trust that he's very accomplished and knowledgable on this subject. I learned a lot from him and from the book. Though this book seems pretty good, but I definitely plan on checking out some others on this subject."},{"Title":"Super Reading Secrets","review":"I got the Mega Speed Reading program from the infomercial and basically it's Howard Berg reading off his book word for word. Does it really work? Well I can't read like Howard does on TV but he does teach you certain techniques you can use. I would definitely get this book instead of the Mega Memory Program!!"},{"Title":"Super Reading Secrets","review":"Mr Berg book is an interesting approach to not so much speed reading than strategic reading, or rather culling, of information. Although there are speed-reading technniques per se that are well-explained in his tome, a lot of the material covered deals with planning so that you can &quot;speed-scan&quot; the book. He, as well, spends some pages on allied disciplines that are useful studying adjuncts. Mnemonics, memory rhythm manipulation, the use of music as recall device are summurily explored. The extensive bibliography that he provides will allow to explore these avenues further if you are so inclined. The book is a softer sell than the infomercials. Interestingly, Mr Stern does admit to some slight chicanery in his public demos...Although it will increase your reading speed, do not expect results in the range that Mr Berg claims... as he is not really reading each and every word on the page. The book is just an okay buy in terms of content but it is so cheap that if one is interested one should buy it."},{"Title":"Super Reading Secrets","review":"This book is definitely worth the money, especially compared to the price of Howard's infomercial. I noticed that I was able to put into practice his techniques soon after I started reading. By the time I reached the end of the book, my reading speed had dramatically increased. I would definitely recomend this book to everyone"},{"Title":"Super Reading Secrets","review":"I took Berg's class and read this book, but I still can't read as fast or nearly as fast as him. I admit I read a lot faster now, but I can't say it is because of him. I owe it to practice. Simply, the more you read, the faster you will read and understand it better. There is no magic formula. One of the techniques Berg teaches is to use your hand as a guide to train your eyes to follow your hand, so the faster you move your hand, the faster your eyes move and therefore read faster. I actually read faster without the hand and using it just gives me headaches. Plus, if you really enjoy reading, I cannot believe reading a page in seconds will be an enjoyable experience. This may be a good thing for students trying to get all the information they need for exams. And the book provides some really good studying tips. Unfortunately when I read this, I already graduated. This is a must-read for all students. Berg is definitely a talented guy that can do what he claims, but you would have to be just as talented to used his speed reading techniques."},{"Title":"Super Reading Secrets","review":"If you've been smitten with Howard Berg's infommercial for &quot;mega reading,&quot; and you don't want to fork out the $170 for the package being sold through the infommercial, this book is an excellent substitute.

In my experience, you don't have to follow them exactly, e.g. i didn't tape the time intervals for the exercises. the most important is that you practice - whatever exercise it is - on a regular basis. However, the book often repeats itself, one exercise was almost the same as the previous. also, you don't learn too much more specific scientific background information."},{"Title":"Super Reading Secrets","review":"I picked up SUPER READING SECRETS because I was and am still interested in learning as much as I possibly can. Being able to increase my reading speed would allow me to read more books than I can now and in turn I would learn more information. After reading the book, I do know how to increase my reading speed. The techniques that Berg suggests in SUPER READING SECRETS really do work, however, they are not something I intend to do frequently. I like reading. Even when studying, I take pleasure from most things I read. For me, there really isn't much distinction between reading for pleasure and reading for information and reading for studying. Just about everything I read is for pleasure. Most of the techniques that are suggested in the book are directed towards reading for information and reading for study.Besides the speeding reading tips, the book is also full of useful study techniques and tips. If I was still a student in high school or college and had never discovered these tips and techniques on my own, then I would have found these parts of the book to be quite useful. However, since I already knew about these techniques I didn't get much out of these parts of the book either.True to the title, SUPER READING SECRETS really does explain how a person can learn how to read one-page in three seconds. It takes time, but it does work. Students who have trouble studying from high school and college will get the most from this book.

This book wasted my time!!!! And doesn't even work!!!"},{"Title":"Super Reading Secrets","review":"'Just another in a spate of hallucinogenically self-evident books on reading like a maniac. I read faster than anyone I know, but I've always read faster than anyone I know. And, in evidence to my claim, when asked questions about what I've read, I don't require that the questions be formatted as multiple choice or as verbal \\"meta tags\\" that merely require recognition/recall. I'm happy to provide context and interpretation. Of course, I may misinterpret, but the questioner can readily determine that I have thoroughly read the book and have a good grasp of its broad issues as well as many of its fine points.The main reasons I read so quickly and effectively are:***1. I learned to read very early--before first grade--and in an extremely positive and supportive atmosphere which made fast and attentive reading seem as normal as breathing. In short: I developed the HABIT of reading, reinforced EARLY, often, and for many years.***2. I was MOTIVATED to read. My parents gave me extraordinary reinforcement through the manifest joy they shared with me in seeing me reading. (They also were brilliant professional people who were emotionally balanced and loving.) My reading \\"environment\\", that is, was superbly supportive.***3. OPPORTUNITY. My home had thousands of books--a miscellany of types/genres. They were readily accessible whenever I wished to read.***4. FOCUS. All the above factors gave me great powers of concentration when reading. I never remember NOT reading and have rarely felt anything but anticipatory pleasure when contemplating a book or article or poem, etc., I had intended to read. I was ready, willing, and able, with visceral pleasure, to plunge into a book.***5. PLASTICITY OF READING TECHNIQUE. Like a tool kit, some items I read with mental verbalization (such as poetry) and others without verbalization (technical material). In general, the more affective or aesthetic in orientation, the more I'm likely to verbalize. (Who wants to speed read Shakespeare?)The more sheerly informative or formally declarative a book is--that is, the more non-affective is its content, nothing is to be gained--except reinforcement of ineffective habits perhaps?--by subvocalizing the words. (Exceptions to the rule, to be discussed elsewhere: Some extraordinarily well-written informative literature has abstract beauty, architectonic economy, and/or intrinsic order--e.g., an elegantly written technical manual, or an ingeniously written computer program.) With such info-laden, and relatively affective-empty materials, I skip the subvocalization and dramatically accelerate my reading speed and factual comprehension. My selection of technique is invariably intuitive and immediate, without conscious choice. Even if I stop and contemplate the consequences of a given info-laden paragraph, I will have read that paragraph very quickly, without subvocalization. Following that reading, the subsequent few moments are invested in reflection upon that paragraph and perhaps its connections--its innate \\"hyperlinks\\" to other paragraphs within the same text, other texts, knowledge I otherwise have, and various degrees of conscious and semi-conscious connections to information, relationships, and experiences within my memory and current awareness.Reading is not only about comprehension, fast or slow, as I have indicated in my observations about reading affective materials. Indeed, reading is also about: being affected by the reading; being transformed in heart and mind; reconceptualizing habitual thinking, perceptual, and feeling patterns; pure pleasure; vicarious participation in imaginary domains; etc. These are also reading skills, and skills that \\"power\\" or \\"photo\\" reading do not even address. They are options not considered. (Some do obliquely mention such reading skills/aspects, without addressing the concerns I've expressed. As such, the various speed reading books omit many of the aspects which make reading a valuable, exciting, and pleasurable experience, and which motivate many of us to read in the first place. If the authors were intellectually honest and clear with the reader, the entire genre of speed reading books would acknowledge that they primarily address info skimming and gleaning skills.)No book can teach such intuitively and immediately available reading virtuosity within a few weeks, any more than any basketball coach can teach the fluid moves of Kobe Bryant in a summer clinic. Of course, there's a difference: all persons of normal intelligence, I submit, can develop a much greater degree of reading virtuosity, while physical virtuosity is more sharply related to biological determinates. Reading virtuosity is more a result of fortunately provided, or consciously chosen, psychological determinates, including the formation of determinable reading attitudes and habits.Also, and not \\"PC\\" (politically correct): intelligence does make a difference. Of course it does! Does not rapid/ fast/ speed/ any-other-type-of-reading involve interpretation? Is the meaning and implications of the words, sentences, and paragraphs self-evident? Of course not! So intelligence must necessarily matter. Yet, importantly, none of this should dissuade any of us from working to improve reading skills, of which speed is only one component (if an important one). We all can. I am simply arguing against any misplaced \\"affirmative action\\" in reading education. You are where you are in your skills. Accurate assessment is vital. You will do yourself no favors by fantasizing of reading pages at one glance. (Yes, you can learn to skim very quickly and effectively, and remember an enormous amount of information--especially when such skimming is complemented by interspersed and selective reading of chosen sections of the material you're reading. If one has never learned to so skim, and especially if one also reads slowly and ineffectively, learning to skim with skill can seem like an epiphany! One's new skimming skills produce results that are superior to one's previous reading results. One is thus converted to Berg's or Scheele's \\"super reading\\" or \\"photoreading\\", misinterpreting the chosen reading system as THE reading system.Quick attitude changes, I suspect, can immediately help develop better reading skills by simply moving the reader from his/her (unfortunately) typical somnambulistic state to a more conscious and focused state of mind. That shift of conscious purpose may be the chief value--to the extent there is value--in such books as Howard Stephen Berg's (or Paul Scheele's)."},{"Title":"Super Reading Secrets","review":"I did review this book earlier.

In his new novel, Galactically Speaking, author Fred J. Klingenhagen tells the story of how and why Nek-Hanan was charged with Capital murder...and what Floridian Leddie Fenhadden learned about this extraterrestrial.In a well-researched story and with a tongue-in-cheek writing style that is humorous as well as inventive, author Klingenhagen unfolds a story of life in the future, in the galaxies yet unknown to us, now. And, you will read, that life then is not altogether different from how we act, now.Nick's mission to Earth is to determine whether the people of Earth are advanced enough to join the Galactic Association of Star Systems, ecologically, financially, socially and intellectually. And it's the Enforcement Department's mission to capture Nick and bring him back.Thus the story unfolds, as do the wonderful characters that inhabit it, here and faraway. And these characters include the cats of Earth who are able to communicate with the extraterrestrials. That look of disdain you often see in a cat? Its real...they really do think of themselves as smarter than their human counterparts.If you want to find out what happens in this page-turner, and how John F. Kennedy was involved (that's right, John F. Kennedy), read Galactically Speaking.

It is not intended to be an overview of Hegel's thought; rather, it is a supplement to further study.Kaufmann is mostly occupied with correcting previous misinterpretations of Hegel's thought, providing useful philological material, and interpreting Hegel's philosophy in the light of extensive biographical research. It is clearly the outcome of many years of intensive study, and one comes away with the impression that Kaufmann pored over every letter and monograph he could find.What the book does NOT contain is a clear, flowing exegesis or interpretation of Hegel's thought. Unlike Kaufmann's \\"Nietzsche\\", Hegel's development is looked at chronologically. It is difficult to get a clear sense of Hegel's overarching thought from this study. Bursts of commentary and exegesis are broken by long, technical digressions. A wealth of footnotes provides extreme detail about discrepancies in different versions of Hegel's texts and comments on their editors and redactors.If you are looking for a tool to assist you in reading Hegel for yourself, this book will make a valuable companion. As an introduction to the thought of Hegel, I recommend Charles Taylor's Hegel and Modern Society."},{"Title":"Hegel: A Reinterpretation","review":"....do start here, for Kaufmann is an able Hegel commentator, clarifier, and critic."},{"Title":"Hegel: A Reinterpretation","review":"When I was young, I was taught that I should appreciate J. S. Bach and other musical geniuses about like Walter Kaufmann grew up thinking that Hegel was really something. Kaufmann and I have both noticed how reluctant Hegel was to admit who he was talking about, so he considers it an anomaly on page 490 of the J. B. Baille translation of THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF MIND that the name Oedipus has been inserted into the sentence \\"In the story of *OEdipus* the son does not see his own father in the person of the man who has insulted him . . .\\" Walter Kaufmann lists the persons whom Hegel actually mentioned in his manuscript (\\"only thirteen men and women are named.\\" p. 125). I would say Kaufmann left out Julius Caesar, since the preface happens to discuss historical facts like the year in which Caesar was born. Reading the translation of the preface by Walter Kaufmann in HEGEL TEXT AND COMMENTARY, a separate paperback volume with the same index as HEGEL A REINTERPRETATION, is the best approach for understanding Kaufmann's method of explaining Hegel. His commentary in that book is mostly in the form of notes at particular places in the text, and they do not always refer to persons that might have been meant by Hegel, as a lot of philosophy has happened since Hegel, and Walter Kaufmann was aware of various interpretations and more modern philosophers like Kierkegaard and Heidegger (who, \\"unlike Hegel, seeks to move philosophy closer to poetry rather than science.\\" note 10 on Commentary page 93). Having HEGEL A REINTERPRETATION as a separate book allows Kaufmann to try to demonstrate the scope of philosophy in a way that Hegel attempted to do, encompassing it all as no one had tried to do since Aristotle.I learned a lot reading this book years ago, allowing myself to feel a lot like Fichte in the comparison, \\"Nobody today would rank Fichte with Kant;\\" (p.110). Self-consciousness in German is not quite what it is in America today, but a large part of how modern the intrusive nature of our media has allowed us to become is the constant measure of our own sorry self-consciousnesses becoming aware of each other, a very Hegelian philosophical theme. The appreciation of particular geniuses in our own day might be troubled by knowledge such as Kaufmann's, that \\"There are not many non-German composers in a class with Bach, Handel, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven; and during their era German poetry was coming into its own, too. The great achievements of the period were triumphs of the artistic imagination.\\" (p. 114). Our own composers always seem to be thinking about something else instead of what it would take to make their music better.Did anybody notice how long the song \\"Lily Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts\\" was on Bob Dylan's \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" album? If \\"the drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind\\" could be applied to philosophy, it might be as a form of consciousness which seeks to avoid an overwhelming awareness of anything which is actually going on. Hegel ought to be considered good for philosophy in the way that Bob Dylan would be good for people whose interest in music involves owning the rights to the songs. The big legal questions in our society are about who has to pay for people to keep singing or swapping this stuff. Most people who buy this book will read it as consumers. Hegel was usually not a philosopher to be considered dangerous, but somehow, people like Marx, who read Hegel as an introduction to how unsettled things of their own day were, were dangerous in a lot of intellectual fields. I learned a lot about Fichte the first time I read this book. His attempt to identify God with a moral world order is clearly stated, and it only takes a little knowledge of human nature to see how his career suffered the consequences, with the result, \\"Accused of atheism, he published a couple of vigorous defenses in 1799 and threatened to resign if reprimanded, which was construed as a resignation--and he was let go.\\" (p. 102). Hegel managed to avoid getting clobbered in that kind of argument, and modern philosophy has a lot of appreciation for everything he managed to say without causing a lot of trouble. This book pulls it all together."},{"Title":"The Ultimates 2, Vol. 1: Gods and Monsters","review":"It's been a year since the attempted alien invasion that was stopped by the supergoup known as The Ultimates. Despite Bruce Banner/The Hulk's pivotal role in preventing the fall of Earth, Banner is still being held by S.H.I.E.L.D. in order to prevent the Hulk from killing anyone else, seeing as how he is responsible for the deaths of 852 New Yorkers. Meanwhile, Steve Rogers/Captain America is dating Janet Pym/The Wasp while she is going through her divorce with ex-Ultimate Hank Pym/Giant-Man. Hank, while no longer officially working for The Ultimates, still visits Banner on a regular basis to continue research and development; currently, he is helping develop the technology to create the superhero Ant-Man. Tony Stark/Iron Man has been dating Natasha Romanova/Black Widow, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff are still a part of the team, and Thor is starting to go nuts (or is he?).The story starts off with someone leaking classified documents to the media that reveal the Hulk's true identity to be Banner. This leads to a trial and massive speculation that Thor is responsible for the leak. Using Matt Murdock (Daredevil) as his lawyer, Banner is put on trial for his life. Elsewhere, Thor is getting messages from his father Odin about the workings of his evil brother, Loki. But his messages may only be delusional.The book ends with a great cliffhanger; we still don't know the identity of the traitor, and something has happened that may make the Ultimates villains in the eyes of the public. The story only continues to get better in these six issues, and I can't wait to see where things go next. The art continues to be great, while the story still mixes drama and action effectively (the fight between Thor and the rest of the Ultimates is amazing)."},{"Title":"The Ultimates 2, Vol. 1: Gods and Monsters","review":"I love the ultimate avengers series. it gives more of a modern day spin to the old avengers. marvel cant turn out these ultimate series fast enough for me. as soon as i finish one i want another to replace it. the only part about the series that bothers me is iron mans armor and the quicksilver and scarlet witch chracters. although i thought the third book was pretty funny when pietro catches wanda flirting with one of the robots hank pym trys to sell nick fury. i love the series. i would love seeing an ultimate series for the hulk as well"},{"Title":"The Ultimates 2, Vol. 1: Gods and Monsters","review":"The best way to tell you about this book would be to simply say kick a$$!

Mark Millar tells a story of what would happen if not only superheroes were real but what would the government do with them? It's very political but not exactly in the way you might think. They don't even fight any supervillians in this one, they're fighting each other. You've got a Thor maybe a God or may just be crazy, and even Thor himself is questioning his sanity. It also tells us what would really happen if the Hulk hulked out in a city and how would people react. Of course the public would want his head. And you've got a Gaintman who's life is in the sh$#er. This is superheros with real problems, and how they affect each other and the everyone's lives. Which is what Marvel is suppose to be about. Mark Millar has written his best work to date.

All I can say is that I can't wait for the second half to come out sometime this year.Practically every character matures and develops more in this book, which is really nice. In addition, I find that my opinions of each character change as I continue reading. For volume 1, Thor had to be the coolest character in the series - at this point in volume 2, its Iron Man. Captain America was ok at the beginning, but I'm really hoping that sometime soon he just gets the living you-know-what kicked out of him. Cap has almost become a bully in this book and it would be nice to see him taken down a peg or two - a la what happened to Thor in this book.

Loki finally enters the Ultimate Universe, and long-story-short Thor has one hell of a fight in this book!

Since \`The Ultimates' is considered the best of the Ultimate line it's the one I chose to read and I was certainly not disappointed.Marvel has always focused more on the dysfunctional side of being a superhero than DC but the new Avengers/Ultimates are truly a train wreck. I began to wonder if the author hadn't found inspiration in Alan Moore's spectacular League of Extraordinary Gentleman (the graphic novel not the dreadful film). If so Mark Miller chose a great writer to emulate. He may not have Moore's gift of dialogue but he pens with a surprising darkness and the story left me wanting more. Despite being 152 pages, \`Gods and Monsters' never once deals with external enemies. The first portion of the book focuses on a government leak revealing that Dr. Bruce Banner was the cause of over 800 deaths in NYC. The second half of the book deals with ex-member Thor who has become a bit of a liability and needs to be removed from the picture. As in the first book the team is called in to take care of one of their own. It just happens that it's always the toughest member who needs taken down. Meanwhile ex-Ultimate and wife abuser Henry Pym (Giant Man/Ant Man) has reached the lowest point of his life after joining the pitiful Defenders. The Defenders were always kind of a joke in the Marvel Universe but in the Ultimates they descend to a new level of irrelevance. Pym has become such a pariah to Nick Fury and that Ultimates that even an offer to give his considerable talents away for free are rebuffed.Mark Miller seems to have found his nitch in what if stories having also penned the excellent Red Son tale of Superman re-imagined as landing and being raised in the Soviet Union rather than the United States. The Ultimates represents the next evolution in gritty, realistic super hero writing as the U.S. moves further and further away from the Comic Code days of the 50's. The difference is that these kind of stories were generally one shot deals or limited series rather than a continuing series. It will be very interesting to see where the writer goes as the seams that bind the team continue to unravel."},{"Title":"The Ultimates 2, Vol. 1: Gods and Monsters","review":"Well this book was one of the best books I've read in a while after I got the dissaponting (writing and artwork wise) Ult. X-Men World Tour. This book deliverd a great story and as always had great artwork. What I also liked was that they didn't have it like the first Ultimates book were it was 4 issues of talk and 2 of action, this one had a lot more action and suprises. If your a fan of the Ultimates pick this one up."},{"Title":"The Ultimates 2, Vol. 1: Gods and Monsters","review":"This was a decidedly less thoughtful sequel to the original Ultimates, though still an overall success. The characters meet with less development, and the limits of their situation see less conflict with the world around them--but still, Millar takes the reader into some interesting scenarios."},{"Title":"The Ultimates 2, Vol. 1: Gods and Monsters","review":"The writing is excellent as is the artwork. I love that the characters were drawn to look like actual people instead of the ridiculous animetoons in the third installment. Its a really brilliant story line. I love the sub plot about giant man's failed superhero career and how low he's sunk.I would highly recommend this item."},{"Title":"The Ultimates 2, Vol. 1: Gods and Monsters","review":"Unlike the previous Batman collection I read (Batman: Officer Down), The Ultimates 2 collection was fantastic. Stories like these are what have started to bring people back to comics again following the disastrous market crash of the 1990's when people became fed up with generic art and horribly written titles.This arc picks up 12 months following the last Ultimates book and much has happened in the Ultimates' universe. Bruce Banner is locked away and awaiting trial, Thor has broken away from the team, and Dr. Pym continues to try to find a way to rejoin the team. Captain America, Iron Man and the other Ultimates find themselves at the center of numerous debates concerning the problems with the American government and other nations pursuing super-powered groups and how they should be used, if at all. Although Bryan Hitch's art is quite strong, what separates this book from many other things on the shelf is the writing. I used to be highly critical of many of the comics being sold because the writing was often weak and depended so heavily on the art to carry the book. Now, in many ways, books like this and the work of Bendis and Miller keep producing, comics have reached the point where the writing is as strong if not stronger than the art, making the medium that much richer and more entertaining. Millar does a fantastic job of keeping an epic feel to everything and at no point do we lose sight of how all-encompassing a team that contains many of Marvel's most important icons should be. At the same time, we see the moments when everyone, including Captain America, seems all too human.I think this is a fantastic collection and highly recommend it to seasoned and new comic readers alike."},{"Title":"The Ultimates 2, Vol. 1: Gods and Monsters","review":"For an action/drama focusing on a super team of heroes, look no further. If you haven't picked up The Ultimates yet, you don't want to start here. This is basically season 2 of the series and you'll be lost, but this is where it really takes off for me. Ultimates 1 was a very well done series and got this franchise off to a good start and Ultimates 2 still blew it away.This is a testament to the skills of Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch for giving us a mature look at super heroes that doesn't patronize the reader and pushes the realism as much as possible. Comics have certainly changed in the wake of popular serialized dramas like \\"Lost\\" for example and for the better. I couldn't be bothered to even watch NBC's \\"Heroes\\" anymore as it doesn't even come close to the action and suspense showcased in this book. Continued in this book is more focus on Hank Pym, Thor and Tony and Natasha's budding relationship. The whole team begins to fall apart due to a possible informant within S.H.I.E.L.D. but who's the traitor?I enjoyed seeing cameos in here from Prof. X as well as Matt Murdock representing Dr. Banner in court. Helps to keep the Ultimate Universe feeling all encompassing with these crossovers. I enjoyed the dialogue between Steve and Jan as the Captain America of the 40's is still having a hard time adjusting to the 21st century. Those moments also help to ground it in reality. And that's what I'm enjoying so much about this take on The Avengers is how much more seriously I can take it than ever before. Comics are not just for kids anymore and The Ultimates is a prime example."},{"Title":"The Ultimates 2, Vol. 1: Gods and Monsters","review":"More of the entertaining destructive and self-destructive antics of the Ultimates. The general public now know that Banner is the Hulk, and his trial demands capital punishment.Giant-Man is Ant-Man, Iron Man is married. There is the aftermath of the alien invasion to deal with, and now, Loki."},{"Title":"The Ultimates 2, Vol. 1: Gods and Monsters","review":"In a nutshell, \\"the Ultimates\\" AKA the Ultimate Avengers is far and away the best of Marvel's Ultimate titles, as evidenced by its top-rating among all of Millar's books. Interestingly, it rates higher than his other Ultimate titles...I think in general the tone is the most adult and most serious of the Ultimate books - closer to the new Battlestar Galactica or Season 5 of 24 than than to its comic peers.While I liked Ultimate Fantastic Four, Ultimate X-men, etc - this is the standard bearer of the line - even if you don't follow the avengers, this is an easy to grasp title. And Volume 2 is far better than volume 1!"},{"Title":"The Ultimates 2, Vol. 1: Gods and Monsters","review":"The long awaited new tales of the Ultimates are finally here. The first volume, plagued by shipping delays which spaced issues months between each other, achieved excellence during it's second half. As this arc starts off (with the series being re-titled Ultimates 2), writer Mark Millar and artist Bryan Hitch weave a complicated new threat to the government funded super team, with consequences for all involved. Hank Pym is off the team and no longer Giant Man. He assumes a new identity as Ant-Man, and continues to make progress on his Ultron creation (longtime Avengers readers know where this is headed), and later has a tenure on the ill-fated Defenders team. In the meantime, the Ultimates themselves are enjoying their lives as super hero celebrities: Captain America and the Wasp have been dating, Nick Fury makes further advancements in the ranks, and Tony \\"Iron Man\\" Stark and the Black Widow are engaged. All this however comes crashing down when it is revealed to the public that Bruce Banner is the Hulk, leading to a short trial of Banner with grave consequences. The leaking information leads to the mysterious Thor, whose origin is revealed, with more questions than answers. By the end of Gods & Monsters, it is apparent that there is a traitor in the ranks, and by the time you reach the last page, you'll be salivating for more. Millar's writing is top notch, pulling out surprise after surprise and plenty of shocks, while Hitch's art continues to impress. All in all, this TPB marks a new chapter for the Ultimates, and it's clear tbat this is one that won't end well for anyone."},{"Title":"The Ultimates 2, Vol. 1: Gods and Monsters","review":"Ultimates 2 vol. 1: Gods and Monsters does something I didn't think was possible, it is better than either of the previous Ultimates volumes. Truly epic in scope, the second Ultimates series picks up one year after the previous tome. Banner is still a prisoner of Shield, Pym is on the outs with the team, though he's now Ant-Man, Iron Man and Black Widow are in love, and Thor has left. Though Wasp and Captain America are still together, not all is perfect with their relationship.Nor is this the end of the Ultimates troubles. Loki provides a foil that even the Ultimates can't destroy, and their own group dynamics threaten to drive the team apart. The characterization and fight scenes are easily some of the best in comics, bar none. To see Thor take on the entire Ultimates is worth the price of admission alone. There's also plenty of glimpses of things to come, such as Vision making a brief appearance. Also, the trial of Banner for crimes as the Hulk provides readers with something rare in comics, consequences.Reprinting Ultimates 2 #1-6, I can't describe to you just how good this volume is, only that I would place it in the same elite grouping as Watchmen, Preacher, and Miracle Man. It has my highest possible recommendations and can easily be read by fans or newcomers. Due to plenty of mature themes, it would probably be best for an audience 14 and older.Why are you still reading this review? Treat yourself and start reading Ultimates!"},{"Title":"The Ultimates 2, Vol. 1: Gods and Monsters","review":"WOW! The team of Millar and Hitch sure do know how to turn a comic book fan's head. Gods & Monsters definitely gives bang for your buck. Collecting the first 6 issues of Ultimates 2, this TDP is an example of stylized comic book grandeur at its very best. Bryan Hitch's dynamic art provides the perfect complement to Millar's grandiose type of storytelling. The synergy between the writer and the artist just makes the pages explode with BIG moments.The Ultimates suffer the highs and lows of being raised to celebrity status. Picking up a year after the events in the Ultimates, Bruce is still incarcerated by SHIELD, Cap and Jan are now an item (though cracks are starting to show), and Iron Man and Black Widow are engaged. Initially universally lauded for their past heroics fending off the rampaging Hulk and an alien invasion, the team has little time to wallow in champagne and caviar dreams before the other shoe drops: a traitor in their midst has leaked the inside info that the Hulk's alter ego is a federal employee in SHIELD, the powerhouse entity that runs the Ultimates. Now Bruce Banner must be tried for murdering over 800 people. Not to mention, Thor has quit the team and persists in his deploration of the Ultimates, who he claims is one hair away from denouncing their domestic status and instead becoming an international pre-emptive strike force. His paranoia and ever increasing \\"dementia\\" force the Ultimates to try to take him into custody. And that's a donnybrook you have to see! Meanwhile, Hank Pym has been ousted from the team and goes to seek his fortune elsewhere. He develops his Ant-Man identity, while continuing to tinker with his Ultron program (ouch!). He even finds time to join the lowly Defenders, where he discovers he's the only one with a legit super power.There's so much stuff that happens in here! You get to witness the nationally televised trial of the Hulk, as defended by Matt Murdock; the \\"origin\\" of Thor and the appearance of the crafty Loki; a cameo by Captain Britain (also Captains Spain, France, and Italy); the debut of \\"Cybernatrix\\" (\\"Iron Maiden\\"?); the cage match between the Ultimates and the \\"God of Thunder\\"; and the hilarious debut of the pathetic Defenders (though Valkyrie is a hottie, but the Black Knight is always late for meetings, being eternally stuck in traffic).And all the while, the group dynamics of the Ultimates are slowly crumbling away. Repercussions? Why, surely.I'd just very recently raved about Ex Machina, a comic book grounded in reality. Well, the Ultimates reside on the other spectrum, where over the top is not extravagant enough. Millar and Hitch take this comic book and raise it to such resplendent levels that it takes on overtones of a Viking opera. Which is a good thing. The folly, for the comic book writer and artist, lies in being somewhere in between the two extremes, where 90 percent of the complacent comic book world dwell. I highly, highly recommend Gods & Monster."},{"Title":"The Ultimates 2, Vol. 1: Gods and Monsters","review":"This one is set one year after the original storyline ends with The Ultimates now under public scrutiny after it is mysteriously leaked to the media that Dr. Bruce Banner is The Hulk and that The Ultimates were behind the cover-up!

The art is hands down astronomical. Bryan Hitch can draw anything and make it look both dynamic and realistic at the same moment. And Mark Millar (whom is often hit or miss for me) writes snappy dialogue that really sets the characters apart from one another. While his overall plots are nothing terribly original, his new takes on classic characters like Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and the Hulk have been tremendously entertaining. We now have heroes in very much the twenty-first century, with all the neurosis, greed, naivet&eacute;, and self-doubt that comes with being a denizen of the modern day.As I said, the overall plots are predictable, but it's the subplots where the genius rests. Each character has their own story, and it's those personal stories and interactions that prove captivating. However, when it's time for the big action of the overall plot's climax, strap yourself in. That's where Bryan Hitch saves the day with his art and Mark Millar makes it fun with his dialogue.If you want to experience super hero comics at their &lt;ahem!> ultimate in terms of action and art, the Ultimates is what you're looking for.~Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphant"},{"Title":"The Ultimates 2, Vol. 1: Gods and Monsters","review":"This is Mark Millar's best work and one of the best marvel volumes ever. The plot was thick and branchy and never once was I lost in the intricate work. Brilliant piece of work. I usually stick with the graphic novels because I'm a reader not a collector and I may go out and grab the smaller trades to get my 'fix'."},{"Title":"The Ultimates 2, Vol. 1: Gods and Monsters","review":"After I finished this chapter in the continuing \\"Ultimates\\" saga, all I could do was shake my head and go \\"wow\\". I have never seen or read anything like this, and that is high praise. The last volume was absolutely incredible and really set a high bar for realistic characterization and incredible battles in this series. What comes about in this volume is the near-disintrigation of everything that was built up in the earlier volumes. There is not one legitimate villain to fight in this story: no rampaging Hulk, no alien invasion, no Nazis, no Kang, Magneto, Galactus or any other uber-villain one would expect Ultimate Marvel's team of \\"persons of mass destruction\\" to face. Their biggest enemy at this point is themselves. Giant Man no more, wife-beater Hank Pym (now old-school Ant Man) is a pathetic mess in this volume who joins a group of superhero wannabes (the Defenders; originally an actual Marvel superteam -albeit a 2nd rate one- who are reduced to incompetent posers in this version) in what proves to be an amusing but ultimately annoying chapter after what proves to be the main attraction here: the arrest of the mighty Thor, who resigns from the team, believing SHIELD's secret agenda is to use them to attack foreign countries . After Thor's anti-war activism goes too far, the Ultimates are grouped with their fledgling European counterparts to take the god of thunder down in what proves to be a battle of epic proportions. Thor is clearly portrayed as a Christ-like figure here in spite of his apparent mental illness (but is he actually insane as his origin -finally revealed- insinuates, or is his brother Loki truly \\"shuffling reality\\" and poisoning the Ultimates against him?) and several shots in the sequence are difficult to look at as he battles his own friends. The fact that you truly don't know whether a classic character like Thor is insane in this re-imagination or if his classic nemesis Loki is a figment of his imagination is a true credit to the writing here. Kudos. The trial of the Incredible Hulk, which commences after Bruce Banner is outed by an unknown traitor as a member of the team, proves to be an interesting but too brief episode with a memorable and unexpected finale. More kudos. So far, \\"The Ultimates\\" has kept me rivetted and while this volume has much going for it, I hope for a return to the more simplistic awesomeness of \\"Homeland Security\\" in future volumes because all of this infighting, while brilliantly executed, takes away from what I really want to see: Earth's Mightiest Heroes battling the most powerful villains around. Also, the political commentary is getting a bit out of control at this point too. We're all tired of the war in the Middle East, and this issue aims this team of classic heroes in a corrupt, fascist direction that could soon border on villainy. It's a bit depressing to imagine the Avengers as government lapdogs fighting for imperialist interests. Will then next chapter have me rooting for the traitor in SHIELD's ranks? And, on a lighter note, Quicksilver gets his moment to shine here, but would it kill them to give the Scarlet Witch something to do besides look hot and hang on her brother's arm suggestively? When you look at every panel they appear in together, their relationship seems a bit creepy to say the least. I keep waiting for Tony Stark to make an Angelina Jolie remark at their expense. However, there is one line Quicksilver delivers to his sis involving one of Hank Pym's new creations that is quite humorous if you know your Avengers lore, so I'll let this stuff slide....this time. But Scarlet Witch's only moment of note in the big battle is threatening to create a reality where Thor is a baby seal getting clubbed before she gets promptly clobbered herself. Come on, Wanda, do something cool! I also wasn't thrilled about Iron Man's birthday present to fellow Ultimate and current lover, Black Widow; her very own custom-made supersuit. Personally, I loved her just the way she was before. Iron Man has a habit of making other characters clones of himself and it's a bit annoying in a title where a diverse array of superheroes is the big draw. Minor fanboyish complaints aside, \\"Gods and Monsters\\" proves to be a shocking and unique continuation of an already bold new take on a classic comic franchise. I've honestly never seen anything quite like it and I'd highly recommend picking this one up after catching up on the past volumes of this increasingly intriguing saga."},{"Title":"The Ultimates 2, Vol. 1: Gods and Monsters","review":"Man, this volume was tough to swallow, in a good way. Some real issues came about and rocked the superhero world entirely. How do people feel about superhero's when they manage to hurt thousands of people while battling a villain? Do the same laws apply to crimefighters as they do American citizens? This, my friends, is Mark Millar's Watchmen. It's epic and very dramatic. I became frustrated for the fate of my heros. This book literally dropped a bomb on me and made me fear the conclusion.I don't want to give anything away, but the second installment gets more into how the Ultimates cope with their problems, and what realities they must face. A few of the Avengers suffer from total alienation, and it felt like the story was starting to turn into a worst case scenerio. Sometimes these issues that seem real and boring to us, become the most villainous obstacles comic book writers can think of. This book deserves all the credit we can give it, but I'll note that I deducted one star, because it wasn't nearly as entertaining as the first series. It's getting there, but this book is mainly a stage-setter. It's an awesome series and I can't stop reading it, but I'm letting you know that you'll probably always like the first volume more than the others.The story continues and Millar finds away to keep the drama alive. Any comic book reader is missing out if he passes up on this series. Pick this one up, and trust me, you will be DYING for the conclusion."},{"Title":"The Ultimates 2, Vol. 1: Gods and Monsters","review":"It is official..

Transported by the alternate deliria of pain and his morphine, Tom regards his existence from a distance while visiting with his constant companions: physical agony, God, and lyrical verse. The poems also help us understand the life of a man who watched his older brother succumb at an early age to the same disease, but who would not let it kill his spirit. (The title refers to his days as a teenage motocross rider, who would infuse himself with clotting factors to allow him not to die from minor injuries while racing his bike wearing a jersey emblazoned with the slogan \\"Powered by Christ.\\") The piece \\"Praying With George Herbert In Late Winter\\" will touch the heart of any reader who has survived a dark period of their life through the succor of poetry. Tom's religious faith is not lambent, but hard-bitten: \\"I can say there is a larger something inside me./ I can say, 'Gratitude/ is a strange country.'/But what/ would I give/ to live there?\\" As someone with little stock in organized Christianity, I found Tom Andrews compelling and ferocious.

H. Lawrence. Edited by John Worthen with an introduction and notes by Brian Finney. Recommended.------------------------------------------------------------------------In The Prussian Officer and Other Stories, D. H. Lawrence explores in short story form the themes that dominate many of his best-known novels. \\"The Daughters of the Vicar,\\" for example, echoes both Women in Love and Sons and Lovers, where one relationship is out of balance and the other shows some promise, and where a son is in near-complete subjection to his mother-even after her death. The question left unanswered at the end of \\"Daughters\\" is whether collier Alfred Durant will be any more successful at forming a lasting relationship with Louisa than artist Paul Morel was. The answer would seem to be \\"yes\\" since he and Louisa are to be married soon-although in the other stories, marriage does not mean a meaningful or lasting relationship has been achieved. It's up to reader speculation whether they will end up like the couple in \\"The White Stocking\\" or the couple in \\"The Odour of Chrysanthemums.\\"Lawrence's world is focused on dominance and subjection, whether sexual, social, or economic, and the resulting imbalances. For all their social loftiness, the vicar's family is as poor or poorer than the uneducated colliers whom coal mining (ironically) elevates economically if not socially. As in the mines, there is a going down and coming up of the classes, with the declining rural gentry no better off than the rising class of miners and their managers. Lawrence experienced the mixing of these disparate groups in his own family, with his educated and domineering mother and his ignorant and brutal father. It's not difficult to find the origins of Elizabeth and Walter Bates in \\"The Odour of Chrysanthemums.\\" In this story, Lawrence overtly articulates the alienation the wife feels from her husband, once death has given her the objective distance to realise it.While compelling, this story demonstrates what I believe is Lawrence's predominant weakness-a heavy handedness of the author's voice in the narration of thought. Across all the stories (and the novels), his characters have similar thoughts and reactions, often expressed in similar terms that seem unlikely and unnatural for those particular characters. In many cases, you could lift entire sentences and even passages with little revision and transplant them seamlessly into any of his other stories or novels. While most critics, better informed than I about Lawrence's social and cultural milieu and his artistic intent, understand this as part of his \\"metaphysic,\\" I find it artificial and tiresome. Reading so many stories together in a compressed time period highlights their similarities in theme, tone, and point of view.As an example, this passage sounds less like the voice of the wife of a dead collier and than that of Lawrence himself: \\"There were the children-but the children belonged to life. This dead man had nothing to do with them. He and she were only channels through which life had flowed to issue in the children.\\" At a certain level, many of Lawrence's characters have no voice that is recognizable as their own-only as his. They are in subjugation to his dominance, which burdens and overwhelms this collection.Two stories that stand out are set in the military: \\"The Prussian Officer\\" (originally \\"Honour and Arms\\") and \\"The Thorn in the Flesh.\\" In the former, a young orderly revenges himself on his rigid and sexually sadistic captain, then dies blindly to restore the balance. In the latter, the runaway soldier and his country servant girlfriend find spiritual elevation and detachment from their mundane concerns in their sexual unification. They are free to face the repercussions of their respective transgressions with indifference. \\"A Fragment of Stained Glass\\" is memorable for its medieval setting, sadism, and eeriness, but is flawed by a particularly weak ending that adds nothing and detracts from the tale's previous tone.The Prussian Officer and Other Stories is a must for anyone interested in Lawrence and his development. Most of these stories are unforgettable, partly because of their symbolism and partly because they integrate pieces of Lawrence's overarching metaphysic. As a side note, my favourite Lawrence story-indeed, one of my favourite short stories by any author-is not part of this collection: the haunting \\"The Rocking-Horse Winner.\\"------------------------------------------------------------------------6 September 2004.Diane L.

Not quite pleased with it."},{"Title":"The Tactical 1911: The Street Cop's And SWAT Operator's Guide To Employment And Maintenance","review":"I recently picked up a copy of this book and just now finished reading it, and I must say that I found it to be quite informative although there were some areas that I felt were lacking for better descriptions. The author covers a lot of basic ground concerning the 1911 pistol and various ways to improve upon a out-of-the-box 1911 in order to optimize it to its fullest potential. This is all fine and good, but if you want to play it smart and cut some corners, just spend the money up front right from the start and get a 1911 that is customized right from the factory like a Kimber, or go completely custom with a Wilson Combat, Ed Brown, Nighthawk, etc.Some of the material is old hat for those of us familiar with the 1911, so if that is the case, you may not find this book as useful as others might who aren't as familiar with this particular firearm. The author covers all the basics from safety, proper handling, and maintenance to various different types of customizations that can be done on a basic 1911 in order to get the absolute best out of it. However, always remember that more often than not the problems lie with the shooter, not the firearm being shot.I also felt that there needed to be more photographs and illustrations throughout the book as it would have helped considerably when the author was describing certain techniques. Overall the book was well done and I only actually rated it at 4.5 stars, but because we don't have a half-star rating feature I gave it four stars instead of five primarily due to the lack of photographs and illustrations to clarify some of the various techniques being described in the book.I do have one nagging question though concerning this statement from the book located on page number 61 in the last paragraph where the author states;\\"The ability to re-holster one-handed is vital. In close encounters, your weak arm will often be busy fending off an assailant while your strong arm re-holsters. Deescalating from firearm to hands-on control is very likely.\\"WHAT? I am absolutely clueless concerning this statement and would readily welcome any correspondence that could make sense of this statement for me. Here is what I am having difficulty with...1. If in fact drawing my firearm was justified, why in the world would I re-holster my already drawn firearm if I am still fending off my assailant? Why wouldn't I just shoot him?2. If you had to draw your firearm in the first place, why would you deescalate to re-holstering your firearm and then going hand-to-hand?Shawn KovacichNRA Firearms Instructor/Krav Maga InstructorAuthor and Creator of numerous books and DVD's."},{"Title":"The Tactical 1911: The Street Cop's And SWAT Operator's Guide To Employment And Maintenance","review":"I thought this book has a lot of excellent information in it about the workings of the gun, possible modifications and some great tactical combat training chapters.

A great deal of Hausa scholarship is evident in the book and a real feeling for the people and the culture. The section on pronunciation is particularly valuable. Grammar and syntax are dealt with very clearly and very thoroughly. My one criticism of this book is that it needs audio support (read: tapes and/or CD). Although the explanation of the sounds of the tonal and intonational contours of Hausa is good, there really is no substitute for hearing it. The UCLA Hausa page will help a lot with learning to make the individual sounds (if you have sound files, of course) but there's no substitute for hearing spoken dialogues.

It will help all Christians to see their role to support their leaders. It is written by an associate pastor who discovered these truths about his role in regards to his head pastor. Yet anyone who serves in a church can learn from these short lessons. Weather you're a small group leader, a eucharistic minister, worship leader - if you serve the body of Christ in any kind of role, this book will help you serve better.Often people take one role in serving the church and see it as a stepping tone to advancement to a \`higher' or \`better' role. That is not he case. We are to serve our leaders and serve them well. \`We have got to start seeing our position as one called and instituted by God. We must be willing to stay in it for the rest of our lives, if that is what God wants.' p.46Through serving the leaders in the church we are fulfilling part of our vocational call and helping to build up the whole body of Christ.Nance has some great insights that he shares with us: \\"We can see that the most important part of the Armorbearing is a ministry of prayer, watchfulness, and intercession. The Armorbearer is to prove his sincerity, loyalty, and courage in the spirit realm through prayer and intercession.\\" p.52 and he emphatically states: \\"Every child of God, from leaders on down, needs to develop the character of an armorbearer. I believe that, right now in the Body of Christ, we need teaching on the development of the character of Christ. We have learned a lot about faith, prosperity and intercession, but I feel we have got to place more emphasis on character development.\\" p.61 Nothing could be closer to the truth. Much of Josemaria Escriva's writings on the Christian life have that same emphasis. His books, The Way, Furrow and The Forge, each have sections dedicated to character.The role of the Armorbearer is also for the whole body, \\"We are God's armorbearers. We are to carry the shield for one another, joining our faith together. If we will do that, we will truly become God's Great Army. We will go forth to conquer in the power of the Holy Spirit.\\" p.63 But being an armorbearer also takes perseverance, and fortitude. We are told: \\"Discover what your course is, and then stay with it and never give up until you have reached your God-ordained destination and goal.\\" p.74.Finally I would like to leave you with two more quotes from the book. First: \\"It is time for us to re-evaluate our lives, and our ministries, to make sure that we are where we need to be and doing what we need to be doing.\\" p.79 And second: \\"The spirit of the armorbearer is the Spirit of Christ. This is the day we see that God's children should take up the shields of others and be willing to carry them forth into battle.\\" p.79.This book will definitely challenge your faith and how you live it out.Also Available in this series:God's Armor Bearer Book II:Bloom Where Your PlantedTerry NanceHarrison HouseISBN: 0892747331God's Armor Bearer Book I & IICombine EditionTerry NanceDestiny Image PublishersISBN: 0971919321God's Armor Bearer Book IIIRunning With Your Pastor's VisionTerry NanceDestiny Image PublishersISBN: 076842299X"},{"Title":"God's Armor Bearer: How to Serve God's Leaders","review":"This book was, and continues to be a very important part of my ministry, it helped me discover who I am in Christ with relation to the Man Of God that I've been called along side to serve under.

The problem I ran into when teaching this course was that there are denominations that actually have the position of \\"Amorbearer\\" built into their structure. That makes it difficult for them to see the importance of this work.This is coupled with the preface which leads you into the frame of reference that people are raised up to protect the pastor. Friends, look at the TITLE of the book; it reads GOD'S ARMORBEARER. If you'll recognize that God has chosen YOU and honored YOU to carry HIS armor (not the pastor's) this book takes on a whole different meaning. Does God need armor? Of course not, but it is HIS armor that we are to wear (Eph. 6:11-18) and in doing so become His armorbearers. The one thing that should be coupled with this teaching is that of putting others above yourself. Actually, I think it IS in there. Phil. 2:1-11 talks about taking on the mind of Christ, and in doing so, making ourselves lower than our brothers and sisters in Christ. Placing their needs above our own. When you put these 2 thoughts together you have one awesome message. One that must be met. It gets the children of God off the pews and into God's service.

That day I felt truly blessed.PROS: This book describes a team relationship in which the team members are willing to lay down their own self interests for the leader. The author equates those working for the pastor with Old Testament armor bearers to the kings. Any leader would be humbled to be the recepient of such loyalty and faithfulness.CONS: These ideas do contain danger. The leader must be an honorable person. Power hungry leaders could take advantage of such support. This book, written from the perspective of the support team, needs to be balanced with a similar book of godly leadership in which the leader copies Jesus and leads on his or her knees with a washbasin and a towel."},{"Title":"God's Armor Bearer: How to Serve God's Leaders","review":"This book is a MUST READ for anyone called to the ministry.

Ministry Leaders cannot do every single thing in the church, that is why it is your job to step up to the plate and get off from warming the bench and stop watching everyone else play the game. We as servants must help fulfill the God given vision given to our Apostle or Pastor and God will ensure that our own visions and dreams come to pass. We must bloom where we are planted and be willing to submit not only to God, but also to the leaders He has set over us.1 Peter 4:10 sums it up plainly: &quot;Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms.&quot; - 1 Peter 4:10 NIV"},{"Title":"God's Armor Bearer: How to Serve God's Leaders","review":"This book will help you gain an understanding of how to come along side your leader and how being a good servant of that leader can bring success to your own life.

It will help all Christians to see their role to support their leaders. It is written by an associate pastor who discovered these truths about his role in regards to his head pastor. Yet anyone who serves in a church can learn from these short lessons. Weather you're a small group leader, a eucharistic minister, worship leader - if you serve the body of Christ in any kind of role, this book will help you serve better.Often people take one role in serving the church and see it as a stepping tone to advancement to a \`higher' or \`better' role. That is not he case. We are to serve our leaders and serve them well. \`We have got to start seeing our position as one called and instituted by God. We must be willing to stay in it for the rest of our lives, if that is what God wants.' p.46Through serving the leaders in the church we are fulfilling part of our vocational call and helping to build up the whole body of Christ.Nance has some great insights that he shares with us: \\"We can see that the most important part of the Armorbearing is a ministry of prayer, watchfulness, and intercession. The Armorbearer is to prove his sincerity, loyalty, and courage in the spirit realm through prayer and intercession.\\" p.52 and he emphatically states: \\"Every child of God, from leaders on down, needs to develop the character of an armorbearer. I believe that, right now in the Body of Christ, we need teaching on the development of the character of Christ. We have learned a lot about faith, prosperity and intercession, but I feel we have got to place more emphasis on character development.\\" p.61 Nothing could be closer to the truth. Much of Josemaria Escriva's writings on the Christian life have that same emphasis. His books, The Way, Furrow and The Forge, each have sections dedicated to character.The role of the Armorbearer is also for the whole body, \\"We are God's armorbearers. We are to carry the shield for one another, joining our faith together. If we will do that, we will truly become God's Great Army. We will go forth to conquer in the power of the Holy Spirit.\\" p.63 But being an armorbearer also takes perseverance, and fortitude. We are told: \\"Discover what your course is, and then stay with it and never give up until you have reached your God-ordained destination and goal.\\" p.74.Finally I would like to leave you with two more quotes from the book. First: \\"It is time for us to re-evaluate our lives, and our ministries, to make sure that we are where we need to be and doing what we need to be doing.\\" p.79 And second: \\"The spirit of the armorbearer is the Spirit of Christ. This is the day we see that God's children should take up the shields of others and be willing to carry them forth into battle.\\" p.79.This book will definitely challenge your faith and how you live it out.Book IIBook two is just as good as Book I in this series. Also as I mentioned in my reviews of Book I there is also now available a combined book I & II as well as a newer Book III.Nance Starts off with his reason for writing this second volume \\"I feel such an urgency about each member of the Body of Christ finding his place and remaining faithful, so we can be productive in God's Kingdom.\\" p.11. This is the main premise of this second book, that each Christian has a role and responsibility to serve the body based upon gifts and calling. Each of us as Christians, if we have been called also have a job to do, Nance States: \\"God has a purpose in life for you to fulfill. You are not here by accident. You have a destiny in God to fulfill. You must find out your purpose by seeking God.\\" p.21 Yet the journey to the God given goals and dreams in our lives will not be easy.Nance tell us that \\"If you do not exercise faith in life to reach a goal or vision, you will never achieve it. You are going to have to get up and work toward your goal.\\" p.27 Growing in the spiritual life is work and much like getting the body into shape, the spiritual life requires a workout plan, moderation of intake (books, TV, Movies...) and discipline. If we are faithful and diligent in the small things God may call us to greater things or reveal more gifts in us. \\"You also have talents in your life that will come forward as you trust God's grace n the small things. We are what we are by His Grace. If you always obey His Original Instructions, you will see things begin to work.\\" p. 32 and \\"God wants to develop His character in you before He Exalts your ministry.\\" p. 33. God cares about who we are on the inside far far more than what we present to others on the outside. Our whole live in Christ comes down to Character and obedience. Without those two it is all for naught. Nance later States: \\"I believe God is challenging us to take steps of faith that we have never taken before. God wants to move us out of our comfort zones.\\" p.34 The Christian life will not often be the easy path or the past of least resistance, and much more so for those who try to serve Christ as a leader. To become a leader your must serve your leaders faithfully and with a pure heart.If we look at the parable of the sower, we as Christians are not all one type of seed. \\"God determined the type of seed you are and where you were to be planted.\\" p.19 Therefore like Nance stated in the subtitle of this book we should \`Bloom Where You Are Planted' We each have specific fruits we are to bring to the Body and serve the body by using our fruits well for the Glory of God!Also Available in this series:God's Armor Bearer Book II:Bloom Where Your PlantedTerry NanceHarrison HouseISBN: 0892747331God's Armor Bearer Book I & IICombine EditionTerry NanceDestiny Image PublishersISBN: 0971919321God's Armor Bearer Book IIIRunning With Your Pastor's VisionTerry NanceDestiny Image PublishersISBN: 076842299XBooks I & II have also been translated into 4 different languages all available at Amazon.com."},{"Title":"God's Armor Bearer: How to Serve God's Leaders","review":"I found this the best written, most practical, and most encouraging book yet for associate pastors or anyone in christian ministry. I think it would form the basis of a great leadership training class for churches. I plan on using it in teaching the leadership of our church. Great read!"},{"Title":"God's Armor Bearer: How to Serve God's Leaders","review":"All of the reviews are correct. This is an awesome book, as is Armor Bearers II. Our entire church participated in bible studies on these two books. All Christians are called to be Armor Bearers, not just the leaders. Our leaders need our support. We need to be a help, not a drain. Read the building of the wall in Nehemiah. We are all called to build our part of the wall with a sword in one hand and a tool in the other. And while we build, we need to stand firm with our leaders."},{"Title":"God's Armor Bearer: How to Serve God's Leaders","review":"An excellent book, easy to read with real-life examples.

That being said, this book does more to encourage than it does to chastize. It is truly a work that causes you to think and pray about attitude and dedication to your pastor. I'd recomend it to every Christian!"},{"Title":"God's Armor Bearer: How to Serve God's Leaders","review":"I read this book as a requirement for a job application for a Christian ministry and was not really sure what to expect.I was pleasantly surprised by the book and really appreciated the insights given by the associate pastor who authored the book. I have grown up as \\"PK\\" or pastor's kid and have seen many rebellious and independent minded parishoners over the years wreak havoc in the church. They had an agenda and were going to pursue it no matter what leadership thought about it or what the church staff may have felt the leading of the Lord was for the congregation.If you are not an associate pastor or other lay person on staff at a church you may have to think a little harder how this book applies to you as you read it but it is worth the extra effort. The idea of honoring the very responsibility laden position pastors have with support, prayer and loyalty is a lesson for all of us. If we laid our personal agendas down and instead offered loyal service to our pastors we can fully expect God to honor us and fulfill our purpose here on the earth.I feel that many people out of fear believe that if they do not MAKE their ministry happen it will be lost but Jesus said we must lose our lives to find them. I think this is the essence of what Mr. Nance is saying an armorbearer must do.I know there are some negative reactions against this book but I caution that the author clearly states that this book is written for church members working with Godly pastors who are in obedience to the Word and not people operating completely outside of the Word of God and truth. Matthew 18 clearly lays out a pattern for church discipline and I do not believe that Mr. Nance is preaching the idea of condoning sin.The idea is to be loyal, supportive and willing to do spiritual battle for our leaders. Praying for them when they stumble and doing everything to restore them instead of tearing them down. Because after all, isn't this what we would wish for ourselves when we go through a tough time? How much more do our church leaders need this support!It is a very short book and easy to read but really full of wisdom and encouragement. I definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"God's Armor Bearer: How to Serve God's Leaders","review":"Terry Nance really opens up the meaning of the Armor Bearer, I am a Pastor and have been for many years and from very early on in Pastoring someone put this book in my hands. I can't tell you how thankful I am to the person who did this great service for me. It helped me understand my role as an associate Pastor, now I had heard of Armor Bearer before but the examples I had seen well lets just say that... getting a cup of water or carry someone Bible or wiping the sweat off there brow while they are preaching is nothing compared to the tasks of a real Armor Bearer. If you desire to move to the next leave in Christ Jesus this is a must buy, it will teach you the secrets to really lifting up a man or woman of God and in turn bring you closer to your God (Jesus) and the man or woman you severe under so that both you and them can be more effect in the ministry God has given you."},{"Title":"God's Armor Bearer: How to Serve God's Leaders","review":"The book is in excellent condition and it is a wonderful read.

It's model of servanthood within the body is backwards. If you want to be great in the Kingdom you must first be a servant. The Bible emphasizes servanthood leadership not the otherway around. The assumption that authority rests within just pastors, apostles or the like is not true, it rests within the WHOLE BODY OF CHRIST. The book is really a slam to the priesthood of the believer.

You can see how she uses her whole body to change from the loving Odette (in white) to the cruel Odile (in black). One reservation: I wouldn't use this book to introduce children to the ballet. The bold theatrical makeup, designed to be visible from the audience, is almost overwhelming in the closeup photos. For a child, Rachel Isadora's illustrations are a better introduction to the story. Still, Ellison's book is a &quot;must-buy&quot; for balletomanes and Nina fans."},{"Title":"Swan Lake","review":"My 5 year-old is into ballet and just loves this book which I bought used for 5 dollars.

Cartoons","review":"I liked what most of the reviewers had to say about this book. For anybody who is a fan of the animated Warner Bros. cartoons, this book is a must for you. It's hard to keep up with the titles of certain cartoons (I mean how many people know the singing frog cartoon as &quot;One Froggy Evening&quot; or the cartoon featuring &quot;Tea For Two&quot; with the tapdance duet with Bugs and Daffy as &quot;Show Biz Bugs&quot;?).This guide deals with them all (one reviewer says this is 1,000)- from the beginning with the black and white Bosco cartoons (1930)to the early days of Porky Pig (no, Mel Blanc was not the original voice; he didn't supply Porky's voice until about 1938), to the evolution of Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd (Mel Blanc was not the original voice of this character either; Arthur Q Bryan was), Daffy Duck, Tweety, Speedy Gonzales, the 1st color Looney Tune (circa 1942), to the introduction of Yosemite Sam, Sylvester, the Roadrunner and Coyote, Sylvester, jr, the Tasmanian Devil (who became very famous despite the fact that he was only in about 4 cartoons during this period of 4 decades), to the closing of the Warner Bros studio in 1969 (whose final days brought us many forgettable catoon characters like Cool Cat and Merlin the Magical Mouse).It mentions who directed each cartoon (Friz Freleng, Chuck Jones, Bob Clampett, Tex Avery, and others) who composed the music (often Carl Stalling or Milt Franklyn), and includes a synopsis of each and every cartoon.A lot of hard work went into putting this together, obviously. If you loved these cartoons as a kid and still do, this book is for you! Th-th-th-th-that's all, folks!"},{"Title":"Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies: A Complete Illustrated Guide to the Warner Bros.

Do you understand the magnitude of that statement?Warner Bros made approximately 1,000 animated shorts between 1930 and 1970. I watched many of them numerous times while growing up. There are lots of others that I have never seen. But at least with this book, I now know what is out there."},{"Title":"Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies: A Complete Illustrated Guide to the Warner Bros. Cartoons","review":"If you like me grew up watching those great old Warner brothers cartoons and still love them, this book is for you. Listing virtually every cartoon the Warner brothers studio put out from the 1930s through the late 1980s was quite a task. And I'm sure Beck &amp; Friedwald must have thought it would never end (&quot;sayyyy, there's something awfully screwwy goin on around here!&quot; to quote Elmer Fudd).Yeah by year each cartoon that was ever made is listed, complete with the people who produced it, date of original release, list of characters, and the plot and story of the cartoon. There's even a list at the back of the book of all the network TV cartoon specials.If you've ever read anything about the cartoonists that did these cartoons, you know they were probably a bit loony themselves. But Thank God, they had such a creative outlet for their looneyness!The book is 11 years old, and I would love to see an updated version.

Each one has been watched and thought about in what must have been a gruelling marathon of cartoon watching (I am SOOO jealous), resulting in a good review (and list of credits) for each and every cartoon made by the studio including some of the offshoots like Pvt Snafu and the cartoons released in the 1980s.

We would not get an appreciation of the sheer number of cartoons produced. Luckily Beck and Friedwald were obsessed enough to pull them all together in one volume. Going on a year by year basis, from Bosko cartoons of 1930 to the last gasps of 1969 (and the reawakening in the 80's) the authors provide a landmark reference showing the premiere date, the credits given in the openings, and a thorough synopsis of the action. But of course any reference like this would be an oddity if it was just a listing. But we are provided with two ways to find information - a title index showing the entry (all purpose for grabbing when watching that cartoon), and an index based upon appearances of 15 of the most popular characters. Want to find out when did Marvin the Martian appear? It's here. (1948 - Haredeveil Hare). Wonder how many cartoons starred Daffy Duck - count 'em up. (a whole lot) Just sitting back and reading synopses shows the breadth of jokes and settings that the artists were able to take advantage of. You can also see the repetition that occured when the writers fell into a rut.

Cartoons","review":"Here is an illustated guide to the Warner Bros. cartoons commonly known as LOONEY TUNES AND MERRIE MELODIES. Every cartoon was either a Looney Tune or Merrie Melodie. These include both the short subjects and feature films. One of WB's biggest cartoon stars,Bugs Bunny appeared in tens of cartoons in a 25 year period,1940 to 1964. Bugs' first official appearance was in 1940's A WILD HARE. A few earlier cartoons such as PRESTO CHANGE-O,HARE-UM SCARE-UM and ELMER'S CANDID CAMERA(featuring Elmer Fudd) featured a similar-looking prototype. WB's other big stars include Daffy Duck who debuted in or around 1938. The star's name appeared in some titles of his cartoons such as DAFFY DUCK &amp; EGGHEAD,DAFFY DUCK IN HOLLYWOOD and DAFFY DUCK AND THE DINOSAUR. Same thing with Bugs Bunny(BUGS BUNNY AND THE THREE BEARS,BASEBALL BUGS,BUGS BUNNY RIDES AGAIN and BUGS BUNNY GETS THE BOID). Also Elmer Fudd(ELMER'S CANDID CAMERA,ELMER'S PET RABBIT and GOODNIGHT ELMER). Other big stars are Sylvester,a mean-spirited cat always wanting to kill sweet little canary Tweety. Later stars include Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote,Speedy Gonzales and Foghorn Leghorn(Foghorn first appeared in the 40's). There's also Porky Pig who first appeared in the 1935 Merrie Melodie I HAVEN'T GOT A HAT. Porky starred in many black and white Looney Tunes since that cartoon. This book lists synopses for every cartoon produced by WB. It also gives release dates and production credits with directors. I like the awesome concept of the variously colored rings bordering the beginning and end title cards. Over the years,they changed colors. The sizes changed also as did the studio logo(the original light blue changed to red). Some cartoons made between 1937 and 1940 featured multi-colored rings. WB still produces short subject cartoons occasionally but does more feature films today. This book went to press before the 1996 release of SPACE JAM,a semi-animated film starring basketball great Michael Jordan and featuring WB's cartoon stars. I dedicate the book to the memories of longtime director Chuck Jones,actor-director tex Avery(Jones and Avery later went to MGM),Mel Blanc(voice of Bugs Bunny) and actress Bea Benaderet who later appeared on TV's The Beverly Hillbillies and starred on Petticoat Junction."},{"Title":"Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies: A Complete Illustrated Guide to the Warner Bros.
