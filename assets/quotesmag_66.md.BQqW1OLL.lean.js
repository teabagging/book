In this book, Carroll writes about a seven year old English girl named, Alice, Who has stumbled into this insane and curious world. In her confusion to find reasonable explanations for this precarious adventure, Alice comes across quite a few unusual characters, including a White Rabbit, whom Alive had followed down the rabbit hole in her curiosity and a shy mouse whom she almost drowned with her tears. As Alice struggles with her internal conflicts of who she is and what has become of her, she came across a blue caterpillar sitting atop a mushroom, languidly puffing on a hookah and after an infuriatingly absurd conversation, Alice continued her journey onward. At last, Alice parades strait into the presence of the demanding Red King and Queen, and finds herself in very unique situations.In, Alice's adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, I occasionally found it hard to follow the sequence of events in which the story is laid out on account of my confusion at weather Alice was speaking dialogue or internal monologue. Although, Lewis Carroll includes in his stories, fictional characters from children books, which gives it a sense of adolescence; he also includes an Extensive, complex and chaotic game of chess, giving the book a more sophisticated feel. In Lewis Carroll's stories, I admire his creativity and originality with using fictional characters, but dislike the stories' structure and format. Considering everything, I would recommend this book to anybody because it meets the expectations of a classic, a fantasy fiction, and a children's novel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Charles Dodgson and the British Imperial ImaginationLewis Carroll (real name Charles Dodgson) was a clergyman and mathematician. His delightful Alice In Wonderland is a feat of mythic imagination and fantasy that conjures an absurd vision of an alternate possible world, while also providing a biting satire of British culture, in the tradition of Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.Alice's tumble down the rabbit hole is the trigger for an imaginative flight of fancy about the structure of the world. Alice fears that she may fall through the middle of the planet to Australia, where people walk on their heads. This spatial referencing for Wonderland is important as a link to the colonial and imperial imagination of Victorian England. The pace of change and development of empire is such that traditional verities are thrown into radical doubt, and the possibility can be entertained of a journey through the looking glass to a land of wonder down under (like the journey from Kansas to Oz).Each of the characters in Alice in Wonderland can be assessed as social satire. Old Father William references the imaginary Australian spatial framework by standing on his head to guarantee his health. The impotent bullying by the Queen, the languid dream of the caterpillar, the madness of the hatter and hare, the card soldiers, and Alice as a quizzical rational person who takes all at face value, each is amusing because it touches a cultural nerve.The British Empire in its age of confidence almost thought that all things might be possible through science and industry and military might. Dodgson takes this cultural pride to an absurd logical conclusion, where chemical potions can rapidly change the size of objects and where the treasures of nature, such as flamingos and hedgehogs, are instruments for pleasure in an absurd game of croquet, like indulgent ancient Romans collecting rarities from the far corners of the earth.Humpty Dumpty is perhaps the most imperial satirical fool of all. His assertion that words mean what he wants them to mean is rather like the colonial settler, seeking to construct a new world in ignorance and defiance of established reality. Dodgson uses this parable as the occasion for wry logical observations about the absurdity of popular psychology.The popularity of Alice in Wonderland reflects the power of the vivid imaginative fantasy world of whimsy that Dodgson created, as an alternate myth to the orthodox imperial pride in British accomplishment. There is a self-deprecation, deflating the imperial orthodoxy with its surface blindness to the stupidity and confusion of Britain's growth. Looking back to Swift, and forward to the Goons and Monty Python, Dodgson voices a British self-doubt which was actually rather prophetic, in that the house of cards of empire eventually proved highly vulnerable."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"This is a fun read you can see where they get the ideas for all the movies from.

Gorgeous books, in exactly the condition described. Wow!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"The story of Alice in Wonderland 1 and 2 is a well thought story that brings you to a place of \\"nonsense\\". The way Lewis Carrol wrote it has to do a lot about politics and the way of reality. Alice always thinks what's the point of a book that shows nothing interesting whatsoever? Well later on she discovers that there are a few reasons why s some things are not nonsense. These are some of the nonesense things; Drinks make you shrink, cakes make you grow, cats can dissapear, and flowers can sing. Some of the things Alice does can be thought as lessons, the sentence \\"Curiosity killed that cat\\" is used in other ways in the story, starting with chasing a rabbit down a tunnle.

Carroll puts them all to shame. Both books are filled with puns, absurd comedy, and rhymes and riddles. The first book is more constantly interesting than the second, which slows down at parts (such as during Alice's long conversation with the White Knight).In Alice in Wonderland, I loved the exposition of logical relationships during the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. Her exchange with the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle is also fun. Although I didn't enjoy Through the Looking Glass quite as much, Alice's interaction with Tweedledum and Tweedledee and then later with Humpty Dumpty are great. (Humpty Dumpty illuminates the poem \\"Jabberwocky\\" by providing his own definitions of all the nonsense words.)I listened to an unabridged audio version performed by Donada Peters (published by Books on Tape, Inc.): Peters was Excellent.

Though it is a shortened phrase from the original, I was intrigued at the message that this book gives to a grownup. There are some books that was clever satires of their times, which has been 'downgraded' to the level of children's books like &quot;Gulliver's Travel' or 'The Little Prince.&quot; Clearly, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; also has some of it. Although Lewis Carroll may not have thought of it, what he told the three girls on that fateful day is for also all past-children who are now grownups. Actually, it seems that it was an interpretation of the grown-ups world for the children through the eyes of this little girl, Alice, who also happens to be the person who insisted that this Oxford-Mathematician publish the story that he told her.

Lewis Carroll creates a wonderful fantasy world for young children but the appeal was not there for me. The separate worlds of both stories are chaotic but they pave a way of mystery and suspense. The characters Carroll creates are great and each one is different from the next and you are never sure what or whom Alice will meet next. The downfall for me in these two stories was that neither one had a well thought out plot. For I could tell Alice was wondering to two different worlds not knowing where she was going or why she was there. Some people may find this type of writing great but I find it almost pointless. There is a good twist to the ending of Through the Looking Glass that leaves the reader somewhat puzzled. Although this book had little point to me, I could read it without getting bored, for something strange or absurd happened every other page.

Well if you haven't, &quot;Don't&quot;. Overall it wasn't that bad of a book, but it was extremely confusing. In my opinion this book could have been written a lot better. For example, it could have been alot less confusing and more realistic. The main reason I didn't exactly enjoy Alice in Wonderland was because it needed to be more happy,then unhappy. Here are some more reasons why you should not read this boring book. Alice in Wonderland could have been written a lot better. The author's language usage was a bit hard to comprehend,like when the caterpillar was talking to Alice about a crocodile and when the cat was giving Alice directions. Also, the scenes were short and they jumped right into each other too quickly. Most of the animals were rude and mean to Alice. The flowers shooed her away, the queen tried to cut off her head and the cat was always making her angry by lying. Another part that didn't make any sense was the tea party,there's no such thing aa a &quot;Very Merry Unbirthday&quot;. Also the Mad Hatter and the Hare wouldn't listen to Alice when she was trying to tell her story. All the creatures and animals kept Alice from what she was trying to do which was to follow the white rabbit. Alice met many,many creatures such as Tweedle Dee,Tweedle Dum,Do Do,Bill, Rabbit,Cat,Queen of Hearts,Caterpillar,Playing cards,Mad Hatter,Hare,Flowers,Pig and the Door Knob. This book made me just as frustrated and upset as it made Alice.I felt like I was in the book and I could feel all the confusion and nonsense going on. If I had to give my overall opinion of how good the book was I would give it 2 stars.So, in conclusion I would like to let everyone know that Alice in Wonderland was not worth reading, so don't waste your time! Go get yourself an interesting book to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was an extremely ridiculous and confusing book. The characters were mis leading and Alice was very annoying (from the little details I read throughout the book). This book would be a good for fantasy lovers, but to me it was unrealistic and childish. Some of the things the characters said and did in the story were confusing and somewhat complicated. I don't know if I would recommend this book to younger children because of its wording, but it was a child-like book and would attract young readers in a way. The writer writes in a unusual, seemingly &quot;old fashioned&quot; way. You could tell the book wasn't written recently by the language usage. Alice is a young girl who is very bright and adventurous. On her way down to Wonderland, she meets alot of new characters. Some are decieving like the treaser cat but all of the very intresting and USUAL, such as the Mad Hater, The Queen of Hearts, etc. The way the author worded things in the book, made me get confused and unintrested. I had no desire in reading it after the first few pages. I thought the book was far fetched, and seriously i wouldn't recommend this book to teens or children."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"The first thing that must be said for anyone who's seen Disney's Alice in Wonderland and wants to read the book because they loved it so much is beware. The book and the movie, while following the same story line, are nothing alike, and if you expect them to be you'll most likely end up as disappointed as I was.Perhaps it's because I grew up with the fluidly poetic Dr Zeus, or perhaps I just expected something that the book simply was not, but I found Carroll's tale bland and void of the essential, natural art to story-telling that all \\"absurd\\" imaginative pieces need to be enjoyable.Though I must give credit to Carroll for what I feel he deserves- in his time, this was a wildly fantastic book with a plethora of crazy characters, riddles, poetry and inspired plot twists that carry the reader around Wonderland with the famous protagonist.The Characters however, were truly brought to life by Disney to a degree unrealizable within the written format. I don't fault Carroll for this, but when you've seen the movie first...I also found the transitions between scenery and scenes to be lacking in impact because there is little distinction made between one place and the next. I realize that Carroll was describing a dream (which is vague by nature), but I feel that his writing could have accentuated the transitions to give the reader more involvement in the fading between one land and the next- what we have instead is something close to \\"Alice was walking in a forest and now she's crossing a river.\\" Call me picky, but such a lackluster transition is bound to bore.Most agitating were Penguin Classic's annotations that literally littered the text with information completely irrelevant to the story. Boasting on the back that my copy is \\"the most comprehensively annotated edition available\\", they weren't lying. To get this title though, they stuck an annotation into every nook and cranny manageable. By the end of the fifth chapter I almost threw the book out of the bus window because I had read more about Lewis Carroll's diary entries and queer habit of wearing gloves everywhere than of Alice herself. At that point I more or less stopped regarding the annotations at all- content instead to deny their existence rather than try my patience at reading them. I was upset at this because there were several places where an explanation, allusion or elaboration was truly helpful, but they were one in stack of fifty and the remaining forty-nine were just too painfully superfluous to sift throughThrough The Looking Glass also failed to leave an impression on me. It was a very simple extension of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, but in the same exact format, with the same trite transitions and utterly lackluster performances.I thought it was a painful struggle to finish Through The Looking Glass, and then found myself face to face with Carroll's original short story Alice's Adventures Underground- the original short story that he had written for the young daughter of a close friend which his friends had urged him to elaborate upon. Following that, I found an essay written by Carroll, Alice On Stage, about his thoughts on the cinematic production of his tale. I'm sorry; I just couldn't bring myself to bother. That was enough of Lewis Carroll for me.As I implied at the start, stick to Disney's movie. I love to read, but Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a story meant to be seen and heard, not read about."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I truly feel sorry for any child forced to read this book in school. Reading it as an adult was no better. It was possibly the most warped and perverse story I have ever read in my life.

It's quite clever to design a deck based on the classic &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot; Would have rated this deck higher except that it does NOT comes with an instruction book, but rather a quick-and-to-the-point pamphlet that truly simplifies the meanings of the cards. If, however, you are versed in the traditional Ryder-Waite deck then you should have no trouble skipping the pamphlet and using your own intuition. The suits have been reconfigured into flamingoes, oysters, hats, and peppermills, which can be quite confusing.

I didn't really like it. It didn't make any sense, I told my mother. It's not serious enough for me.But years later, at age twenty, I acted on a whim and read it a second time. And I was captivated. No other book matches Alice in humor, oddness, or bizarre characters. All the imitators (and there have been many) have failed because they couldn't manage to hold together their story's oddness with such a strong, flowing narrative or protaganist as lovable as Alice. Lewis Carroll's plot drifts effortlessly from one bizarre situation to another with sublime grace. His genius was that he went into the bizarre without going too far; his creativity never turned cheap.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is an adult's children book. I doubt that children will, or even can, enjoy it to the extent that adults will. When I read it at age nine I wanted it to have some kind of meaning, some raison d'etre--how ironic that now I'm an adult and its dreamlike feel is just the kind of break from reality I could use. Of course children can love these stories too, and I don't want to give anyone the idea that Alice and Looking Glass are stories only for adults. Your kids probably don't read anything other than the Harry Potter books, over and over, so why not give them something else?Some other things about Alice in Wonderland make it such a classic. It was unique in its time (and still so) for its complete lack of moralizing. It doesn't tell you how good boys and girls should act, or turn into a good-vs-evil tale. Its protaganist, Alice, has to be one of the greatest characters, female or otherwise, in all literature. Her cleverness and logic are Wonderful.So buy the book.

The difference is that while Tolkien was a philologist, Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) was a logician, so their slant on words and wordplay are a lot different. Tolkien is the poet of names and Carroll is the weaver of paradoxes and nonsense. Both, however, benefit from exegesis for those of us who are neither philologists nor logicians.Carroll's works also need heavy annotation for his references to people and events of his day as they are masked by metaphorical references in the Alice books.Reading these stories with Gardiner's annotations is virtually the only way to fully appreciate these works.

Lewis Carol was such a wonderful storyteller, full of imagination and creative use of the English language.This was two stories in one. The first, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, I thought had more imagination and he action seemed to flow faster with more scenes and challenges for Alice to deal with. The characters are fantastic and highly imaginative.The second story, Through the Looking Glass, also had a lot of imagination, but it didn't seem to have as fast a pace as the first book. Still, I found it fascinating as the story was done as if Alice were a chess piece moving across a chess board to reach the other side as a pawn to become a queen. As she moved up the chess board, she encountered different characters and situations.Highly recommended, even if it was written as a child's book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"When I was assigned Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass to read for my Victorian Literature class, I was excited. Even though I had heard Alice's Adventures in Wonderland referred to countless times throughout my youth, I had never read the story or seen the movie. I had never heard of Through the Looking Glass, but while reading, I realized that many people who think they are talking about AAIW are actually referring to TTLG. The two texts seem to be conflated in a way that makes them indistinguishable from each other. It is for this reason that I enjoyed reading this edition of the texts. There is only a page separating the two stories, which allows the reader to easily make the transition between them. This small separation also allows the reader to recognize the undeniable connection between the texts and to understand why many people combine them in their minds.AAIW is about a young girl named Alice whose boring day with her sister is interrupted when a white rabbit runs by her saying, \\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\" Alice's curiosity is aroused, but surprisingly not to a great degree. This is the first hint to the reader that Alice is not an average child, as she seems to believe that a talking rabbit is quite normal. She does become intrigued, though, when the rabbit produces a clock from his pocket, so she follows it down its hole and enters a world of wonder. I loved the story from this point on. It is filled with such unbelievable creatures and situations, but Carroll's writing style made me want to believe in a world that could be filled with so much magic and splendor. There was never a dull moment in the story, and each page was filled with more excitement. I will offer a warning, though. This story is not for those who like a neatly packaged plotline. It is written in a somewhat discontinuous nature and seems to follow some sort of dream logic where there are no rules. However, I enjoyed the nonsensical pattern. Without it, a dimension of the story would be lost. It offers some insight into the mind of a young, adventurous, fearless girl, and Carroll seems to be challenging his readers to be more like Alice.The second text in this book, TTLG, is again a story about Alice. In this adventure, Alice travels through a wondrous world on the other side of her looking glass. As in AAIW, Alice again encounters absurd creatures, such as live chess pieces and talking flowers. The land she travels through is an oversized chessboard, which gives this story a more structured plot than AAIW. The chess theme provides Alice with sense of what she must accomplish in the looking- glass world, and it provides the reader with a sense of direction throughout the story. Alice's goal is to become a chess queen, so the reader knows that when she becomes queen, the story will be over. However, just because the story has some structure does not mean that it is not just as wild and marvelous as its predecessor. I enjoyed all of the characters. They seem to have an endless supply of advice that people in the 21st century can still learn from. My favorite example is when the Red Queen says, \\"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!\\" Maybe what Carroll is suggesting is that if we read more nonsensical, unbelievable stories like his, we won't be so afraid to be adventurous and fearless like Alice; so that the next time a white rabbit runs by us, we might just see where it leads us."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Long time ago, I should have read this story as a child, but I don't remember how come I didn't, but I don't remember either how I came to know Alice so intimately, as if this was a legend that had leaked out to me and never to be forgotten. No doubt, this is one hell of a legend.The title itself belies it to be just a fantastical childhood tale but it is actually a book that will get adults curiouser and curiouser until all the puns that are intended to taunt the deluded adult world will boil down to giving you a crazy smile. I swear by a mouse's tail- these two Alice books are charming, and so full of funny, far-out characters. I cant resist being crazy with the mad tea-party, and the wacky game-story of cards and chess, of the chesire cat that is actually more charming than eerie, and of course, Alice who is smart, proud and always snappy. Although my favorite of all is the wise caterpillar who smokes a hookah and sits on a mushroom.And I love the drawing given by John Tenniel, and some text's visual presentation are supercool.Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass&quot; is actually a story of growing up, or more like a child's discovery of wisdom, or maybe an exploration of wisdom in a child's perspective. The setting of cards and chess is an allegory of the world of chance and determinism, and the pervasive foreshadowing of death seems silly but anyway childish. Sometimes I don't understand why the book is one of the most quoted. Perhaps because aside from being popular, I am sure this tale really brings out the child in anyone.Lewis Carroll might have only told this story to put a loquacious girl in silence but fortunately, he has not made a very simple fantasy. He has invented an Alice in a lot of us."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"It's a fantastic book, of course, and it certainly doesn't need me to praise it as millions have done before. It's probably one of the most unique things ever written: the only book that could be considered both completely a children's story and completely a book for adults. The only problem with the Penguin edition is that it's grossly over-annotated. For scholars this may be very helpful, but sadly enough a lot of the notes are either irrelevant to non-professors or provide critical instead of historical or biographical commentary which, in my opinion, ruins the greatest delight of the book: AAIW/TLG are highly interpretable and symbolic stories, but unfortunately the commentator is always interrupting like a nagging pedant before the reader has a chance to reflect. Once again, both stories well deserve their status as true English classics but another edition might be a better choice."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"How is a raven like a writing desk? Because it can produce a few notes, though they are very flat; and it is never put with the wrong end in front. That is an example of the witty offbeat humor in \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\".Alice is sitting bored when her attention is captured by a talking white rabbit. She follows it down a rabbit hole into a world full of strange creatures, curious happenings, and mysterious pastries. At first she marvels at all the oddities, but soon she wants to get home, only to discover that she doesn't know how.By far my favorite parts of this book are when Alice encounters the Cheshire Cat. He is very witty, and adds something special to the story. Also his grin is phenomonal.I think the theme of this book is really about using your imagination and letting your creative side get the best of you once in a while, not letting other things like television and the media do the imagining for you. That's also why the movie is totally hypocritical.The whole point of the book is using your imagination, and the \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" movie did the opposite of that. Despite it being created by the godfather of the animated film industry (Disney) it really sucked. They took out too much of the story just to squeeze it into 1 and a half hours and a G-rating. \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\" wasn't made for the big screen, considering its length and semi-annoying characters that if animated and given the life of Disney turn them into monsters that are enough to make even the most devout Catholic contemplate suicide. And the songs! Don't even get me started on those. Disney has to pump every movie it pushes out full of annoying constant 5-minute \\"songs\\" that give you ear worms for a month! They ruin everything they get their greasy little fingers on. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland used to be original and interesting and Disney went ahead, squeezed out all the creativity, shoved some songs into it, stamped their trademark on it, and shipped it out. They are sick, sick little people.Most of this book is quite entertaining, though there are a few parts that just seem stuck in there and were quite dull. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is a very original and interesting story, and if you've never read the book, do so. It is entirely worth it. If you haven't seen the movie, stay far, far away. For those of you who have, good luck with the nightmares. And those monstrous ear worms.-carli"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Find some children anywhere you can and read this book to them! I say this for your pleasure at least as much as theirs. Reading it out loud will be one of the delightful experiences of your life. Did I say \\"reading?\\" I should have said \\"performing,\\" because you will not be able to resist acting it out. Let yourself go--you will be a child again, yet still appreciate the book's adult insights.There is so much to say about this classic. It captures the psychology of a girl on the verge of growing up; it is full of jokes that appear absurd, but are fiendishly clever; it somehow avoids anything old-fashioned or politically incorrect; and absolutely all the characters are loveable, no matter how hard they try not to be.Carroll was an unhappy, aging man, yet he understood children to a spooky degree. While I smiled mildly at some of the humor, my children rolled around on the floor laughing.Here is an interesting phenomenon: When I read it as a child, I didn't particularly warm to it. When my children tried to read it on their own, they gave up. But the group experience of reading it out loud was a joy for all.Do I need to describe the plot? Could I if I tried? Alice may or may not be dreaming when she follows a rabbit down into his hole and enters a world where the simplest actions are strange and complicated. In her effort to explore this world and ultimately return home, nothing fits right, nothing seems to follow through properly, and no one she meets is sane. Alice, though a little girl, is given plenty of opportunities to be the rational, mature, assertive person of action.Everyone I discuss this book with, and I mean everyone, shudders and raises the issue of Carroll's alleged improprieties. They are invisible in the book, but to put your mind at ease, you may want to check out the judicious biography by Morton N. Cohen.The particular edition of Alice in Wonderland that I am reviewing, published by Grosset, is especially pleasant for reading out loud, with comfortable print, and Tenniel's essential illustrations."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"The books are outstanding classics and I have no complaints about them.The Kindle formatting leaves a bit to be desired.A functioning Contents page would be fantastic, especially if you want to skip ahead to the second book without having to manually flip through the pages.

Recently, I stumbled upon the book and started skimming it and I was completely blown away!!! There are so many brilliant layers of wit and humor between the lines which I never noticed as a kid. There are twists and turns and endless puns and word games with every turn of the page. This is as much a novel for adults as it is for kids, maybe even more so! Lewis Carroll was a creative genius and I can't think of another writer who has ever created characters more colorfully endearing and comically puzzling at the same time. I recommend this book to anybody who thinks it's just a children's tale because you will be pleasantly surprised and thoroughly entertained."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"The book is fabulous. And has a great analisys before the story. about the story itself, I'm sthill reading :P it has Alice in Wonderland and a few more Alice's from Lewis Carrol.Regarding its conditions, it arrived really quickly atending the distance and in great conditions.A++++++++ seller.Thank you."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" has always been one of my favorite novels. When I first read this novel, I wanted to go through the same thing Alice went through in the story. Following a rabbit, going down a rabbit hole, drinking a potion that makes you either larger or smaller, meeting such wonderful and strange creatures just seems as such an amazing and unforgettable experience.This book is a must read novel for everyone, and it shall continue to be a timeless classic."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"My first exposure to this classic children's story was when I watched the 1951 Disney version, \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\" I remember as a kid, loving it, but actually feeling a bit scared by it. As a kid, I was actually pretty terrified of the idea of falling through a rabbit hole, and getting lost all by myself, in a strange land. Add in the scary character of the Queen of Hearts, and I swore to myself, never to wander off around alone, as a strange rabbit might appear and force me to follow him! I had a pretty wild imagination when I was a child. It's bad, because this often is the cause of my nightmares.I decided to lay off the whole \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" scene, and promised never to read the book. I didn't break this promise for years! Until now. In fact, I have only read Lewis Carroll's until just about a month ago. I know, it's a bit disappointing in my part that I have never read this, but what can I say.. a promise is a promise, right?Review: First of all, I have to say, this is still one of those stories that have the most unforgettable characters ever made. Lewis Carroll created such whimsical characters such as the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, the Caterpillar, the Queen of Hearts, the talking flowers, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, and so many more. It's kind of amazing to say the least that all these unique characters all come from one story!The best part though, in my opinion, coming from an adult reader, is the symbolism of this story. Almost all the characters play a part of something in real life -- a metaphor, in a way. The wordplay as well, are witty and clever. Both are done in an extremely subtle way, that most would overlook them. That is probably one of the reasons why this is a classic, and has been around for so long. I feel as though children, as this book was intended for, would see this as a fun book with fun characters. Adults, on the other hand, while they will still appreciate it for the same reasons, would also love this as it will challenge them, and teach them subtle messages, while bringing them back to their childhood all at once.I highly recommend this novel to any reader, no matter how old or young they are. Do not miss it, as this is a timeless piece of literature that everyone should definitely read at least once."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"The book I received was in great condition and arrived in a timely fashion.

So much going on its hard to keep up, but it does a great job at keeping one's attention. Both stories were great, but i liked the original one a little better than the sequel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"When I was younger, I watched the Disney version of this book and was left absolutely horrified by what I had seen. I was about four years old and the constant visions of strange and horrid looking creatures flashing on the screen made me want to leave the room. Because of this, I was not so sure how much I wanted to read this story. Actually, even now, I'm not all together convinced that I really like this story. I feel that it is somewhat sacrilegious to say so but I just don't enjoy this story all that much. As read through the first few pages I could still see the strange and haunting images from the twisted children's movie. Maybe that's what has ruined this tale for me, but I do sincerely feel that it is more than that. When I am reading, I begin to feel hopeless, lost and somewhat confused. I don't really feel happy about saying this since I'm a high school boy, but I feel that you should know how strange the concepts are in this book. Honestly, I must say that reading this book made me feel as though I were on a drug trip. This book has the strangest and most disturbing elements such as drinks that reduce your size and cakes that re-enlarge you. Not to mention that creepy, talking cat in the tree, the Cheshire Cat.From a thematic point of view, I suppose you could say that one theme from this story is the frustrations that come with the loss of one's childhood. What I mean by this is that when a person gets older, they encounter physical changes that radically change they way that a child views the world and may even frustrate them. Across the entirety of Alice's adventures, she runs into a series of absolutely ridiculous changes. While these changes are much more absurd than real changes we incur growing up, they cause Alice to become traumatized, frustrated, and even change her perspective of the world. Although she is forced to go through these changes, she continues to struggle to maintain a comfortable physical size. In chapter one, she tries to follow a rabbit into a garden and is unable to fit through the entrance because she is too large. She takes a drink that shrinks her to the appropriate size but then realizes that she left the key to the entrance on the above table. She then eats a cake that grows her to the size at which she can retrieve the key but is then once again too large to enter the garden, which is very frustrating to her. Again in chapter five, she looses control over her physical build and gets an irregularly long neck.As for the characters in this book, I find all of them one hundred percent unbelievable and terrifying. The characters are all introduced abruptly and are completely beyond reason. For example, the Mad Hatter and his fellow creatures are constantly making insane remarks about class and the state of things. There is also a strange creature named the Cheshire Cat who is unaffected by all that goes on in Wonderland and merely observes all that goes on, somewhat like a stocker.This story is told through the perspective of a narrative view through Alice's eyes and conclusions of the new world she has entered. This view gives a good perspective of how crazy the world can be. I mean, Wonderland may seem like and absolutely mashed land of turmoil but through the eyes of Wonderland, Alice is absolutely mad. I suppose this could be compared with the difference in views in today's society and other countries.Again, I must say that I don't really like this book personally simply because it disturbs me so much, but I would still recommend it to others as they may not feel the same way. It really is a well written story, even if I don't like the general plot. I give this book a three out of five star rating."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"This is about the font size, NOT the content.

I just LOVED the characters that Alice encounters on her adventures and I also loved the story's word-play and witticism.Out of the two stories, Through the Looking Glass, although less famous, is the more linear and I think entertaining but both are amazingly creative and bizarre stories and are both short enough so that they should be read together."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I really like Alice in Wonderland and its sequel because it is so whimsical. The way Dodgson made fun of Alice so much makes one laugh until tears come pouring down. He based the character Alice, on his friend; a real life Alice. Throughout the book, he constantly makes references to her, or something related to her. For example, when a character asks her the exact day Alice replies May 4th. May 4th is the real life Alice's birthday. Alice walks through Wonderland, and she sees many strange things, but thinks otherwise. If you like poems, you will certainly like Alice in Wonderland and its sequel, for both books contain numerous poems. However, in the book Carroll takes the original poems and creates a parody out of them. Something interesting to know is that all the poems relate to the chapters. These are all minor details, but something to muse over. On the surface, Alice in Wonderland is a book where she meets weird creatures and walks away from them always feeling humiliated, as she thinks she is smarter than she really is. That is most of Alice in Wonderland.Alice through the Looking Glass is similar to the prequel, yet glaringly different. The whole book revolves around a chess game, and so the character's actions correspond to moves on the chessboard. Alice joins in the game, starts out as a white pawn, and proceeds to move until she becomes a queen. At each square, she meets a new character, but in one chapter, characters from the previous book are in this one too. An important thing to know in this famous classic is that everything is backwards. It makes sense since Alice is on the other side of a mirror, yet she encounters difficulty sometimes in understanding this. But in the end, she manages to become a queen and to checkmate the red king. Both books are very enjoyable, and I strongly advocate both children and adults to read it. Enjoy!! Cheers!!!!! : )"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"If you were the kind of child who always asked the &quot;why?&quot; question, and who liked to challenge what everyone else regarded as normal, you'll love this book. In &quot;Wonderland&quot;, Lewis Carroll questions everything about life that is normal, and gives us a picture of a world where everything that we accept as normal is turned upside down. With Alice, you'll fall into a rabbit hole and enter an imaginary and wacky world where nothing is at it seems. Here's a small taste:&quot;By-the-bye, what became of the baby?&quot; said the Cat. &quot;I'd nearly forgotten to ask.&quot; &quot;It turned into a pig,' Alice answered very quietly, just as if the Cat had come back in a natural way. &quot;I thought it would,&quot; said the Cat, and vanished again.&quot;they drew all manner of things - everything that begins with an M - &quot; &quot;Why with an M?&quot; said Alice. &quot;Why not?&quot; said the March Hare.If you find this kind of surreal world even remotely attractive, then you're sure to love Alice's &quot;Wonderland&quot;. You'll be amazed by the cat-less grin of the Cheshire-Cat, amused by the absurd logic of the mad Hatter, and in hysterics over the antics of the murderous Queen of Hearts with her constant refrain of &quot;Off with his head.&quot; &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is full to the brim with wild humour, farcical fantasy, witty wisecracks, and slapstick comedy. What I especially enjoyed were the abundance of delightful puns, paradoxes, and parodies. Much of the deeper significance will escape young children, but they will enjoy it as a fantastic story, and rediscover it with even greater pleasure as adults. A &quot;classic&quot; is a book that appeals to people of all times and ages, and that's certainly the case with &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot;Is &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; all nonsense? I don't think so. Behind the outer layer of nonsense Carroll conveys a great deal of sense. He allows you to return to reality with a renewed appreciation for everything that is normal and accepted. Yet this fantasy world is at the same time so nonsensical and enjoyable, that you'll want to return there many a time.

To begin with, I hated the illustrations. They were ugly and gave me the creeps. Although my language was English it was very different from the English that Carroll wrote. I didn't understand half the words. I didn't know what a hedgehog or a dormouse was. Nor was I familiar with mock turtle soup. But its major crime was that it was static. Nothing really happened. She just met a lot of unpleasant individuals and finally woke up. Fast forward sixty years and I have just read it for a class and found it quite enjoyable! First of all, I love the Tenniel illustrations. Yes, they are ugly, but that's what makes them unforgettable. Carroll is not Disney. His little animals are not cuddly and don't whistle happy tunes and are rarely, if ever, helpful. Tenniel makes that clear. Second, I had no idea as a child that it was funny. I did not get any of the jokes or understand any of the riddles. This time I laughed out loud several times. The poems that I could not abide as a child I now find fascinating and rather beautiful, especially the White Knight's verse. Alice STILL has no plot, however, which is why it's not very compelling reading. However, both these books are mercifully brief.Whether one actually likes these books or not, they are important to English literature and are referred to and referenced constantly in other works. So ALICE is essential reading if one wants to be considered an educated English speaker. It's open to many interpretations and many people find it a profound work.

I reread this with some trepidation as I remembered reading and enjoying it several times as a child, but was pleasantly surprised to find it just as magical as I did then.I won't bore anyone with the details of the story as I'm sure that most who are reading this review are familiar with it. Suffice it to say that Alice's journey into Wonderland is still rather wonderful.Alice still comes off as a bratty know-it-all, but I thought that when I was younger, so it did not change my feelings towards the book. The humor is well thought out, reading through it as an adult, I caught many more of the clever puns than I did before, so that made for some refreshing new discoveries.I would reccommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it or at least hasn't read it since their childhood. It is a quick, enjoyable read that takes ones mind into a magical land of wonder.Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found ThereThrough the Looking Glass continues Alice's adventures. This time, as Alice is playing with Dyna's new kittens, she takes to wondering what is beyond the room that she sees on the other side of the looking glass. Before she knows it, Alice has pushed her way through the looking glass and is in the backwards world on the other side!The faniciful creatures that Alice runs into here are as colorful, and in some cases even more so, as the characters from Wonderland. There's the talking flower garden, a run-in with the Tweedles, a host of chess pieces of varying ranks, a unicorn, a lion and many, many more. Along with the Tweedles, my personal favorite is a white knight who can barely stay mounted upon his steed.The magic and wonder from the first of Alice's adventures is still very present and, although the book sometimes gets confusing because things come and go so rapidly, I believe that I actually found it to be more enjoyable than the first. I highly reccommend it to children of ALL ages. If you feel like some simple fun and joy, settle back in a comfy chair with a nice cup of cocoa and let your mind journey Through the Looking Glass with Alice and discover all of the wonders that she finds there."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is one of those books you can still enjoy as an adult even though it was written for children. The story is completely nonsensical and at times humorous. In fact I think some of the jokes can only be understood as an adult so it is worth reading again.I have a yellowed copy of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, which was given to me on my seventh birthday. It has the original artwork on the cover. My grandmother gave me a copy along with a harmonica. The harmonica was lost long ago, the book remains and has always had a place in my heart. I was too young to read the entire book, so my father started reading this book to me. Perhaps still having this book has given me a connection to the past.I laugh when I reminisce about my father singing \\"Beautiful Soup,\\" most beautifully I must add. He also recited \\"Jabberwocky\\" and I can still hear his voice as I read the tale of the Walrus:\\"The time has come,' the Walrus said,\\"To talk of many things:Of shoes - and ships - and sealing wax -of cabbages - and kings -and why the sea is boiling hotand whether pigs have wings.\\"Alice spends a great deal of time either shrinking or growing taller, depending on what she eats in Wonderland. There are talking chess pieces and flowers. Everything in the looking glass world is backwards so it is fun to think about how life would be on the other side of a mirror.The Mad Tea Party is also very memorable. There is all kinds of nonsense conversation children will love to try to figure out, and as adults still might be trying to figure out! They will love the riddles and beautiful illustrations. The mouse, the chess pieces and the Cheshire cat talk most intelligently about various concerns in Wonderland. Just as everything in a child's world is sometimes alive to them, so Alice's world is filled with things that are alive and most interesting to children.Alice never seems to run out of adventures. The Looking Glass House is amusing to me as it has a cute black kitten who is quite mischievous. I quote:\\"Oh, you wicked, wicked little thing!\\" cried Alice catching up the kitten and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. \\"Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! ...Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help if it might.John Tenniel's illustrations make the book and together he and Lewis Carroll created a magical world for children to explore.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Those who pick up ALICE IN WONDERLAND seeking to read a book mirroring the Disney movie version will be sorely disappointed. Those who wish to read a delightful children's story that will enchant and entertain readers young and old need look no further.ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS have very little in the way of plot - little Alice is thrown into a strange world where nothing seems quite right. She changes in size, is confronted by the imperious Queen of Hearts, has tea with a number of quirky characters; each new situation she encounters is \\"curiouser and curiouser\\" than the next. What the stories lack in plot, they make up for twentyfold in character. Carroll created a whimsical world for his young readers, and its charm spills over to entertain even the old.

The many drug references, however, are extremely amusing, and add to the story very much.Alice is asleep and dreaming up a crazy world. The characters she meets are all eccentric, strange, and frightfully funny. Whether we're thinking of the Mad Hatter, the rabbit, or the Queen of Hearts herself, this book is truly a child's happy adventures through a completely ridiculous fictional land (unless you are firm in your belief that this book is completely about drugs, but even then it's still funny and ridiculous).Even though this book is known as a children's book, it is hilarious to all who read it.

I think that anyone, young or older child, teen, or adult would love every page of it. I felt that it went by fast most of the time, but some parts were repeatable. I almost wish it were a little shorter, like each story only 100 pages so it would go by faster, but it was still very enjoyable. I actually have to say I like 'Through the Looking Glass' the best. I had always thought these were just short childrens books, I was surprised when I found out how big they were! I didn't really like the end of 'Through the Looking Glass' since it was about the same as the end of 'Alice's Adventure's In Wonderland'. The end of 'Alice's Adventure's In Wonderland' was better because: 1. I read it first, and 2. It was just better and I was very surprised by it (guess I haven't seen the movie \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" in a while!).

It details a little girl's wild adventure through a make believe world. The writing was clever. And so were the characters and situations created by Carroll. Everyone is familiar with the principal idea of the book, but reading the book forces you to remember all the particulars. It it clear why children love this book, which it's fantastic situations.Being a software developer and a computer science major, it was also interesting to pick up on concepts such as reasoning and logic skattered within the book (Carroll was a mathematician). Of course these concepts are skewed in Wonderland.If you've never read this book before, put it on your \\"must read\\" list. It's a short book and a fast read.

Whether you're a young child or an experienced reader, you can't help but marvel at the charm that Lewis Carrol creates. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (The Alice books as they are often collectively referred to as) are two of the most enduring children's stories of all time. However, at the same time, they both are considered to be literary achievements in the adult crowd, due to the many societal critiques hidden withing the text.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland begins with the classic scene of young Alice falling down the rabbit hole. Soon she finds herself lost in an insane world. Drinking things make her grow into a giant or shrink to the size of a mouse. Best of all, are Alice's conversations with the many eclectic characters that inhabit Wonderland. Unfortunately, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland comes to an end within the one hundred page mark (it is a children's story, after all). Fortunately, this collection holds the book's sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass. In this Alice stumbles through a looking glass and finds herself in Wonderland again. This time around she becomes a pawn in a giant game of chess. The reader follows her adventures as he tries to become a queen by making it to the eighth square. This chessboard element proves a very intersting way of advancing the storyline.What truly gives this book its lasting charm is its characters. Whether its the Mad Hatter telling Alice about his friend Time, or the disappearing Cheshire Cat, every character is impossible to forget. Many such as the White Rabbit, remain popular icons today, well over a century later. Conversations held with these characters often prove laugh out loud funny, as Alice tries to make sense of and explain herself to these characters. From beginning to end, the reader will have a goofy grin plastered across his or her face.Behind all these fun adventures, Carroll manages to slip in a large amount of social commentary. Some characters represent types of people, such as the overzealous monarch, to display in an exaggerated sense the foolishness of such extremes. His many poems throughout the book often have larger meanings as well: The Walrus and the Carpenter are clearly a condemnation of modern religion. Even the wild effects of drinking and eating can be interpreted as a moral on temperence. As the Duchess in the Wonderland said \\"Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it.\\" Likewise, Alice is rife with various morals.So what makes this book a classic? Reading through other people's comments, its hard to find a single person that didn't give it five stars, much less didn't like it. However, it was hard to find a definite consensus on what made it so good. Some stated its entertainment value, other enjoyed the commentary. Perhaps what makes this book so brilliant is that it has whatever you're looking for. If you want escape and adventure, it has it. If you want to laugh, there's humor. If you want intellectual thought and prose thats there too. What will the reader take away from reading is whatever they are looking for. Definitely a book that deserves its recognition as a classic of English literature."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"This book was great for children and adults alike!

Lewis Carroll is a magnificant author and the story he writes is wonderful. Alice is a little girl who journeys to a magical land where everything is full of non-sense. She incounters many people and creatures along the way. She is told many stories and riddles while she travels through wonderland.

Even though it was a dream, Alice still loves her world of non-sense."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Lewis Carroll provides us with a twisted view of our worldthat provokes hours upon hours of thought. This novel may seem like anovel for children, however, it is filled with more literary devices than a truck-load of Hawthorne! Beautiful imagery, puns, malapropisms, possible drug innuendoes and grammatical devices make this a masterpiece to be reckoned with.

This Kindle editionAlice's Adventures in Wonderland HTML Editionis a POOR CHOICE - 2 stars. 5 stars is for the original book. I sampled many Alice in Wonderland and all the Through the Looking Glass books I could find available (at Amazon and Gutenberg org - though today I discover some I missed). I believe I found that the best available editions, if you want both, are:The BLTC at 1.79Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (BLTC Press Edition)- this edition is very well formatted with all the Tenniel illustrations that I recall and is the one I purchased myself.The Bompacrazy at .99Alice in Wonderland (Illustrated)orAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (Illustrated)(these two appear to be exactly the same from the samples as both have the 'blotted out' picture of the Drink Me tag): this is almost as good a choice, though not quite as well formatted. The sample has a Rackham illustration (and there may be more) as well as the many Tenniel, though, which is a plus.The free Gutenberg org versions - lacked the improved linking and formatting, but there are various illustrated editions; may be worth it to you if .99 is too much or you are looking for something other than Tenniel.I did see a kindle version of an 'Original First Edition' Alice which appears to be illustrated by Arthur Rackham - in case you are looking for that one instead of the better known John Tenniel version.Alice In Wonderland - Original First Edition Version Published For Kindle - Lewis CarrollThat edition has no Tenniel illustrations in the sample; also the text seems to be abridged (or just maybe an earlier version?) and the formatting is poor. Note that the picture of Alice looking at the Cheshire Cat in a tree that appears on this linked product page is not the cover that appears on the downloaded sample; the cover that does appear is of Alice walking with the Duchess and looks like this kindle book:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass- now for more typical Amazon mis-linked craziness, this latter edition has Tenniel illustrations, but beware that they are very small thumbnails and enlarge to very poor quality. I do not recommend either of these editions. The Rackham is available at Gutenberg for free.Today I discovered the Master EditionThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions)which I missed before (likely because I was concentrating on Through the Looking Glass, which has far fewer editions, and then pursuing the 'matching' Alice in Wonderlands). Today the price is .89 and I am going to buy it. It is at least as well formatted as the BLTC (based on the sample) and has even more Alice writings (beyond Wonderland and Looking Glass) as well as essays and historical info and other 'add-ons'. He has all the illustrations from Tenniel and additional ones from Holliday and Carroll (I think he should add Rackham's, too).As many others have said, the basic Kindle edition is a very poor choice, and most others also lack the illustrations. Thank goodness for samples.Re Through the Looking Glass, it was the chess board appearing in the BLTC sample (and not in the BompaCrazy sample) that finalized my choice in their favor (before finding the Master). Here are the BLTC and BompaCrazy links:Through the Looking Glass- BLTCThrough the Looking Glass (Illustrated)- BompaCrazyI hope this review helps you find your best choice far more quickly than I did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I love Alice in Wonderland. I've been reading it since I was a small child, hence I can honestly say that whoever retyped this for the Kindle did a shoddy (my peers would say \\"half-assed\\") job. Oh, it's readable, don't get me wrong. But if we'd bought this as a paperback, there would be an outcry, so why not shout out one for the eBook crowd? Shame on you!There are tons of typos. The quotation marks are in that cheap ASCII nearly-sideways type that makes you blink more than once until your eyes adjust. Italicized words jumped between actual italics to underscores before italicized words (e.g., I will prosecute _you_). John Tenniel's illustrations are non-existent (oh, the horror!!). But my biggest complaint, though, is the presentation of the poetry. In fully-justified, unpunctuated paragraphs. Are you serious, Kindle publishers?!?I got my first taste of things to come with \\"The Mouse's Tale\\" (Fury said to a mouse that he met in the house...), usually written in a fun, swirly format with decreasing font size. (You can see the original at [...]). I realize this would have been difficult to redo in the Kindle format, especially when the user is given the option to make the font bigger or smaller at will. But at least put it in stanza format! I tried to reproduce the result of the attempt, but Amazon's comment box reformats everything, so I'll try to demonstrate:Fury (huge gap) said (huge gap) to a mouse That he(huge gap) met (huge gap) in the (huge gap)house Let us bothgo to (huge gap) law, I will (huge gap) prosecute you.It's the worst example of full-justification allowable - the humongous gaps between words, no punctuation, three or four words per line...and so forth. Making the text bigger or smaller made it worse.The rest of the poetry is in plain old paragraph format, with punctuation thrown in haphazardly or missing altogether. In \\"Through the Looking Glass,\\" consider the presentation of \\"The Walrus and The Carpenter.\\"The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so, And then they rested on a rock Conveniently low; And all the little Oysters stood And waited in a row.\\"The time has come,\\" the Walrus said To talk of many things Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--Of cabbages--and kings--And why the sea is boiling hot--And whether pigs have wings.Readers might find this a little thing, but I'm sorry, this just bothered the hell out of me.I guess I should have expected it. I only paid 99 cents for this version, and you get what you pay for. And for God's sake, don't fall for the \\"free full versions\\" out there that were typed by \\"scholars\\" and available on the web for nothing - they're worse yet! So I give this 3 stars - a wonderful story brought low by lazy copy-editing.Honestly, publishers, if you're going to redo a classic for the Kindle: (1) Include the original artwork, (2) format it correctly so it resembles the original hard copy as much as possible, and (3) spell-check it, for crying out loud. Don't make Kindle owners wonder what other crap is in store that will make us sorry we bought the thing and just reach for our old paperbacks instead."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"After more than a century, young Alice's adventures in Wonderland are still fun. True, there are a good many dated notions and difficult puns. But, even so, my six year old and I had good fun with the tale. That said, I think our success with the book depends a good deal on the edition we choose. By luck we stumbled upon Peter Weevers' illustrated version (Alices Adventures In Wonderland). Sadly it's out of print. Such marvelous pictures! Mr. Weevers really brought Wonderland to life for us.By contrast, most editions contain JOHN TENNIEL's classic/original drawings. Frankly, I think they're a bit dated and dreary. Purists will certainly adhere to them, but other illustrators have done far better. My suggestion is that you search for Alice and find one with another illustrator! One option is the unique artwork of Alison Jay (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland). Not to everyone's taste, but more alive and child-friendly than Tenniel. Another option is the Cooper Edens' edition (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland -A Classic Illustrated Edition). A new edition that looks quite promising is illustrated by Helen Oxenbury (Alice Through the Looking-glass: Walker Illustrated Classics.In another episode, my first experience with Alice was a very bad one. I made the mistake of buying an annotated version. I'm not sure which one. Perhaps:The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition. I got so completely tripped up, looking up 19th century references to English politics and what not. I'm sure that aficionados can appreciate Carroll's deeper humor, but for most of us this is just a kids' tale. Don't buy an annotated version unless you're already hooked on Alice.All things considered, here is my advice. DO buy the original Lewis Carroll text (unabridged, not rewritten). It's lively and fun. Especially if you are reading to a young one: DO NOT buy a Tenniel illustrated edition. Try to find a used copy of Weevers' version or take a chance on the an Oxenbury edition, such asAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. And lastly DO read Alice. Her travels through Wonderland are still lots of fun."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"My son stayed at home \\"sick\\" and I said he couldn't watch TV or play computer but he could listen to this audio book.

The books are elegantly presented: Alice with a gold color cover and gold gilt edges on all three sides, Looking-Glass with a silver cover and silver gilt edges on all three sides, and the box being in gold color and looking almost identical to the Alice volume. The books are printed on fairly thin, very smooth, and somewhat off-white paper -- the color of which I personally find detracts a little from the books. The books are identical in layout, typeface and illustrations to the original 1865 &amp; 1872 Macmillan editions: the type has been reset and is thus perfectly crisp, the typeface (De Vinne) is a perfect match to the original typeface except the quote marks are a bit more spaced out than is usual. The text is otherwise a perfect match, with line breaks in identical places, etc. The speciality of these Books of Wonder editions is that the illustrations have been printed from the original woodblocks which had been sitting forgotten in a bank vault for many years. The books claim that &quot;details never seen before are now visible&quot;, but I haven't been able to see evidence of this myself: the illustrations _are_ considerably cleaner and crisper, but I've not seen any extra details. On the down side, a number of the woodblocks had editing done on them when they were made, and over time these edited portions have clearly shrunk or no longer fit perfectly into the surrounding wood, so that the editing is much more clearly visible than on facsimiles of editions from 100 years ago.

A must have for reading aloud to emerging and expert readers alike, and it's a nice important feeling book for them to go over on their own as well."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I would rate this lower if the rating were based simply on how I felt about the book.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was easy to read, mildly entertaining, and terribly familiar. I can't tell if the entertainment came from familiarity or not - so much of Alice is simply part of cultural memory that I knew it without ever having read the book. It was silly, but for a time, it progressed. Alice was trying to get into the garden and was exploring the nonsense world as she went along.Through the Looking Glass was different. I had a hard time reading it. I didn't find it entertaining. The pieces made no sense together, and the goal of becoming a queen by making it to the eighth square seemed an afterthought. It may be that Through the Looking Glass was a better dream narrative (it certainly seemed a good example of the kind of play young children engage in), but I still had a hard time reading it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I have an avid young reader in my family and it is not always easy to guess what kind of book she may enjoy.

Originally published under the titles Alice's Adventures Underground and Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There, these books were the work of an Oxford mathematician named Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, using the pen-name of Lewis Carroll. According to Charles H. Sylvester (editor of Journeys through Bookland): \\"One day . . . he took three of his little friends, Alice and Edith and Lorina Liddell, for a trip up the river, and on that afternoon he began telling them about Alice and her Wonderland, continuing the story on other occasions. He had no intention of making a book, but the story pleased little Alice and her sisters so well that they talked about it at home and among their grown-up friends, who finally persuaded the author to have it printed.\\" Note: Songs are composed by Field, although the opening poem \\"All in the Golden Afternoon\\" is missing from this recording. Both audiobooks are combined in one package. The readings are approximately seven hours long on six Audio CDs."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Its really neat to have the story as it was originally written.

This latest version is ok, and it's brand new but not what I was expecting, what I was expecting was there there would be the usual 19th drawings of Alice, the rabbit, and all the other characters would be there, but unfortunately there are no drawings. It's sadly missing a good part of the charm of the other editions I read and have owned. I currently have a lovely complete works of Lewis Carroll leather bound which includes Alice in Wonderland and Alice through the Looking Glass, with the original drawings which I've had in every edition I've ever had including other paperback versions, but sadly not this one, if I'd realized that this one was missing such an essential ingredient as the drawings, I wouldn't have bought this particular edition. I bought it with the assumption that it had the usual charming Victorian drawings that every other edition hardback or paperback has it, but as my other copies of Alice have disappeared, and the leather bound edition is too frail to sit down and read, I'll make do with this one, but I'm not happy with it.I think may well send it back, and get another with the drawings."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is very creative, it has talking rabbits and every animal is talking and talking objects to like flowers and checkerboard pieces. Alice thinks this a dream but it is actually happening. She sees a talking white rabbit and follows it because it looked like it was in a hurry, was wearing clothes and was holding a watch. The white rabbit falls in a whole which takes them into wonderland where everything is alive and talking. Alice is amazed of what she sees and is still following the white rabbit. The white rabbit takes her in an adventure and she meets strange things and at the end realizes she misses her home.What I liked about the book was that I watched the movie and the book and they are very similar to each other. What really interested me the most is that how Lewis Carroll came up with all of this. I liked how everything talks and that wonderland is very colorful and living. I also liked how much detail it gave to really make you imagine how it looked it kind of made me feel like if I was really there. There was really nothing that I did not like about it.Through the looking glass is book two that explains how Alice goes into another universe by walking into a mirror and is her second time in wonderland but she thinks it's all a dream. But in Through the Looking-Glass she fins out that this is real and that she is not dreaming. In this part of the book she is playing a game of chess and is trying to get to the eighth square. Through the Looking-Glass was my favorite part of the book because it has so many details. I also like that they included little children's stories like Humpty Dumpty. What I did not like was that when Alice was talking to the White and Red Queen about adding and subtracting. I really got lost in that chapter."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"This book is almost like a dream.The way Lewis Carol sweeps you out of your world and into Alice's is simply wonderful.Inside this book of dreams are alot of details about how life was back then, they're just not straight forward.I think this book is appropriate for every age."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"This has always been one of my favourite books. All the characters are wonderful, the poems are hilarious and everything that happens is so entirely whimsical. They are so exactly like dreams too. All the events are thoroughly unusaul, but all the same seem perfectly natural to Alice the whole time; and many of the events are scary in the same was as they are in a dream. There is no explanation -- and no ecsape. It is no wonder that generations have followed Alice down the rabbit hole, or through the looking-glass, into this world filled with wonder!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"This book was great!! In the sense that you can see the trasitions inbetween Carroll's life changes around every corner... it is very cool the way hat Carroll will take tweedle dee and tweedle dum and have them doing mathematical wonders without realizing that he was doing that until you really think about it.. also I LOVED the cheshire cat, how he is so intriguing... like when Alice asks what trail to go down, and he says &quot;where do you want to go?&quot; Alice responds &quot;I don't care.&quot; &quot;Well then, it doesn't really matter which way you go then now does it?&quot; It's a lot like life.. ok.. thats my review...

And I have re-read it at least once a year since.I'm not interested in why it was written or what deep, dark psychological quirks of the author underlie its imagery. It's enough that, from the time I fall down that curious rabbit hole, swim through the sea of tears, dance the lobster quadrille (Can you walk a little faster?), I seem to be retracing every step of my life. Every one of Alice's adventures has its echo in the real world, and they aren't hard to match.So, my much-worn copy sits comfortably on the shelf nearest to hand, and my grandchildren-to-be can expect to find a copy of their own in their very first Christmas stockings. And, hopefully, we, too, will one day &quot;talk of many things -- of ships, and shoes, and sealing wax; of cabbages and kings,&quot; just as I did with their parents when I first recited for them the dire warning &quot;Beware the jabberwok, my son!&quot;"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Don't buy the Kindle edition hoping to see the wonderful illustrations described in the product information.

Well done. Illustrated.

There is madness here and method in the madness. There is a story, a heroine, and her meeting with zany characters and a zany world whose rules seem to change with each person she meets. There is wordplay, and there is logical laughter and conundrum. There is seemingly something for everyone.It is possible to be frightened to near death by the Queen of Hearts or to become broken and wise like Humpty Dumpty .\\" Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall/ Humpty Dumpty had a great fall/ All the kings' horses/ and all the Kings' men/ could not put Humpty Dumpty / together again.The weird wonderland Alice meets is filled with games and play. It is fantasy and fear, it is fun and fright. There is at one point no way out of it and yet there is miraculous transformation which takes you somewhere else completely.The logic of this world seems at time too sophisticated for children, and yet childlike . Paradox is contradiction with the pain taken out.There are so many memorable lines and situations here, so much to mean in each sentence , that the work is a wholesale factory for epigraphs and epigrams.As one who never followed the story very well I nonetheless could see that in this work poetry and logic meet and mix each other up for the general benefit and pleasure of the reader.This is a book to be read line by favorite line, character by favorite character, incident by favorite incident with amusement and pleasure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Do you want to get away from the hassles of reality, the stresses of everyday life? Then Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is the book for you. After reading it, I found that it can be entertaining for a reader of any age. Children can enjoy an outrageous character in the story, such as the Cheshire Cat. Kids like the sly, disappearing cat with the everlasting smile because he's unusual. Adults can also enjoy the story by examining the meaning of the seemingly shallow plot, a girl lost in a dreamworld, a wonderland. I myself enjoyed the book because it gave me a break from reality. It made me feel like all that I needed was to enter into a wonderland of my own. Is this &quot;wonderland&quot; really safe for kids though? Some people question whether this story is appropriate for children because of the unusual characters, but what is the real meaning? Is the Mad Hatter, with his neverending tea party and his bumbling speech, a portrayal of the mentally unstable? Is the Catapillar sitting on top of a magical mushroom, blowing smoke through a hookah, an emblem for drugs? Children would not see these things in the story, or would they? I think children could enjoy the story for its simplicity, not for hidden meanings. How can the story be taken further though? Adults should be asking questions about the book. For example, when first read, the plot seems simple, a young girl falls asleep and in her dream she tumbles down a rabbit hole into a backwards world where she grows to her liking, watches cats disappear into thin air, and gets crazy advice from a catapillar on a magic mushroom. One second Alice is reading with her sister and the next second sne is floating down a rabbit hole. Adults can examine twists like this and wonder what it means for the entire storyline. Does it foreshadow events to come? Older people would be more likely to think about the storyline and can have more fun trying to find hidden meanings. So this story is very appropriate for adults. The reason why I enjoyed the story was the break from reality. Obviously the story of Alice and her adventures is fantasy, but when I read it, it makes me feel like I can take a break from the world. This is because the characters and plot are so unreal, that they make me feel unreal, too. So this story, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, can be simple for children, complex for adults, and is a break from life for me. Overall, it is a very satisfying story. Are you willing to go tumbling down the rabbit hole?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Everyone has been rating this book as a children's book... It was written by an astute mathmatics doctorate Oxford professor. It is a fantastic book for adults to understand the mind of a child."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a fun and pleasant reading. The book allows the reader to enter into Alice's mind and travel along with her through the worderful and mysterious Wonderland. Alice is a curious and questioning little girl traversing a land where nonsense is the common-sense, where right is wrong and where wrong is not always right (but can be sometimes!). This causes a surprise in every page you turn. The characters Alice meets usually produce the most unexpected replies which always leave Alice and the reader in a troubled state-of-mind. However amazing it can be, we are sometimes a little puzzled by noticing there is some logic in the nonsense world of Wonderland and I personally think this is the true beauty of the book. Moreover, all this is presented by the most unusual characters in a rich text, often mixing prose and verse and sometimes toying with typography in a e. e. cummings-like nature, which makes the book quite unique."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"The book Alice in wonderland starts when Alice finds a white rabbit.

When Alice wakes up from her nap she takes Dinahs kitten through the looking glass into Looking Glass World where everything is backwards.

I could read it many more times because the author paints a vivid picture in your mind that places you in Wonderland along with all of the delightful characters including Alice. The description in the book starts out strong and ends up even stronger. The author's ability to describe both the characters and the setting is amazing.I could just imagine being at the tea party with Alice or pondering whether or not i should drink out of the little bottle labeled drink me. The book takes place with Alice being bored out of her mind which most kids can relate to. Then, her curiosity about a little white rabbit with a pocket watch gets her in trouble when she ends up in a whole other world of queens, kings, talking animals and insane people.All of the characters are interesting and humorous, but often make you frustrated along with Alice because of their crazy antics and utter annoyance. This book is a classic that everyone should read at one point in their life whether they are young or old. This is a story that will surely be remembered . It beats the Disney movie by far.

It is definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a classic that all young spirited people should read. It has adventure, love, fantasy, and a lot of fantastic nonsense. Every page is exciting and mysterious with a bewildering twist. Lewis Carrol exceeds on making a childerns story into a fantastic novel for all ages. He has great imagination that he uses in his puns, riddles, and characters to make nonsense into complete thoughts and morals. Alice is a creative little girl who seems to find adventure around every corner. Everybody in Wonderland is just as creative as Alice; they all seem to be intelligent and fully spirited. This novel is something no one wants to pass by. Personally, I suggest this book becomes a classic everyone should have to read. Many things in this book capture a moment, like this qoute,&quot;The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the Hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &quot;I-I hardly know, sir, just at present - at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times sice then.&quot; Another quote that stood out and will help choose this as your next book to read is from the cat. &quot;In that directoin,&quot; The Cat said, waving its paw around, &quot;lives a Hatter: and THAT direction,&quot; waving the other paw, &quot;lives teh March Hare. Visit either you like: They're both mad.&quot; &quot;But I dont want to go amoung mad people,&quot; Alice replied. &quot;oh, you can't help that,&quot; said the Cat.&quot;we're all mad here.

This book is certainly not just for children and better than the bible."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"The book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll was a creative trip into the world of dreams. Lewis Carroll is most famous as an author, particularly for writing Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. He was also a mathematician, Angelical deacon, and photographer. Carroll originally created the story for Alice Liddell, a child he befriended while he was a deacon at a local church. She loved the tale and asked him to write the story down on paper. At first he hesitated. Two years later, Carroll agreed, and the classic story was born. Carroll's main goal for writing the book was to get children interested in reading.Lewis Carroll was actually a pen name for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. His work was mostly considered to be literary nonsense, and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a classic example. Many people, ranging in all ages, have enjoyed Carroll's fantasy and word play writings. Carroll's way of writing has influenced many authors all over the world.Although Carroll's writings are very creative and imaginative, Carroll wrote a book with too many hidden meanings in it. For instance, the references to drug use are too prevalent. The first run-in Alice has with drugs is with the caterpillar. She stumbles across him sitting on a mushroom. He is smoking hookah and blowing rings of smoke toward Alice. Shortly after Alice leaves the caterpillar, she meets the Mad Hatter. He was a hatter, which means that he would inhale some of the mercury fumes that were used to cure felt in some of his hats. Mercury poisoning results in brain damage and confused speech. The last drug reference occurs when Alice eats and drinks the substances that make her grow or shrink. Alice did not know what she was consuming. She ate and drank it anyway and she ended up growing or shrinking. Carroll intended that children read the book. He might have sent the wrong messages. Children might think that Alice has fun eating and drinking mysterious substances and they would too. Also, Carroll actually wrote a very complicated book that most young children probably could not understand. He used a lot of literary techniques like reversals, puns, and mirror writings. These could easily be overlooked and misunderstood by children.Lewis Carroll tried to write the book from Alice Liddell's point of view to make reading enjoyable for children. He wanted to prove that children could have thoughts that were as complicated as or more complicated than adults. If the reader will not try to dissect the meaning of each word and wants to feel like a child again, then this book would be a good choice."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"My nephew loved this book and had me read it to him.

It is a perfect example of a story written a very popular theme. It explains that in the mind of a child things are not always as they seem. Alice (the main character) is a curious youngster who follows a white rabbit, in a waist-coat, down a rabbit hole. Alice finds herself in a strange new world where nothing is what it seems. Small cakes and unmarked bottles cause her to grow to be three stories tall and pieces of mushrooms make her shrink to the height of a playing card. As the story progresses, Alice encounters many interesting characters including a very demanding queen who sentences everyone to be beheaded before the end of a crazy croquet game. The author, Lewis Carroll, used poetry and rhythm to add to the already whimsical and mysterious atmosphere. He created individuals with exaggerated character traits, so the reader can easily picture them. For example the Cheshire cat with his giant grin and disappearing body. Carroll also included illustrations of the important scenes of the story, so the reader would be able to understand them better. This story perfectly explains the racing imagination of a child in a light-hearted and imaginative way."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I have been reading some chapter books with my preschooler and she has really enjoyed it.

Alice was getting tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, when the White rabbit with pink eye's runs by saying \\"Oh Dear! Oh Dear!

I have always heard about all the underlying and hidden things within the story but I guess I am a surface reader. Either that or all of the underlying things were topical and with the book being written in the late 1800's most of those things would have been lost on me.The Good: It was an easy read the characters were quite unusual and Carroll definitely had an imagination.The Bad: besides my thinking it was going to be better than it was not much. It was somewhat confusing at times.Overall it was an Ok read however with all the hype and rumored greatness surrounding the story I was slightly disappointed.Through the looking Glass. The less known second story about Alice is which she enters a looking glass (Mirror) world where you must move in the opposite direction to get where you desire to go. The world is divided into a grid like a checkers or chess board with the ultimate goal is to make it to opposite side of the board and to become a queen.The Good: Same as the first, lots of imagination and unique characters.The Bad: not too much, like the firs it was a little confusing at times.It was Similar to the first with regard of craziness and characters however slightly inferior to the first."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Alice's AdventureMy first impressions of this book were that it was like reading C.S.

With the bossy, dominant Red Queen and the quiet, kind, messy white queen, the book is a study in contrasts.The interweaving of the Nursery Rhyme Characters and the frequent fish poetry references does provide more continuity and a sense of sequential events than Alice's first adventure.

The story was based on a girl named Alice and everything she saw in wonderland."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Wonderland is nothing but a world filled with nonsense. I realize that may be the author's intention, but it left me searching for meaning where there was none. Everyone is mad in wonderland, or they wouldn't be there. It's hard to call it an adventure, since nothing really happens. The characters are all mean, and at times unlikable. I get the pun, I can see the satire, but I just didn't find it funny. I have two daughter's who are 4 and 5, and I tried reading it to them as well to see if it might be a generational thing, but since most of the book is a play on words, they did not understand it, and they did not like it any better. I'm sorry. I'll admit Carroll has quite an imagination, and created quite a unique world, but he didn't do anything with it. I feel bad for having seen Disney's classic animation adaptation of this story first, and for hoping to gain some added insight by reading the actual book, but there is nothing more here to be gained. It did make me appreciate the job Disney did in adapting it to a movie however. I believe he (Disney) captured the images perfectly."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"One of the best books in the world!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I had to read this book for a classic book report. My teacher said it would be a great one to read. If it wasn't so confusing, it would be a great book for younger children. I really didn't enjoy it though, because the lot seemed a little too young for me. Anyone over the age of twelve, might not be interested in it. Don't get me wrong, Because it did have some exciting parts in it though, like when Alice first entered the wonderland. Everything was like a fairy tale with talking rabbits and shrinking/growing juice. Alice would walk into a room, drink the juice, and if she was small, she'd grow into a giant, and if she was a giant, she'd shrink. It gets pretty confusing. On her adventure, she walks through a series of rooms and can't find her way out. Will she ever make it out? Read the boook to find out."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" was required reading for one of my present classes, if this had not been the case, I'm certain I would not have finished it for the sake of enjoyment. I admit this story has good points as well as bad; it would not have survived nearly so long if it did not. In my opinion, however, the good did not outweigh the bad.One of the strong points of this story is familiarity; the vast majority of us have had some experience with this book, usually as a child; we have heard the story, read a condensed version or seen a film or television portrayal. We have seen little girls dress up like Alice on Halloween; and who doesn't personally know The White Rabbit, The Cheshire Cat or the Queen of Hearts? Perhaps there's a degree of nostalgia that comes from revisiting these old childhood friends.In addition to being familiar, this story also has the charming quality of feeling as if it had been pulled directly out of a child's imagination. By that, I mean it doesn't follow the rules that have been set up by adults, either scientific or social. So, if you fall down a well shaft in Wonderland, not only are you likely to live, you may also be able to examine the trinkets placed on the shelves, perhaps even get in a few winks as you fall.In this book, nothing is what it seems (unless you are familiar enough with the story); a baby may mutate into a pig and run off snorting; a couple of card soldiers may spend an afternoon painting white roses red in order to avoid losing their heads, this is all perfectly normal in Wonderland. Perhaps it is even this strange quality that has made this story so popular. It wasn't enough for me however, to make up for what it lacks. This book didn't move along purposefully enough for me to enjoy it or care what happened next. It also had a strange dream-like quality and I don't mean surreal or day-dreamy. It was dream-like because it was a jumble of random scenes that didn't really interrelate. We often fill in the gaps when we retell our dreams so in that they make sense to us and frankly so that they are worth telling to someone else. This is the impression that I had of Alice in Wonderland; unstructured and random. The only real goal of the main character was to follow the white rabbit and even that failed as a motive fifty percent of the time. Alice is simply moved haphazardly through a sequence of strange encounters and then wakes up. Because of this, I didn't feel anticipation, I didn't hope for anything, and I didn't have any sense of closure when the story ended; which are the elements that I feel make a story worth reading."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking glass are two interesting stories. When I was a child, I watched the Disney version of Alice in Wonderland and enjoyed it. I've watched it again recently and find it very strange. I came across the book, &quot;Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass&quot; in an old library at my Grandparent's house. This was an old English version, which may have made it more difficult to read and comprehend then if it was in common dialect. The first story, Alice in Wonderland, is the better of the two. It tells of a dreamland that a seven-year old Alice is visiting. This book jumps around a lot, and it is difficult to keep track of who's who by the end. The second story, &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, was worse then the first one. It is once again in a dreamland of a world seen backwards from Alice's own world in the reflection of a mirror. When Alice enters this world, there are about two chapters before they enter the difficult analagy of telling the story through a game of chess. This is extremely hard to follow, seeing as you have to visualize the chessboard in your mind. Each seperate story takes place on a different tile while Alice is a pawn waiting to be Queened. In the end of the story, she is Queened and has tea with the other two queens, that is, the white and red queens. The dissapointing conclusion was that Alice was really in her world the whole time and her kittens were the queens in the story. I found both stories a challenging read, and was relieved when the book was finally over!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Oh, how I long for those days of innocence, when I could trust in all that I held dear and holy. When I thought a Transformers movie would be a great idea; when I truly believed that Buffy and Angel could be together someday; when I could rely on \\"Heroes\\" to be, oh, at least kinda interesting. And a big part of my naivet&eacute; had to do with the Disney Studio. See, as a youngster, they taught me that Snow White had an evil sorceress for a step-mother, that Cinderella had a fairy Godmother for a, uh, godmother, and that a young lady called Alice went to Wonderland in her dreams one day, and met there the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, with whom she celebrated her un-birthday.Disney lied! About that last part, at any rate. Gasp!I can't quite understand why I never knew this, or why this never even occurred to me. I mean, I had read the fairy tale behind \\"The Little Mermaid\\", so I knew that the whole Ariel-Prince Eric hook up was something of an artistic liberty. I'd read \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", and a host of other stories about beauties whose princes someday came. And since they were all old, old tales, ripe for revision and, let's face it, not exactly offering endings to make you go \\"ahhh\\", it didn't occur to me to argue with the happy-ever-afters being assisted by singing mice and the occasional dancing cavalcade of cutlery.But for some reason, despite the voraciousness of my reading habits throughout what I like to pretend is a life, I didn't get around to reading the original, non-Golden Book version of Carroll's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" till I was well past the age where perhaps I should have. I've now read it several times, and all I can say is... cool.We all know the basic story (if not, as I have recently discovered, the entirety of it). Little blonde girl is dozing in a meadow with her cat Dinah when she sees a waistcoat-clad White Rabbit rush past exclaiming that he is late. She, naturally enough, follows the tardy bunny down a very, very deep whole, at the bottom of which she discovers a little door. Through that door is Wonderland, which she can only reach by shrinking herself with the assistance of convenient shrinking refreshments. And later, she gets larger again. Then there's this whole thing about a mystic caterpillar, a tea party, the Queen of Hearts, a croquet match using flamingos (animal rights activists, unite against Flamingo Croquet!) and a trial... and that's not even mentioning that enigmatic Cheshire Cat, who can materialize anywhere at will. What an elegantly contrived, wondrously chaotic, perfectly lovely story it is, too.The first thing I thought upon concluding it, however, was that I had accidentally bought the abridged version. So much Alice that I remembered seemed to be missing, and I knew my imagination wasn't good enough to have conjured up that stuff. But then I read \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\", Alice's continued adventures, and it was all explained.Through the Looking-Glass finds our Alice being all other-worldly again, but instead of down a hole she goes through a mirror into a slightly askew locale in which the lion and the unicorn fight for the crown, Humpty Dumpty falls from his wall, and we hear of the Jabberwocky and the Walrus, cabbages and kings. There's also a giant, and inexplicable, chess game afoot. It's witty and suspenseful, surreal and yet actual, well-crafted melodrama blended perfectly with satire... so very entertaining.Ah! I exclaimed. I see! Those clever, sneaky fellows at Mouse Central had combined elements from the two books to create their little gem that they, regardless, called \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", even though Alice was clearly *through the looking-glass* when she, as for example, learned of un-birthdays.This got me to thinking. Does this mean that Disney has lied about other things, as well? Is there no Bambi, no Davy Crockett, no kids from Witch Mountain? What about Herbie, did he really go bananas, and did that guy turn into a shaggy dog, or were those shameless untruths as well? Sure, I knew they'd let the fact-checking go a little in their more recent endeavors, what with Pocahontas not having a talking willow in her circle of friends, Hercules not really being all that good of a guy, and there actually being a proper Princess in \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" (who was emphatically not from New Orleans). But those cherished memories of my childhood I had held as sacred, and they are now tarnished forever.But that's okay. More than okay, really. It's a joy to discover that a story I had thought so familiar can be all shiny and new again. It was a revelation to dive into Carroll's simple, yet complex prose... even the academic-y footnotes are interesting here, as so many of Carroll's characters, metaphors and poems are parodies, references and allusions to persons living and dead. (Well, okay, mostly dead.) The in-jokes are more prevalent than in your average Supernatural episode. Dated it may be, but out-dated, never, and the fact that I can continue to discover the pleasures of this ostensibly child's tale at my advanced age actually makes me grateful for a childhood deprived of it.So, I guess, thanks for lying to me, Disney. I appreciate it. Really. Um... so... anything you want to tell me about \\"The Jungle Book\\"?[The review first appeared in Geek Speak Magazine, Issue 2.]"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I'm going to assume that we've all read and loved Alice's Adventures, and focus instead on reviewing this gorgeous edition.

The imagination used to create this story is genius, if you are going to see the movie than take the time to find out what made this classic story timeless."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is a literary classic which has had a vast influence on many writers after Lewis Carroll's time. One can easily see where satiric writers, like Jasper Fforde, get their notion of twisting literary and familiar characters to suit their own purposes. This Wordsworth Classics edition contains \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and its sequel, \\"Through the Looking Glass\\", which is the lesser of the two stories.Most everyone (including those who have not read the book) are familiar with the plot line. Alice follows the White Rabbit down the rabbit hole and finds herself in the strange and exotic world of Wonderland where nothing seems to make sense. As she continues in her journey, she meets a wide variety of characters - some familiar (like Humpty Dumpty) and some specific to Carroll (the Mad Hatter and the March Hare). Because Alice's adventure is truly a dream, what happens in Wonderland does not need to make sense or follow any logical pattern of time or plot. \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" finds Alice back in Wonderland, this time with the promise of becoming a queen if she can make it across the chess board. The concept of chess ties this story together, but there are few strong elements which make this sequel difficult to stand on its own. It would work better if some of its stories had been incorporated into the original.All in all, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" are unique escapes into one writer's dreamy imagination. In a way, the oddities wind up making sense, allowing readers to philosophize with Carroll along the way. And for any lover of the English language, some of Carroll's creations (especially the Jabberwocky) are astounding and wonderful plays on words. Sir John Tenniel's classic illustrations help further the story, truly capturing the weirdness of Wonderland and Alice's adventures there."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Of course the story is fun but I don't like the way the ebook is formatted and there's no Table of Contents."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"This is a book that seems to stay with what Lewis Carroll wanted these books to be.

There are so many adaptations of this book and so many varied ways to enjoy it, that there is perhaps a danger that it may be overused.

While it is often labeled a children's novel, it takes the understanding of an adult to grasp the richness of symbolism contained in each page. We get a front row seat as Alice journeys through a myriad of characters that range from the bizarre to the down right funny. Alice is the wiser for each encounter, but what makes the book so charming is that she manages to retain her child-like wonder.I must admit that this novel would not be complete without the illustrations from Punch cartoonist John Tenniel. Tenniel gives the characters a richness and exaggerated life that is unmatched. The book is incomplete without those drawings.Lastly, there is little bit of Alice in all of us. Who among us has not wanted to walk in the forest, open a closed door, or peek behind a curtain. The thought of escaping and exploring the unknown without the fear of harm is almost intoxicating.

Sure, her adventures--first in Wonderland, then in the world behind the Looking-Glass--will appeal to all children; the characters are whimsical and delightful, the dangers tantalizing (at least to young minds), and the endings ever-so-happy. Plus, there are kittens, butterflies, and talking goats...what child can resist talking goats, I ask you?But for those of us over the age of 8...we need something else. As for myself, I got lost in the brilliantly clever humor that was strewn throughout the tales; the wit is quick, and Carroll's enjoyment of wordplay is apparent on every page. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\" contain some of the most memorable dialogue you will ever encounter.

I feel that it is just like you are in a dream and the author does a very good job at writing the book so it seems like that. I think it is a good book because it really keeps you focused on what is happening because it is a complicated story. There are a lot of twists and turns in the book, especially in the beginning. I think that it is also a good book because the author, Lewis Carroll, includes things that you would never even think about until you read to book. I also like the book because it is very entertaining to understand how Alice (the main character) tries to deal with and interoperate all of the strange circumstances that happen in wonderland. All of the characters that are in the book are very strange and tell very bizarre stories. The stories have no point what so ever and it gets quite frustrating to Alice because she really wants to know what happens, but they just wont say it and go on and on. All of the events that happen in the book that need trial do not seem very savvy and are unjust and unfair which is quite interesting to read about because Alice gets accused of a lot of things and it is very gallant of her to stand up for herself.

Alice finds herself in world of cards, bottles or cakes of magical liquids that changes her size, and a vast array of dizzying characters. Alice plays a croquet game with the Queen of Hearts in her garden, all the while the Queen ordering her guards to chop off peoples heads. She also encounters a Mad Hatter at his teatime, which is all the time because he angered time once, so tea time is always for him! In Through the Looking Glass, Alice travels to a backwards world through her mirror in her living room, playing her way through the world in a chess game, meeting various characters in her quest to become a Queen. Here, is Lewis Carrols famous poem, Jabberwocky: \`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves' did gyre and gimble in the wabe:' All mimsy were the borogoves,' and the mome raths outgrabe.I found this book to be not what I expect. It was entertaining, exciting, but quite a bit confusing. Overall, I believe it would be better suited for free reading than a report for a class. A part I found especially confusing was in Alice in Wonderland when Alice visits the house of the Duchess and the Duchess sing to her baby, \\"Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes: He only does it to annoy, Because he know it teases.\\" This part I found to be confusing, since beating of a baby is never allowed in any society, past or present.Many of the themes in Alice in Wonderland are told through poems or songs that the characters sing. Sometimes the message is hard to clearly express because of the way words are used and the long list of characters. I would recommend this book to adults more, because of the writing styles Carrol used, more because the book was written in 1872, but also some teenagers for a look at how developed the movie became for children but because some of the confusion is hard to determine, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I am fonder of Through the Looking Glass than Alice in Wonderland, perhaps because of less exposure (e.g., Disney and other commercial venues).

It took fantasy and brought it to life in my mind. Through my imagination, I was practically in the body of Alice, experiencing everything she did. Lewis Carroll is an excellent author, depicting excellent pictures, thoughts, and questions in the reader's mind. His style and technique of writing put amazing imagery and specific descriptions through my imagination. &quot;A found face, and large eyes like a frog, &quot; was an example of a piece of his work that depicts a good sense of imagery. The main idea of this story is for the main character, Alice, to find her way out of Wonderland. Some examples of some of the characters were: Queen of Hearts, Alice, the Mad Hatter, and the March Hare. Lewis Carroll uses descriptive words and phrases to describe the many different characters in this fiction book. In this book, Alice goes from being in the middle of the woods to a large hallway, into a big pool of water, to a house in which she grows larger, and finally she meets a weird looking caterpillar resting upon a mushroom. She adventured from place to place, seeking help from many different creatures. Lewis Carroll has a very unique way of describing different events and is also very creative while doing so. For example, when Alice was playing a relaxing game with the Queen of Hearts, the author describes the ball as a hedgehog, and the stick as a skinny, pink flamingo, which puts a very creative picture in the reader's mind. In the process of this story, Alice drinks and eats things, even though she doesn't know what she was ingesting, she did it anyway. Every event in which happened, went with the pattern of the events in the story. Every event was important and was needed to make sense out of the wild story. In &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, Lewis Carroll uses his imagination to create a story full of memorable and fantastic events, used to put a smile on the reader's face and a strong grip on the reader's hand. Overall, I would recommend this book to readers 13 and older. This book will put a sparkle in the reader's eye, and a mind full of memories for a lifetime to remember. So if you have a chance, pick up the book and start an adventurous fantasy through Wonderland!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I just read this book for an Honors English class, and I got exactly what I expected. Lewis Carroll has an unique writing style;it is unlike anything that I have read before. His use of words give a sharp image in the reader's head, just like as if they were actually there. He uses excellent imagery. His descriptions on every single character was great,and that was one thing that I enjoyed. An example of his descriptions is in the beginning of chapter six, when Alice sees a footman in front of a house. Carroll describes the footman &quot;with a found face,and large eyes like a frog&quot;. He is one of the few authors that take the time to describe the supplementary characters. The main character is , of course, Alice. She is very adventurous, and this is seen throughout the book. Anyting that she sees that is new, she will try it. In the very beginning of her adventures, she sees a potion that is laying around, and in hopes of getting into the garden that she saw earlier, she drank some of it, just because it said &quot;drink me&quot;. The potion made her very small, which eventually became an adventure within itself. Another example was when she went to play croquet with the queen. They played croquet with hedgehogs as balls and flamingoes has sticks. Alice didn't care what the adventure was, as long as she was a part of it.She also didn't hesistate to express her opinions. When the queen was executing everyone in her path, Alice spoke up about what she was doing. People who like adventuruous characters would like Alice. The theme of this book to me is if you see something new, you should try it just for the fun of doing something new. It is shown by Alice's different adventures, like what I mentioned in the previous paragraphs. I didn't really get the plot of this story. I thought that it was to get to the garden that she saw in the beginning of the book. I think that I didn't get it because Carroll jumped from one adventure without finishing the previous one. That is one of the reasons why I gave this book three stars out of five. I didn't like this story, partially because it was fantasy. I just read it to try something different.I would recommend this book to readers who like reading fantasy and who like to use their imaginations while reading. I don't know why it is a big children's classic, but I didn't like when I was in elementary school and I still don't like it in high school. This book will most likely never become one of my favorite classics. Overall, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; wasn't very effective to me."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I read the book, \\"Alice In Wonderland.\\" This is a very good book to read but it can also get very confusing if you don't read it thoroughly. The author of this book has a very unique way of writing. The author thinks back as a child and put down everything that happened and then exaggerates it so much that it is a totally fiction book. \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" is not the type of book where you could skip over sentences, because you would get completely lost. This book is a magical book. It takes you into a world you never knew was there. The main character in this book is Alice. She takes many trips, not knowing that in her imagination she is making it all up. She goes from the woods, to a big hallway, into water, then into a house in which she grows larger than wanted, and then she meets a caterpillar on a mushroom. There are many other places she went and met other creatures that helped her along the way. There are many things you can learn from this book. For example Alice wanted to change her size (she wanted to be different than she was before) but then things went terribly wrong. She never went to the size she wanted to be... she either went too short or too tall. This teaches you that you should accept the way you are, because you will thank yourself in the end. You are perfect the way you are you never need to change unless you are bad and need to change into good. You could really learn a whole lot from this book but it is going to be hard for younger kids to understand. I personally recommend this book for 12 year olds and up. This book is really good, give it a try it will take you into a magnificent world and you will never want to come back!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"THE ULTIMATE FAIRYTAIL.

In rereading the book, I laughted loudly at times of the cleverness with which it was constructed. As a very 'mature' reader I had remembered such from my youthful reading of it. Then I realized the movie makers had indeed 'Hollywoodized'-- that enchanting story -- making it violent and very Harry Potterish in its 'dragon chases' Of course the British actors were superb, as well as the American, but what a corruption of its dreamy innocence with such nightmareish malevolence! This book really is a must for anyone's collection of childhood classics read and enjoyed, even if one is older."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"The author wonderfully re-creates the unsettling and illogical happenings of the dream world. I suppose this has stood the test of time because it has no message or moral - unlike other children's books, which can be too precious and preachy.

The book was also in very good condition and I will deffinatly be ordering from here agin."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Alices' adventures in wonderland and through the looking glass written by Lewis Carroll and is illustrated by John Tenniel is a story that has lived on and is enjoyed by both young and old. The original book was an immediate classic success for people young and old to read.Carroll's sense of absurdity in his humour and his amazing gift for games of logic and language have made this book an enduring dream legacy of what is possible to happen in a persons mind. This is a story about Alice and growing up and what is lost for her in doing so. Alice dreams of a world where she doesn't belong to and where what is true in her real life isn't necessarily true anymore. The story begins when Alice follows the frantically delayed white rabbit down a black hole into the magical world of wonderland, where she meets a variety of some bizarre creatures some mythical creatures and some downright illogically wrong creatures. There is no linear path to life in wonderland where one event will lead seamlessly to another adding meaningful experience upon experience, instead life for her is made up of series of oftentimes unrelated events, by conversations you never fully understand while others you can't reason with at all in a completely upside down unpredictable world,that is always ever changing. Carroll's way with words has stood the test of time. His use of characters such as the mad hatter and the jabberwocky all have added to the simplistic colorful nature of his story in its a true grandeaur of a masterpiece that will live on for generations to come for readers reading it. Characters that keep you wondering for days on what they exactly are ? Do they belong in our world truly or are they a instead a collection of mixed creatures that are taken from mythological creatures of times a gone by who knows? If you haven't read this book yet then pick it up and read it no matter how young or old you are in age."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I really do love this book with all my heart. It's one of those books you can re-read a million times and it never gets old."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Believe it or not, there was a time when the world was seen as a place where imagination had no place. It was during the industrial age of the 1800s and the mechanic way of life was in. As such, art and fantasy were seen by a lot of people in England as ridiculous, nonsensical, and tolerable at best. But Lewis Carroll didn't think so. There are always a few people who won't give up common sense for the sake of public opinion. Writing for a little girl named Alice Liddell, Lewis Carroll told of the adventures of another girl named Alice who, after a tumble down a very strange rabbit hole, found herself in a place where fantasy and nonsense reigned supreme. Countering the status quo of the era in England, \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" bursts with eccentric characters and unsuspecting twists and turns. A good read if you're tired of the machinization of any age and need to have some good old fashion unpredicatable fun!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I must confess I had never read the account of Alice's adventures before. As an adult, though, I found the two books to be quite charming and fun to read. Alice's Adventures In Wonderland is the much more enjoyable tale of the two, perhaps because so much of it was already familiar to me as a part of popular culture. Through the Looking Glass seemed to me to be much more contrived and less magical. I found myself trying to puzzle out hidden messages and motifs in the latter work, while I basically just read the Wonderland story for pure enjoyment. The latter tale also seemed to fall apart at the seams as it began to approach its conclusion. Without rereading the books, I have trouble seeing all of the complex and satirical things mentioned by academic types (such as a critique of Victorian society and contemporary educational methods), nor does the whole chess game motif make complete sense to me, although the workings of the game apparently pleased the mathematician in Carroll's alter-ego enough that he attempts to explain it at the start of Through the Looking Glass.It was a treat to see the original illustrations of John Tenniel interspersed throughout both stories, despite the fact that Alice appears a good bit more sullen than I envision her in my own mind. It was also good to be formally introduced to such well-known entities as the Cheshire Cat, although Humpty Dumpty certainly comes across as a rather taciturn figure. For those of you who love puns, Lewis Carroll offers you a gold mine of them, although I doubt that many children will actually understand very many of them until they reach an age in which they will probably reject a reading of Carroll as \\"baby stuff.\\" I'm no expert on children's literature (or on children, for that matter), but the story of Alice's adventures would seem to offer a free ticket to an enticing fantasy world for youngsters and a delightfully quaint vacation spot for adult readers."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I purchased this book because I was specifically lo0king for the sequel, Through the Looking-Glass.

I purchased it after reading that review and thinking he must be mistaken, but he is right, it is there."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I don't think we will ever again see anything quite like the two Alice stories. They are both unalterable masterpieces.As beautiful as the Disney movie is, the two books have so much more. More off-the-wall characters, more extremely witty dialogue, and more imaginative scenarios to ponder, these books go above and beyond any creative work I have ever seen.Carroll's works have changed my life more than any self-help book ever could. Through them I can ponder about so much more than only the things I can see. I am able to look inside of my imagination, and be unafraid to push its limits.I was around 20 years old when I read the Alice books for the first time. They seem a bit complex for children's books. I believe Carroll intended the books to be for an 8 year old child, and to be honest, I'd be impressed if I saw someone that age reading this material. The vocabulary and sentence structure involved looks more suited to someone the age of 12 I believe, but perhaps children know more than I am aware of.Also, Pig and Pepper (one of my favorite chapters), has a scene that's quite disturbing. I don't know if a first time novelist in this day and age could get away with including such content in a children's title. It's nice to take a look at though, since the chapter contains the very first appearance of the Cheshire Cat. I personally like the sheep from the Wool and Water chapter of \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" a little bit better than the Cheshire Cat, so try looking into that chapter also if you can."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"This has to be two of my favorite books of all time. Carroll has managed to create memorable characters, the mad-hatter, Humpty Dumpty and many others. This is not merely a well-written children's story but a piece of biting satire and a violent attack on the norms, morals and ethics that were prevalent at the time. For instance when Humpty Dumpty shakes hands with Alice he only offers one finer. This was an extreme version of the upper class only offering two fingers to shake to anyone below their stature and he takes this nasty habit to its ugly extreme. The pictures are tremendously well done. I can not praise Caroll enough since he is one of the best writers of children's stories ever and the way he paints the landscape and his usage of the words is truly stupendous. Every time I read it there is something new I pick up and that I have not thought about before. This is the sign of marvelous talent and proves that he is one of the best authors and story tellers ever."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"The book ''Alice in Wonderland Through The Looking Glass'' was an interesting book. I liked the book because it had neat words to learn and also the pictures were very well in illustration. My favorite part in the book was when she met the catipillar. That was my favorite part because he was so calm the way that the author wrote, and he also described the catipillar's actions very well. The ending was nice because it was just good to know she got what she wanted. This book is good and confusing but it is worth while."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I loved Alice in Wonderland growing up.

I was not happy with this book, and would not recommend it to anyone if you enjoy \\"normal\\" size print. This was really tiny!!!!!The book arrived in good shape and the shipping was satisfactory."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I first read theAlice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Signet Classics)books as a child, armed with my own library card. Throughout that experience, I was simply delighted by the wonderfully colorful illustrations and the fanciful tales. There was no issue of digging for deeper implications, puns, or wordplay. I still recall my fascination with the nonsensical creatures, as well as with Alice's adventurous dreamland.As an adult, one can choose to delight in the obvious fantasy adventures or search for hidden meanings. Therefore, for the purpose of this exercise in which I foray into a reading challenge that will encompass these books and others that can be considered \\"retellings and sequels\\" or \\"literature with allusions and influences,\\" I am choosing to simply enjoy revisiting a childhood treasure.In any case, the most important aspects of these books are the creatively developed characters, especially the portrayal of Alice as a curious child who is obviously intelligent with layers of common-sense and creativity. Just following the characters in their upside-down or backwards adventures can be enough to intrigue the reader. All the reader must do is suspend disbelief for the purpose of the reading experience, which is not such a departure from many reading or movie-going encounters.I plan to reserve my searching for hidden meanings for the other books that I will be exploring in the upcoming weeks.This book is obviously a classic that has stood up to the test of time--it should be no surprise that I am giving it five stars."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"This book is very much worth reading for anyone who would like to know the story before some ells changed it around.

Known best both in his lifetime and even more afterwards for his three GORMENGHAST novels (TITUS GROAN, GORMENGHAST, and TITUS ALONE), he was equally adept as a poet and as an illustrator and painter. He illustrated many of his own works as well as those of contemporaries such as Quentin Crisp, and on occasion provided new illustrations for classics from the past, such as this wonderful edition of ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS, first published in a rare and obscure edition in 1946 but republished many times since and still readily available.My copy is the Shocken (USA) hardcover edition from 1979, and I can recommend it strongly to anyone interested in a decent copy of the work but not necessarily prepared to look for an earlier edition. The binding is nice, the paper acid-free, the illustrations well reproduced. Peake is closer in style at first glance to Tenniel than most other 20th century artists who have interpreted the work; his finely detailed pen-and-ink work and heavy crosshatching bear the hallmarks of the classically trained illustrator in line with the earlier Victorian draughstmen who set the stage for much children's book illustration in England for a century or more. But there is a weirdness and grotesquerie - a creepiness - to this artist's work that is much more unnerving than Tenniel's and that, in my opinion, does a better job of reflecting the genuinely disturbing elements in the text, the madness and terrors that lie on the edges of the story in such violent characters as the Queen of Hearts and Tweedledum and Tweedledee. There are also pictures that edge close to a surrealism that Carroll was approaching, but that Tenniel I think didn't really understand.A magical interpretation then, and one that any collector of either artist or editions of the work (I am both) should make a top priority."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"In my retirement, I've taken up creative writing and enjoy it very much. In the last five years, I've written over 150 short stories. Had a few published and others read on our local PBS station. The teacher suggested we read \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" as a good example of imaginative story writing. I don't remember reading it as a child, and it was fun delving into Lewis Carroll's mind as he dreamt this up for Alice, his young friend. The introduction to the book, about Carroll, did a good job of setting the story up as well as provide biographical information about the author."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"this classic story is totally worth the read. if you love fantasy this is the book to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Is it a children's story or a primer on logic or even a work of wit and wisdom?Maybe it's all three.Alice in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass make up the two Alice books by Lewis Carroll. And in these books, Carroll paints a strange world in which logic has a strange way about it, mostly consisting of folk who interpret things quite literally.This, being a classic of children's literature, has been mimicked by many, and by many, unsuccessfully. Though, I will admit that many adaptations of this work have been made satisfactorily.The first book takes Alice down a rabbit hole and into wonderland. There, she meets all sorts of strange characters and discovers the queen of hearts, as well as other card-themed characters. The queen, it seems, is obsessed with displacing people's heads, and Alice must take every precaution to not upset her majesty.The second book takes Alice through a looking glass into a chess-themed world. Here the cruel magnate is the red queen. Alice learns many new poems and logical quirks before returning back through the looking glass.This book is sure to be enjoyed by bright children as well as adults who are kids at heart."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I have always loved the classic Disney movie of Alice in Wonderland.

The author's use of language is extremely appealing to the younger readers. These young readers are attracted to this book because of the author's use of many songs. For instance the lullaby sung by the duchess to her child. The Mock Turtle also sang to Alice and the Gryphon a song about the Lobster Quadrille. The author also uses poems that are entertaining and fun to listen to. &quot;You are Old Father William&quot; is one of the many poems. Not only does the author use poems but she also uses commonly known poems and changes the words to fit the character saying them. For instance the Mad-Hatter sings Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in different words saying &quot;Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky.&quot; If this isn't a unique way of writing I dont know what is. Another style of her writingthat is appealing is when she creates a picture, using words in a poem, about the poem. Yhis is used on page 37. The words in the book are nbot hard so the book can be enjoyable when it is being read, not stressful. The author brings animals to life which is an interesting style of writing. This is Lewis Carroll's style of writing. The main character in this book is a little girl with blonde hair named Alice. This child is full of fantasies and dreams, which is what the book is about. Alice is very curious and likes to know every little detail. She thinks she is very smart. For example, when Alice is listening to the Dormouse's story she asks questions like &quot;What did they live on,&quot; and makes smart comments such as &quot;They could'nt have done that you know, they'd have been ill.&quot; She is also a little bit bratty, especially to the Dormouse when she says: &quot;Nobody asked your opinion.&quot; These characteristics pull together to make an interesting main character and to create a fabulous story. The theme of the story is sometimes you need to take a break out of every day life and dream of fantasize. This makes your life more interesting even if you dream about things that will never come true. Alice does this when she dreams about changing sizes and listening to talking animals. Dreaming doesn't hurt anyone except the people who don't do it. If nobody ever had dreams life would be extremely stressful and boring. The plot of the story is all about Alice trying to find the white rabbit, which of course is in her dream. Following the white rabbit takes ALice to interesting places, such as the Courtroom filled with animals, and the Duchess' house, along with meeting interestingpeople such as the Cheshire-Cat and the Queen. This amazing cat hes the ability to disappear whenever it wants to and it always smiles. In the end Alice finds the white rabbit and then wakes up from her dream. This is the plot of the story. The story is effective to the reader. This is so because after listening to such acreative dream and fantasy, it inspires people to take a little time out of the day and be creative and dream once in a while. All the parts of this five star story; the writer's style, the main character, the theme, and the plot; come together to create the overall effectiveness of the story. This is why I rated this book five stars."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"If you've ever wondered what this story was like, I encourage you to read it for your self.

The order came in time and was brand new as I expected it to be.If you havent read it, you should do so."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Lewis Carroll's Alice stories are two of my favorite stories of all time. I love that they are about imagination - it reminds us that everyone should exercise their imagination from time to time, even adults. After all, if no one used their imaginations there would never be any inventions (the White Knight in Through the Looking Glass is a grand inventor) or progress in the world, although you do have to watch out for the people who use their imaginations for evil. These books are also wonderful because in today's non-stop world we all need a break from reality in a place that is ridiculously nonsensical.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass are stories of a young girl named Alice who, as we find out at the end of each story, has fallen asleep and dreamed up fabulous lands, creatures, and exceptional nonsense. Although often printed together since the main character is the same little girl, they are actually two separate books written several years apart. They are set in two very different, yet equally ridiculous, places - Wonderland and a place simply called \\"Through the Looking Glass.\\" These books are classics because they have not only stood the test of time, but also because they can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Young people can enjoy them because they are so fantastically silly, and adults can appreciate Carroll's mastery of wordplay.I can't remember if I was in junior high or high school when I first read them, but as is the case with most classics that I read back then, I did not fully understand or appreciate them the way I do now. In going back and rereading them, I found them to be much more humorous than I did the first time around. They illustrate beautifully the reason why English is one of the most difficult languages to master. Part of the charm of the Alice stories is that the characters constantly miscommunicate with each other by using different meanings of words (the Cheshire Cat telling Alice about characters who are \\"mad\\" and meaning that they are crazy while she thinks he means that they are angry), different spellings of words (the mouse saying his \\"tale\\" is long and sad and Alice thinking his \\"tail\\" is long, but she can't understand why it is sad), or by the characters taking comments literally instead of figuratively (Alice complains to a frog that no one is answering the door and he wants to know what question the door asked).Unfortunately, like many classics the language that has made the Alice stories so funny is the same language that will keep many modern readers from enjoying them. Most classics were written in different ages and people talked differently back then. Words and phrases have come to mean different things, we use different slang, and our very patterns of using language have changed. There have also been huge changes in society that affect the way we read and understand. In the 19th century when the Alice books were written, people (especially those in the higher classes) were much more \\"proper\\" than we are today. They had strict rules of conduct which we see Alice struggling with throughout the books, especially since the people and animals she encounters in her imaginary worlds don't seem to be playing by the same rules that she is used to. This again is part of what makes the Alice stories so funny, but only if you \\"get\\" the joke.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass are truly timeless classics that should be read and reread throughout a person's lifetime. Each time I read them, I find something that I overlooked before, keeping them both comfortingly familiar and surprisingly fresh. Alice is definitely a heroine that little girls can love, but boys might be hesitant to read these stories since they are about a little girl. They should, however, find the kings, knights, creatures, and fight scenes (you know, all the \\"boy stuff\\") appealing. Children will need a pared down, edited version that they can understand, and given the differences in language, junior high and high school students may need a \\"translated\\" version as well. At any age, the Alice stories are best enjoyed when read in the spirit that they were written - with the wonder and pleasure of childish imagination. After all, \\"Life, what is it but a dream?\\""},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"From the first to the last page, Lewis Carroll displayed his unique exposition of characters in order to convey his ideas of the world he wished to create for his readers. The main characters of this wonderful tale include: Alice, the White Queen and King, the Red Queen and King, the Gnat, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, the Lion, the Unicorn, and the White Knight. Alice, the protagonist, displays a sense of determination to be liked by the people in the Looking-Glass throughout the story despite the fact that the people hardly care for her. A character that ultimately disregards Alice's every word is the Red Queen, which is a strong, organized woman that is sure she is correct over everyone else. Quite the opposite, the White Queen is an unkempt, tentative woman, but helps Alice along her journey. Alice meets the Gnat on a train ride while he is whispering ideas of jokes in her ear to say to the other riders, yet his tepid disposition betrayed his sadness. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are just an odd pair of brothers that fight over meaningless things. Humpty Dumpty is an egg- shaped man that is simply rude to Alice and changes that meaning of all the words she asks him to define. A sweet, awkward, uncoordinated man, the White Knight, leads Alice to the end of her journey. A main conflict that Alice is forced to endure is her struggle to be accepted by the other creatures and people in the Looking-Glass. Another conflict is that Alice must travel through the land alone in order to achieve the rank of Queen. One plot action that helped lead up to the climax is when the Red Queen actually describes the path Alice must follow if she wishes to become Queen alongside herself and the White Queen. She told Alice that she was a Pawn on a chess board and she was to travel through eight squares, and also explained to her who or what is in each one; for example, she told her that she will meet Tweedledum and Tweedledee in the Fourth Square and in the Sixth Square she was to meet Humpty Dumpty. Another action that gradually leads to the climax of this tale is when the White Knight rescues Alice from the Red Knight and leads her to the Eight Square. Enthusiastically, the White Knight gibbers on about the new inventions he has created, and Alice is somewhat listening but is subconsciously waiting to arrive at her desired destination to finally experience her future, whatever or wherever it takes her.\\"Through the Looking- Glass\\" has the capacity to push your imagination to the level it was when you were a child, and that's what I loved the most about it. One of my favorite chapters in the book was \\"The Garden of Live Flowers\\", for the distinct personalities Carroll portrays for each flower was quite entertaining to read and it grasped my attention as did many of the other chapters. I also admired the idea of everything being backwards in the Looking-Glass world, and this was finely displayed in this chapter. \\"Humpty Dumpty\\" was another chapter that I enjoyed because I had a slight twist from the regular story I usually heard as a child. I was able to see the alternative view of a classic tale, and that was a pleasant change of perspective. Throughout the entire story, I also appreciated the diversity of the characters because their odd personalities come together to create a pleasurable read. With the Red Queen being rude and strong and the White Queen being benevolent and hesitant, Humpty Dumpty's character is uncaring but the White Knight's character is sweet and awkward , and Alice's determined personality is different from all else, this causes the readers to get hooked and interested in learning more. I would recommend this book to all children, teenagers, adults, and seniors because imagination has no age limit."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was the first book I can remember that truly thrilled me. I was very young when I picked it off a bookshelf at my grandparents' house almost at random. I was immediately drawn in: electrified, enthralled, amazed. I wanted more and more. This most recent trip through Wonderland was perhaps the second re-reading since then, and while I cannot ever again read it with the wonder of a small boy, I can still see why it captivated me. The wordplay; the games with logic; the agreeably disagreeable characters; Alice's mixture of confusion, curiosity, and determination--it was an irresistible combination. Some might think it is silly for a grown man to read a book like this, but it is certainly no sillier than for a grown man (and an Oxford don at that) to write one. And while Carroll's obsession with little girls, including photographing them naked or near-naked, is downright creepy now to an adult (something I didn't know about when I read his stories as a child) from a literary perspective it is easy to see how this fascination was channeled into giving his young friend Alice Liddell (his boss's daughter) a story to captivate her imagination by making her the primary character. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is the more engaging story, but the chess-themed Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There has some of the passages I remember most. There is the Red Queen running so fast with Alice that their running is more like flying, and pointing out to Alice that \\"it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place.\\" Then there is the White Queen in discussion with Alice about impossible things, informing her that \\"sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.\\" There are the appearances by Humpty Dumpty and by Tweedledum and Tweedledee (characters Carroll did not invent, but who play more than cameo roles in the story and provide occasions for some of the author's trademark logic and word games). And of course, \\"Jabberwocky,\\" a poem I can still recite from heart, comes from the looking-glass world. While they are perhaps not so magical to me as they once were, it was very pleasant to read these two stories again. They are nice for a diversion, a few linguistic gymnastics, and a return visit to a land that has set more than one person on a lifetime course of reading."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"This is a really great book! But at some points the book got a little boring to build up a climax.

One of them was 'Alice'....Even tho I had read it as a child, I had forgotten just how wonderful Carroll's book was......Recently I was in a bookstore and noted that once again summer classics are out and it was in the pile once again. It can be read and enjoyed by all ages, but I think the subtleties can be best enjoyed by those who are a bit older e.g. the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, the croquet game featuring the Queen of Hearts etc. I was reminded of how much the tea party reminded me of a previous job that I had involving a variety of board members.I guess there is only only one word to describe this classic, 'timeless'."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"THIS IS A BOOK WICH ONE SHOULD ANALYSE FOR ONESELF!And NO, one cannot overanalyse this book, the symbols in it are like the branches of a tree. The branches keep expanding until they end in fruits and seeds, the seeds thereoff will fall unto the ground and transform into another tree wich also has seeds and the cycle will continue ad infinitum.One of the most important symbols is the transformation trough eating pastry or drinking liquids, wich will make one bigger or smaller. The pastry or the liquids as clusters of thought wich will transform ones shape in nonphysical reality. Have you ever encountered someone who was very short or small in appearant reality yet he/she displayed a posture of magnificent greatness? Well, it is not a wild argument to state that he/she took a bite of the cookie or a zip of the magick potion....Another thing very important are the playing cards. The metaphor as life as a game, yourself batteling a whole armada of playing cards spades, hearts and diamonds alike!Then there is the eloquent buffoonery one engages upon in the teaparty of life (remember the rabbit and the hatsalesman?). This reminded me very much of the people one encounters in everyday life who seem to not be able to think clearly, to be out of syntax with the axioms of logic. These people will resort to various kinds of practices like palmistry or speaking with angels, they have postulated their delusions into actuallity.But of course, to transcend beyond this and to show you a way out one has to engage upon our magickal cat (but usually one will just bumb into him at the least expected moment).

Truly amazing. It has inspiried so many people, and even those in my acting school who didn't see much more than the Disney movie were moved by it. And to those who say it was confusing and full of nonesense, I have an explanation. The story was made up by Carroll on a boat ride to Alice Liddell and her other two sisters. Alice wanted to hear a story with lots of nonesense, and that's what Carroll did. If you still do not get it, I can't put it any more clearly. If you need help understanding the books, buy volumes such as the Annotated Alice and other books that explain Carroll's work. Hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"It's difficult to critique a classic, especially one as well-known as this one, so I have decided to take a different path and strongly recommend this work to all aspiring fantasy authors.Rather than becoming absorbed/obsessed with the works of Tolkein or Jordan, take a long and critical look at this masterpiece.A fantasy, first and foremost, must be fantastic, and Lewis Carroll evokes the fantastic and surreal beautifully without sacrificing that centerpiece of drama known as characterization. The novel's constructs are mind-bending and dizzying; the novel is truly fit for Wonderland."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"This book is genius (in a nonsensical sort of way).

It's so magically written, I recommend it to anyone who likes a good laugh or perhaps likes everything that makes no sence what so ever!!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"My first exposure to Lewis Carroll's classic children's story was through the 1951 Disney film adaptation \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" which I watched repeatedly as a child. The creative quality of the story never failed to fascinate me, and I kept going back despite my deep-rooted terror of the frightful Queen of Hearts, who always gave me nightmares! However, it was not until recently, as an adult, that I ever picked up the book/s upon which that film was based. In some ways I wish I had read it when I was younger, as the book certainly makes a great deal more sense than the movie does (as much sense as a story of this sort can, anyhow), but thankfully this book is unique in that it is just as enjoyable for adults as for children.The story is actually spread across two books, here contained in a single volume. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was first published in 1865 and relates the events that take place after young Alice falls asleep during her lessons and dreams of following a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. Alice encounters all manner of strange creatures in her dream, and finds herself in all sorts of curious predicaments where common sense fails and the nonsensical comes to be expected. There is no central, concrete storyline, but rather Alice moves rapidly from one bizarre situation to the next before waking once more and relating the whole adventure to her sister.The second of the two books, \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There,\\" appeared in 1871 and is very similar in nature to the first, though having a slightly different plot. Here Alice steps through an ordinary looking-glass one day, only to find herself in a world where, if you wish to get anywhere, you must walk in the opposite direction! Walking toward your desired destination only gets you further and further away. Also, interestingly, the land which Alice has entered is essentially a giant chessboard, and she must move through the different squares to reach the other side if she wishes to become a queen (which she does).The characters Carroll created in these two stories are some of the most strikingly unique and unforgettable in the world of literature. Alice herself, based largely on Alice Liddell, a real-life child of whom Carroll was very fond, is a wonderful heroine that you can't help admiring. Throughout all of her backwards and upside-down adventures, she remains ever sensible and analytical, always trying to reason her way out of the most unreasonable situations. Other characters a reader won't soon forget include the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the Cheshire Cat, Bill the Lizard, the Caterpillar, the Duchess and her peppery cook, the aforementioned Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, the Gryphon, the Red and White Queens, the talking flowers, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Sheep, Humpty Dumpty, and the Red and White Knights. Carroll also created many fascinating new creatures in his stories, including bread-and-butterflies, rocking-horseflies, \\"slithy toves,\\" \\"mome raths\\" and more.What I find most intriguing, as an adult reader of these books, is Carroll's brilliant use of wordplay and symbolism throughout the stories. Nearly everything has some sort of double meaning. There are hidden messags and subtle witticisms on every page. Carroll also includes several parodies of what were well-known songs and rhymes in England at the time. Young children will love the books for their fantastic qualities and imaginative inspiration, but most readers will not pick up on the many puns and jokes until they are a little older, so these stories really do have something to offer to anyone, no matter what age. I'd highly recommend the book to any reader - and be sure to get an edition that includes the original illustrations.This review refers to the 2004 Barnes & Noble Classics printing, with introduction and notes by Tan Lin."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"There is one thing that all potential customers must keep in mind when buying any Alice book: Do not purchase one that does not include the illustrations of John Tenniel! This edition includes all of them and the quality of the reproductions on the pages are excellent. Tenniel's illustrations help add to the childish excitement of Carroll's stories and will be especially invaluable to teenagers and adults, having just by nature of growing up lost some of the imaginative innocence, that ability to stretch reality, that we all possessed as kids.Of course, the illustrations wouldn't mean jack if they didn't have a captivating story to work with. Carroll's amusing tale of nonsense is targeted as a kid's book, and that is always where many of our fondest memories of it will remain, but as a college student reading it I was amazed by its power to suspend reality and return me to a level of imagination that I had simply thought I lost somewhere along the way. The trip down the rabbit hole can be quite a different experience from a different point of view.This particular edition also includes a good introduction and very helpful explanatory notes organized chapter by chapter. The introduction and notes offer insights to Carroll's life and his relations with the real life Alice and her family that, from a student viewpoint, reveal an interesting and more personal side of the Alice tales."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"This is not a review of the book, you can refer to the printed (or many of the Kindle versions) for that.

It does look like a well formatted version of the book, with an introduction by the editor, the original poetry from the beginning of the story (which some public domain versions lack), the original italicized text rather than CAPITAL letters as in some public domain versions, and a good approximation of the unique text formatting as seen in the printed book.

Between Tweedledum and Tweedledee and Humpty Dumpty and all the reat of them, I had a lot of pleasant laughs and thoughts and dreams. Unfortunately, I read that Alice is losing popularity because people aren't at the reading level to read it before they outgrow fairy tales. This is a shame. people should preserve their imaginations just to read an excellent book like this and dream about it for a while. Now I am 13, and I stll treaasure this book.

Is there a person alive in Western civilization that *doesn't* know of Alice, the Mad Hatter, the Queen of Hearts, the White Rabbit and the Cheshire Cat? I seriously doubt it. Writing under the pen name of Lewis Carroll, Dodgson's quirky fairytale soon became a publishing sensation in Victorian England, quite an unusual feat for a dour mathematician who had no interest whatsoever in boys, women or most other human beings, and instead lavishing his attention on little girls - particularly one Alice Liddell, to whom he presented the original manuscript to. The story of Lewis Carroll is just as fascinating as his fictional Alice, so I would suggest following up the \\"Alice\\" books with a good Carroll biography.In a story that is so random (basically made up of one little girl wandering about in a dream) there is plenty of room for all sorts of crazy theories as to exactly what everything means. Does \\"Alice\\" have a deep subtext, filled with hidden meaning and messages? Is it Freudian? Elaborate satire? Does it reflect the deep internal frustrations, anxieties and wish-fulfillment of a slightly-disturbed mathematician obsessed with little girls? Or is it simply a series of weird and wonderful events dreamed up for the enjoyment of children? The fact that nobody is really sure *what* to make of this story is probably the reason why it's still published, read and discussed today.The other reason is its historical value. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was the first book designed for children that was entirely void of any sort of moral, and instead written solely for pure entertainment purposes. Before \\"Alice\\", children were stuck with stories that preached goodliness and virtue, something that Carroll himself pokes fun at during the course of the story, when he refers to \\"several nice little stories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had told them.\\" His stories came like an unexpected breath of fresh air amongst Victorian society, and it was little wonder that adults as well as children helped to make \\"Alice\\" a bestseller during its day.Another crucial feature to the tale is Alice herself, often considered the first realistic representation of a child in literature. She's curious, but sometimes a little shy. She's polite, but manners often give way to frustration and temper tantrums. She's intelligent, but not as intelligent as she would like to think she is (relying heavily on an education that often fails her). She often holds her own against the contradictory natures of the people she meets, but more often than not is baffled and belittled by them. She possesses some degree of common sense, but often does some remarkably stupid things. She's likeable, but she's also a bit of a show-off and a snob. In other words, she's the first (and perhaps the best) example of a three-dimensional child character in literature geared toward either children *or* adults.\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" begins with the infamous sight of a white rabbit with a waistcoat and pocket-watch muttering to himself: \\"I'm late! I'm late!\\" Abandoning her sister and the dull book that she's reading, Alice follows the rabbit down a rabbit hole and unexpectedly finds herself drifting deep down underground. What follows is a series of weird and wonderful meetings with the likes of the Queen of Hearts, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Cheshire Cat and the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle, as poor Alice - the only sane person in the madhouse - struggles to make herself heard against this twisted parody of the adult world.Nearly every page contains a clever pun, nonsensical poem or mathematical puzzle, and there's plenty here to keep you fascinated, whether it be Alice's abrupt shrinking and growing (brought on by eating Wonderland food, and perhaps reflecting Carroll's desire to control the growth of his young protagonist), the beautiful garden that Alice cannot seem to reach (and when she does, she finds it not quite to her liking, perhaps suggesting a reverse-Eden, in which children desiring adulthood soon realize that it's not quite what they expected it to be) or Alice's internal crisis in which she debates whether the surreal circumstances she's found herself in have resulted in her loosing her own identity (I won't even try to open the jar on *that* one!) No wonder scholars can go mad trying to untangle this tale! Even the fact that the story succumbs to the ultimate clich&eacute; in fantasy-fiction, the ending that will reward you with an F if you use it in a creative-writing exercise at school (I am of course, referring to the fact that Alice wakes up at the conclusion of the story to find that it was just a dream), doesn't damage the power of Carroll's imaginative force.\\"Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There\\" is a little more structured in terms of its storyline, perhaps because Carroll was not simply making most of it up on the spot, as he had done with its predecessor. This time, when Alice falls asleep, she crawls through the mirror on the top of the mantelpiece and into the room on the other side. There she finds a land organized into the shape of a giant chessboard, in which Alice herself is a little pawn that must journey to the end of the board if she wishes to become a Queen. On the way she meets several chess pieces, including the Red and White Queen, and the White Knight (widely believed to represent Carroll himself), as well as Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, a garden of living flowers, and the Lion and the Unicorn, the latter of whom famously tells Alice: \\"If you'll believe in me, I'll believe in you.\\" My favourite chapter would have to be the one that involves the ludicrously pompous Humpty Dumpty (who is really the one who coined the term \\"un-birthday\\", not the Mad Hatter and the March Hare as the Disney version would have you believe), though equally memorable is the intriguing episode when Alice happens upon the sleeping Red King, and is told that he's dreaming of her. Is Alice in the Red King's dream, or is the Red King in Alice's dream? What should happen if one of them should wake up before the other? It's a disturbing metaphysical conundrum, and hints at the depths with which a scholar (or deep-thinking child) could delve into these stories.Of course, not every child will enjoy the \\"Alice\\" stories. What was once vividly imaginative and innovative for a stifled Victorian audience has long since become commonplace in children's fiction, and the randomness with which the adventures take place can often unsettle young listeners (as they certainly did me, as I always felt that Alice was caught inside a nightmare). However, others will delight in the madness that abounds throughout the story, and others still will learn to appreciate the work as they get older. There are hundreds of editions out there, most probably quite as good as the next, but I would encourage buyers to track down an edition with John Tenniel's famous illustrations - you simply cannot read the \\"Alice\\" books when they are not accompanied by Tenniel's portrayal of his demure little Alice, with her hooded eyes and large forehead. It would be like reading C. S. Lewis without Pauline Baynes, or Roald Dahl without Quentin Blake. Unthinkable!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I had not read these books since I was probably seven or eight, and I am glad that I finally got around to reading them again. These are some of the most fun childrens books (or any books for that matter) ever written. A previous reviewer gave this book a poor rating because it was only a childrens book. I fail to understand how being a childrens book means that a book is bad. Many childrens book are among the best books that I have ever read. Just because a book is a childrens book does not mean that it is a book just for children. Lewis Carroll wrote this for children, but it is probably even more enjoyable for me to read now than it was when I was a child, for now I understand many of the double meanings and world plays that you would never understand as a child. Carroll is better with word plays than any other author that I can recall reading. He is a master of molding sentences that simply slide right off of your tongue because they flow so smoothly. This is definitely one of the best childrens books ever written.Overall grade: A+"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, was a shy, eccentric bachelor who taught mathematics at Christ Church, Oxford. He had a great fondness of playing with mathematics, logic, words, for writing nonsense, and for the company of little girls, especially a little girl called Alice Liddell (rhymes with fiddle), the daughter of Christ Church's Dean. Dodgson's passions somehow fused into two great masterpieces of English literature, the Alice Books, immortal fantasies whose fame surpassed that of all of Carroll's collegues at Oxford put together. If the Alice books had any &quot;purpoise&quot; other than to entertain little girls, it is to send you, the reader, to the pleasures of logic and philosophy and, as Carroll says in the introduction to Learners (1897) &quot;to give a chance of adding a very large item to your stock of mental delights.&quot; Carroll's special genius lies in his ability to disguise charmingly the seriousness of his concerns and to make the most playful quality of his work at the same time its didactic crux. In the case of Alice, we are dealing with a very curious, complicated kind of nonsense, which explores the possibilities of the use and abuse of language and is actually based on a profound knowledge of the rules of clear thinging and logical thought. In fact, most of Carroll's apercus and all his jokes are inversions of the rules. Reason is here in service to the imagination, not vice versa. And oh my! Those interesting characters! I like to think that most of the characters that Alice meets are Oxford Dons that the real Alice knew. They sound like Dons with their fine mastery of Socratic logic, their crushing repartee, and the disconcerting and totally unself-conscious eccentricity of their conduct. The wealth of material which Carroll presents for the illumination of his subjects is almost without end. The more I read it, the more I think about it, the more I find. In fact, I have reached the conclusion that AAW is in actual fact a story so deep as to yield results in exegesis almost beyond belief. Also consider purchasing The Annotated Alice by Gardiner. It will help increase your reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"People tend to lump \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass (and What Alice Found There)\\" into one collection which has taken on the new title of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". This is probably a product of the movies, which took bits and pieces from each and made a composite adventure. This was possible, because Lewis Carroll (a.k.a. Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) managed to make the stories so even in quality that they can be put together seamlessly. He also managed to keep the stories enough different, that one can still enjoy reading both of them one after the other, without the feeling that the second is just a retelling of the first.To be sure, there are several ways in which the stories are similar, but not to the point where it detracts from the reader's enjoyment of the story. There are only three characters which appear in both books, one of which is Alice. The other notable characters (the Cheshire Cat, the Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, etc.) are well distributed between the two books. Thus there is a looking-glass between the two, just as the looking-glass plays such a key role in the second book.The Penguin Classics edition of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass\\" includes both books including the illustrations by John Tenniel. It also includes the original \\"Alice's Adventures under Ground\\" which includes Lewis Carroll's artwork. For additional features, it includes \`\\"Alice\\" on the Stage' an article which Lewis Carroll wrote after seeing a production of the stage version, and it includes preface's to the books which Lewis Carroll wrote in 1896 for the 1897 editions. There are wonderful notes for both books, and a very informative introduction by Hugh Haughton. There is other supporting material as well. To sum up, this edition has pretty much anything one could want, other than a complete collection of Carroll's work.A last comment on the introduction, it covers the biographical information for Reverend Dodgson, and the information on how the stories came about. Some of this information may detract from one's enjoyment of the story, but one can certainly understand the decision to include it for those who are interested in Reverend Dodgson and his life. All in all, this edition is packed with everything and will suit those who just want to read the stories as well as those who want to delve deep into their origins."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Last week I downloaded the free version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

So, I came across this version and it was very appealing because I thought I was getting both books for just 99 cents. At first I was mostly satisfied since I saw the poetry, but the formatting of the book was weird. There would be a line of text and then the next line would only have a couple words.

But the book is 100% better than any movie.As a writer myself, I can only hope to write a book half as imaginative and charming as this one."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is my favorite book, and it has the sequel Through the Looking glass. This book is fantasy with a lot of humor in it. When I was little someone who came to our house gave the book to me. I never started reading it until I was in the 5th grade. But still I thought the book was too long so I never finished it in 5th grade. But in 6th grade I read the whole book and loved it, and I read it again this year. I think I could read this book 1 million times and still want to read it 1million times again!In the first story, Alice in Wonderland, It is about a girl named Alice. Alice is in this wonderful, magical place where creatures she never thought of come to life. It all starts with a white rabbit holding a pocket watch saying, \\"I'm late, I'm late.\\" Alice is very curious (who wouldn't be!) so she follows him and ends up falling through a hole, and it is a long, long fall. She comes to a room where strange things happen to Alice. She has a tea party with mad, crazy people, she meets the queen and finds out that the queen isn't decent at all!In the second story, Through the Looking glass, Alice meets a bunch of weird creatures. Alice steps into looking glass house where she is in a giant chess game and on her way to becoming queen Alice. And a lot of exciting and weird things happen along the way.I highly recommend this book to anyone in the 6th grade up. It is the kind of book that you can't stop reading. You get attached to the characters, and books that do that to me, I love, because you know you are enjoying the book. So if you like fantasy and like to have a few laughs, this is the book you have to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a great book. It gets your imagination going. It all starts when Alice is sitting on a bank with her sister and falls asleep. From there it is all imagination and from there your imagination never stops. Alice lets her curiosity get the best of her so she finds herself falling down a long, black, well after following the white rabbit. She follows the rabbit because she heard it say &quot;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!&quot; Personally, I would have followed a talking rabbit also. After she hits the bottom of the well she finds all of these doors that she soon finds out are all locked. After she went around trying all of the doors she found a three legged table in the middle of the floor with a small gold key on it. The key was to small to fit any of the doors and she starts to wonder how she is going to get out of her. She then finds a curtain and she moves it. That's where she finds the door that the key fits. Once she opens the door she sees a beautiful garden but she is to large to fit in the door. Alice then finds a bottle marked &quot;Drink Me&quot; and when she drink it she shrinks. When she shrinks she noticed that she left the key on the table which now she is to small to get. Then she finds cookies that says &quot;Eat Me&quot; so of course Alice being as curiosity that she is she ate it. The cookie made her larger then what she was before. It made her so large that she got stuck. She started to cry which made her shrink once again. She cried so much that it caused a river of tears. Alice meets a lot of wonderful creatures and people during her adventure. She meets a caterpillar who gives her advice. She also meets the Duchess who has the Cheshire cat. Alice was confused about why the cat was smiling so she asked the Duchess. The Duchess said that he was a Cheshire cat and that it was supposed to smile. The Cheshire cat told Alice to go visit the Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse. The cat told her that she would love them because they were mad. Alice did as the cat told her and visited them where she sit down and had tea with them. Alice also meets the Queen of Hearts won is an evil person. The Queens tarts get stolen and she thinks Alice stole them. Alice has to go to court over this. The Queen loved to scream &quot;Off with her head!&quot; Alice is woke from her wonderful dream by her sister. Alice then starts to think about how her sister will be when she grows older. At the beginning when she first falls asleep it is hard to tell if she is dreaming so that is kind of confusing but otherwise this book is wonderful and very easy to read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I was hoping to find a Kindle edition of both Alice books in one file with the original John Tenniel illustrations. This seemed to fit the bill and seemed to be worth the money. Overall, from my initial reading, I am mostly pleased with the formatting. The unorthodox type setups (such as the mouse's tale) are mostly preserved and the illustrations look good. One complaint is that the title very clearly says \\"with active table of contents.\\" There is no table of contents. I was disappointed in this. Also, on my K1 anyway, some of the poetry lines broke in the middle of words. This made the poetry awkward to read at some places. There also are some stray punctuation marks here and there, but this didn't really detract from the reading experience.Edit 3/19/10 - I finished reading the entire two books and found the table of contents at the back of the book.

That said, I am a huge sci-fi and fantasy fan and certainly don't have a lack of imagination, even at 27. Just a couple of years ago I re-read all of the Chronicles of Narnia, and enjoyed them just as much as--if not more than--I enjoyed them as a child.All of that said, yes, Carroll did a wonderful job portraying the messiness, strangeness, and scenery switches of a dream. But as a whole...his works barely rate a 3 on a one to five scale. In fact...I'd probably go with a 2.5 at best. Although some of his Victorian satire was certainly amusing, I feel as if these books were mostly nonsense and simply didn't contain the literary merit to render it a classic with the likes of, for example, Hans Christian Anderson, J.M.

Those thousand monkeys at typewriters would produce something along these lines before getting to Shakespeare. For some reason, I never read this when I was discovering Narnia or Oz. Ormondroyd's \\"David & the Phoenix\\" has the spirit I expected to encounter in Caroll's book. Instead - this book starts nowhere and ends nowhere. And perhaps that is the nonsense that some find pleasing. For me it was simply distracting. The whole idea of the world's we create ourselves is a notion I have always been drawn to.

The author is very creative in this novel; she uses the literary element personifications through out the whole book. She does a very good job with this by how she portrays the character in the book, (ex: the Queen as a snob). Alice (the protagonist) starts off by following a white rabbit to a hole. This late and timid creature leads her into Wonderland. Wonderland is a place of creation and imagination. The dream like setting gives her the adventure, like a labyrinth.

She finds herself lost and goes along with what ever she comes across the unknown world. She finds herself with decisions and she has to make to get to one point to the other. I think that this story has really no point, its just nonsense of fairytale she tells to little kids. She even said that she told this during a trip to entertain three little girls. To me the story was a pointless adventure. Yes, she creates a great tone and mood for the setting yet the body of the story was boring to me.

Is there not an equally complicit socio-political aspect to environmental issues? And why is this aspect, the environmentally comprimising social institutions, missing withing environmental news coverage? Guantlett's subltle, yet powerful analysis shows that the important &quot;absent narrative&quot; within television coverage of environmental issues is nothing as diabolical, cliche, or as simple as a conspiracy thoery, but rather the normal outcome of the workings of modern industial capitalism, corporate owned media, and thus an increasingly narrow ideological framework of acceptable media content. Guantlett's work is on the money - so to speak.A worthwhile sidenote: anyone who can incorporate Horkheimer, Adorno, Marx, and Beavis and Butthead into a single chapter about mass media and society is a five-star book for that reason alone - enjoy!"},{"Title":"Michelin Hungary Map #732 National (Michelin Maps) (English and Hungarian Edition)","review":"It is a very large map and quite detailed.

I would rate accuracy of this one, as perfect ... as usual for Michelin.But equally, I was often frustrated in trying to find the highway or route number for example. The numeral is always very small and along a 300 mile highway, the route number is not shown often enough. So, I find the highway I want and then need to look along it for quite a way on the map to figure out the route number.Even with reading glasses, in good light, I often found it too difficult to decipher the name of a road, for example.And in rural areas, there is simply too much information; every dirt road is shown, making for a very busy area. So it's difficult to find the road I want.The Province of Ontario, Canada is HUGE compared to all of Hungary and yet, the map (of another publisher) is no larger. Even so, it's so much easier to figure out what the route number is for a highway ... or to find a road in a non-urban area ... or to decipher the name of a road without a magnifying glass.I really think it's time for Michelin to re-think their approach to maps."},{"Title":"Michelin Hungary Map #732 National (Michelin Maps) (English and Hungarian Edition)","review":"The map is great, except that it is enormous!!

Baron Nicholas Picard had cut a swath through the women of Exeter and few mourn his death, including his wife. Still, could one of them have overcome such a powerful knight?Despite resistance from the local Sheriff, Lord Ralph Delchard and his associates investigate both the murder and the property dispute. Each of the five claimants is convinced of the justice of their case. Each had good reason to wish Picard dead (including his unloved wife). Still, three women, an ancient Saxon, and a priest seem unlikely murderers.Edward Marston does a fine job describing a fascinating time period when Norman rule was still new and still rode like a boot on the Saxon throat. His use of Brother Simon to provide comic relief works effectively to balance the narative and give moments of respite between the investigation. I would have liked to see a more fully developed character in Golde, Lord Ralph Delchard's wife, but otherwise find little to criticize in this fine historical mystery."},{"Title":"The Wildcats of Exeter: Volume VIII of the Domesday Books (Domesday Books (St. Martins))","review":"Twenty years have passed since William conquered England. The Conqueror is sending forth secular people and churchmen to adjudicate land disputes and collect taxes. Norman and Saxon alike detest these individuals, but with William's backing, they accomplish their tasks. On numerous occasions, the adjudicators must solve murders to determine who owns disputed property. While William's dispute resolution administrators ride to Exeter, someone murders Nicholas Picard, a claimant in a large land quarrel.The local sheriff insists robbers killed Nicholas, but Ralph Delchard and Gervaise Bret believe the homicide is tied to the land dispute. Each claimant to it, including the non-grieving widow, the mistress, the former landowner, and even the local church abbott had plenty to gain with the removal of Nicholas. Matters turn ugly when one of the administrators, Hervey de Maurighy disappears. William's men want to insure justice occurs even if it means risking their lives to insure it happens.Volume eight of the Doomsday Books is a finely executed, well-drawn medieval mystery because of the myriad of viable suspects with obvious motives, means, and opportunities. Thus, readers will never guess the identity of the killer with any certainty. Edward Marston paints a tapestry that vividly brings the late eleventh century into full perspective as the monarch's administrator enforce regal policy even to the detriment of a powerful noble. Fans of historical mysteries will take pleasure in THE WILDCATS OF EXETER and search for the previous Doomsday tales.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Wildcats of Exeter: Volume VIII of the Domesday Books (Domesday Books (St. Martins))","review":"Terrific whodunit set in 13th Century England. It took me a few chapters to settle into the rhythm of the novel, but once you're tuned in its great stuff. When a rich lord is killed on the way home from a trip to the city of Exeter to visit his mistress, a flock of claimants step forward to claim his lands. Ralph Dechard and his colorful colleagues represent the King to adjudicate the claims. Sex, violence and greed are the order of the day. As the tale unfolds, the &quot;clues&quot; point to several different possible villains in turn, but finally come together to reveal the true killer.

While I am certain the quality of the story is everything I have come to expect from Edward Marston, unfortunately the eBook conversion is also what I've come to expect for this publisher. It is extremely frustrating that the the author or print publisher is willing to tolerate the abysmally low quality of the editing on this text. This text, like the previous two I've purchased in this series, appears to have been converted but not edited at all. Many sentences run together, making it difficult to follow the dialog, it being unclear who is saying what to whom, while other sentences are broken into separate lines, as if a new speaker has spoken. In places where in the print text there is a section break indicating some change in scene, in this eBook there is no such indication, which makes following the action rather confusing.What is truly sad is that most of the editing mentioned above can be accomplished in under an hour. Is the profit margin so narrow they cannot afford to pay for it, or is this publisher so disdainful of the reader that they just can't be bothered?"},{"Title":"The Wildcats of Exeter: Volume VIII of the Domesday Books (Domesday Books (St. Martins))","review":"The king's commissioners, Ralph Delchard and Gervase Bret, have been sent to Exeter to settle some land disputes. Just before their arrival, the owner of several disputed properties, Nickolas Picard, is savagely murdered. Now there are five different claimants to Picard's property: his wife, his mistress, an elderly Saxon, a lady of the town, and the abbot of Tavistock.It soon becomes apparent to Delchard and Bret that the murder is somehow connected to their investigations. As they gather evidence, one of the king's commissioners is murdered in a similar manner to the first murder. Delchard and Brent will not stop until the identity of the the killer is discovered. They believe that if they find the murderer they will also find the true owner of the disputed lands.Added to the importance of solving the murder is another pressing issue. Gervase is due to be married at Winchester soon. Will they solve the mystery and get Gervase to the church on time?This novel is the eighth volume of Marston's Domesday Book series.

He has also written mysteries under his own name with both sporting and golf backgrounds. However it is primarily the books that take place earlier in history that I am interested in. He read modern history at Oxford and has had many jobs, including university lecturer, but fortunately for all his readers, he turned to the writing profession.After reading the first book in the series, I avidly sought out all the other books by Edward Marston and not a single one has ever disappointed me. They are about a period of history that I love. His Elizabethan theatre series of books were wonderful and he has continued them through from 1988 to 2006. The Domesday series is also a great series and this is the second book in the series.The Domesday series is about a period in England's history shortly after the Norman conquest , during the reign of William the Conqueror. It was King William himself who called for an \`inventory' to assess taxes and survey landholdings. This inventory was called the Domesday book and was a tremendous undertaking, but one that brought stability to England. Edward Marston's Domesday novels are based upon actual entries in the Domesday Book.Nicholas Picard is riding home in the gathering dusk. A journey he has made many times before, but this time he is attacked by a wildcat. His neighbours find his lacerated body in woodland, but when they discover the slit in his throat, it soon becomes apparent that it is human hands that have caused his death.Picard's death causes complications in a difficult land dispute that Ralph Delchard and Gervase Bret have been sent to settle in nearby Exeter. The murdered man had a stake in the outcome of the dispute and now his widow believes that she is the rightful owner of the land in dispute. However Picard's mistress and the mother of a previous deed holder of the land see things from a different point of view. Each woman is so determined to prove her claim that Ralph and Gervase begin to wonder if any or all of them are capable of murder."},{"Title":"The butternut guerillas: A story of Grierson's raid","review":"First, let me say that I'm not much of a history reader, no matter what the subject matter. And war stories really isn't my thing either. So how was it that I got into reading \\"The Butternut Guerillas\\" by Larry Underwood? Rather easily, if I do say so myself. Early one morning (like 5:00 A.M.) I was into my early morning 2-mile walk on the bike path with my two walking buddies, and one of them is a history nut. By chance, he got to talking about the Civil War and mentioned this book to me. He talked about the story and how these men that were Yankee soldiers and called the Butternut Guerillas played a major part in the Civil War, under the leadership of Benjamin Grierson. And their company was mostly from southern Illinois. Now he had my attention. The first thing I asked was if the non-fiction story was boring, because if it didn't grab my attention right off the bat, I wasn't going to waste my time. \\"Not at all. In fact, I think you'll enjoy the heck out of that book. I did,\\" Big Ed replied. Then I asked if he thought the local library had the book, and of course, he knew that it did. Later that day, I found myself in the library, picking up the small hardback. I'm the world's worst about thumbing through a book, looking at introductions, prologues, dedications, and even to the end of the book for final words. Needless to say, at the end of this little book was a roster of the Sixth & Seventh Cavalry Regiments from Illinois. Men's names from Hardin County, White County, Saline County, Pope County, and names that were familiar to the area, even names from different towns. And you must remember, this was in 1863-65. I was amazed at the names, so I read nearly every one of the field and staff members, when I ran across the name John W. Rogers, Saline County, Illinois. And I immediately knew this was my grandfather's brother. My very own great-uncle John W. Rogers. Little was said about this man while I was a young girl growing up, and when I tried to ask, I was simply told that \\"Uncle John was kind of the black sheep of the family\\". I guess everybody has one of some kind or the other. Regardless, Uncle John is buried in the family's cemetery plot and I put flowers on his grave every Memorial Day, even though I never knew him. He didn't play a big part in the book because he was simply a Yankee soldier, not one of the Butternut Guerillas, but now I couldn't put the book down. And believe me, without a doubt this is one of the best-written Civil War stories that has probably ever been told. I was totally amazed at the dialogue and how well Underwood told the events that transpired. In fact, I almost felt like I was there with those guys. This book is EXCELLENT. I can't believe that it hasn't been reviewed before. If you're a history nut and like to know how the events of the war transpired, this book is a great insight. The next time I'm honored with Big Ed's presence on the bike path, I'll have to tell him so."},{"Title":"Way Home","review":"This, the second volume of the Richard Mahony trilogy, opens where its prequel left off. Mahony, and his long-suffering wife Mary, are just about to land in England after years in Australia. At first thrilled to be back to the green fields of his homeland, Mahony soon realizes that people are the same everywhere; he was eager to leave the money-oriented and vulgar people of Ballarat, but in England he soon experiences snobbery, particularly against the warm and generous Mary, who cannot grasp that it's just not 'done' to socialize with persons who have been 'in trade.'Making yet another U-turn in his plans, Mahony decides they should return to Australia. But his investments have done unexpectedly well, and he can retire. Life in Melbourne forms the larger part of this book: the friends and family who are so important to Mary; births and a death; and against it all, Richard's increasing restlessness, his developing interest in spiritualism, his unsociability and ultra-sensitivity...Wonderful read - I can't wait to start the final volume!"},{"Title":"B2B Without the BS","review":"In general, this book presents a very good practical approach to B2B marketing.

I have nothing against smut (my wife loves it) but I picked up this book expecting just a good naval adventure series. For me, the author gets a little too descriptive when writing about the promiscuity of the main character. I understand that he's a young naval officer who would have been doing a lot of what the author portrays, but personally I could have done without the vivid details. I've read other series by other authors (Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series for example) that are more my speed. Portions of this book read like what I'd imagine a good smut book must read like. Maybe I'll let my wife read it and see what she thinks. Other than not liking the smut I think the book is fairly well written, so if you like smut and adventure this could be a good book for you."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"I have to agree with the comments of the other reviewers of this book but would also like to forewarn first readers that Lambdin has a fascination with ultra explicit sex scenes, and he embeds them liberally throughout his books. This no doubt makes the books more attractive to those who love modern literature but it is likely to be a bit disturbing to those, such as myself, who are more interested in nautical adventures than dime novel discriptions of sexual conquest. This hasn't stopped me from reading and enjoying his books but, as I now start on the fourth book in the series, I'm finding myself skimming through the sex scenes to get onto the real nautical stuff."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"I must congratulate mr dewey on these series of books,After reading all of C.S. Lewis's Hornblower I must say how much ive enjoyed reading this book.Its such a refreshing change to read about a character that has some of the normal flaws that every one of us has,Rather than the same ole officer and gentleman that we generaly read in the Rammage,,Aubry,,Hornblower sagas.It reads a lot like A Cornwell novel more than a lewis i found it very funny and also packed full of action which kept me turning the pages.Alan Lewrie is no Hornblower hes a cad and a bit of a ladies man but hes more of an intreasting character because of it.I will be collecting this series of novels and following mr Lewries career through the Royal navy.I hope my dewey will eventualy get around to writing about a character in the USN of the same period i would love to see that.I was born in Oxford England and now live in the USA and served in the British Army with the Royal Green Jackets the same regiment as Bernard Cornwells Sharpe."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"The King's Coat is a good story, maybe better than the 3 stars I rated it, of course I am a fan of nautical fiction with a soft spot for a leading character with a tarnished reputation. It's easy for Hornblower &amp; Bolitho to come out on top in almost every situation because they have no chinks in their armour. Not true with Alan Lewrie. He has some gaps in his character you could sail a ship of the line through! I guess that's what makes this unlikely hero so loveable. The naval detail is good and the characterization is better. The plot was a little thin, more like part I in a larger volume. Sure hope the publishers can find a way to reprint the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"This guy is not even close to being in a league with O'Brian. His characters are inconsistent and obvious, thin cliches. He makes his hero smart about whatever he has to be smart about at the time, with no relation to his education or background. The writing is sloppy. Every time a leadsman calls the depth, he &quot;mournfully intones.&quot; The sex is overdone and over written. The author's basic attitude is adolescent. The ship handling and battle scenes are good enough to make the books worth a casual read. I'd call him 3rd rate, but that would mean he had 50 guns."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"For me, any of the Alan Lewrie books are a matter of extremes. I extremely like the fast paced action at sea and the matters of our hero's budding naval career, but I absolutely LOATH the detail author Dewey Lambdin goes into regarding the main character's sex life. This problem faces the reader immediately in the beginning of the book, which opens with Alan Lewrie having sex with his half-sister. Now, I'm not some kind of puritan, but the type of sex scenes in this book are far too numerous and just unpleasant to think about by half. Lewrie's conquests take us into the bedrooms of some very relatively elderly women. Alan Lewrie often seems to cross the boundary between an anti-hero and a just plain immoral person (though he does \\"redeem\\" himself on occasion).So, you might ask, why do I rate the book so highly? The part of the book you're probably considering buying it for, the naval action, is superb. There has got to be three books worth of awesome battle scenes in this one volume alone and they are easily the best I've read in a very very long time. Alan Lewrie, despite being annoyingly perverted is a likable fellow to read about. Lamdin provides an inner dialogue for his protagonist that makes the action at sea feel personal (though on land it merely gives us a window to a part of everyone's mind nobody wants to see).All in all, its a good read. The parts I hate represent a smaller part of the whole book and I usually just skip them as they rarely add any crucial developments to the story. I will warn though, as one who has continued reading the series, if you find the excessive sex scenes (and I do not call them excessive lightly) annoying, the will only grow more annoying as the series goes on."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"Lewrie is forced to join the navy to avoid the hangman's noose for raping his sister. This book details his sexual adventures as a midshipman with a few sides of naval derring do. Lewrie is a conniving, thieving, toadying, sexual predator that will do anything to get ahead or get in bed. More time is spent on Lewrie's sexual escapades, he aspires to being a pimp, than his naval escapades. His naval accomplishments are due to a marine being stationed to keep people like Lewrie from running away and Lewrie's willingness to break his captain's orders and given word - both actions unbecoming an officer. Towards the tail end of the book he seems to have some of the makings of an officer, more for advancement than patriotism. I dislike anti-heroes and that is what Lewrie is, at least in this first book."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"Comparisons to Forester's Horatio Hornblower and Patrick O'Brian are understandable because of the subject matter. Dewey Lambdin's Alan Lewrie has more in common with George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman than the earnest Hornblower. Flashman, an officer in the army, shirks dangerous duty at every turn. Lewrie is a cad and forced into the the king's navy. Like Flashman, he craves a life of comfort and sport. Although Flashman is an unwilling participant in the historical events of his day, his observations are always astute and on target. Similarly, Lewrie is a quick study and a natural seaman who often sees strategic moves that his captains miss.Interesting to read a historical novel from the British point of view as this book takes place during the American Revolution. Lewrie's ship is focused on taking prizes that are supplying the American war effort and his ship engages in a fierce battle against the new colonial navy at one point.This was fun. I want to read more."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"Forget Patrick O'Brian. If you like Alexander Kent and C.S. Forestor, this series is for you! In fact, the hero, Alan Lewrie, is a bit more human than either Hornblower or Bolitho. And Mr. Lambdin certainly provides more humor, while staying true to the history and technical aspects of telling a good sea story in the tradition of Forester and Kent. If you like a GOOD sea story, or if you just like a good story, read this one."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"For historical fiction, this series is absolutely unbeatable! Huzzah for Dewey Lambdin's Alan Lewerie!"},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"The best thing about this book and the subsequent books is that the thoughts and atittudes of the Lewrie character are probably more accurate (ranging from panic to misery to disbelief most of the time) than most of the others in the genre. The pornographic elements telegraph themselves and can be ignored since they have nearly nothing to do with either the story or the character. Great history, though. Roman a Clef like the others, but well rendered."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"The book is in the shape it was promised, it was delivered quickly and on time.

Even though our hero's father has recognized him and saved him from the gutter, he is used as means to get our hero's dead mother's family fortune by being blackmailed into joining the Royal Navy as a midshipman at the late age of seventeen. The upshot is that our hero becomes a very reluctant but able sailorman. He begrudgingly finds that in spite of himself there is a core of decency and honour that makes him into something of a man. Albeit a man who ruts with after every woman he sets sight on. There is in this rutting a underlying doubt of his own sense of manliness. His rabid hate of homosexuals indicates a character riddled with secret self doubts of own sexuality. He seems to be to disturbed by close and warm feelings that any of his many very handsome friends may cause by to forward demonstrations of effections. He turns his back on one of the mentors on his first ship who had taken the trouble to teach him the skills of a sea officer, when that worthy is seen kissing another man in a carriage at a party where he been rutted like a boar with a married woman. He leapt to the conclusion that this officer was a 'Molly'. The hero/author will present further diatribes against homosexuals in the following stories of our hero's saga. The author's portrayal of the life of the British tar of 18th century is not entirely accurate when it comes to the idea that they were long sufferingly chaste in their sex lives except for when when in port and the ship was out of discipline. Our author is imposing the mind set of the mid 20th century on a time much different where men developed strong male to male ties that were kept separate from their duty to hearth and home. This was the case regardless of class, whether they were of the upper classes or lower. As witnessed by Admiral Nelson, infamous for his laision with Lady Hamilton, still whilst at sea was close to Captian Hardy from whom he asked a kiss before he died of his wounds at Trafalgar. In spite of the author's rabid homophobia, and overlooking poorly written sex scenes, this book and the following tales are good reads. However they will never match up to the stories about Hornblower or Bolitho."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"Having fallen in love with Patrick O'Brian's work, I started branching out into other naval fiction set in the same era. C. S. Forester and Frederick Marryat are very enjoyable. Lambdin is abysmal. The King's Coat is very poorly written and edited - subjects and verbs don't agree, there are endless misspellings, and any time he's at a loss, Lambdin throws in sex. The sex is fairly explicit, which is OK, but serves no other purpose than titillation of the reader, which is not. It advances the story in no way at all. Lewrie is apparently intended to be a nautical Flashman, but Lambdin doesn't have anything approaching the skill of George Macdonald Fraser. When Lambdin runs out of inspiration, Lewrie tumbles a wench at length and in great detail. The dialogue tends to sound either suspiciously American and modern, or archly dated. Nothing to recommend this book or the series except the fairly well done descriptions of the handling of the ships."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"I read this novel with the expectation of something similar for the C.S. Forester Novels of Hornblower. Boy, was I disappointed. It really is just an opera set to the background of the mid 1700's British Naval Era. It contains very little in the way of excitement that is worth anything. The writing is not moving and the explicit sexual scenes were over the top. I also take exception to the anti-gay sentiments revealed throughout the book. The writer reveals his true chauvinistic and homo-phobic tendencies with ungentleman like descriptions of women and gays. Reading pornography when I am looking for classic writing about a bygone era is like going to a boxing match and a hockey game breaks out, completely unnecessary. Sorry Dewey, but this one fell far short. I could not even complete the novel it was so bad."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"This book is a great read! The battle scenes are comparable to Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series. This book is fastpaced and action packed. Alan Lewrie is the opposite of Hornblower and Jack Aubrey which is completely refreshing, even if he is a lecherous rascal. The dialogue is fresh, quick witted, salty and to the point. I love this character and can't wait for the next book in the series. The fact that the author is a sailor makes the sailing lingo understandable and he includes information about ships and sailing points that helps the reader (sailor and non-sailor alike) understand the business of sailing that takes place in this book completely. Mr. Lambdin has given us in The King's Coat an excellent beginning to a wonderful series and a very rememberable rogue in Alan Lewrie."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"This is nowhere in the literary league of Patrick O'Brian, but seem pretty well researched. The characters are likable and fun, full of weaknesses as well as strengths. The bawdiness of the book is a real pleasure--this were real people having a wild time. The swearing is incredibly creative as well, a nice change from similar books which may say &quot;he cursed like a sailor&quot;. The sounds like the way people might really have talked. Great fun."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"This is the first book in a 12 plus book series, about the tales of Alan Lewrie, who goes from midshipman in the British Royal Navy to Captain during the 1780's to the Napoleanic Wars. The adventure is very good, the character development is excellent, we really get to know the midshipman and his thought process. Our hero is not the eagar young person wanting to join the navy, but a privledged (...)son of a Lord, who is 'pressed' into naval service by the trickery of his father. The nautical settings are accurately presented, however, the old english, and the foreign tongues that are part of the story are sometimes a little hard to understand. No need for a dictionary, but prepare to comprehend some passages that are not easy reading.Lastly, while many of our nautical heros do not seem to have a sex life, our hero has a good and vividly portrayed one. He seems to have almost as much fun in bed as he does on the decks of a fighting ship. Overall a great start to a series, I am currently reading book 7 and look forward to the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"If you like nautical fiction of the great age of sail (e.g. Forester, O'Brian, Woodman, Marryat), you will enjoy this opening volume of the action-packed, fast moving and realistic adventures of our tarnished hero, Alan Lewrie. While on water, this book is as good as any of the above writers, excepting of course the incomparable O'Brian. However, our author founders on land with trashy sex scenes more appropriate to a Harld Robbins potboiler. The author trying to model his protagonist on Fraser's Flashman, or Fielding's Tom Jones comes badly ascupper. These humorless sex scenes are perhaps why this nautical series is not as popular as many others. However, once back on the high seas, this book recaptures its pace and becomes highly exciting and enjoyable. One day, however, I hope to open a book with a handsome, brave, cunning and feisty hero in possession of a small penis. It will, however, not be written by the otherwise entertaining Mr. Lambdin."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"I read this book, the first in the series, and didn't find it greatly attractive. But it was good enough to make me read the *second* book in the series, and, from there on in, they just keep getting better. This is, in my opinion, the weakest book in the entire series. So...bear up, give it a chance, and keep going. You may find your persistence rewarded.The research is excellent. The nautical details are first rate.The sex scenes are unnecessarily lurid. I could really do without all the sex and cussing.But...these are sailors!"},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"I've read all the Hornblower, Aubrey-Maturin, and Bolitho novels and find this series by Dewey Lamdin to be a fine complement to the others. Alan Lewrie is more of a rascal in the first few books than the heroes of the other series but it's also fun to watch him develop into a seasoned British Naval Officer.What sets this series apart is the history. The first couple of books are set during the American Rebellion as told from the British side. I have read very few novels about our War for Independence that are as compelling and fast paced.Later on, the series deals with the French Revolution and then the Napoleonic Wars. Lewrie's duties takes him all over the world and the descriptions of the places and events are very well researched by author Lambdin. The reader gets a much better understanding of the times and events than in the other series by Forester, O'Brian, and Kent.I rate \\"The King's Coat\\" at only 4 stars since it has to spend a lot of time introducing the character and getting him out to sea and there's a little less action than in most of the subsequent installments. For example, I rate the second book, \\"The French Admiral\\", 5 stars since most of it is a riveting account of the battle of Yorktown as told from the viewpoint of a British sailor."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"It's takes nerve to invent a new Napoleonic War-era fictional naval hero when you're competing with Horatio Hornblower and Jack Aubrey, not to mention a half-dozen lesser lights. Except Alan Lewrie isn't really \\"heroic,\\" though he has nerve when needed. He's the bastard offspring of a scheming member of the minor London aristocracy, well educated enough and skilled with weapons, but profligate with money and definitely a \\"user\\" when it comes to women. After being set up (we don't know why -- yet) and caught in bed with his half-sister, he has the choice of being hauled before a magistrate or being packed off to sea as a midshipman. After a rough few months, he learns his trade well enough to be of some use on a deck and discovers a love of artillery. He makes some friends, loses some, commits some dreadful blunders, and has some unexpected successes. He's not a villain but neither is he entirely honest. In other words, he's a very human being and probably better than most of his class by our standards. Lambdin writes with humor and verve, inventing believable characters and painting excellent word pictures of the engagements in which Lewrie takes part -- but I wish he hadn't so casually elided what appear to be substantial portions of his protagonist's first year at sea."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"This entire series is incredibly addictive. Having just finished reading the series for the third time (lacking the oft lamented &quot;The French Admiral&quot;), I eagerly await Lambdin's next yarn. Alan Lewrie, just cast out of his comfortable life in London, thrives after getting his sea legs. Although this book and the entire series has more adult scenes than you will find with Horatio Hornblower, Lewrie's personal flaws make this a much more believable and enjoyable tale. Lambdin uses nautical and social terms of the day and paints a thorough description of life onboard a warship in the late 18th century. If you are fascinated by life during the Age of Sail, or just enjoy historical fiction, this entire series is a must read."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"The first of a growing series of books about a reluctant Royal Navy hero. I had previously read all of the later books in the series, with the exception of this book and the 2nd in the series, &quot;the French Adirmal&quot; (which is due for reprinting in '99), when I found this one. Thankfully it's being reprinted. It is quite humerous, and bawdy at times, but with plenty of naval action which takes place at the beginning of the American Revolution. Alan Lewry, the hero, is forced to join the Royal Navy at 17, due to some falsely accused improprieties (he was actually framed) which occured at home. Alan is whisked away into the rude and very different routines of shipboard life in the late 1700's, learning a new trade, while trying to live long enough to get back at the people who forced him into the navy. Every time he gets a leg up, so he thinks, his other leg is kicked out from beneath him. At times, it's better than the O'Brian series, only because it seems more real - with an added dose of humor. Although not written in the English spoken in the 18th century, it's far easier to follow. The action is brisk and brutal, as it must have been at the time. A great series, and if you don't mind the bawdyness, one well worth reading. There's plenty to laugh at and more adventure than you can wish for. Once started, it's really hard to put down. The series will grow on you. And you'll be buying them all and wishing Mr. Lambdin would come out with the next book.Greg Toth"},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"I don't believe Dewey Lambdin went out to try to match the depth of style and prose of Patrick O'Brian. O'Brian will be very, very difficult to even match for quite a while. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the romp and action of this novel. I have not yet read the next one, but will soon. If you're looking for lighter reading than O'Brian or C. S. Forrester, this is certainly a choice. Lambdin's Alan Lewrie character is much more of a hero/anti-hero than is Hornblower, and a little more so than is Aubrey."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"I really did enjoy this book. more than the amount of stars that i gave it. the character is alan lewrie. a rogue and unlikly hero, he is thrown into his majesty's service by circumstance and tries to make the best of it. the action is fast paced and exciting. it does get graphic at times with the effects of splinters and cannon balls. i enjoy how the hero is not all prim and proper made a good refreshing change from hornblower. my only real complaint is the sex. it is heavy and very un-necessary to the overall story. just thrown in to fill some pages. but apart from that the story is interesting and worth a read. but keep in mind that this book is not for everyone and if you are thinking of buying it for your kids then i strongly recommend looking at the hornblower series. otherwise pick it up and give it a read."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"Consider this to be a review of the entire Lewrie series to date (Oct 2012). Some of the novels are better than average, some are not as good. If you need me to tell you exactly which ones to read, I suggest you wait for the comic book version.I've read most of the other 18th/19th Century naval series too, and while C.S. Forester is still head and shoulders above all the others, Dewey Lambdin's Alan Lewrie is quite entertaining and always worth a look-see. I have to admit I've never found O'Brian's Jack Aubrey series at all readable - it reminds me of Fenimore Cooper's ability to spew out page after page without actually saying anything. Lewrie is well written and unlike some naval fiction it is obvious that Lambdin knows how sailing ships function and the sailor's language of the era. Some of the current crop of 18th century naval fiction falls just shy of the \\"Shiver Me Timbers\\" school of nautical speak.I have to admit that several of the Lewrie books do get bogged down in stupefyingly dull spy stories, but this is a problem common to a lot of military adventure novels. For the record I think James Bond is dead boring and Le Carre's Smiley is a masterpiece of the spy genre.Much is made of Lewrie's explicit sexual escapades, but the fact is the series is about a contemporary of Tom Jones (and not the Welsh singer look you). Sex was, in fact, quite popular back in those days.Unfortunately most writers of 18th Century Naval Fiction are unwilling to give up on the Young Adult market and consequently the British Navy comes off looking like a bunch of prepubescent boys off on a cub scout jamboree. If you have a problem with sex scenes, read something else. Lewrie's adventures are not written to gain approval by all the various blue nose councils that prefer banning books to reading them."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"I must admit, this is the first book of this kind that I've read and I found it to be a great book. Although getting through all the sailors slang was a little confusing, this was still a quick and enjoyable read.Lambdin did a fine job in his freshman attempt at authoring a naval novel. He's created a likeable lead man and has a well developed supporting cast. The battle scenes are great and the sex was just raw enough to be entertaining.I highly recommend this novel!"},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"I liked this book, very good on naval tactics and facts.

Tell the publisher we want them all! Starting from our hero's &quot;impressment&quot; as a rather old Middie, you are easily captivated by the humanity of this aspiring British Naval officer. Not afraid to admit to himself his fear of cannon balls, or his strong desire to &quot;put the leg over,&quot; Alan Lewrie is a fun-loving, yet suprisingly competent rogue! This is a fun read that you won't put down! You should also read: Horatio Hornblower, Captain Frank Marryatt, and Patrick O'Brian."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"It's probably not fair that when an author decides to write about the English navy during the Napoleonic wars he will be compared to Hornblower, but as the Hornblower novels were one of the first and still the best about this subject, it is to be expected. How does Mr. Lambdin compare? Well, for storytelling, historical accuracy and character development, he's pretty good. However, as a writer--a practitioner of the English language if you will--he leaves a lot to be desired. The prose is pedestrian at best and displays little wit or panache.The story has to do with a young Englishman in 1780, Alan Lewrie, who after an unfortunate carnal romp with his stepsister is hustled off into the navy as a midshipman. Over the course of the novel he serves on the crew of three different ships, is involved in three terrific battles, and survives a bout with yellow jack fever. He also gets into a duel, falls in love, and has several sexual escapades with various beautiful women. Quite an eventful year, one would think, so much so that it teeters very close to the straining edge of credibility. But if you accept the adventures on their own terms and don't consider them too carefully you'll find that they're not too grossly improbable.The detail is pretty good. Although there is--by necessity, one supposes--a lot of nautical jargon, the author takes the time to explain a lot it, and it comes across as very informative and interesting. Here is an excellent example, having to the with the ship's cannons: \\". . . the guns had been loaded with quarter-weight powder cartridges, eight pounds of powder to propel a thirty-two pound iron ball. An increase in powder charge would not impel the shot any further or faster, since all the powder did not take flame at once.\\" This type of careful explanation, along with the maps and diagrams in the front of the novel, help to make the technical jargon more understandable. If there is a fault with the Hornblower novels, and with the Patrick O'Brian novels as well, it is that the authors perhaps assumed a little too much from their readers.The characters and descriptions of sea-life are pretty good too. There is a lot of below-decks, working-class banter that one doesn't get in Hornblower and O'Brian, and also much discussion of the day-to-day, hour-to-hour duties of the average sailor. Again, it's interesting and informative and a presents a different view of the sailor's life from that of the officer class.The problem here is the language which . . . well, it's not awful, but there's nothing elegant or charming about it either. It's a bit coarse on occasion and the f-word is used a little too liberally as well. Worse, it isn't used to convey verisimilitude, or a sense of the times. Lewrie is introduced to his girlfriend's father. His clothing and the, \\"wig he wore fairly screamed \\"Country\\"--of the worst huntin', shootin', ridin', drinkin', tenant-tramplin', dog lovin', View-Halloo variety.\\" Reading language like this, in a novel about English people in 1780, is like listening to the proverbial fingernail on the proverbial chalkboard.It's quite off-putting, but still probably not enough to prevent me from reading the second novel of this series. Eventually."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"In 1780, seventeen-year-old Alan Lewrie is already a rakish man-about-town. Unfortunately, he falls to temptation and his father's plan to get rid of him and take over his inheritance. Forced to go to sea as a midshipman aboard the Ariadne, desperate for crew due to the war in the Americas, and totally ignorant of anything nautical, Alan needs to learn quickly just to survive... or at least survive without punishment. Fortunately, he's not stupid and has enough pride to try and not look a total idiot. He also discovers that he not only has an aptitude for life in the Navy, he also begins to like it.Alan is a flawed, but overall sympathetic character. One can chock up a lot of his more ignoble aspects to his upbringing as an unrestrained, unloved bastard son in a thoroughly disreputable household. His father, Sir Hugo Willoughby, is nasty enough to make Alan's larks look like what they mostly are--the japes a wild young man might get up to, given his situation. At sea, Alan is more than competent, once he gets up to speed as a midshipman. In personal relations, he makes friends among the worthy and enemies of types who tend to make enemies easily. On land, he naturally is interested in women...I thought the action and adventure, off the Americas and in the Caribbean, was fast-paced and exciting. And I was intrigued by Alan's character and his ability (or inability) to negotiate his way to having a career in the British Navy. I'll certainly look forward to reading the next in the series."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"I'm a history teacher and an avid reader. I'm always looking for series for if I like the first, I've got a lot more to read. Dewey Lambdin's Alan Lewrie series is a delight!. I mean no disrespect to C.S. Forester, but Lambdin's books are throughly enjoyable and throughly readable. Yes they are much lighter than Horatio Hornblower, but they are just as good in their own way. And for those who complain about the sex - grow up. Yes it is quite detailed but so are the battles and the depiction of life at sea during this time. The latter is very well researched as is the historical backdrop of the times.Bravo Mr. Lambdin!"},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"If an author sets out to pen a new swashbuckling, age of sail novel, he finds himself in the unenviable position of having to measure up to the works of C.S. Foreseter and Patrick O'Brian. To make these stories engaging to a reader that has already consumed perhaps dozens of swashbuckling naval adventure novels, the main character has to have a hook that makes him stand out as unique. The hook for Lambdin's Alan Lewrie is so simple, I'm surprised that it is new: Lewrie is teen-aged rake and libertine, and \\"The King's Coat\\" blend the staples of the naval adventure with the borderline pornographic style of a cheap romance novel.The results are lurid and earthy, perhaps more \\"Moll Flanders\\" on the gun deck of a man of war than God, King and Country. Lewrie's sexual adventures put a new twist on the role of being the King's man in the 18th Century, especially when compared against the chilly and self-conscious Hornblower. Indeed, Lewrie makes me think of what the lusty Mr. Midshipman Aubrey who got himself turned out among the common hands for keeping a whore in the focsle must have been like. Those in love with the details of nautical life in the age of sail should look elsewhere; Lambin's prose shares a disdain for such matters similar to Forester's; he is no O'Brian. The novel's feel for action borrows a great deal from Alexander Kent's Richard Bolitho novels. Lambdin's main innovation is in his ribaldry.The result is an earthy novel detailing the adventures of a promising young swashbuckling officer entering HM's Navy in 1780. The story is enjoyably precisely because the characters are so human. If you are a fan of this kind of fiction, give \\"The King's Coat\\" a try."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"This first installment Alan lewrie gets pressed into service. The story is interesting and deals mostly with Lewries difficulties adjusting to his new life as a midshipman in His Majesty's Navy. There are only a couple of battles in this book but it is still an exciting read. The one thing that I don't like is the VERY graphic descriptions of Lewries sexual exploits. It would be good enough to just let you know he bedded certain women. Those parts of the book are unneccessary. I am reading a naval adventure, not looking for pornography."},{"Title":"The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core)","review":"This is the first in a series of 20 books on the adventures of Alan Lewrie in the Royal Navy in the day of sail.

After reading, he donates them to the local small Texas town library where he lives. We have done this for several years and all benefit. He did tell me however that all the books in this series are &#34;keepers&#34; to be reread in a couple of years. The main character (Alan Lewrie) and his adventures and progression in rank over time is similar to Bernard Cornwell's Richard Sharpe 21 book series except that Lewrie's adventrues all take place in a Royal Navy environment whereas Sharpes are in the British Army.

I think I really lost my patience with Dewey when Alan is being embraced by a lady to comfort him over his friend's death, and all he can think about is her breasts.

Now I am hooked!! I have read the first 6 books in just a couple of weeks. Alan Lewrie is a very intersting character: part Horatio Hornblower, part James Bond, part Forrest Gump, and part Hugh Hefner. The series has all of the usual historical fiction staples from this era: the nautical terms and speech, the battles, the storms, the hardships, the famous people (Nelson, Hood, Rodney, Napolean, etc). UNLIKE the usual Hornblower or Bolitho main character, we have the good-for-nothing, womanizing, bastard son Lewrie. Well, not good for NOTHING. He discovers, to his own amazement, that he IS good at being a naval officer. He's also good at getting himself in trouble by thinking below his belt.

I would call this &quot;Flashman Goes to Sea,&quot; since it has the same sort of ribald approach and a scoundrel hero who succeeds in spite of himself. Written by an American, the series, especially in the first few novels, has a distinctly American point of view. I read with interest the review from the writer who was critical of the &quot;homophobic&quot; bias of the author. While I'll admit that the protagonist, Lewrie, is a homophobe, this is not out of character for him, as he has suffered from the perfidies of his half-sibling, who is gay, and at the time he seems shocked and disgusted by his apparently homosexual superior officer, he is still shy of his 20th birthday. I, on the other hand, liked the descriptions of life aboard ship; the strong battle scenes; the fact that Lewrie is not the perfect little hero; and the glimpses of British Colonial life in both America and the West Indies. For anyone who likes naval fiction, I heartily recommend this series. I have just started the series by Patrick O'Brian, and the Lewrie books are far more &quot;modern&quot; and exciting, at least to me."},{"Title":"Naked Season","review":"This book is entirely lost on me...and consider the money I spent on this book...well lost in a nude beach.

In actual fact, I cannot remember why I picked out this book among all the others in the shelves. The cover isn't all that great and the title is a little...confusing.

How romantic it all sounds! To live in pain for the love of art, expressing one's exotic soul, only to eventually to disintegrate and die in obscurity.The reality to living as an artist is rather more prosaic than what the writers tell us. The issues an artist faces to produce artwork are far less emotional than what the layman would believe.Here, for the first -- and as far as I know -- the only time, is a novel which accurately reflects the lifestyle and technical considerations of the typical working artist: a highly skilled professional without a &quot;name&quot;. This book says it all.And it says it with great finesse. Beyond its veracity to the profession, Painter of Our Time is both a well written story and compelling character study of an aging man in a less than perfect marriage.The one exotic aspect to the story's main character, is that he is a politically committed hungarian refugee living in post-war London. Written in the form of a journal, the artist is haunted by the memory of a dead friend, as he struggles with low income and an indifferent wife.Some readers may have a problem with the book's heavy emphasis on old school communist doctrine (as I did), but if you can get past this, you will find this a thoroughly absorbing, thoroughly accurate work about what it means to be an artist."},{"Title":"A painter of our time","review":"Berger's luminous intelligence, his passion, his capacity to imagine, is one of the joys of my life. That he wrote,'A Painter on Our Time' in the mid 1950s reveals his prodigal vision ( a moment, incidentally, when he made the crucial career decision to opt for writing over painting, on the basis that he could reach further & more powerfully in print). Odd, for me, that I have so recently come to this, his initial, published work.It is as prescient as ever; the dilemna of the creative stirrings in a being, the dilemna between art & life, searchingly and exactingly laid out in the journals of his fictional, Hungarian, self-exiled painter. His social conscience, his memory, his ambitions are convincingly unpacked, and with the narrator as guide and amplifier to these confessions, we journey to where we know from the books early pages,Lavin's return to tumultuous Hungary. Berger wrote an afterword to the book in 1988, disclosing, amongst other things, the actual friends who inspired his fictional artist. With them he had shared the sense that pain is the source of human imagination. It is not to be avoided, refused, repressed, and regarded as undignified. In mid-career, Berger opted out of the hurly burly of the English media to embrace the underprivileged peasant lives of a small, French mountain community, from where he has written about their lives with the penetrating sympathy he demonstrated in his fictional Hungarian.

It contains many insightful reflections on art, philosophy, and politics. In addition, the international setting and the unexplained disappearance of the principal character at the beginning of the story combine to generate the kind of suspense that is characteristic of a classic mystery by Graham Greene. The ambiguities do not end there. A dialectical tension between art and politics, between representational art and abstract art, and between Marxist politics and bourgeois politics is sustained throughout the novel. If the principal character has, in fact, returned to his homeland to join the political struggle there, it is not at all clear which side of the struggle he has joined. The philosophical underpinnings of the book might be better appreciated by a reader who is already familiar with \\"Ways of Seeing\\" or other nonfiction books by the same author. But it is not necessary to have a background in philosophy or art theory to enjoy the story. The visual qualities of the book alone would make it an excellent candidate for an award-winning film if it were not for the anti-intellectual prejudice of the American film audience. Although such a film would undoubtedly be a commercial success in Europe, the absence of conspicuous consumption, gratuitous sex, and spectacular violence would doom it to obscurity in this country. So, don't hold your breath waiting for the film to arrive. Read the book."},{"Title":"A painter of our time","review":"Berger is a new writer for me, and so far (this book and one other), a treat. I have only a general knowledge of the well-known painters, but found the interpretive sections interesting and generally accessible for an interested layman - sufficiently so that I believe I will tackle some of Berger's art essays next.Besides the observations on painting, A Painter of Our Time interests as a character study, in its examination of the relationship of each of us to his past, and the question of how well we know each other. A small, quiet gem, it rings true throughout - especially as a first novel.

The same publishers have listed a huge variety of subjects of other books that they publish, on the back cover - anything from Yoga to Theology, Self-Help books to Architecture."},{"Title":"Crescent and Star; Turkey Between Two Worlds","review":"I had this book on my shelf for years and picked it up because I wanted to learn more about this country, especially after it has become more prominent in the news. Kinzer writes well and covers many of the major issues, with chapters divided into themes.Unfortunately, Kinzer litters the book with judgments, constantly chastising Turkey for not being sufficiently democratic or proclaiming that its future lies with Europe. In retrospect, his optimism sounds naive - he seems never to have considered the possibility, for example, that democracy would lead to an Islamist political party with foreign policy interests that don't coincide with US/European notions of progressivism. This is exactly what has happened recently, with the AK Party government forging closer ties with Iran. This development, and Kinzer's lack of in-depth discussion of popular support for Islamic politics, suggests that Kinzer's knowledge of Turkey came primarily from intellectuals and elites who shared his outlook on life and politics.More importantly, Kinzer's judgmental tone simply becomes annoying and takes space away from more anecdotes and analysis about Turkey. I found the book to be shallow and judgmental. In some ways, I learned surprisingly little about Turkish history and politics. Besides being energetic, what did Prime Minister Ozel do? How did he survive politically if he challenged so many military elites? I understand Kinzer didn't have space to cover thousands of years of Turkish history in 240 pages. However, he surely could have provided more interesting historical stories about the country rather than dedicating several pages to his desire to swim across the Bosporus Straits."},{"Title":"FOUL MEANS","review":"Those who have a passion for understanding the often complex, and sometimes, ambiguous, relationship between slavery and freedom in the colonial world will be pleased to read Anthony Parent's new work - Foul Means. This well written and exhaustively researched work discusses the aforementioned dilemma in Virginia from the mid-seventeenth to the mid-eighteenth century. The central argument is that the planter elite in Virginia, or \\"great planters,\\" established America's racial dilemma. Modifying traditional colonial arguments, the author advances the thesis that planters were not conscious of their actions. \\"The analysis,\\" contends Parent, \\"challenges the generally accepted belief that the shift to racial slavery was an \`unthinking decision' on the part of a wide variety of aspiring planters who were responding to market and labor forces.\\" (2) According to Parent, they knew that slavery was a pivotal cog in the colonial power wheel, and they carefully and consciously leveraged all available resources to tilt the balance in their favor. As for motivation, the planters were inspired by the ever shifting economic tides that existed between the New and Old Worlds.The author emphasizes the importance of labor in the early American south and in England. The crown initially supported servitude in the colonies as means to promote and encourage economic development in the New World, but as Parent carefully articulates, the English economists came to realize the pitfalls of this arrangement. Charles II implemented this philosophy and \\"promoted the slave trade to preserve English labor for England.\\" (60) The development of the slave trade became, in essence, more economically and lawfully viable for the crown.Continuing with a tightly weaved chronological narrative, Parent discusses the role of tobacco as an impetus for class divisions in, and outside of, colonial Virginia. The lower prices of tobacco prompted the planters to look elsewhere for economic fervor. In short, they \\"promoted slavery as a remedy for the troubled tobacco economy.\\" (81) The theme that planters were opportunists who monopolized each, and all, opportunities to suppress threats is well articulated by the author, and it is evident that their calculated manipulations shaped colonial America. Furthermore, their economic well being became a euphemism for freedom and the planters became so enmeshed with \\"white society in 1705,\\" that they were \\"prepared to preserve racial slavery to the death.\\" (129)Highlighting the significance of slave rebellions, Parent is one of the first scholars to illuminate that insurrections \\"threatened the order of Virginia society.\\" (172) He pays particular attention to the Chesapeake Rebellion and ties it to the dual role Christianity played in the early seventeenth century. Initially viewed as a way of controlling slaves and Indians, it later became a catapult (i.e., rumors of Christianity leading to emancipation) for prompting slaves to rebel against the white Virginia society. This interesting and insightful approach, paints a clear picture of how religion and freedom were interconnected entities in colonial society.The only somewhat troubling portion of Parent's narrative was his constant referral to the ruling class in Virginia as the \\"great planters.\\" They were not \\"great\\" in the pejorative sense, and perhaps the author struggled to label them. But were they really great at all? These elitist, such as William Byrd, had a large hand in creating an environment which supported and embraced racism. The lasting consequences of their actions have colored and corrupted American society for centuries. Why not assign a more appropriate title to these men, such as \\"economic tsars,\\" or \\"colonial corrupters?\\"The complexities of Parent's narrative touch on a wide array of facets, and in sum they advance a novel paradigm in colonial history. He convincingly demonstrates how slavery emerged in early Virginia history. Academics and peers should applaud Parent for this highly readable and carefully argued account of colonial history. This work should be required reading for all history students and economic historians."},{"Title":"FOUL MEANS","review":"\\"Foul Means\\" is a powerful expose' of the history of slavery in the Virginia Commonwealth. Because of its importance in earlier American history, one can say, \\"As Virginia goes, so goes America.\\" Thus, in many ways this book traces the course of slavery throughout the thirteen colonies and beyond and provides a moving picture of the ruthlessness involved in the enslavement of an entire race.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction ."},{"Title":"The Atlantic Liners 1925-70","review":"I really don't know how my fellow reviewer is able to describe the artwork in this book as \\"detailed drawings.\\" They are not!There really are some excellent books about ships which contain a minimum amount of factual detail plus a line drawing. Whilst those by Duncan Haws are amongst the best, this work is easily amongst the worst.The line drawings contain such a bare minimum of detail one could easily argue that the ship depicted is \\"not\\" that particular ship at all in several instances. Furthermore, the narrative is suspect.This was one of several books I purchased as part of my ongoing research into a number of liners which have been lost at sea and was easily the most disappointing.As an example; All ships are known, historically by their final name - even if they were far more famous under a previous incarnation. A good example of this is \\"Seawise University - previously \\"Queen Elizabeth.\\"The Bianca C, had several previous names before being lost off Grenada in 1961. In this book, however, she is listed under her previous name of Arosa Sky, as part of the Arosa Line - even though her eventual fate under her final name (as part of the Costa Line) is mentioned in that part of the text. Neither the \\"Costa Line\\" nor the \\"Bianca C\\" appear in the index at all.How curious, this is the second book I have reviewed this month which contains exactly the same mistake. All of which begs the question; How many more mistakes are there?Altogether, therefore, the content cannot be trusted and the line drawings are far too basic to be useful.NM"},{"Title":"The Atlantic Liners 1925-70","review":"This book lists every transatlantic liner for the years 1925-1970 and has detailed drawings of each one.

After browsing several similar books in a local B&amp;N bookstore, I picked this one as our official handbook, for the following reasons:1. The price is right. For 19.99, it is wallet-welcome for many of my co-workers, and my company (if my company decides to pay, hopefully).2. It is cook-book easy. There is almost not a single page going without figures. I found from teaching experience that it is the easiest way for people to follow.3. It covers most of the topics a new W2K user will ask, from installation to configuration to networking to trouble-shooting. And it explain things in plain English that most of the people will appreciate. The procedural steps are numbered on the figure with actions shown under the it, making it very easy to follow. 4. After each chapter there is a Q&amp;A section called Personal Workbook. A reader then can review and test his/her knowledge just learned. I do think it is a nice touch as a teaching materials because it helps a user to identify some blind spots, as well as pointing out the more important parts covered in that chapter.I think this book is well organized and very easy to read. It is not the most advanced book around, however, for $19.99........... there is nothing to lose to get this book.

Although the main text is somewhat dated (1981), a helpful six-page update from 1999 is included. All this information does make the book a little bulky for hiking or backpacking, so photocopy the pages you'll need before you hit the trail. (And remember that big guidebooks with lots of information are better than those that don't have enough!)The only criticism I have to offer is that Schaffer tends to ramble off-track in some of his trail descriptions, but this is a minor complaint. All in all, a good, comprehensive guidebook to the area."},{"Title":"Lassen Volcanic National Park & Vicinity -","review":"The Lassen book is great with good trail descriptons. I recomend Schaffer's books to any one who enjoys hikeing. Most of his books come with a map."},{"Title":"Lassen Volcanic National Park & Vicinity -","review":"I can't believe others are reviewing this book so highly. It is an OK natural-history guide, with a decent general overview of the area. But don't try to get anywhere with this book or look for specific information. For example, although it has individual chapters for each region (e.g. Caribou wilderness, Thousand Lakes, etc.), they don't contain any information on geology, fishing, zoology, etc. Instead, these topics are lumped into their own general chapters in the front of the book. With the notable exception of the wildflowers section, these chapters seem somewhat topical and weak. In the case of fishing, the &quot;chapter&quot; is one page. Likewise with resorts and campgrounds, which are lumped into a three-page list in a separate chapter, rather than discussed by region.Although it contains one nice topo for the entire Lassen area, the 1:62500 scale and lack of detailed maps for any of the sections makes finding trailheads or following trails nearly impossible. I guess it's just not clear what this book is trying to be -- if it is a natural-history guide, as the back cover proclaims, why so much space describing trails(half the book or more)? If it is a trail guide, why no decent maps to make it usable?"},{"Title":"Lassen Volcanic National Park & Vicinity -","review":"I was very disappointed in the overall format and descriptive narrative of this book. If you are a rock hound or a naturalist that is concerned with all of the Latin names of every plant species in the Lassen area, this review may not apply. However, if you plan on using this book to help plan a multi-day backpacking/hiking trip through Lassen you should look elsewhere.No doubt the author is very knowledgeable about the area, but the format is not for trip planning, but more for reference to read as you are walking the trails. The trails are not linked in loops, or connected for round-trip hikes in any discernable way which is a necessity for trip planning in my opinion. Overall, this book is great if you want to catalogue volcanic rock and plants, but if you are planning a backcountry trek look for another hiking guide."},{"Title":"First crossing of the Polar Sea,","review":"A fascinating discussion of arctic exploration in a dirigible. Although only two authors are listed, other crew members included their accounts of the crossing, including that of HJ. Riiser-Larsen, who gives a fascinating and lucid discussion of the principles of navigation over the ice cap in a dirigible. Never mind that the writing is a bit awkward--English is not the first language for most of these guys.Unfortunately, the illustrations are absolute disasters. I find it difficult to understand why any publisher (University Press of the Pacific, Honolulu) would release a publication with such shoddy reproduction of not only the photographs, but their virtually unreadable captions. The book would be improved by eliminating these pictures altogether. Most of the pictures are shadowy smudges on the pages, and do great disservice to the writings of these heroic explorers."},{"Title":"First crossing of the Polar Sea,","review":"On May 11, 1926, the Amundsen-Ellsworth expedition aboard the airship Norge sailed due north from Kings Bay in Spitzbergen. Three days later, without change of course, the great dirigible was seen by Eskimos in Alaska gliding southward from Arctic wastes. For the first time men had crossed from Europe to America via the North Pole. Newspaper reports were voluminous and in the main accurate, but the record as given here by the leaders themselves should be considered the final authority on a transit which ushered in the epoch of polar flying.This is a well-documented book with many illustrations, simply written, without any attempt to achieve effects. The participants are their own historians. Five other members contributed each a chapter on his specialty, notably Lieutenant Riiser-Larsen, who describes the problems of navigation involved in extended air voyages, and Finn Malmgren, who kept the meteorological records. One omission is not surprizing--the absence of a chapter by General (erstwhile Colonel) Nobile, builder of the Norge and its commander. Nevertheless his part is not minimized, though the authors are careful to specify his relative position in the general scheme of things.To Amundsen, whose leadership meant everything, to Ellsworth, who unselfishly seconded him and contributed a very large share of the cost ($125,000), and to the Norwegian Aero Club are attributed first honors. In the bibliography of early polar exploration, this book falls easily in the front rank."},{"Title":"Swindle: How a Man Named John Grambling, Jr., Cheated Banks Out of Millions","review":"This is a very well documented book.

The one break in her heart that never quite healed. To make matters worse, Grace is no longer the lean, lanky college student that Elizabeth first fell in love with, but a stunningly beautiful news anchor whose smart, confident demeanor only adds to her devastating attractiveness.Unwilling to be hurt again, Liz reminds herself that she's seen it all before, believed it all before. Yet here she was again. Losing herself in the depths of Grace's eyes. Feeling her fears vanish in the heat of Grace's arms. Reliving all of the passion and promises that seemed so real... just yesterday. - END OF BACK COVER TEXTI have read most of Linda Hill's books and own the others. She's a pretty good author who usually delivers a solid story. \`Just Yes' is not on par with her usual quality, so I only gave it three stars.Specifically, the character of Liz Grey is wishy-washy, has low self esteem and seems lost. She was in love with Connie, but Connie went off to establish herself after college. Before Connie asked Liz to join her, Liz met and fell in love with Grace; but she left Grace for Connie anyway. Grace and Connie had an affair and Liz left both of them behind. Now, ten years later, Liz is nearing the end of her committed relationship with Janet and her whole world seems to be falling apart.Tragic circumstances bring Liz and Grace together again, but Liz falls victim to her own weaknesses once more.

Ethan Black desplays his usage of suspence in the sentance, &quot;She feels his hand, that smooth hand that once caressed her, and made her feel like a woman, the hand that probed inside her, the fingers that touched and excited her, oddly familiar, close tightly over her mouth.&quot; His suspence was greatly intensified with his sentences that leave readers longing to know what will happen such as this sentence, &quot;She hears his footstep behind her as she reaches the counter and grabs for the wooden rack of knives.&quot; As the plots change in each chapter some younger maybe lost until they come together.

The police detective Voort is horrible.However, the worst part of the book was the writing style. Black is all over the place with his writing. He wastes so much of the reader's time with irrelevant material, trying to be descriptive. The problem is his descriptions have nothing to do with anything involving the plot or characters. And when he does try to give us character descriptions he either describes clothing, or attempts to use mundane prose to let us in on the personality of the characters.I could go on and on about how bad this book is, but I will not.

But it goes wrong in several ways. Its hero is neither a likable or interesting character; it is the situation he is placed in that is, and keeps one reading. The other is that after the surprise revelation and psychological explanation, the author jettisons originality for a mainstream cops and robbers climax worthy of prime time TV. Can we have something different, please? As for the surprise, I disagree that is revealed too early; helfway through is a fine time to bring it forth. However, about a third of the way through I began to suspect what was afoot. When I turned out to be right, I felt disappointed at being able to figure things out so quickly. I am sure other readers feel this too. A strong thread of misogyny runs through this book, not only in delineating the crimial situation, but in how women and sexual relations are portrayed in such a blantanly male adolescent way. Women, and feminisits in particular I am sure will find this book a turn off. Yet enough of &quot;The Broken Hearts Club&quot; remains compelling. Like &quot;The Bone Collector&quot; it cries out to be filmed. If and when it is I hope a better job is done. How casting and maintaining the surprise on screen are achieved will make it interesting in and of itself. I look forward to Ethan Black's next thriller. He needs only to hone his technique."},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"Ethan Black's &quot;The Broken Hearts Club&quot; is one of those books you want to dismiss as commercialized pap, nothing unusual or different; not really a great literary style. However, Black does create a set of believable characters, and even though the &quot;twist&quot; does come early and is not too hard to decipher, he keeps your interest by exploring the many different personalities of the psychopath. Conrad Voort is a very interesting leading character. He is rich, handsome, and deeply in love with Camilla, a television news reporter (notice how many heroines of thrillers these days work for T.V.?). Voort has a sensitive side, and although I got frustrated with his obsessive love for Camilla, by the end of the book, you know he really does love her, and his decision at the end is refreshingly honest and understandable. After just finishing the Special X series by Michael Slade, this novel is amazingly tame in its treatment of gore. The murders are not really described in great detail, and it almost seems as if they're &quot;cast aside&quot; to avoid any description. Whether this is a weakness or strength is the reader's choice. Black has hooked me though; I have &quot;Irresistible&quot; next to read to see where he takes Conrad Voort. A worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"All I can really say is I never saw it coming! The twists absolutely blind-sided me.

You're sure to not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"Was only able to force myself to read the first 37 pages before I decided a mind is a terrible thing to waste on trash.

The best recommendation I can give is I am going out to buy his next book."},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"I bought this because I very much like John Rubinstein's narrations, but not even Mr. Rubenstein could salvage this one. The jacket doesn't indicate whether the author approved the abridgement, so perhaps criticism is unfair. However, it's difficult to imagine how the full version could shore up the novel's flaws. The idea is interesting, but not well executed. The villain, and the reason for his villainy, is revealed less than half way through, and the remainder consists of the supposedly intelligent hero doing one absurdly stupid thing after another. Character development rarely rises above describing what someone's wearing (with brand names attached, of course). Hoping that this will not encourage teenage boys to buy this book, I do want to note that the sex scenes/dialogue are more explicit than in most mystery/thrillers. That, in itself, would not be a fault, but for the sense that the author is either trying too hard to titilate or suffers his own infantile fantasies. In either event, it is annoying. Those who did like this book should try Michael Connelly for a better point of reference."},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"Led by psychologist Ian Bainbridge, the members of the BROKEN HEARTS CLUB meet every week at Mackey's Steak and Ale Tavern in Midtown Manhattan to discuss their ailing souls.

The other three (the banker, the literary agent, and the mechanic) believe they each have an ax to grind with the women who hurt and betrayed them. However, one of the club members takes the next violent step: murder.NYPD detective Conrad Voort has his own heartbreak to deal with since his lover Camilla Ryan ended their relationship. Camilla's new love is Ian. Conrad has no time to nurse his injured psyche as his superior assigns him to investigate the recent murder of a woman. He soon ties the case to the BROKEN HEARTS CLUB. However, before he can solve who is the killer and how the remaining trio fit in the puzzle, more murders occur.THE BROKEN HEARTS CLUB is a thrilling police procedural that concentrates on the affairs of the heart more than on detective work. The fast-paced story line bounces back and forth between the prime characters even more than a bouncing Tigger could accomplish. Though confusing at first, Ethan Black brilliantly ties the plot together and readers will see the logic behind the constant shuffle. The emphasis on non-police matters fails to add to the character development, leaving readers not caring whether any of the broken hearts ever mends.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"I enjoyed Ethan Black's first novel.

Camilla's hotness and Voort's being the richest cop in the known world were brought up enough to become a distraction - how many times do we need to be told how much Voort's home is worth? Also, some of the inner dialogue/actual dialogue seemed clunky and over blown. And I won't even get in to the psychology in the book.But despite all this, I found myself liking Voort (grudgingly) and wanting to know more about what happens to him.

You really want to like the detective, but after reading him do some really dense things, you lose interest.I also have a fundamental problem with the book and it's secret. I think the author really needed to get himself a better editor, because there are many inconsistencies that need to be resolved.Speaking of editing, the book is chock full of poor grammar and missed/mis-used punctuation.I'd wait for the next book or if you want to read a thriller, get Mark of the Assassin by Silva or something like that."},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"This is a book whose premise had potential to be a suspenseful, gripping novel. However, none of that potential is realized. Instead, it is badly written, filled with graphic sex and descriptions of the wealth Voort and his well-to-do partner. I found myself not caring about any of the characters. There's a twist in the middle that makes reading the rest of the book almost irrelevant. I'm always looking for new authors to add to my reading list. Based on this, Black isn't going to be one of them."},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"The characters are preposterous. The novel begins with a collection of broken-hearted men who are preposterous. They are involved with a crime investigated by a millionaire NYPD detective who has has a tall, thin, beautiful, blonde girlfriend with white-blonde pubic hair. You buy that?P.S. This is not a debut novel. This is an author who had a mid-list crisis and has been repackaged. Good luck, Ethan."},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"This novel is not particularly distinguished-- the characters and settings are a bit too generic-- but what really got to me was the psychology. It is just bad. The details of the mental disorder that the killer suffers from are straight from a bad made-for-TV movie and have no relation to reality at all. He even gets the name wrong, using a distorted form of the old label for this disorder. To me, a good novel must first and foremost have decent psychology behind it, or else it doesn't work. Even comic book and fantasy stories must be grounded in good psychology in order to work and create a connection to the reader. To fudge on this undermines the story in a big way. Maybe he could have gotten away with this if he had gone into the mind of the killer a little more, but he doesn't, probably so he could create some half-hearted red herrings in the first half of the novel.Also, what I found even more bizarre than the events in the book was a three-page interview at the end between the author and his fictional detective (!?!?!?). If an author wants to generate interest in a character, why not do it in the context of the novel itself? Thumbs down for me."},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"Broken Hearts Club was an exciting book with a strange twist.

I will be waiting."},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"Although I tend to agree that the characters are a little on the unbelievable side, I found the book entertaining and well written. In other words the plot overcame the shortcomings. A nice twist in the middle of the book did not detract because Black keeps the pace up right until the end. He handles multiple perspective well, keeping you up to date and never losing sight of the main characters. A real page turner - I read it in two sittings."},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"I found this book to be very riveting, but I found thatrevealing the secrets of the killer halfway through this book sort ofruined it for me. I like a book that keeps me guessing to the end. For awhile I thought &quot;oh, these clues are so obvious&quot; then the author just tells you the big secret and then I found myself just reading to the end only to see how the author finished it not because I had to know. The ending did seemed hurried to me after the build up in the beginning and I agree with others that the characters were not very endearing. I also found that the sex scenes went a little to far. I would like to read another book by this author."},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"A quick and moderately entertaining read, but nothing more. One must suspend belief from the very beginning of this novel. The main character and his partner are millionaires who continue to work for the NYPD out of the goodness of their hearts. Their women friends are all 6 foot tall blonds with busy careers who find time for exercise and, of course, always sport thong underwear and have insatiable sexual appetites. And, as mentioned in other reviews, the real plot twist is revealed in the middle of the novel--making one wonder why they should bother finishing it at all. If you read quickly and are not too particular, this is a nice diversion. If you only read 5 books a year, pick something something else!"},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"The Broken Hearts Club is a small group of men who have broken up with their girlfriends and just can't seem to get over it. They meet every Thursday night with their psychologist in the back room of a restaurant where they discuss their failed relationships and try to offer each other support and understanding.One night, after a particularly emotional meeting, the unthinkable happens and one of the men decides it's time to confront the woman who caused him so much heartache. The result is a most brutal murder and you get the sense that a monster has been unleashed on the streets of New York City.Taking the case is Conrad Voort, a millionaire homicide cop, and his equally affluent partner Mickie. Their investigation begins perfectly normally although they are hampered by a distinct lack of clues apart from the letters BHC gouged into the victim's kitchen table. On the part of Voort and Mickie we are taken through the standard police procedure of tracking down known friends and enemies and paper trails. Progress is slow until victim number 2 is found.Meanwhile, we're made privy to the build-up to each murder as we sit in on each meeting of the Broken Hearts Club and the emotion that starts to simmer as each man recounts his tale of woe at the hands of a heartless woman. The inevitability of the trip to each woman's apartment each week is terrible in the knowledge of how the visits will end.As I said earlier, the premise of the book is good, but there are problems that I found annoying at first and then later had me just plain frustrated. To start with, Black has decided to include graphic sex scenes between Voort and his girlfriend which, while it doesn't offend me at all, was completely irrelevant to the story. Sex scenes are fine with me if they're in context with the story but the detail used here was reminiscent of some of the stuff found in Penthouse Forum - and about as believable too.I felt coincidence played too large a part in the investigation, so much so that I found myself rolling my eyes as yet another improbable lead resulted in a home run for the police. I put this down to clumsy plotting and was just a little disappointed that it seemed unlikely that I was going to be wowed by the police work. The disappointment flowed through to the ending which I felt was built on glaringly obvious plot holes in an attempt to force the feeling of tension so much so that rather than build tension, I found that I was frustrated to distraction by the contrived nature of the final showdown.THE BROKEN HEARTS CLUB is Ethan Black's debut novel, but apart from an interesting opening premise, it is hampered by clumsy plotting, needlessly graphic scenes and a twist that was revealed way too early in the book. All in all I was disappointed with THE BROKEN HEARTS CLUB. The idea of a wealthy homicide cop who has the means to circumvent authority has the potential to be quite refreshing compared with the majority of stories featuring over-worked underpaid cops who deal with personal issues that invariably lead to broken marriages and drinking problems."},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"Dr. Bainbridge assembles a group of men who all suffer the same thing--they've been dumped by women they loved, and they meet each week to discuss their heartache. But then women begin to die in horrible ways. Is there a connection? Nick Voort is the extremely wealthy and well-dressed NYC detective assigned to try to crack the case of these gruesome but seemingly related deaths.That sounds great except there isn't a great deal that's original about this story. The killer is typical thriller fare, the detective is tough with a sensitive side, and everything seems to pull together despite some rather large plot holes. Along the way, the reader is privvy to Voort's love life, a great deal of rather graphic, steamy sex--which might possibly be the best parts of the novel--and the inner workings of the killer or killers. Black also describes in great detail the expensive clothes worn by most of the characters. This along with my inability to buy into the idea of not one but two very wealthy NYC detectives who are supersleuths really annoyed me and made me want to throw the book across the room at times. I was also disappointed in the television version of the psychology used within the books; it seems to be pulled from every trite movie-of-the-week and pulp thriller that's out there.So, why do I give this a higher rating than 1? I actually enjoyed reading the novel for the most part. Sure, it's not very original, but this is good summertime reading, and it helps to kill a few hours. I was able to read the entire book without giving up on it, so that scores some points in my opinion.

After these meetings, some of the women discussed, end up dead. The first half of this story is fast-paced and full of suspense. I couldn't put it down. Unfortunately, the second half of the book gets bogged down and once all the secrets are out, way too early for a satisfying thriller, it slows to a snails pace. But, the overall story is good and the book has one great thing going for it...a New York City detective named Voort, who you'd like to get to know a lot better. Not a bad first effort.

Ethan Black has written a very good book and then filled it with little inaccuracies. I've already mentioned in another review (\\"All the Dead Were Strangers\\") that Mr. Black seems fixated on .38 caliber handguns (both real and imaginary), even though virtually no law enforcement organization currently uses this caliber. In writing this book, someone has apparently told Mr. Black that Medeco (TM) locks are very secure. Therefore, Mr. Black makes virtually every lock a \\"Medico\\" lock, not even bothering to find out how to spell it properly. He uses \\"Medico\\" at least four times in the book. Folks, this may be small of me, but it is inconceivable that an author could put as much work and love into a book as Mr. Black does and then fail to catch such gross errors. And where are the editors? Any knowledgeable and experienced editor should have found this error. There are more examples, but....let's just say that the story is good, the writing is good, and the author needs to do a little more research (...)."},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"Normally it takes me 2 days to read a book and this one took me a week and a half.

I want to read Irresistible, but I'm not sure if Ethan Black is that caliber of a writer for me to get another one of his books. I just might be careful and try to get it from a library.

It contains sex, violence, lust, murder and much more. Black is a clever writer because the plot throws any reader for a loop, due to its unexpected results regarding the BHC. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys horror/thriller novels."},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"This novel is known to be a \\"Thriller\\". It is about a couple of men who have had past experiences in relationships that didn't end up very well. They all got together and formed some type of group. As the story progresses, the book gets more interesting. It helps to attract readers to keep on reading and make them want to know what is going to happen next. In my opinion, I think that The Broken Hearts Club is a good book to read because it attracts many readers. This book does have many strengths and also weaknesses. The most obvious strength that this book has is that it attracts the readers. I think it is because of its \\"Thriller\\" theme. In my opinion, scary stories that make you want to know what is going to happen next is a fun and popular liking of the audience. The cover of the book is very interesting and can be eye catching. It has a picture of a red hand print almost the size of the whole cover. The first impression that it gives is that it is a \\"Thriller\\" and/or a scary book. Its hard cover also protects the book and helps it last longer and keep it from damage. The title of the book on the cover is very clear and can be read easily. The font size that the story was written in wasn't too small and wasn't too big, which helped it to become one of its strengths. In opposite to the strengths of the book, it also has some weaknesses. Since this book has 336 pages, some people who don't like to read long books may not want to read this book and go for a different book. Since this book is Ethan Black's first book to be published, readers might not think that it is worth to read and that his more current books are much better. There is minor vulgarity in the book so it does limit readers to be at a certain age minimum to read it. In my opinion, and I hope all of us agree on, is that this book is not suitable for little kids to read. It contains minor sex, minor vulgarity, and violence. Of course these things are inappropriate for children to be reading about. We should be aware that certain books are for certain people. Like this book, it is limited to a much more mature audience to be reading it. Though these weaknesses may bring down the rate for the book, it is still a good book to read. Lastly, there are millions of books out there for you to read. You may choose romance novels or science novels, but in my opinion, \\"Thriller's\\" are a pretty good choice to read a book about. As you read farther and farther into the book, it does get interesting, as was mentioned before, and helps the readers to stay focused on the story and to keep them enthusiastic. As I mentioned before, you should be aware that these books are for a more mature audience because of the inappropriate things in it that children shouldn't know about. Aside from these minor weaknesses of the book, overall it is a book in good shape and a good book to spend time reading. I rate this book with 3.5 stars because the novel is easy to be read, and that it has an eye-catching cover."},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"Opened to the first page and five hours later read I was finishing the last.Enuf said..."},{"Title":"The Broken Hearts Club (Conrad Voort Novels)","review":"They meet every week in the shabby back room of a bar in New York City.

I didn't really care for this book because it didn't really interest me. I'm not really into the whole mystery killer type of thing. I am more interested into the more humor books that make me laugh like not serious stories. Something that I learned form this book is that just one person can really affect someone else's life not only mentally but also emotionally as well as physically. When I was finished readying this book I learned something about myself. I learned that before I say or do something I should think about how that person might feel or how that person might react.

It is an impressive, well-written scholarly work. It traces national and local policies toward (against) wolves from the mid-19th century to the present. The research is thorough and extensive. It demonstrates a profound understanding of the relationship between government and land-owners and the implications of policies for the ecology of the Western U.S. It includes an unprecedented detailed count of the wolves, coyotes, and livestock killed since 1878. The writing is beautiful. For example, on page 4, Robinson writes: \\"In fall the crisp weather turned aspen leaves yellow, and the first wisps of snow wafted in like unhurried emissaries from a season the hard, cold ground had never quite forgotten.\\" This is a ground-breaking work.Pearl Katz, Ph.D.Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"Title":"Predatory Bureaucracy: The Extermination of Wolves and the Transformation of the West","review":"Wolves in the West from Rout to Reintroductionby Wayne Sheldrake, Author of \\"Instant Karma: the Heart and Soul of a Ski Bum\\"It takes a little romance to feel a kinship with wolves, but to become involved in the process of their protection and reintroduction one has to be practical. Michael Robinson, an avowed wolf activist is a practical romantic. Predatory Bureaucracy: The Extermination of Wolves and the Transformation of the West keeps the wilderness poetics to a minimum and lets the history, legislation and law of extinction speak for itself.In a story that is part tragedy and part epic, the power of his tale lies in the character and flaws, of wolves and men. The enemies of wolves, trappers and hunters motivated by bounties or salaries, are portrayed as outdoorsmen of perseverance and skill, men who often admired their enemies even as they killed them. Wolves, though decidedly disadvantaged and obviously doomed, are remembered as insightful and tough (undeniably killers too). The heroes among them knew the individual scent and habits of their human torturers.From Robinson's long perspective, the true villain of extermination was the triumvirate of environmental holocaust, federal bureaucracy and poison. The quick demise of the buffalo caused wolves serious problems. Abandoned carcasses were an irresistible boon and wolves proliferated. (29) When the free range--literally free: no grazing fees, no fences, no railroads, yet--was repopulated with cattle, wolves did what wolves do. Stockgrowers associations offered bounties, pressing counties and states to do the same. (30-31) But hunters and trappers went where bounties were highest, and they let pups mature until they were worth money. (64) Wolves bounced back, until a system emerged that compensated for the limitations of commercial cooperation, local government, and human nature.In 1905, the new Forest Service \\"enacted\\" grazing fees. Cattleman immediately demanded protection from wolves. (51) About that time, the federal Bureau of Biological Survey was looking for ways to fund scientific projects. (63) They saw they could provide a service by quashing criticism that the FS provided wolves sanctuary, (78) and offering stockmen--very influential constituents of Congress (53)--\\"a more centralized system\\" of efficiently poisoning \\"\`noxious animals'.\\" (66) Robinson gives the Biological Survey a face, Stanley P. Young, master-trapper turned Uber-bureaucrat. Young cast wolves as \\"criminals.\\" (155) He presented slide shows on poisoning to annual stockgrowers meetings and conventions. (155) He solicited annual contributions to the agency from states, counties and \\"local ranching associations.\\" (164) He reported successes: 25 wolves killed in 1921 (153); 19 dead in 1922. (157) He also contended with little or no opposition. (Robinson includes an interesting chapter that explains the inaction of women's organizations, the American Bison Society, Aldo Leopold and Enos Mills.) When the wolves were gone, he deftly shifted the blame and the bureaucracy flourished, killing coyotes.Here the book embarks on a complex and innervating odyssey. A new kind of hero, and, paradoxically, a new kind of bureaucracy emerge. Into the late Twenties, conservationists complained internally that the loss of wolves was a loss to science; and predators, they had observed, helped prevent the spread of disease among ungulates and rodents, and controlled populations. (181-182) Young responded by cleansing agency terminology. \\"Extermination\\" became \\"control.\\" (198) In 1930, 148 scientists signed a letter protesting widespread poisoning. (212) F.D.R. tried to cut the BS budget in '31. (257) Congress reversed the cuts. (260) He appointed a critic as Chief. Poisoning continued. (264-268) By 1945, the agency had a new name, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and had adopted new poisons (coyotes spit out strychnine) and aerial gunning. (297) These were seminal years in the development of the practice (and personality!) of conservation activists.Rosalie Barrow Edge, a lifetime member of the Audubon Society, was \\"appalled\\" when she learned the Society turned its head from the BS's poisoning of magpies (246) because the birds ate coyote baits. (169-177) She filed \\"what may have been the first private citizen environmental lawsuit,\\" and won. (247) William Hornaday, who had fought to save the last bison, shared his mailing list (249), and she helped found the Emergency Conservation Committee, which supported the formation of wilderness, the \\"removal of all livestock from National Forests,\\" (249) and \\"indicted \`wholesale poisoning and trapping operations'.\\" (250) The committees mass mailings were written by scientists.Times and minds changed. The scientific work of mammologists like Joseph Grinell and his student E. Raymond Hall came to bear. Aldo Leopold, a former wolf killer, connected the preservation of predators to the preservation of land. (298) Even the founder of the BS \\"[came] out against the poisoning program.\\" (251) Finally, Stuart Udall became Secretary of the Interior and Rachel Carson's Silent Spring aroused public concern over the impact of poisoning on humans in the early sixties. Still, the institution of poisoning wasn't collared until Nixon banned it in 1972. The ban was disarmed by Ford, Carter and Reagan (327, 329), but by then the Endangered Species Act was law. Though it didn't forbid poisoning per se, it outlawed \\"any action that would doom a listed species, including destroying its habitat.\\" (323) The Act also gave citizens the right to sue for failure to enforce and mandated reintroduction. In 1986, when the EPA tried to \\"reauthorize...strychnine for rodent control\\" Defenders of Wildlife and the Sierra Club sued. (330)Robinson spends the remainder of the book recounting wolf reintroduction based on the tradition of legal activism and concessions. Wolves were returned to Idaho, Yellowstone and the Southwest amidst the opposition of equally active western ranchers. In Yellowstone, Defenders of Wildlife \\"promised to reimburse ranchers for the cost of livestock killed or injured by wolves.\\" (341) and wolves \\"known to be preying livestock\\" were shot from \\"planes and helicopter.\\" Still, by 2005, \\"over 900 wolves roamed Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana,\\" and a few wandered to Washington, Oregon, Utah, and Colorado. (346) Reintroduction in the Southwest was bitter, violent and disappointing. Over three years, the population remained static at 27 wolves. (363)Robinson's polemic against bureaucracy is strong. The history of the BS as a policy-maker operating as a service at the beck and call of a powerful political constituency puzzles together the zeitgeist, backroom politics, and scientific exchange of the times through the remarkably frank letters and memos of the principals. There's less voice, and less depth to more recent personalities, when the research relies primarily on published statements, news reports, and legal briefs.The writing is most compelling in the early history of the west, when the individual character of wolves--their heroic escapes, their family loyalties, their tragic ends--packs the narrative with drama and grief. Hunters are masterfully juxtaposed as men whom, though diabolically skilled, possessed wild, near-meditative wolf-wit. Trapping wolves was so difficult (and dangerous to livestock) that poisons came to the fore, but even poisoning a wolf took insight that a naturalist would envy.Robinson's captive audience, wolf lovers, will be rapt with the epic martyrdom of a species, and they may be agitated to tactical, practical action. Reintroduction opponents might be moved to reexamine the grim history of a bureaucracy that exceeded the viciousness of its prey."},{"Title":"Predatory Bureaucracy: The Extermination of Wolves and the Transformation of the West","review":"Before you open it for the first time, Predatory Bureaucracy can be bit intimidating due to its length. But once I finally started reading, the pages melted away quickly. Even though I knew the ultimate outcome of the wolf history described in the book - the ultimate reintroduction to great controversy and current/recent debates over delisting them, and the additional difficulties in the Southwest - the parts of Predatory Bureaucracy that transition from chronicling the persecution of predators to a growing appreciation for their value somehow 'tricked' me into imagining that the book would have a happy ending where everybody eventually came to accept the value of intact ecosystems and let up on the persecution. That is, until at about page 330, when I took a break from reading to check my inbox and found an email from Defenders of Wildlife about plans to reinstate aerial hunting of wolves in Wyoming. So that relieved me of any illusions quickly, but I thought the fact that the book was able to induce a temporary disconnect from the reality I know and love is a testament to the author's ability to create an engaging narrative out of what could have easily been just a collection of facts and quotes, making the book both devastatingly informative and quite readable.

You will truly never see the west the same after reading this incredibly detailed account of federal agents' compliance with special interests at the detriment to our natural predatory system."},{"Title":"Predatory Bureaucracy: The Extermination of Wolves and the Transformation of the West","review":"This book is a highly-regarded study of the extermination of wolves in the US West over the last century. Unfortunately, I'm unable to give it as high a rating as the other reviewers. Certainly Robinson knows his material and he has given us an exhaustive story of how the Bureau of Biological Survey (BBS) and other agencies exterminated the wolf.Unfortunately, the narrative is not only exhaustive but exhausting. Robinson has given us too much, and culled too little, to make for a compelling story. The basic structure is clear enough: cattlemen cleared out bison and put cattle in their place on the open range; wolves found cattle (and sheep) easy prey; cattlemen and other settlers organized to eliminate wolves; a scientific agency in the federal government found an opportunity to grow powerful by providing the service of wolf extermination to a wide constituency instead of doing science for a narrow constituency; and even after eliminating wolves, the BBS moved to kill other species, which it continues to do today (under a different name). Thanks to its political allies, the BBS resisted all attempts to rein it in, though the Endangered Species Act has slowed it down.That could have been a six-chapter story. One might have expanded it to perhaps twelve chapters, to allow for changes in the players and their actions over time. Unfortunately, Robinson gives us 27 chapters. We meet a lot of individuals, whether scientists, politicians, stockmen, administrators, bounty hunters, or wolves. But Robinson tries too hard to be thorough, so we meet too many of these characters.I realize that professional historians generally value this kind of definitive treatment of a subject, and this book certainly provides a definitive history of the wolf extermination program. More implicitly than explicitly, it raises serious questions about the complicity of government in despoiling the environment instead of protecting it. Robinson's analysis of the political support coalition behind a very destructive agency could lead any earnest young environmentalist to despair.Even admitting all that, the book would have been better had it been shorter."},{"Title":"Autumn Grocer Quail","review":"Here, again, Mahfouz continues in the direction he started to assume in \\"The Thief and The Dogs.\\" This one I can say had a better plot, even though I did not think so when I was reading it.In this story, we have a social worker who lost his work after revolution. He was successful in his job, was about to marry the woman of his dreams, and was in the verge of being a first class citizen. Things change, however, and he becomes jobless. He takes a big vacation to Alexandria and so many things take place from there on.Here, Mahfouz, who got used to writing in this new style, explores all possible things occurring to this man, and he even makes him suffer in war. He uses his simple sophisticated language to explain all the events.The ending was a bit shaky to my taste. There was, in fact, no ending, for all I care. It is one of those \\"and life goes on\\" where you do not know what comes of the heroes.All in all, the book is worth reading, it might even give you some delightful time, but still I like the old Mahfouz's style."},{"Title":"Autumn Grocer Quail","review":"In this novel dated from his &quot;Symbolist&quot;-period (or 3rd phase of Mahfouz recognized career), Mahzfouz presents the life of an ex-Wafdist, who formerly was a ruthless officer of the deposed party: Egypt is now ruled by Nasser's regime; but Isa, the main character, is still living in an out-dated time, refreshing his memory with past events and refusing to see the present changes. The way of introducing the manners and thoughts of Isa is brillantly convincent, upto the point of letting the reader to get a deep insight of his innermost motivations and feelings. Isa is an &quot;historical outsider&quot;, he lives out of his times, and all this leads him to an actual &quot;psychological eclipse&quot;.The span of time covered by the novel is lengther than in other writings of his, from the same years: occurrences happen in a longer period, happenings become in a slower pace. Isa's past is told through flashbacks and mind-flowing thoughts. What is a surprise is the end: the abrupt conclusion has left many critics hanging on; I think that this book deals with the &quot;autumn&quot; of a man, but that Life always give a chance to &quot;find oneself again&quot;, such as the &quot;grocer&quot; return once and again to the same place after it has migrated God knows where.

I would recomend the book to any person who likes adventure or olden times books."},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"This short novel by Seredy (1899-1975) won the 1938 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. It is a story based on oral traditions of the founding of the Hungarian nation in the fifth century by the Huns (or, precursors or &quot;cousins&quot; of the Huns), brothers of the Magyars and the Cimmerians. The vision of a white stag leads Attila across the Carpathian mountains to a new land."},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"I remembered reading this when I was little and bought it for my daughter. It is still a great read."},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"A familiar story with unfamiliar details. Seredy tells the origin myth of her ancestors, the Magyars and the Huns: how, starting with Nimrod at the Tower of Babel, they are propelled ever westward by a hunger for their own land. Nimrod's descendents continue the search; at times of crisis, a ghostly white stag appears to guide them. The search ends with Attila, most famous of the Huns. Well before Attila was born in 408 AD, the Magyars had split off from the Huns and settled between the Volga and Don Rivers, near the present city of Volgodonsk in southern Russia. The Huns became even fiercer, laying waste to any inhabited lands they passed through until finally they found their home on a fertile plain just west of the Carpathian Mountains, in today's Hungary.Because documentary evidence for these Hun and Magyar tribes at the time of writing was almost nil (no \\"facts and dates\\" available, as the author says), the work is speculative historical fantasy. As such it is done quite well. The author's illustrations are superb -- finely drawn lines and delicate shading, with nobility and grandness of purpose emanating from every page. The figures recall comic book superheroes, except that these drawings were done well before the first Batman or Superman appeared.Readers familiar with Norse and Germanic mythology will recognize much here: hardened warriors, animal spirits, magic swords, mystical nature-beings, prophecies read from the skies. Many other cultures have figures like Nimrod and Attila that embody the essence of that people's origin; e.g. Abraham, Moses, Aeneas (founder of Rome), Brutus (founder of Britain), even Columbus and Brigham Young from later eras. Human beings do seem to love their founding legends.The book is an excellent teaching tool for lessons on world mythologies. Seredy fills in the gap usually left in such studies, which tend to cover Greek, Roman, and Germanic myths before moving on to Native Americans. The reading level is higher than the comic-book appearance of the illustrations would indicate, so the book would probably work best as a read-aloud. Children could then be encouraged to explore their own origin stories.One interesting side note: the white stag that appears in difficult situations looks exactly like the \\"patronus\\" supposedly invented by JK Rowling in the Harry Potter books, and plays the same role."},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"I had my kids read this when we studied the fall of Rome. For fun, we also watched the Disney movie \\"Mulan\\" in which the Huns are wonderfully big and dark and evil. Simultaneously, we were reading \\"real\\" history texts linking the building of the Great Wall of China, with movement of the Huns west, with the Huns pressuring the Teutonic tribes outside the Roman empire into the Roman empire... We were making interesting historical speculations. I like what another reviewer said about comparing it with The Trumpeter of Krakow. I do history chronologically and I would put Trumpeter a bit later in my medieval studies, but it's a superb comparison of POVs to make again and again for middle schoolers.There is a theory that the Huns developed the stirrup which was necessary for knights to be able to fight in heavy armor on horseback--here come the middle ages.I won't use this book with older kids because there is just more important literature out there to read, but I am glad I used it once."},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"This is a story that a tribe called the Huns and Magyars.

I can now assure you that it stands the test of time, and well deserved the Newberry Award"},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"The White Stag is the story of a culture of which I know little, that of the tribes of the Huns and the Magyars. The two tribes were once one, but split to follow two brothers, one adventurous, the other less intent on fighting. Both tribes roamed westward, in search of the white stag, and were eventually reunited under the leadership of Attila. This story had a surprising rhythm, a cadence almost like a fairy tale, filled with battles and power struggles and wanderings."},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"This book takes your middle grades reader across the vast Asian steppes as the Huns and Magyars move relentlessly westward. Heroic leaders and inspirational illustrations - this book will get them hooked. Portrays Attila as his people's natural leader, born to it and raised by a cheerless, grieving father. It does mention, in passing, that the Scourge of God is conducting bloody warfare on a massive scale, but the book doesn't go into graphic details.Powerful prophecies, potent writing.Nicely done story."},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"I ordered this book for my child's book report. I was worried that it would take too long to get to my house and that there would not be enough time to read the book and write the report. I couldn't believe how quickly the book arrived--just a couple of days. I was very impressed with the speed of delivery and the book was in excellent shape. Although it was a used book the book seller described it perfectly and it did not look like it had ever been touched. It looked perfectly new. If this book seller (JJ's Book Nook) can continue to operate like this I would give them a 100% satisfaction score. The book itself was a historical novel. It was less than 100 pages, but a lot of information was placed in this book. It can be read on several levels from child to adult. On the adult level, the author tells about some very specific historical events and puts them in a proper context that was very interesting. A child would not know about any of these events and some knowledge of history is necessary to fully understand the merits of the book. It basically told about the founding of the country of Hungry and some of the myths associated with a few historical facts. The combination made for a good read for both child and adult. Reading about the myths would be fun reading for children and the historical context of the story was interesting reading for adults."},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"The White Stag by Kate Seredy is about a tribe that is trying to find the Promised Land. The tribe believes in the White eagleand Red Eagle as powerful gods. Nimrod, the mighty god told a prophecy about the future. The other leaders were Hunar and Magyar. Slowly the tribe starts to split up into the Huns and Magyars. Hunar married and has a son, Bendeguz. The Huns likes war, they never lose. This book is happy, sometimes confusing, and took place a long time ago in 480 A.D."},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"This book is a classic in my family, who are of mixed Hungarian and Scotch-Irish descent. While it is far from accurate history, it is a beautiful legend of the origins of that curious non-Slavic race called the Magyars. Seredy's grasp of myth is readily apparent; her prose is simple enough for an eight- or nine-year-old to understand but she never talks down to the reader, since she uses the universal, spare language of the epic poet. This book was richly deserving of the Newbery Medal and remains a must-read for young adults (and old adults) today."},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"&quot;The past lived in songs, the present in their flashing swords,and the future in their hearts.&quot; This twentieth century myth about the ancient Magyar migration is stark in content yet poetic in style; some passages seem more like poetry disguised as prose. Seredy has recreated an era long swallowed in the mists of lost cultures, when the Roman Empire was disintegrating under the relentless attacks of various &quot;barbarian&quot; tribes. The Huns and the Magyars followed the prophecy of aged Nimrod, leading their people ever westward from Asia to Eastern Europe.They needed bold, even ruthless leaders to accomplish this monumenal task, yet they were also inspired and championed by a mysterious animal protector--a magnificent white stag with supernatural power. It is difficult for us moderns to admire the Huns, a name synonymous with bloodthirsty aggresssion and destruction of post-Romanic culture. Yet Seredy's goal is to justify this epic migration--a March of Terror spanning three generations, which enabled her ancestors to achieve their self-imposed dream. They focused on steadfast obedience to their god, Hadur, who told them of a Promised Land &quot;between two rivers, surrounded by mountains.&quot; There is both literary genius and respect in this saga of the birth and destiny of young Attila. This slender volume is actually a mini epic, piercing the curtain between History and Legend. For readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"I like to pair this book with The Trumpeter of Krakow. First we read how &quot;The Tartars came through the world like a horde of wild beasts. They left not one thing alive nor one green blade of wheat standing. Brave they were as lions, courageous they were as great dogs, but they had hearts of stone and knew not mercy, nor pity, nor tenderness, nor God.&quot; (From Trumpeter of Krakow)Then in White Stag we read, &quot;For years there was no rest for them, there could be no rest. Like a sharp wedge they had driven themselves into Europe and now they were surrounded by enemies; they had to go on or perish.&quot;By comparing these two books, a child learns that there are two sides to every story--a good lesson in life."},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"You know what's wrong with most Newbery Award winning books? They're just so darn pro-peace. Didn't used to be that way. Why take the fascinating novel, \\"The White Stag\\" as an example. An amazing story that decides that Attila the Hun has gotten a bad rap. In this book, he's still a psychopath, but he's a psychopath with a mission. If you find yourself unfamiliar with this literary work, allow me summarize the major points found within.To find their promised land, the Huns go on a years long rampage of pillaging and murder in the hopes of finding their own place to live. It's like the Old Testament but without any of the good moral lessons. For its 1937 publication, the book is remarkably pro-genocide. As it briefly explains, the Huns find themselves in a kill or be killed mentality. People who see them coming fight them instinctively so that the poor Huns are forced to become blood-thirsty. They search day in and out for their own place to live, guided by their vengeful god Hadur. In this light, Attila is the Moses that finally leads his people to a land flowing with milk and honey. Whatta swell guy.You may have picked up on the fact that I'm being sarcastic. But how can I help it? Just note the fate of pacifism. When Bendeguz, father of Attila, decides that maybe the Huns should settle down in a rather nice land they've come to own and not go about slaughtering the innocent, he is berated soundly by the blind seer Damos. Those who fight others without provocation are holy. And those who would rather not go around killing, \\"will be punished for their weakness... Long after the Huns have found the promised land, they will be still homeless wanderers in the wilderness\\". Um... okay.There are things to like in this book, of course. The prose itself is evocative and lovely. If judged on the placement of words alone, this book deserves the Newbery. And Kate Seredy's illustrations are impressive, there is no question. They're a series of beautiful 30s illustrations, akin to the kinds of graphics you'd normally find in a Socialist rag. If you can possibly locate a copy of this book with the original illustrations, you will not regret it. It's just the moral of the story I have difficulties with. It's supposed to be: Have faith in yourself and your beliefs and in the end all will turn out well. Instead it comes off as: Kill lots of people because you're certain your god is the best, and all will turn out well. Lots of other people will disagree with me. But regardless if you're a hawk or a dove at heart, this book comes off as little more than a beautiful immoral tale."},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"The White Stag is a great book for people who like strange fantasy. It was very different than any other books in the way Kate Seredy expressed what happened. I liked how she changed an old story of killing into an interesting plot. Before you read this book you think of the Huns as people set on killing, but when you read this book you feel the Huns actually had personalities and reasons for doing what they did. You get to find out about a hidden history and how different the Huns really were. It is a very interesting book."},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"The White Stag by Kate Seredy tells an epic tale of the author's own imagined mythic origins of the Magyar (Hungarian) peoples. The story unfolds as a heroic migration out of Asia and into Europe by the sister tribes of the Huns and Magyars, with the Magyars losing their nerve and settling eastwards, and the Huns driving on for historic glory with Attila.I first picked the book up as a fourth grader in a school well the book was hardbound and well worn, thumbed over by several generations of Hungarian-ethnic schoolmates I presume, the school having many such folk. I'm not Hungarian but I relished this tale of conquest, destiny, and pagan will-to-power.Today I've reread the book with my child at the same age. My how my perspective has changed. Today I enjoyed the book again but with pause. I was amazed at how the Huns were depicted as so convicted in their god-blessed migration of conquest, and how any sympathy to the vanquished and displaced populations of Europe was barely mentioned in the telling, except to note that they'd given Attila the name of the \\"Scourge of God.\\" In this way and to my adult mind, the story had a lot more \\"Biblical\\" parallels than just the patriarch named Nimrod. Did the Hebrews cry for the dead children of Jerhico in the Bible? I can't recall, but Seredy's Huns sure don't.I wonder if today a book such as this could win the Newberry award let alone be published. The White Stag, however, was published in 1937 when Germany and Germans were entranced with their own version of epic nationalism and seemed ready to throw the dice again on a war of conquest. Perhaps the book fit the mood of the day. But the perspective of the award-giving intellectuals has certainly changed since then dramatically in a skeptical and anti-nationalistic direction. Would Knut Hamsun have been published in recent decades, let alone won a Nobel prize?Well this book has no ironic self critique. It speaks the epic with a voice more like that of the Nietzschean \\"blonde beast\\" than that of a self-doubting and ironic product of the late 20th century's cultural deconstructionism. If you prefer your tribal tales full of sympathy for the downtrodden \\"Other,\\" then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"The beautiful story arc pits the Magor tribe against the followers of a man we come to know Atilla the Hun. This book had me on the edge of my seat as a child, and has a great ending!Late, late in this book, Seredy uses the word \\"Hun,\\" at which point (as a child of 9), I figured out that Hunor and Magor were the founders of *actual* tribes, including Atilla's Huns. Up 'til then, I'd assumed it was pure fiction created by Seredy. Her subtle approach has always impressed me about this book."},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"Attila . . . who is this man? Attila the Hun . . . who is this conquerer? You may read every history book on this historic man, but you may not learn as much as when you read The White Stag. Ask yourself this: when does fiction end and history begin? There are few authors who can express themselves perfectly in both writing and drawing as Kate Seredy, the author of The White Stag. When she combines her talents into this book, the results are wonderous. The poetic words flow into rich pictures which capture the imagination and brings it into new heights. Even though The White Stag is a short book, it is an equal to any ancient history book with hundreds of pages. After you read this book, the memory of it lingers and enthralls you. Adults and childern alike can read this novel and find the satisfaction of an excellent book. Stories which mix fiction with facts are as true as history. When you read this book, you read history, because history is as full of untruths as truths. Read this book when you are young, and when you grow up, read it again to yourself anf your childern. Each time you read this book, your insight of its sighnificance will grow."},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"I enjoyed this book.

Starting with Nimrod all the way to Attila the Hun. The moral of the story gets mixed up, but I really didn't see this as your typical \\"good vs. evil\\" or Aesop's Fable story-line. It's folklore and an explanation on how \\"our Hungarian ancestors\\" came to be.I'm not going to explain this in great detail as other reviewers did. It's a short story and it has many illustrations and it is worth picking up or checking out at your library."},{"Title":"The White Stag.","review":"The White Stag written by Kate Seredy is a wonderful fairy-tail based on Hungarian legend. The book tells of how the warrior bands, the Huns and Magyars struggle in their travel across Asia and into Europe to the Promise Land. The story is beautifully written as it tells of a powerful family of hero's, a mythical white stag, moon maids, and a blind prophet who is able to see the future. The symbolism and metaphors Seredy uses are wonderful and make the story very beautiful; of course the most magnificent one being the white stag representing Hadure (God). The tail is quite exciting as it tells of bravery, honor, loyalty, faithfulness, love, doubt, ambition, failure, and happiness. It's truly an amazing story with an important message to its readers, that hard work and determination pay off in the end."},{"Title":"Third Down and a War to Go: The All-American 1942 Wisconsin Badgers","review":"This book appeals to readers from many different angles. I bought one for the history lover in the family, and another for a friend who enjoys tales of war. This is to say nothing about the football and human interest stories that are intertwined as well.Frei's book breaths new life and, in many cases, uncovers a side of life in the young men portrayed in the book. Their heroic exploits as football greats in 1942 gave way to a higher level of heroism on the battle fields of Europe and Asia from 1943-45. Frei brilliantly traces the tales of friendship, glory, fear, courage, love, honor, dignity, humor, joy, and sorrow in a slice of the American experience the likes of which we'll probably never again witness, except through accounts like this one. Thanks, Terry!"},{"Title":"Third Down and a War to Go: The All-American 1942 Wisconsin Badgers","review":"Terry Frei writes a great story abot some amazing people. We all should be thankful for those who have made sacrifices before us, and this Wisconsin football team is a great story. A great read for all college football fans!"},{"Title":"Third Down and a War to Go: The All-American 1942 Wisconsin Badgers","review":"In 1942 the Wisconsin Bagers had a football team that was exceptional, a host of star players coached by Harry Stuhldreyer one of the Notre Dame Four Horsemen. But 1942 was a different kind of time for young men. Within a few months these young men were in places like Okinawa, POW camps, the authors father was flying a P-38.This book is in part a sports story, in part a war story (one battle death had been shrouded in mystery for 60 years), and also an interresting analogy between college football and the military services. It is no accident that the size of the average sports team and the size of the basic military unit both contain about ten men. This is the group that can work well together.This book fits right in between a sports book and a history book."},{"Title":"Third Down and a War to Go: The All-American 1942 Wisconsin Badgers","review":"By the other reviews here, you'd think this was a marvelous sports-war book fullof interesting, endearing characters performing in extraordinary times. In fact, the book reads like a story from a friendly uncle who carries on and on about people you don't know who he hasn't made you care about. There's little to bond you to the characters, and much of the book explains the not particularly interesting game-by-game season of a Wisconsin football team. In the preface the autor relates how his father's life inspired the book, and this feels like something someone would write for the benefit of the narrow group of people who experienced it, not the general public."},{"Title":"Third Down and a War to Go: The All-American 1942 Wisconsin Badgers","review":"Very average book!

And what a way to get a kid started. It was one of those times when, briefly, it all came together: Heartland guys who hailed from small towns and cities and who played an extraordinary game of football for the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Names like Elroy Hirsh, Pat Harder, Dave Schreiner still resonate. Sadly the war put an end to this magic, and tragically some of the guys never made it back to pick up where they'd left off. Sportswriter Terry Frei, son of the late '42 Badger Jerry Frei, has done a remarkable job of reporting the drama and the triumphs of the season and the dedication and inevitable heartbreak that marked the war years. But despite the focus of this cleverly titled book, don't be fooled. This is an All-America story."},{"Title":"Third Down and a War to Go: The All-American 1942 Wisconsin Badgers","review":"I think Terry Frei did a fantastic recounting events of something that happened 60 years ago. Clearly Mr. Frei did a thorough job researching all the events and the many characters he references. As for the reader, he/she is taken on a journey about teenagers turning into young men during one of the most difficult times in American history. Frei goes into great detail about the Wisconsin Badger roster and characters that make it up. At times, it does get confusing but I honestly don't see how Frei could have singled anyone out -- except for perhaps Dave Schreiner. I will admit I skipped some of the middle of book when the author gives a recap of all the Badger games from 1942. The second half of the book (about the war) is very well done. In fact, the second half of the book is a real page tuner. All in all, it is a good book about some fine people that I would have loved to have met."},{"Title":"Third Down and a War to Go: The All-American 1942 Wisconsin Badgers","review":"Mr. Frei has been able to so clearly paint the images of football, war, heroism, friendship, patriotism and love. I never wanted to put \\"Third Down\\" on the nightstand; the faces and stories were so real. This book will appeal to football fans and history buffs alike -- yet it is so much more than either of those. \\"Third Down\\" is a fanastic story but the fact that it is based on reality makes it so much more... I deeply care for the people Frei writes about -- he touches the reader by bringing us into the lives of real American heros.

In describing their experiences on the football field and in service to their country, Frei makes it clear why the generation young men and women who came of age during the Second World War have become known simply as the \\"Greatest\\"While some may think that this book is \\"too narrow,\\" \\"too old,\\" or \\"too local,\\" let me say that it is far from that. This is a story of the highest degree, one that will leave the reader at various times laughing, mournful, amazed, and inspired. \\"Third Down And A War To Go\\" is much more than just a football story. It is much more than just a war story.It is a story about us."},{"Title":"Third Down and a War to Go: The All-American 1942 Wisconsin Badgers","review":"So many had raved about this to me, on the web and in the media I didn't know if it could live up to all of that. It was even better than I expected. The friendships, the campus atmosphere in the first year of the war, the great football season involving famous players (Crazy Legs) and a famous coach (Four Horseman), and then the war experiences! When you get to the battle climaxes, you're both feeling proud and ready to cry in places, and you're also staggered because of the amount of research that had to go into this to find all of it out. Not to ruin the story, but this also shows why a lot of us Wisconsin fans think David Schreiner should be honored on the facade of Camp Randall Stadium. If you haven't heard of Dave Schreiner, you should. Talk about what this country is all about! He's it."},{"Title":"Third Down and a War to Go: The All-American 1942 Wisconsin Badgers","review":"Third Down and a War to Go is a page turner which chronicles the 1942 University of Wisconsin all-star football team and its college years, heroic service in World War II, and return to unsung ordinary lives. It was a different era for college football. Players actually wanted an education. The majority were less than six feet tall and weighed less than 200 pounds. What scholarships they received were so meager that even the All-Americans washed dishes and waited table. There was no question about them interrupting college and collegiate football to serve their country. Some selflessly gave their lives but most returned, played some more football, and contributed to America's post-war recovery as lawyers, teachers, real estate agents, and Jerry Frei, the author's father, as a college and pro football coach. Most never discussed their war service and certainly didn't consider themselves the \\"greatest generation.\\"Terry Frei tells their story in a moving style.

I can't remember the last time I read a book, let alone a paperback, with so many typos. The stories this book attempts to tell are worth telling, but not in this way."},{"Title":"The witching hour,: A drama in four acts,","review":"The play \\"The Witching Hour\\" by Augustus Thomas opened on Broadway in November 1907 at the Hackett Theatre and ran for 212 performances. John Mason who had run on Broadway several years earlier in \\"Leah Kleschna\\" played the lead Jack Brookfield. We learn that Brookfield's niece Viola Campbell is in love with young Clay, although lawyer Hardmuth would like to neutralize his rival to seek Viola's hand.As the first act unfolds at Brookfield's estate, a gaming dispute escalates. Young Clay Whipple picks up a cat's eye pin and fatally stabs Tom Denning. The second act unfolds as the Whipple trial comes to dominate the news. Hard-nosed politician Frank Hardmuth sees an opportunity to advance his bid for the Governor of Kentucky. He also tries to discredit young Whipple to advance his romantic chances with Viola.As events unfold, the play explores paranormal abilities of mind control. We learn that Jack Brookfield can know the cards in another's hand and can even influence the minds of members of a jury miles away. Jack knows that Hardmuth is unethical because he has read his mind and therefore opposes him as the choice for his niece to marry. Brookfield battles Hardmuth by reading his mind and running a story in his paper that Hardmuth had planned an assassination. While true, it is impossible for Brookfield to have known about it other than through telepathy. The play climaxes with the resolution of the Whipple trial and a renegade Hardmuth pulling a gun on Brookfield.Almost a hundred years later, interest in the paranormal continues to intrigue audiences. One might ask questions like how Jack developed his abilities and the ethics involved in having this type of superior power. But \\"The Witching Hour\\" is an effective dramatic play which might lurch uncomfortably toward melodrama in an unskilled hand. However, it equally might still be revived as an early example of the exploration of this theme in the American theatre. Enjoy!Note: I assume that this is the 1908 publication of Thomas' play, but it should be longer than the listed 3 pages."},{"Title":"The Slow Cooker Cookbook","review":"Slow cooking has been the subject of competing titles, but The Slower Cooker Cookbook offers a twist: dishes which are not usually seen in the other casserole-oriented books.

Many have conjectured withpredictable, unlikely speculations. E.G. Ross tackles this questionwith verve and imagination, while holding to a plausible story linethat engages the reader. There is no lack of action, intrigue andsubplots to keep a mentally sharp bibliophile happy. Yet there ismore here. One finds a basic questioning of current trends in therole that government plays in our lives, and a believable projection ofhow this might effect us in the near future. The importance ofindividual responsibility and freedom is one theme of this thoughtfulnovel. Readers will also enjoy the fast pace and technology that addzest to this excellent adventure."},{"Title":"The Oregon Rebellion","review":"This novel is the last published by Mr. Ross, who unexpectedly died in April 2003. While the story features many futuristic technological ideas and products, it continues the broader theme of his earlier novels Engels Extension, and BTB (his only published e-book) in honoring the spirit of individualism and ornery resistance to statism. And while set in Oregon (Ross's home state), it could easily be located anywhere so this is not just for Northwesterners. I was a personal friend of Ross since the early 1970s, and among his many talents and avocations, I think he most wanted to become a successful novelist. I think this novel accomplished that goal, even though he was working on several others. I do recommend reading his first novel (Engels Extension) prior to this one, but it isn't necessary to get thoroughly transported into his world of intrigue and inventiveness."},{"Title":"The Oregon Rebellion","review":"I love reading fiction that incorporates up-to-date information about technological advances. For example: electrogravitics; mental states created by magnetic induction; and miniature, insect-like flying machines of which there are already working models.Ross gives the reader a glimpse into the future. His books are &quot;futur-orical&quot; novels. What you read about is likely to show up in the media sooner or later.The places too are real.

No information for snorkellers though."},{"Title":"Diving Indonesia: A Guide to the World's Greatest Diving (Periplus Action Guides)","review":"I've dived much of the territory this book covers, including Bali, Komodo, Raja Ampat, and Wakatobi, and in my experience the Periplus guides are about as good as they get. Just remember that one rotten reef bomber can destroy a pristine dive site in five minutes, so you can't depend on any given dive site being what this book describes. Still, you should have a book before you go there--many areas have treacherous currents (a requirement for the dazzling biodiversity we enjoy) and other tricky circumstances, so you shouldn't go unprepared.But Indonesia has, arguably, the best diving on Earth, and this book is the best intro I know of.One tip: Grand Komodo Tours, based in Bali, has liveaboards in many of these areas. My wife & I have gone on three of them and loved the prices and the expertise we got. Don't use expat divemasters! We only use divemasters who grew up there. You're often a long, long ways from help, and it takes locals to really know the water conditions in many of these places.One other tip: the book recommends Tulamben in Bali for good diving, and so it is--but the divemasters at the German resort there have been grabbing all the nudibranchs they can find and moving them in front of their resort. So if you want to find nice nudibranchs there, you know where to find them now.That's the sort of advice no book can give you--even the Periplus ones. So always supplement your book-learning with extended conversations with knowledgeable locals.If you aren't a diver yet, try Permuteran in Bali. It seemed to have the easiest conditions."},{"Title":"Diving Indonesia: A Guide to the World's Greatest Diving (Periplus Action Guides)","review":"Book in great condition - like new!

Conran won't just ask, what color scheme do you want, but instead makes reader think about true functionality of beds &amp; baths and all the accoutrements. If you use this book to remodel or build, you'll be making some informed choices!Ignore the hairstyles of the models (mid 1970's) and book won't seem so dated. In fact, Europe (source of most of these designs) must have been ahead of America in the bathroom design game, because most of the fixtures seem quite current, actually.Bedroom sections of the book are more dated, though, with a lack of variety, especially with conspicuous absence of shabby chic, country, and ethnic styles which have become popular in America.What is really great about this book is its organization. There are informative and entertaining sections about the history of, say, the bidet or the cradle. There are sections for the design of sickrooms, rooms for convalescing, rooms for couples, rooms for teens, and so on.Great variety...Many excellent, helpful examples and diagrams! More photos and examples than most currently available design books of the same size.Goes one step more technical/practical than usual style books, in that there is a whole section on choosing a mattress, one on toilet seat ergonomics, one on the manufacture of carpets.One last complaint... photos often feature poorly lit interiors.

Brief summaries examine each area's history and methods for tattooing. The book is very attractively done. Recommended for anyone serious about tattooing."},{"Title":"Tattoos from Paradise: Traditional Polynesian Patterns","review":"This is an excellent book as a historical reference for Polynesian Tattooing. It offers no new ideas or artwork but combines the historical information from previously published books. I recommend this book for anyone interested in Polynesian tattooing as not the definitive, but a good reference. It focuses a lot on Maori Tattooing and less on other cultures but that may be due to the fact that the Ta Moko had more documentation or illustrations that this author could use to fill his book. This is also a good reference into Polynesian culture because it documents that historically the Tatau was not a fad, or in anyway a negative, rebellious action in Polynesia. Ta Tatau was interwoven into the culture and life as a positive art form historically and today."},{"Title":"Tattoos from Paradise: Traditional Polynesian Patterns","review":"This book brings together a collection of interesting images, some of which have special interest personally because they are of my own ancestors. While some images also also in in my own and other public and private collections, a publication such as this provides an important opportunity to share. The text provides background comment although it is limited and forced to rely greatly on previous published thought and opinion. My one concern would be that, given the current worldwide craze for so-called \\"tribal\\" tattoos, even with many current derived designs out there in catalogues, that sources such as this become further samples to be copied. Since traditionally, and especially in Maori terms, a \\"moko\\" was a unique, personalised signature with a detailed narrative attached to each design element, any person simply copying a design in ignorance of its innate powers and significance, would be running contrary to ancient \\"tapu\\" and obligations. The other interesting aspect here is the way in which early photographers actually enhanced \\"moko\\" with ink or paint in order to make the designs more prominent. This, of itself, is interesting as it also involves a serious breach of \\"tapu\\" where, touching the head of a chief was not permitted.

But, it is a good book. It's a work of fiction about fellows with the 3rd Arkansas and Hood's Texas Brigade. It's a good read and I have gone through it a number of times. Unlike one reviewer, I have no problem following events and the characters. The book follows one mess (a group of soldiers assigned to work and eat together in camp which forms an unshakable bond that carries over on to the march and battlefield) of the 3rd Arkansas which was to eventually be assigned to Hood's Texas Brigade of the Army of Northern Virginia and together were the only westerners remaining in Lee's army after a reorganization that moved other western troops such as Mississippians and Tennesseans to the Trans-Mississippi area of operation.Even though concerned with one mess there is one character in particular who is perhaps the \\"main character.\\" He is probably the one seen as \\"impossible to empathize with\\" because basically, he is an overly naive and immature Ozark hillbilly whose older brother goes along to watch over. We join this mess as an invisible participant and follow it and Lee's army through it's days of seeming invincibility through days of inevitable defeat and finally to the bitter end. As time progresses, as does the army, so to does our mess begin to crumble. Since the story is as much about the mess as a whole besides the \\"main character,\\" the book does take us in different directions sometimes necessarily overlapping events. The intent, I believe is to present as completely as possible an image of a Confederate soldier of Lee's army and the many fates that might befall him in his service. I'd say the book does it well. I like this book well enough to have read it not once or twice but many times.It's an especially readable book for those, as another reviewer noted, who tire from the view from the mighty ranks of Blue. But since the ending is the same, it is not a happy one. the book brings you to an end with heavy heart. And that's as it should be. It also pictures the Confederate soldier in a light to often ignored. Simple farmers most of them, neither dedicated nor even caring about slavery but drawn together for various personal reasons but mostly to defend against what they saw as an invasion of foreigners. Once assembled they became an army dedicated to their commanders, and each other. Greater issues such as \\"The Cause\\" were immaterial. That is not what they fought and suffered horrors we can't even begin to imagine (thank God!) for. But for duty. And they gave it to their \\"last full measure of devotion.\\" It is these men who we read about. It does a pretty good (and heart rending) job of telling their story.The author referenced the history of the 3rd Arkansas, \\"They'll Do to Tie To\\" and it is a fairly reasonably accurate portrayal of that unit and it's actions allowing for some literary license. It's a work of fiction, not a unit history."},{"Title":"The Barefoot Brigade","review":"This is the story of a group of men from Arkansas, particularly the brothers Noah and Zack, who end up fighting in Virginia during the Civil War. Jones has a hard time maintaining narrative tension -- there are moments when the reader notices something and then thinks &quot;wait, when did that happen?&quot;, and the overall context of the characters' experiences is unclear, though that might be deliberate on the author's part. Through much of the text, drama is lacking somehow. On the other hand, during the last quarter or so of the text, the author seems to have been reinspired and produces some rather good writing as well as some dramatic action scenes. The end comes as a surprise and I'm not sure how I feel about it: without spoiling it, some major characters die, and while I don't object to that at all, I had a hard time with the fact that the one character left alive is one who was not well drawn and with whom it was never possible to empathize."},{"Title":"The Barefoot Brigade","review":"Though not always the most advanced writing with complex literary concepts this was a good book.

I read Closed Circle first, which was great, but then Out of the Sun was incredible. This one, like all of his work, has a wonderfully crafted plot and excitement galore. Goddard is a hidden gem outside England, and that's a shame. If you don't know which of his books to buy, start with Past Caring and you'll get all of them after that. Goddard has quickly become my favorite author and I will gladly devour anything he writes!!"},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"This was my first Robert Goddard novel, and after reading this book in less than 24 hours I can certainly be considered a new fan.I simply could not put this book down. It did what every good thriller should be able to do -- transfix you and make you want to turn the page to see what happens next. It was the twists that kept me reading this book. However, they are not so frequent that you expect a twist at the end of every chapter. There are just enough thrown in to make you reconsider every time you think you've sorted out what is really going on.Reading the other reviews posted here, I was a little concerned about all the flashbacks that this novel uses. But upon reading the book I found it no problem at all. It is not overdone and they are all contexualised with modern day events. One will have no problem at all keeping track of things.I was glued to this novel for the better part of a day, reading it in very quick time. I simply had to find out what was going to happen next! If you like that in a thriller, then you will greatly enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"This was my first Robert Goddard book and I was pleasantly surprised. Goddard's writing evokes a sense of place almost as strong as those created by P.D. James. I don't think all of Goddard's characters are as well drawn as they might have been, but he does a good job with the Great Uncle, Christian, and Nicky. &quot;Simone&quot; is over the top at times, and her character stretched my suspension of disbelief pretty taut.The plot reminded me of LeCarre's &quot;Perfect Spy&quot; or Deborah Crombie's &quot;Kissed a Sad Goodbye&quot; with it's the twists and turns and links between the present action and the events of the past. I found it a challenge to keep things straight at times, but I anticipated almost every plot twist before it happened with a few exceptions, so either I'm pretty good at deciphering mysteries, or the plot isn't as confusing as some critics have suggested. I also think it helped to read the book in a 24 hour period.I recommend this book. It's head and shoulders above many other mysteries I've read lately by &quot;famous&quot; authors."},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"Another unique mystery from the pen of Robert Goddard, a writer who knows how to create thought provoking, absorbing stories peopled with conflicted characters, some-what flawed protagonists and descriptive images of the British countryside that are so vivid you feel an overwhelming urge to jump on the next plane and have a look for yourself.The story spans a period of time from the late 1940's to the early 1980's and examines the impact of a 35 year old murder on the two families directly involved. The characters expose us to the full gamut of emotions as they experience friendship, honor, lost love, avarice, hate, vengeance, and the strong antipathy between family members..........and...... as with many novels set \\"across the pond\\" money and social status are the name of the game and losing is not a viable option.The plot of BEYOND RECALL has as many twists and turns as a Grand Prix course with the same potentially hazardous consequences should a wrong turn be taken by our protagonist.The main thing I appreciate about Goddard's writing is that his stories are always logical in their resolution. No inconsistencies, abrupt endings or surprises out of left field. The solution was always there for us to see, it just took a while for it to come into focus."},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"Estranged from his family, Chris Napier returns home for the first time in years to attend his niece's wedding at the family estate Tredower House converted into a hotel in Truro, Cornwall. Unwanted at the ceremony, Nicky Lanyon arrives insisting to his childhood friend Chris that his father Michael never killed Chris' great uncle Joshua Carnoweth over three decades ago; although authorities hung the man for the murder insisting the motive was greed as he was about to be replaced as the heir.Nicky accentuates his point when he is found the next day hanging from a tree; apparently having committed suicide. As homage to Nicky and to alleviate his guilt having ignored the plea, Chris decides to investigate the 1981 homicide of Joshua though his preference remains leaving the past buried.This is an exciting tale of murder, blackmail, and avarice within an extended family as secrets from the past are slowly revealed. The story takes a bit of time to introduce the three prime interrelated families, but once it does the plot never decelerates as the tangled history is unraveled one dangerous thread at a time by Chris. Fans will enjoy this fine suspense thriller filled with twists and spins that shake the hero as he uncovers the truth.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"Have read all of Goddards books, and definitely recommend this one, (as all the others!).

Fast-paced, eintelligent, well-written and well-plotted...this author deserves a wider readership!"},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"This is a terrific, complex book. It begins with a suicide, not a murder, but that act of self-destruction opens a door into the past -- a past that is filled with murder, blackmail, inheritance, duplicity, and the hanging of a possibly-innocent man.As the book begins, Chris Napier, a childhood friend of the suicide, begins to explore the reasons for his friend's death. Chris is driven at first by guilt. He had let go of his friendship with Nicky years ago, when both were boys and Nicky's father was hung for murder. Chris hadn't meant to abandon his friend, but the murder drove a wedge between their families, and, finally, it drove Nicky's family to leave the area and take up a new life.Before long, however, Chris is driven by more than guilt. The original murder may be long in the past, but once he has opened the door, that past comes alive in the present. Chris digs -- he finds the retired policeman who investigated the case; an aged witness from the trial; a woman in a nursing home whose mind is sharper than anyone realized -- but at the same time, things begin happening in the present. Someone is stalking him.The story is incredibly complex, but absolutely believeable. In part, that's because each character is believeable. Not just the major characters, but each person we encounter. Each of those witnesses Chris finds, for example, has a real personality -- each has motives, foibles, and a life history that we glimpse in passing.Each witness that Chris uncovers adds a new piece of information to the story, and, with each new bit of data, the story takes a new turn. In some cases, the new bit of information gives us a rude awakening -- things are not what we thought. In other cases, that new bit of data casts new light and expands our understanding. The entire effect is that we follow Chris along -- darting back and forth between present and past -- and peel layer and layer back off the story until we have it all.I've read a few other Goddard books -- Hand in Glove an! d Closed Circle -- and they were decent books. This one is so much better that it could have been a different author."},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"A friend from Canada gave me 2 Goddard's for Xmas along with a clipping of an article by Stephen King listing Goddard's novels as his top \\"discovery\\" of 2008. I don't read Stephen King because the weird and horrible do not appeal to me. But that's not Goddard's style so I dove in. I've read 11 Goddard's since. The best so far is his first \\"Past Caring\\", but Beyond Recall is easily in second place. The others are all good stuff, but tend to run together in my mind. These 2 are truly outstanding. He is of course better known in England but that is sure to change."},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"Robert Goddard was recommended by Stephen King in a December, 2008 article ( Entertainment Weekly) of his favorite books for that year. This was the first book of his I read and now I'm on my second. The story involves a murder that took place over 25 years ago in Cornwall, England.

The Napiers ( the family of the murdered man) start to have bad things happen to the. Christian Napier is the lead of this story and he investigates the crimes of the past and present.Goddard writes very well. I was nevered bored.

A question that nags Chris and demands an answer when Nicky commits suicide. A question that sets Chris on a long journey through three families' histories and the ramifications the truth brings.Robert Goddard has written a twisting haunting tale of lies and intrigue much in the style of Kate Morton's The Forgotten Garden or Iain Pear's Stone's Fall. A good story that will linger long after the final page."},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"This book took some reading. I struggled on to 50% of the book before it became interesting. This book came highly recommended. I'll reserve my judgement til I've read another of his books. A slow starter but great ending."},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"Robert Goddard is an excellent writer who is expert in weaving intricate plots. This is a book that one is compelled to read from start to finish. I always look forward to Robert Goddard's next book, and &quot;Beyond Recall&quot; met all of my expectations."},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"This was my first Goddard book and I was pleased with the excellent plot and how he weaves the characters together. Is a tad bit dry and loses the supsense because the book starts out in current time and the rest is flashbacks until the end. Too many flashbacks used as well -- you find yourself having to organize yourself. A family tree would have helped too so that you can keep all the characters straight."},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"&quot;Beyond Recall&quot; is a well crafted story with a solid plot line. Goddard has chosen to use more flash-backs than usual. I don't like flash-backs but these are so well written they are not objectionable.

The book is a good read but does not rate 5 stars."},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"I managed to acquire a copy of this while in England over the Christmas holidays. I hadn't read Goddard yet but will now read his other novels. A wonderful mystery and a page-turner that isn't a mindless &quot;thriller&quot;. It keeps you guessing to the very end. I wholeheartedly recommend this when it become available here in the U.S.!"},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"Harsh, yes. Honest, very. I read the prior reviews and then bought the book anxious to find another great author. What I found was boredom and frustration, some red herrings, and a mystery not worth my time. The characters weren't in depth enough to feel for them, the forward in time back in time movement didn't work for keeping the story moving, and the story itself didn't hold my attention. I finished because I felt committed."},{"Title":"The Mode of Information: Poststructuralism and Social Context","review":"Electronic communications today have, according to Mark Poster, radically altered our discursive patterns, thus reconfiguring our perceptions of ourselves and our relationships with others. The Mode of Information: Poststructuralism and Social Context argues that \\"new forms of language wrapping are imposing significant changes in the social field, and that poststructuralist theory is uniquely appropriate to interpret this\\" phenomenon. This thesis is quite provocative, but Poster's delivery is somewhat uneven.An appreciation of this book requires at the very least a working knowledge of poststructuralism and the four theorists on which Poster focuses (Baudrillard, Foucault, Derrida, and Lyotard). Poster only rather briefly addresses the relevant theories themselves, and to a reader unfamiliar with the discipline, Poster's focus on application and his jargon-laden text will be somewhat inaccessible.Poster argues, as I indicated, somewhat unevenly. Much of the book is spent exposing minute shortcomings of Marxist, Weberian, and various other structure-oriented theories of communications, and the reader is often left wondering when Poster himself will articulate a theory. Therein lies a significant concern; Poster decries totalizing theories, arguing that such theorization is a feature of the \\"new, linguistically-based, structures of domination\\" in our contemporary society. Thus, the latter two-thirds of the book apply poststructuralist theory to individual forms of electronic communication, and Poster never provides a framework for understanding society as a whole.This, of course, is a hallmark of postmodern theory, and many readers will undoubtedly find sections of this book quite outlandish, particularly the chapters on Derrida and Lyotard. The chapters on Baudrillard and Foucault are, however, quite well argued and provide some excellent analysis of the impact of television advertisements and databases. The theses of these sections are relatively innocuous, and even a reader who strongly disagrees with the tenets of poststructuralism will find here something of value.Generally speaking, The Mode of Information will be welcomed by those who embrace poststructuralism and avoided by those who reject it. For the more ambivalent reader, Poster's book is a thought-provoking investigation into our contemporary means of communication."},{"Title":"The Mode of Information: Poststructuralism and Social Context","review":"Everyone who wants to understand how subjectivity, the \\"in here\\" of each of us, is shaped in the late modern age must read two chapters of this book. What McLuhan did for media, Poster does for information; he explains how databases and computer science set us up and bring us forth in their own distinctive ways. Saying he \\"explains\\" is perhaps too strong; the shaping of our \\"in here\\" is an elusive matter. But if you're looking to understand critics who complain that our everyday life is \\"informatized\\" and that the self is \\"multiplied by databases,\\" these chapters are superior to anything I've read eleswhere, especially given their brevity. The remainder --an introduction to post-industrial society and chapters on TV commercials and electronic writing--are excellent and will be useful to many.Poster's perspective is commonly known as \\"post-modern,\\" and he enlists four seminal thinkers to do the heavy lifting: Jean Baudrillard (TV commercials), Michel Foucault (databases), Jacques Derrida (electronic writing) and Francois Lyotard (computer science). Readers who are not familiar with this perspective or these authors may find themselves befuddled. Poster doesn't do much handholding; the book is a terse 150+ pages. To remedy this situation, readers may want to bone up with Robert HollingerPostmodernism and the Social Sciences: A Thematic Approach (Contemporary Social Theory)and/or Pauline Marie Rosenau,Post-Modernism and the Social Sciences.Once you're up to speed, anyone thinking hard about how the self, the hero of modernism, emerges within post-modern or more modestly late modern conditions will find Poster's slender volume an important contribution."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"The first fifty pages of this book sucked. I was ready to toss the book out the window. Good thing you can't open windows on the airplane.It's the first book in a series about the multiverse. It's basically a chain of universes linked together by portals with the same planet at it's center. At one end of the chain are the Arcanans, a universe where the code of magic has been broken and is used for everyday life. At the other end of the chain are the Sharonans. They use technology of the 1880's. The laws of physics apply in that neck of the wood. Except they have a high percentage of telepaths. The Sharonans are up to steam power and gunpowder and are working on oil.The two civilizations meet at one of the portals, which they call Hell's Gate because of all the shooting involved from both sides.Why did I hate the first fifty pages. My god did they need editing. It was page after page of exposition and tangents. Both authors felt the pressing need to tell us everything about everyone. I can understand the need to explain the world and it's people, but it never let up. They'd be in the middle of an action sequence and suddenly it was time to talk about the main Sharonan women's mother and father and how she was an ambassador to the cetaceans and how she lived on this spit of land near the ocean and there was a bell the dolphins could ring to get her attention and her father and it would not stop. You forgot what the hell was going on by the time you got back from the byway. It was like a first novel without an editor.They eventually toned the exposition down but it would creep in through out the novel. Isn't it better to do things in novels rather than talk about them?Eventually the action moved forward and the pace picked up. In the beginning both sides of the shooting incidents were good guys appalled by the bloodshed. Then the incompetents showed up to make the misunderstanding worse. It's typical Weber. There are only supremely competent individuals or supremely incompetent individuals. And if one of the Competents is in a jam, an incompetent will come along and make the situation worse. There are no shades of grey.Fortunately, before everything gets sorted out, opposing parties in the Sharonan and Arcanan universes see oppurtunities for advancement by escalating the conflict.The second half of the book was okay. There is a noticeable rise in tension. All the opposing sides are being drawn nicely. I'm just hoping they get a really good editor before the next book.And one last quibble, what's with Weber and his fascination with people carrying around pets? In the Honorverse, we had the Cats. In this book it's Birds of Prey. Why? Why do some people always have to have a semi-sentient familiar? Couldn't you find some other way to make the people stand out?"},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"I just managed to plod through this first of a new series, and I must say that I find it less than enjoyable. W Boudville's review of the book is quite appropriate here. I agree that it is much like the war in the Pacific, and most of his further description.My biggest gripes were the sheer complexity of the names: I could not keep track of them as I would have liked. And what makes this so perplexing is that the use of current time, volume, and distance are in our language, yet the names are not. This is a bit far fetched. Further, the lack of maps or indexes are frustrating, because the book is very difficult to keep complete track of all the kingdoms and worlds. Certainly not advantageous to a good series.Here is something that I did not see mentioned by others: the blending of fiction and fantasy. I am Not a fan of fantasy, so I find the use of 'magic' to be not to my liking. I will probably take a raincheck on further books in the series. I have been noticing that this blend of science fiction and fantasy seems to be going strong within the Bean Books world of late. Even John Ringo, and some others have preceeded Weber, and I have not bothered to take the bait there either. Sorry, but I will stick to more mainstream SF.Fortunately, I did not spend any money on this book, but checked it out from the library. Money well saved."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"As a few other reviewers have noted, this book bogs down repeatedly on endless expositions about the nature of the two different multiverses and their diverse cultures. The problem is that by the time you're halfway through the book you practically need a Clifnote edition just to keep track of who's who and what's happening next. And after what seems like the 37th exposition about how long it takes to travel from one end of the multiverse to the other it's to the point of \\"Get ON with it!\\"All in all, wait until you can pick this up cheap. It's not worth the full hardcover price; it's not even worth half that. Considering I am normally one of David Weber's biggest fans, that's saying a lot."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"I do, he's my favourite author - but this is terrible.There are too many characters with too many complex names. It reads like a rookie novel before the editor has been at it and cut down the cast of thousands. Consequently, there isn't enough room to draw any of the characters in depth and I can find little empathy for any of them.The whole premise of the book is high-tech society meets high sorcery society and the two end up going to war after a series of aggressive mistakes.Classic Weber we either have wonderfully competent characters or horribly incompetent/vicious ones. Don't mind that, I'm used to it, but - I guess my whole problem with the story is that it falls somewhere between two genres, sci fi space opera and proper fantasy. Now Weber has done both magnificently (if you're a starter to his work, try Path of the Fury and Oath of Swords for good examples) but the issue here for me is that the tech society isn't tech enough and the magical society isn't magical enough. They're both kinda somewhere in the middle and the result - is just a muddle. Half the time as the story jumped around I was trying to figure out which society whoever I was reading about happened to be in.A mess, Dave. I love you, but NO. Get back to writing more Honor/Bahzell/Alicia DeVries. Don't waste your time on this - PLEASE."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"I seldom buy hardcovers but I was waiting for this book so... I sprung for it and promptly regretted my decision. The book is overly concerned with minute details. D. Weber has a great story telling style but I cannot believe he had anything to do with what went on in this book. It was just a big setup for the next book with plodding asides, usless digressions, forgettable characters, this book has it all.The editing in the first 50 or 60 pages left a lot to be desired. All in all a tiresome read and certainly one that will color my interests in upcoming Weber books."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"What started out as an interesting idea turned into a chore to read. Whenever they threw in the made up names for the various places on the two \\"earths\\" the flow of the story came to a screaching halt with my mind struggling to put together the clues that pointed to where on our Earth the action was taking place.It was over 500 pages into the book before they described what the Arcanan military titles actually meant. Which is to say that the book was nearly done and they were still setting up the universe. You'd think that after 800 pages something would have been accomplished but it feels like it was only the prelude.The novel could easily have been edited down to half it's current length without hurting the story. I eventually just started skimming through the second half only stopping when interesting things were happening and I don't feel I missed much.I would not recomend this novel to Weber fans."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"I wanted to like this book. I REALLY wanted to like this book. From prior reviews and the plot description, it seemed to have at least the potential to rival Keith Laumer's \\"Worlds of the Imperium\\" series or H. Beam Piper's \\"Paratime\\" series.Instead, upon opening the book, I was greeted with a mass of made-up names reminiscent of 1940's SF--BAD 1940's SF--to the point where I was unable to figure out who was whom. Add to this a hefty dose of military minutae, rank titles that seem to have been borrowed from the Romans, and a plot that really doesn't move at any great pace, and no evidence of any divergent cultures (or any cultures) in the mass of parallel worlds and my disappointment only grew and grew. I found it difficult to identify enough with any of the characters to really care what happened to them, and totally confused by the alternate worlds setup and unable to see how it worked.This book would have greatly benefited from a cast of characters (as in Mr. Weber's \\"Shadow of Saganami\\") and a diagram of the parallel world branchings. If we could be provided with star maps in the Honor Harrington books, I don't see why such a diagram could not be given here.The Honor Harrington series now runs to eleven or twelve books, plus many short stories. If future books in this series are the same as this one, for the sake of both readers and trees, I hope the series will be a short one."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"If you've never read a Weber novel then I'd say the book rates 4 stars.If you were looking for a nice \\"young adult book\\" or you are into romance novels then this would be a good read...just take some tranqs first for the descriptive parts.However, were you looking for something on the lines of Mr. Weber & Mr. Whites' Starfire series, look elsewhere, this one is a bit of a letdown and is certainly not one of Weber's best.I don't know if Mr Weber just can't drop his previous series but the characters in Hell's Gate as well as the overall plot closely resemble that of the Honor Harrington series. Some other letdowns include:Quite bit of genre stereotyping (Dragons & Fireballs in fantasy settings);Badly mixed genres with improbable technology evolution (using computer terminology to describe Magic & define its structure, sorry Dave, Rick Cook did it already & much better);Dialog & descriptions written for teen & tween comprehension (I'm not trying to be insulting to the younger readers...its just the plot is a tad basic/contrived with very little subtlety);Repetitive dialog and an overabundance of setting description placed in inconvenient/odd moments (you do not describe a persons history, addendum, in the middle of a fire-fight, it detracts from the action sequence)."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"This is almost a first. A Weber book that I really didn't like too much (the other being Insurrection w/ Steve White). I don't know, it's an excellent premise (the Multiverse), but it's just not written well: It's a bit too slow and boring, and I felt that some of the characters were being led by the hand by Weber (meaning that they easily figured things out that should have been nearly impossible). Furthermore, there is way too much animosity between characters on one side of it (seems like it's the side that Linda Evans wrote, probably). Oh, well, hopefully he won't write too many more books that are as bad as John Ringo's stuff."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"As a long time Weber fan I was disappointed by this plodding, predictable and ponderous attempt. As other reviewers noted, too many \\"J\\" names and way to many irrelevant details, all detailed in exquisite...you guessed it...detail. Part of the problem is with the original conceit which is parallel universes. The problem arises with both universes being complex which makes for twice as much exposition....some of which is not altogether bad, but overall it makes for slow going. There were some incongruous moments, like the trip back to Arcona during which the two lead female characters are relaxing in deck chairs--just two babes catching some rays on the cruise home and they talk about....genetics. I guess exposition is where you find it. If I had it to do over, I would wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"This is the first in the \\"Multiverse\\" series by Dave Weber and Linda Evans, and is followed by the excellent \\"Hell's Gate.\\" It tells the story of contact and increasingly of conflict between two civilisations, both spanning multiple universes.Judging by the other reviews a lot of people apparently hated this: I rather liked it. Perhaps the problem is that it takes a long time to get going. Dave Weber and Linda Evans use a lot of pages to explain, first the setup of a highly complex set of universes, and second, how two universe-spanning civilisations, each of which comprises a majority of reasonably decent but fallible human beings, both come to believe that the other has attacked them.I found this story set-up interesting, others may not. However, without wanting to give too much away, if you are looking for the kind of action in many of David Weber's other novels, this series looks likely to deliver it big time in subsequent volumes, and \\"Hell's Gate\\" explains how that happens.To summarise the \\"Multiverse\\" opening position: between one and two centuries before the events of these novels, portals start to open between different versions of the planet earth - apparently between parallel timelines. Most of the different universes which are connected by these portals are not inhabited by intelligent life, but two have human civilisations. Both start to explore the new worlds to which their homeworlds are suddenly connected, and then each expands into these new worlds, experiencing over a century of peaceful colonisation and growth.There is an explanation given for the fact that for over a century neither civilisation finds other humans. It is suggested that different timelines are splitting off from one another like lines radiating outward from a central point in all directions, and similar timelines tend not to collide because they are heading in the same direction: hence when timelines do intersect they tend to be very different, e.g. so different that humans never evolved.But eventually these two civilisations do meet. On a world new to both of them, a lone scout from a military survey party of the \\"Union of Arcana\\" encounters a single member of an armed civilian survey party from the civilisation which began on the world called Sharona. Nobody, including the reader, would ever know for certain who shot first, because one was killed and the other mortally wounded. At first each side believes it has been attacked.Both civilisations now spread over hundreds of worlds, and their cultures have more in common than either realises, but their technology is utterly different. Sharona's is broadly similar to our science, and their engineering and construction abilities are in most respects about where our Earth was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including railways, machine guns and heavy artillery. They don't have radio but do not need it because their scientists have discovered how to train people to use certain psionic talents such as telepathy.Arcana, by contrast, has very little of what we would call engineering - the most advanced weapon they have which does not use psi-abilities/magic is the crossbow - but they have formidable weapons of a completely different type. Firstly they have trained creatures from their world, such as flying, fire-breathing dragons, which are just legends in ours: and their magical/psionic talents, while operating on different principles, are far more powerful than those of the Sharonians, and include the ability to store energy and information in crystals so as to be able to use them like a handgun or a laptop computer.So when these two completely distinct civilisations think that they have been attacked, each is able to inflict surprise after surprise on the other.Will the decent people who are a majority of both sides be able to negotiate a peace? Of are they doomed to a universe-spanning war?Before I read these books I thought they might be just another rehash of John Barnes' \\"Timeline wars\\" stories of the battles against the Closers (e.g. Patton's Spaceship etc). Having now read the first two \\"Multiverse\\" books I think that does Weber and Evans an injustice. If you do like Barnes' \\"Timeline wars\\" books there is an excellent chance that you will like this series but it's not just a rehash of the same idea, there are a lot of very original aspects to the clash of civilisations in these books.However, if you are the sort of reader who insists on lots of action - for example, if you loved most of Weber's Honorverse books but hated \\"War of Honor\\" or if you liked most of Harry Turtledove's \\"Worldwar\\" books but hated the \\"Second Contact\\" and \\"Homeward Bound\\" successors - then you may like the successor books but not \\"Hell's Gate.\\"Personally I greatly enjoyed both \\"Hell's Gate\\" and \\"Hell Hath No Fury.\\""},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"This book was a bit confusing at first, trying to keep the two cultures seperated (and telling the names apart), but it was really very good. So is Hell Hath No Fury."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"While I have only read a handful of the works by David Weber I was in an airport bookstore and saw this and thought to myself, why not? Unfortunately at times I found myself wondering, why did I?As many people have already commented the book is a bit how do you say...slow on the get go. Honestly it was really really boring and there was so much character development and back story that you sometimes forgot what happened at \\"Fallen Timbers\\" or to Sir Olderhan and his Shardoni throughout the book.While admittidly it was slow in the beginning, after having now read the second book in the series I understand why things were done they way they were in this first book. The character development is some of the deepest I have ever come across in a book and you really begin to feel some pretty deep connections with the main characters by the end of this story.However while following main characters is one thing, they have gone and personified the civilizations of Andara and Sharona in of themselves. It's difficult to pick which side you really want to win because of all the similarities to human history and fantasy.Ironically though some of the deepest aspects of this novel have everything to do with the development of the readers link with each civilization and the political, and human response to such a meeting. In the end I would have to say that this really was a great read!"},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"The end of the book set things up for Pearl Harbor of the Multiverse. Somewhere in the book the background became more important then the plot. I enjoy knowing the background of the characters and their universes but those of us who enjoy this type of fiction don't need overwhelming detail. If you read this type of fiction, you don't need to be convinced of every detail. You just except the world as created by the authors and enjoy the story as it progresses."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"To those who are griping about the amount of exposition, don't you think the introduction of not one but TWO entirely new universes might require a little bit of explaining? Actually there are more since it's a multiverse, but the protagonists are from the two main ones. See? It is such a broad new storytelling concept that even in a letter about it some explanation is required. I suspect the same folks would be complaining that there wasn't ENOUGH background if Weber had left it out and simply dropped dragons and spells on a reader who had just gotten used to a bunch of characters (in the OTHER universe) who were telepathic steam engine users. Yes, there are a lot of characters, but again, remember, two universes. Rest assured, these people are being introduced for a reason. Seemingly minor characters now will have vital roles to play later. Trust the author. He knows what he is doing. Has Weber ever disappointed you before?I found this novel, well, novel. It is a promising and entertaining beginning to a whole new series and I look forward to a long and enjoyable string of books set in this \`multiverse' that promise to stand up in quality and pure reading fun to the Honor Harringtons already on my shelves. I read through this book in just a couple of days and immediately ordered the next one. Let me assure you now; It gets even better in \\"Hell Hath No Fury\\". I am eagerly awaiting announcement of the third book in this thoroughly enjoyable new series and will buy it without hesitation"},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"I really like the Honor Harrington books! I bought the Hell's Gate books in hardbound because I like the Honorverse so much.Hell's Gate is a big disappointment. I finished the whole thing and I still don't have the characters straight. This is at least partially because all of them have difficult made-up names. Had I browsed it in a store, I wouldn't have bought it because of this. I bought Book 2 at the same time but I don't know if I'll ever read it! I wasn't involved enough in Book 1 to make it worthwhile."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"Weber and Evans have clearly put some thought into the structure of this plot. The book's title explicitly says it is the first of a new series. And without giving away any details, the book's end certainly cries out for at least a sequel.But there are deficiencies that hopefully will be corrected in later texts. We have two human societies, from different universes; and neither ours. To accentuate their alienness, the names of the characters are quite different from those of our English-speaking background. So no Ralph, Laura or Mike, for example. Hard to keep track of who is who. The book should have a list of characters. Much like Turtledove did in his WorldWar or fantasy World At War series.Another problem is a lack of maps. The plot imagines portals connecting Earths in different universes. An ant's trail of trajectories that is hard to keep straight. Not unlike what Weber had in his \\"In Death Ground\\" series, for spacefaring civilisations. But in those books, he furnished very nice maps that graphed out a network of portals. We could do likewise here, showing how the portals connect up.Which leads to yet another problem. In several of these Earths, they do not of course use our names for various regions, like North America, Arabia etc. You have to tease out from descriptions in the narrative where several places are. Another point of aggravation for the reader. It is really awkward to keep track in the context of our world, of the various locations.These problems will lead some readers to abandon the book early. Perhaps not you. But others. It unnecessarily limits the readership. The puzzling thing is why they were omitted in the first place. Both authors are experienced enough that they should have recognised the need."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"I couldn't read this book... 100 pages in and I gave up. A poorly written romance novel with an extremely thin science-fiction facade. Incredibly wordy, pages and pages which don't advance the story or character development one bit. You can skip 20 pages and not miss anything. Heck, you can skip 1000 pages and not miss anything... that's what I ended up doing. Scary bad. Yanking nose hairs en masse will get you to the same place for free."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"I read and enjoyed both this book and the book that followed in the Multiverse \\"series\\". However, what is the point of buying ANY book in a series that the AUTHOR HAS ABANDONED?

But this took soooooo long to even start to develop, that I lost interest. I couldn't even make myself keep reading it. If you like military scifi, skip this book."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"Interesting - at the start there were a couple of times I was going to chuck the book. I dislike books where the character's names are unpronounceable. But after a hundred or so pages I was hooked.

Then I tried to read it. I have been a science fiction fantasy fan going on 40 years now. After 30 pages I was so confused as to who,was who,as well as the technical, aspect of the story that I gave up. I mean multiverses were first encountered by me from H.Beam Piper, as well as other authors and I was able to keep track. Then you have the tech's from Sharona who don't have magic but are psychic and telepaths,give me a break. This book will soon be in the discount bin which is a shame as Weber is usually a good author."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"This is a lucid and gripping novel about parallel universes i.e. multiverses. Since the physical geography for each multiverse sounds like it's the same, a map would be a great aid to my visualization!The societies are complex as the story itself. I liked the premise that man is capable of bungling (and re-bungling) first contact and that war can explode, not from ideological extremes, but from individual mistakes. In a nod to current political machinations, we see an example of how circumstances gallop away from ones' original intentions.There are many characters and political groups in this book so it is a complicated read at times. However, once you can start to see the connections, all the background reading becomes worthwhile. A tree of both Sharonian and Arcanian societies and characters would be helpful.The depiction of the two universes and their technologies, both arcane and mechanical, is clearly delineated.Overall, this is epic scifi and a good start to a new series. I look forward to a sequel."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"In parallel universes, two humanoid cultures share in common the belief that they are alone as neither the Sharona or and the Union of Arcana have encountered any other civilization as they expand through their universe. The Sharona combine technology with some psionic abilities while the citizens of the Union of Arcana use magic as an everyday energy source.The Arcana have begun to enter portals that take them into the Sharona universe. When these two monolithic societies meet for the first time someone fires the shot heard around the multiverse. Arcanian expedition and military leader Hundred Jasak Olderhan is upset that his squad opened fire and hopes to prevent a war with the survivors of this other human species, but one of his soldiers Fifty Garlath kills an unarmed man. Soon the rest of the Sharonian party of all civilians is annihilated except for two that are taken prisoner, Shaylar and her husband, Jathmar. Now Magic and Science has collided with the first encounter being open hostility.This is a terrific opening of the Multiverse series that has two competing societies colliding with distrust and an inability to communicate. The story line is filled with action, but also provides the needed input for readers to understand and believe that Arcana and Sharona exist without choosing magic or science as being the more civilized. Fans of either author will appreciate this fine collaboration in which fantasy and science fiction blend delightfully into a strong out of space thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"I have been a fan of both authors and looked forward to this new series, but. While the book is tightly written and the characters are well plotted, there are faults. Or at least in my opinion.the book is long, extremely complicated, and because the setting is so different than the average readers background, hard to understand.Both magic and PSi powers need more explanation on why they developed rather than our industrial revolution type universe.No explanation of how these \\"gates-between-the-worlds\\" work is given; maybe both universes are too low tech to even try a explanation.On the whole, I can recomend the book for a light evenings read. I especially wait the next volume early in 07, maybe evething will be explained.Overall, despite the faults, a book well worth investing your time and money in."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"This series is off to a promising start, as Weber and Evans blend interesting characters with the somewhat unique scenario of the first contact between two cross-dimensional cultures, one whose technology is based on science, and the other whose technology is based on magic. The consequences of mistaken assumptions, compounded by all too human failings on both sides, are tragic and combative.The characters come across as being real people, although some of them are telepaths and others are magic users. I found myself caring about them and eager to find out what will happen to them as the series progresses."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"The Union of Arcana thought that they were the only human society which existed. They have expanded through naturally forming portals that link parallel universes. Of course, there was a prodical for peaceful first contact should they ever encounter another human society. Yet since no other society had even been found in their century and a half of exploring and mapping Multiverses the prodical seemed a mute point. But that changed the instant an Andaran Scout met a Sharona human. No one will ever know which man fired first.Hundred Jasak Olderhan was in command of the military unit exploring the new area. Not wanting a second disastrous confrontation and still hoping for possible peace, he began a hunt for the other humans and made sure his men knew not to open fire unless attacked. Unfortunately, Fifty Garlath disobeyed those orders and killed an unarmed man that had been trying to peacefully communicate with him.The other human society, Sharona, had been exploring the Multiverses for a long time as well. However, the Sharonian group was made up of civilians and their task was to simply survey and map. The group defended themselves well, but in the end only two survive and are taken prisoner. Shaylar and her husband, Jathmar, had been devastated as the fireballs rained down upon their small group. Shaylar established a telepathic link with another \\"Voice\\" (telepath) far away named Darcel. As Shaylar fought for her life and watched those around her burn alive, Darcel could See, Hear, and Feel everything as if he were there...until Shaylar was knocked unconscious.The Union society had been built with a MAGIC foundation and could not understand how the other society had survived without it. The Sharonian society had been built on a foundation of something called SCIENCE and knew nothing about magic. Neither society understood the other and events were beginning to roll out of control and into war!***** This is a blending of two exemplary talents by authors David Weber and Linda Evans that will have you begging for more. Having read both authors previously, I could often tell which author did major work on each section. However, there are several sections where the line between the authors blurred. As the reader, I was treated to intelligent tactical strategies and politics. Yet I could easily sympathize with the horror and grief both societies went through. The novel succeeds in telling the view from both societies, not just one. All-in-all, an outstanding beginning for what may very well be one of the best sci-fi series of the decade! *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"Great story, perhaps long winded setting scenes and characters, nevertheless i am eagerly looking foeward to the sequel."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"Well developed characters, a gripping plot, well thought out action sequences.

I'll be anxiously awaiting the next title in the series."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"Late 19th century technology and psychic abilities versus magic and dragons. That's what this book is about. Two separate civilizations, Sharona and Arcana, have been exploring empty parallel worlds until they very violently bump into each other.Now the first thing you'll notice about this book is that it is pretty long. Unfortunately two thirds of that length is little more that explaining, re-explaining, and re-re-explaining the various worlds, governments, etc. in the book. It starts off fairly slow, but picks up towards the middle, but then slows down again until the very end with a fullscale war we've been waiting for finally starting just as the novel ends.In general this book has a good idea for a story and what story is there is pretty good, unfortunately it gets bogged down in endless explanations and instances in which the viewpoint switches between three different characters to give three different viewpoints on the same experience or event. It's interesting, but we really don't need it to enjoy the novel."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"I am sorry for those of you who did not like the rather complicated but very interesting new world Mr. Weber has created.

There were a lot of characters introduced in very short order and I had to keep checking to see which side was being discussed. It made it confusing but after a while things started to click for me. I still really enjoyed it and it has much of the same feel I expect from Weber. When I re-read Honor Harrington books, I tend to skip all the politcal intrigue, discourse, and stupidity. I've read through all of that here in this book on this first pass through, but it was hard in this case because so much of the book was that sort of political maneuvering.Still, I am very much looking forward to the next one. Hopefully we won't be introduced to 27 new characters while still following the story of the dozen or so that we are currently interested in."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"This book is 800 pages long. I wonder if the writers were paid by the page and/or by the number of words. The only thing that actually \\"happens\\" in the book, covering at most, 50 pages, is two battles in the beginning between Arcana and Sharona. Arcana is a very advanced society based on magic. Sharona is technological, but for some unknown reason, is only at a steam powered level of technology. I don't understand why Sharona could not have had a 20th century level of technology. The balance of the book is basically 750 pages of conversations between the characters and some political manipulations. There is such a thing as having too much characterization. It was very difficult not to nod off during this book."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"I wanted to start reading a good series, so I purchased this book because of the past reviews on Webers other series of books.

But now I am feeling guilty about spending so much money on \\"Hell's Gate\\", and not finishing it. Don't spend the money on this book! It is not worth the pain and suffering."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"I love David Weber's work but I have put off starting this series for quite a while because I am miffed. I am waiting for the continuation of some of his other works, particularly the Honor Harrington series. I want him to get on with it. Now, having read this one, I have even more reason to be miffed. I have to wait for continuations of this series as well.The concept is a bold one. \\"Portals\\" allow transit from parallel versions of earth that are practically identical except for one thing. There are no humans. This has led to a plethora of resources as the new universes are exploited. Then comes the fateful day when it is learned that \\"we are not alone\\". There is another human civilization out there doing the same thing. This could be cause for rejoicing except that first contact does not go the way anyone could hope. There is shooting by two nervous individuals. It gets worse when an incompetent and cowardly officer becomes responsible for a massacre of a civilian survey party.The two civilizations facing each other have much in common. There are political considerations for just about everything in both home universes. This leads base men to make matters worse on both side.There is also much different. On one side, technology seems to be fairly primitive. Arbalests and swords are the normal armament. This does not prevent those using this technology in doing so most effectively but it is still primitive when compared to the technology used by the other side which seems to be on a par with the late Victorians. The real difference, though is in their respective gifts and talents. The more archaic civilization does not need the fancy mechanics because they have magic, complete with dragons, unicorns and such. The other side does not know how to fight this. For their part, though, the more advanced civilization makes use of psionic talents. Telepathy, precognition and related skills are a normal part of life for them. In neither case are these gifts and talents universal but they do tend to make the other side even more incomprehensible than they would otherwise seem.Weber and Evans have crafted a well thought out series of universes in this series. This initial book is basically dealing with the initial contact and the ramification stemming from that contact. The point of contact is a long way from the home of either civilization and the potential for unwanted strife is great. Weber and Evans make the most of that potential.I still want Weber to get back to work on the Honorverse books but I am going to cut him some slack because I want him to finish more of these as well."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"This has to be written by Linda Evans entirely - in my opinion: Not \\"David Weber & Linda Evans\\".The writing style has absolutely none of Weber's touch. Rather the writing style here is clearly based on the following philosophy and written word style:Never use one word when 1,000 words can be used; never use one sentence when 100 pages can be written; never have a clear and direct description when a meandering, redundant, over detailed background can be employed; and on and on and on and on and on.Unreadable.

It reads like a prose heavy version of John Ringo's council wars. Good concept, magic versus technolgy but not really fleshed out and the introduction of too many (at this point) extraneous characters who do nothing but talk about their motivations makes this a tedious read.

There's so much of it in this book that very little interesting actually happens. This book is effectively just the setup for the next book, but without enough story of its own to stand up as an interesting read. The resulting pacing is awful.Put another way, it is as if the series bible was spliced into the text of the book by mistake.Beyond that, there are too many annoying or uninteresting characters. Other reviewers's accusations of incompetent characters are on the mark.Bottom line: Overwritten, underedited. This has been a trend in Weber's recent work, but it is particularly bad on this book."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"There are some major flaws in this book and, sadly, most of them are easily fixed but were not.1) Terms, characters, names are all confusing to the point of making all but the most dedicated reader give up in frustration. Reading fiction should be a joy, not a chore.For example, \\"Chief Sword\\" is obviously (I think) a military title, but is it a PFC or a Major General. And what the heck is a \\"Hundred\\"???OR\\"The Five Thousand was too tough for any jaguar to eat, Sir. All I did was stop the bleeding.\\"\\"Most he could have expected out of you after he was stupid enough to step right on top of it.\\"Is the \\"Five Thousand\\" a title? I thought at first it was 5,000 of something. And what is \\"it.\\" he, she or they stepped on?It only gets worse. I gave up caring after a while.2) \\"....the Union of Arcana hadn't fought a true war in over two centuries.\\"Given this, the hair trigger that sets off the war is unbelievable. Frankly, Japan during the Tokugawa shogunate would make a better model. Warriors turned administratorsand police force rather than army.3) Garlath: A typical Weberian incompetent. And while I enjoy a round of liberal bashing as much as the next, this stereotyped \\"villain\\" has been used, overused and abused by Weber.And frankly it was completely unnecessary in this story. Given that the UoA hasn't fought a real war in 200 years, Garlath would have been better modeled after someone like G. A. Custer He'd have still been odd man out, a fire eating warrior in a land of administrators and the disastercould have been caused by his correct, well meaning and absolutely correct adherence to strict military policy that had been set down 200 years earlier. This would have not only been more believable, but would have allowed Garlath to have been a more three dimensional character, atragic figure rather than a cardboard character that was simply a cut and paste from almost every other Weber novel.4) The set up for the first encounter was weak, but not so off putting I quit reading. However the rest . . .Garlath was the only character who actually made sense AND was correct in his judgement (maybe we shouldn't be chasing these people so hard), but was shouted down, not because he was wrong, but because the authors had selected him as the bad guy.But, after a stupid, pointless chase (again, justified simply because the authors wanted it, not due to any internal logic) but, in chap. 7 Jasak (the titular good guy) puts Garlath (an officer that Jasak doesn't trust and several thousand words have been spent in characterizing as a cowardly incompetent) in the position of being able to cause a disaster. Is anyone surprised when the disaster occurs? I bet Jasak looks for gas leaks with a lit match too.5) Finally, several chapters later, we find out that the dragons the UoA use go berserk around the Sharona \\"psionics\\". And the authors never thought that this would make a perfect reason for the first tragic meeting between the two races? Or a better cause for the firefight that killed all but two of the Sharona than the simple minded use of Garlath? Or were they too set on bashingGarlath to see what they'd already written into the story?All of these errors (and many more) could easily have been caught and should have been caught by the authors, let alone their editor.This is so badly written I can't even recommend it as a library book. Instead, go read H. Beam Piper's \\"Paratime\\" series."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"I've read about a dozen books authored solely by David Weber - all of the Honor Harrington stuff and his \\"War God's Own\\" series. He's a masterful storyteller that doesn't get bogged down in the minutae of his characters and setting at the cost of the story. His trademarks are action, heroic protagonists that are larger than life, and a page turning pace. He usually accomplishes what he sets out to do... In his solo works, he usually nails at least two out of three of them.Linda Evans, on the other hand, drags a story down. She did it when she co-authored Road to Damascus with John Ringo. In both books you notice that the story lacks well paced action and that turning pages is tedious. A lot of text is devoted to superfluous description and is unclear about the timing of events in relation to each other. It's not that she's a bad writer. She's just lacking in some qualities that I like in my writing, and I feel that her relatively obvious contributions to the story make it drag rather than flow.The book itself is a fantastic concept and the concept of a science based world coming into conflict with a magic based society - without redoing something that's been done before - is frankly awesome... as a concept.The execution on this wonderful concept is far below what it could have been and I'll confess to being more than a little disappointed by it. I own it and have read it, and maybe I might pick up sequels, but I'm not recommending the series to friends."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"After reading Weber's Starfire series I was excited to pick up his new Multiverse saga. The premise was interesting: through the use of portals that lead to a parallel Earth two human civilizations had grown into vast empires spanning multiple worlds. Sharona who built their empire on technology (equivalent to late 19th century) and Arcana who built their empire on magic were both exploring a new portal when they ran into each other.Magic was to be pitted against technology, each civilization frightened and confused by the other's means of war. The obvious question to a meeting of these cultures would be \\"what would happen?\\" The answer: absolutely nothing.Because nothing is exactly what happens in this book.There is so much time spent on describing landscapes, characters feelings and expressions, what they're worrying about and the different cultures that the story devolves into long diatribes that fail to catch the reader's interest in any way. And it goes on, and on, and on. I'm talking pages, not paragraphs. In the first two hundred and fifty pages there were about fifty pages of genuine, useful and interesting material.Normally such long descriptions can be forgiven if the characters are interesting or there is a good amount of action happening. Unfortunately you get neither. The characters get old quick and a few only get more annoying as the story progresses. When you want main characters to perish and they're not the antagonists, there is a problem.In my other reviews I give a good sized summation of what happens in the novel, but frankly there isn't anything to talk about. Put simply, most this book is filler. After their chance encounter which leads to a brief battle, members of one are captured and as soon as word gets back on the encounter that occurred, both sides race to find what happened and mobilize forces preparing for the worst. Essentially, it's a setup for the next novel.Some reviewers are saying the reason Weber spends so much time is because he has two vast empires with varying cultures he needs to explain, but even then it doesn't justify how much he talks about them. He goes into too much detail, much of which is of no consequence later on. This isn't a valid excuse for the amount of time he spends on it given he managed in his other books to develop background in mere fractions of the space.This review is entitled \\"Don't Bother\\" because that's what you should do. Extended periods without anything happening, uninteresting characters and a good premise that is completely wasted don't make this a worthwhile read, especially at over 1200 pages. I've heard the second book is better, but after reading the first I have no inclination to pick up the sequel regardless of positive reviews. If you called this review brutal and excessively negative I wouldn't disagree, but why should you waste your time like I did?"},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"To some reviewers, all good and bad qualities of books exist on a gradual scale. Some drawbacks are almost always balanced by some advantages, and vice versa. Other reviewers recognize one (or more) Unforgivable Sin, and if the author commits it, then it does not matter how good the rest of the book is -- into trash pile it goes. In my case, One Unforgivable Sin is \\"forcing a conflict through contrived stupidity\\". The author needs to stage a fight between two groups which have little or no logical, or even ideological, reasons to fight. He forces them into war by making sure that initial contact, and a good deal of subsequent contacts, are run on both sides by self-important moronic bureaucrats. They create an (entirely avoidable) disaster of each contact, and the whole thing snowballs into war. The war in Hell's Gate could easily have been averted if someone competent and open-minded (and there were plenty) were in charge during any of several encounters between two sides -- yet somehow it was always the worst donkey. Result -- war nobody needed except the author.I did not finish the book, and will certainly not read any sequels."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"And so begins what is obviously going to be another super-long series by David Weber. If you're a fan of the Honor Harrington series, you might like this. I say might because as my title suggests the book is just one long back-story designed to set the stage for the rest of the series. I'm a fan of military sci-fi so I enjoyed the battle scenes but there are only two of them!The authors lack sophistication in their writing. Every time a new character is introduced, a long detailed background is given, no matter what was happening at the moment. Weber and Evans also seem to feel some weird compulsion to detail every single religous and political event of every society introduced in the story. At times it feels like you're reading a textbook for History 2100. I've always disliked the way Weber wrote dialogue and this book is no exception. Linda Evans seems to have learned writing at the same school of \\"Psuedo-Victorian Dialect\\" as Weber did.With the Harrington books I would plod through the boring parts but I found a new way of coping with the uninteresting parts of this book: I skipped them. I probably skipped about half the book in total. Luckily for me I work at a book store so I signed the book out for free. My suggestion to anyone considering buying this would be to get it free or just wait till the second book comes out."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"There is, at most, about a hundred pages of story here. The rest is filler and padding designed solely to make you buy the next book. You get to the 52nd chapter and after all that it stops as the action is about to begin. Harrington regulars will recognize familiar hall marks from the latter half of that series. A strong female lead. (Two of them actually.) Smart animals. Equivalent but not equal technology. Corrupt officials back home. Two powerful empires, one of which is (conveniently) significantly more evil and stupid than the other - just so you easily know who the bad guys are. If you really love the authors books and must buy it - buy it cheap. If not go straight to the second in series which begins (as this novel should have) by dumping you straight into the action."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"Now despite being billed as \\"A War between Science and Magic,\\" it would behoove the reader to know that the last battle between these two cultures occurs on page 350 thereabouts. The problem is, its an 800 page book, and the only thing that happens for the rest of the 450 pages is a severe amount of preparation in character backstory and motivation for the rest of the series. Knowing Weber, this is to be expected for him to plant seeds here that wont pay off for several books down the line, as he does that unceasingly annoyingly in his Honor Harrington novels, making the reader wait YEARS to see where things are heading (while pumping out about 5 OTHER books between each Harrington novel). For this book, as a reader, I was constantly thinking, \\"Thats Ok and all that, but where's the war?\\" Then we get to the horrible disappointment of the ending, to find out that there ISNT one, and we have to wait for Book 2 to see anything interesting.GOOD NEWS IS, that Book 2 will hit you like a thunderclap, with the big showdown between the dragons and the howitzers that we were promised in Book 1 finally arriving in a huge flying monster vs industrial war machine free-for-all. This should have been the ending to Book 1, and judging by the size of Book 2, only HALF the size of this one, it very well likely may have been, becoming a 2nd book in the editing process.Just keep 'em coming at a quick clip. I can handle these waits as long as we get a steady stream of sequels. Book 2 had better have been short for a darned good reason, such as Book 3 being 800 pages or more...

There's no need to fight each other; trade works much better. And there's no point in fighting over resources when the resources are unlimited! Just find another portal to a new world.I gave up on it just after the two cultures meet. A pointless story."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"I really like the setting of this book. The multiverse thing is interesting and the differences between the civilizations are really cool. The story is pretty good, but all too often relies on there being far too many idiots or bad men in important positions. There were just too many POVs, however, for me to get hooked. I would describe the novel as event-based, rather than character-driven. All of the important, but improbable events that take place rely on a bunch of little POV shifts. I would have preferred to stick to just a handful of important POVs.I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure I could recommend it."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"I've never read David Weber or Linda Evans before picking up this book.

For the life of me, I just don't understand why the response has been so lack luster from the Sci-Fi Community as shown by the low ratings here on Amazon.I read a book a week and I blazed through this book in two days and boy was I bummed out to learn that the Series is in limbo pending his finishing up writing the SafeHold Series which looks like its going to take a decade to finish at the rate he's going :(Mr Weber and Ms Evans, if you somehow stumble across this review, I implore you, I beg you with all my heart and soul to please finish this series."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"Why has David Webers recent books all been terrible? I don't know but I wont be buying them anymore. I couldn't even finish this one it was too tedious, and I pride myself in being able to finish the most boring of books. Oh well."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"Where have all the editors gone?I get that David Weber is one of the crown jewels of current authors. Any publishing house would love to have him on board, slap his name on books (as I strongly suspect they did with this one) and watch the books fly off the shelves. That doesn't excuse them from doing more than just printing words on the page. Publishing houses have an obligation, a duty even, to reigning in the author when gets off track. Having spent four years working my way through this book, I can only conclude that the publisher and the its attended editors did the same thing I did. They started the book, put it down, hoped everyone would forget about it. Sadly someone remembered, and rather than struggling with finishing their editing of the book, they just threw their hands up in the air and said \\"Sure its find, send it to the presses\\".This book is another of the \\"Good idea's gone bad\\" sequence that seems to be cropping up more and more. Here we have two worlds, exploring other worlds via gate that transport you instantly from one world to another (though it may all be the same world geographically). One of the origin worlds uses technology, the other magic. They encounter each other, and due to Weber's stereotypical type casting go to war...Its got possibilities. Maybe. Well, right up until the guys with magic realize that technology works for them. Then they've got guns, bombs, and magic. But still, it could be entertaining reading about it.Only it's not. Its long, meandering, and boring."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"Parallel universes have been a source of plots for science fiction novels for generations. This book is one of those attempts at exploring that interesting concept. In this case, a civilization has evolved and found portals to parallel universes appearing at random. The other universe is the exact same planet as the initial one (and in all cases, it is geographically the same as the earth we know) but the portal location is not the same on both sides. So, for example, if the portal is north-facing in New York, it might be southeast facing in some remote region in the equivalent of China. However, since the world is the same, the mineral deposits and other natural riches are in the same places thereby providing an incentive to map out the new world and claim the known gold, coal, and other deposits as soon as possible. Also, there might be portals to yet another parallel universe somewhere in the new world, with its own gateway to yet another new world, and so on.The question asked here, is what if there are two different civilizations that both are doing the same thing and suddenly meet on one of the newly discovered universes? To complicate things a bit, let us assume that the cultures are different but somewhat equivalent in size and sophistication. To make that happen, let us assume that one is technologically advanced (up to the level of 1880 in our world, roughly), while the other relies on magic and magical beings (Dragons, Unicorns, and the like). So, what would happen when first contact takes place?This book supposes a series of events that are misinterpreted by both sides that lead to a war of the different civilizations. Which means that we can explore what happens when magic fights technology, etc. Both of these concepts are very interesting and should have lead to a book that was difficult to put down with lots of exciting action and fun reading.But that is not what happened to this book, which is why I only give it three stars in this review. The co-authors are clearly intending this to be the foundation book of a whole series of follow-on novels. And therefore are simply establishing the concepts in this introductory one. The trap that they fell into, though, was to focus so much attention on the descriptions of the two different societies and how they are organized, and what their differing developments are, that there is very little action in this book. Essentially, beyond the initial encounter, we find two skirmishes and then are teased into knowing that a battle is about to start as the book ends. While that would have been Ok in a book of 200 pages or so, this particular tome is over 1200 pages in length!The second major problem is that the authors decided that we need to understand a lot of background material, and they are very, very verbose in their descriptions. As an example, quite early on it is obvious that the world they are describing is the same earth that we all inhabit, but they take a 30+ page detour at one point to describe each of the countries of one of the two cultures. Since they cannot use earth-names (like Ireland, Italy, or Mexico), they describe the geography in great detail so that you get it. Thirty pages of geographical description which devolve to where some minor countries in that culture reside, is about twenty nine and a half pages too many. I wish the editors of this book pointed this out to the authors and forced them to cut out all of that unnecessary fluff and boring descriptive passages.Another problem is that the authors decided to get cute and keep the parallelism going to what I consider to be excessive extremes. Both cultures appear to have the same abhorrence of war and its destructiveness, as they both are horrified when civilians are killed. Not only that, but there is exactly one woman civilian on each side who is - of course! - very prominent and well known and loved. So, when they are either harmed or affected by the skirmishes, the whole culture that they belong to vows revenge. Then we find on each side that there are young men who are in the military who are the heirs to the crowns of the leading empires on both sides. Both of then, of course, are involved to some extent in the initial fighting and both of them, of course, are beyond nobel, smart, and do no wrong. Many other officers in either military are portrayed as being either completely stupid, or having other motives beyond what is obvious. I presume that any follow-on novels will explore this in more detail as there is certainly fertile ground laid for all kinds of additional stories and storylines!My final comment about the excessive length of this book is that the authors use this book to explore and explain what they do not like about different societies that exist in today's earth. That added way too much excessive baggage to this book, which added to its length, which makes it difficult to read and enjoy.In summary, while the initial idea and plot are interesting, this book fails to keep your interest through adding way too many details and political, geographical, historical, and cultural explorations that burden it too much."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"Not great, not bad..sort of in between.

However, if you want character development, love politics, religion and military strategy mixed in with science and magic this series has the potential to keep you turning pages."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"While I've never actually read any of the other works of either author, clearly they are both quite creative. The copy that I had must have been the edited edition because I didn't notice any of the terrible editing many other reviewers have alluded to.The first thing that struck me was that it was an extremely creative setting. \`Portal's' between alternate Earth's and the two, very complete and complex cultures that explore them as well as the descriptions of when these cultures collide, is certainly original in my experience.The characters, while a little too stereotypical - most are close to simple archetypes such as the noble warrior, the loyal wife or the paranoid dictator, are generally good; if a little plastic.However, the bias the authors show both for and against some characters is something I find particularly galling. The ham-fisted approach of getting bunches of characters to all repeat again and again what the reader is supposed to think is not worthy of authors creative enough to create such a setting.Where I disagree with many of the reviewers is at the pace. I found the exposition and explanations of the cultures as interesting as the military action. I guess I just don't need to hear about combat to make a book interesting.I gave it four stars and would have given it 7.5 out of ten."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"After 600 pages I've decided to put this book down, which is surprising for me considering its a David Weber. The book has all the essential characters, villians, heros, techonology, magic but missing an editor.There are chapters of explanations of characters families, where they lived what lived with them, how they lived which just plain bogged things down.The characters re-actions to events or situations just didnt seem plausible. One of the main characters , Jasak's interactions with the 'enemy'(Shaylar and Jathmar) appeared more like a girl scout view rather than a career military man. He felt infinite empathy and sadness for his prisoners, who he didnt know anything about.Also the use of adjectives got a little rattling, characters regulary felt 'fury' white-lipped fury, raging fury and simmering fury where a few of the terms liberally used, which irrated me for some reason.If you like David Weber I wouldnt pick up this book.Which is a pity, because the fundamental story is good although more into the fantasy genre, and the characters, plots and twists could definately work.

It is fantasy, with one side in the conflict using magic, and the other having telepaths and ''technology'' on the level where a revolver is considerd high-tech.

It CAN be done! Unfortunately, it hasn't been done lately, and Hell's Gate is perhaps worse than most of his recent books. The whole problem is, David Weber doesn't seem to be able to restrain himself from wandering off into excruciatingly excessive detail. Maybe he needs an editor with a good supply of red pens. Maybe he needs a co-author with a \\"won't take no for an answer\\" attitude. What he REALLY needs is a LOT fewer words!Hell's Gate would have made a totally excellent 300 page book. Alas, it tops out at over 800. And it was so utterly avoidable. Do I really need to know the tiniest detail of how train lines are built in the multiverse, and how long it takes, and gosh darn it, everything but the crew members mothers' maiden names? Nope. Just tell me it's gonna take a long time to get where they're going cuz the train line isn't built yet, then get on with the story. It's a really good story, for the most part; there's just not enough of it.Oh, there are a few annoying little things....like, could he have possibly given one more major character a name beginning with J? It gets a little confusing. Is this the J guy who's married to the girl? Or is the the J guy who's the nobleman...in the OTHER universe? See? It gets confusing. And there are out-of-place feeling things like the media people in both universes. It's like the horn telephones in the Flintstones....investigative reporters are part of OUR reality, not the reality of the multiverse. It's jarring enough to shatter the illusion and make the reader work harder to stay in that willing suspension of disbelief. Since the reader is already working hard enough just trying to remember the plot line during pages and pages of digression, this just doesn't seem fair.Will I buy the rest of the series. Probably. Like I said, there's a good story buried in there. I just wish I didn't have to work so hard to dig it out."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"I have been an avid reader of David Weber's military sci-fi, especially the Honor Harrington books. I have, however, also noticed that when a book by a well-known and rightfully popular author appears with a secondary author, the work is invariably sub-standard. This is the case, unfortunately, with this book. This is the first book purportedly by Weber that has failed the 20-page rule. The prose is best described as turgid. It is disappointing to see his name on this book, as it doesn't live up to the books I have come to love so much."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"As a fan of Weber, I expected a good read from this book. High tech meets magic. Grim battles, political maneuverings, the works. Unfortunately, this book is a series of slow-moving descriptive text with a few short battles and a smidgen of political maneuvering wedged in. After the twentieth or so painfully detailed description of just how angry the citizens of one culture were at the other, etc, I think the readers got the point.

About 50 of the 1205 pages have some action.

Hell's Gate has no ending; it just stops in mid-scene. It might as well say \\"Continued in Sequel.\\"Weber's usual strengths are here -- the characters are deep and real, appropriately motivated whether they are admirable, evil, or dolts.

Although this book has excellent action sequences these are separated by page after page after page of meandering prose that gives the term 'expository writing' a bad name. Clearly, the publishing house editors have lost control of the authors here. You can get through this book and have a petty good grasp of the situation by skimming along and actually reading about one page in three. I think about 20 percent of the text could have been eliminated if they had just included a few maps. At the very least would if have killed them to include maps of the Sharonan and Arcanan home 'Earth' equivalents? Fortunately, the book doesn't cost more than a normal paperback.It's a shame because the characterization is pretty good and the plotting has some interesting twists and turns.

But each book in a series should be self contained. I think it is unconscionable for the authors to write an 800 page book (far too long anyway) with essentially no ending.

Two civilizations are expanding through the multiverse via interspatial gates on their home worlds when they meet in the universe soon to be known as Hell's Gate.In this novel, two men from different universes encounter each other in a newly discovery universe. Both have standing orders to avoid hostilities, but each takes precautions that alarm the other man, leading to them simultaneous firing at each other. Both hit their targets, but the man from Sharona is only severely wounded by the arbalest bolt and manages to evade the Arcanans until returning to his own party. The civilian survey party promptly leaves their encampment, taking only essential supplies and the interspatial maps, and head back to the entrance portal and its fort.The Arcanan soldiers find their man dead in the stream shortly after the incident. He has been shot through the heart with a heavy rifle. The Arcanans backtrack the Sharonan to his camp, but it is deserted when the Arcanans got there, yet the evacuation path is quite clear. The Arcanans follow the Sharonans and catch up with them at Fallen Timbers, a clearing in the forest caused by a tornado. There the two groups had a final shootout.Ecah group has weapons unknown to the other party. The Sharonans have firearms -- both rifles and handguns -- using chemical propellants. The Arcanans have arbalest -- crossbows -- as well as crewserved magical devices shooting fireballs and lightning bolts. Neither have any electronic devices, but the Arcanans have Personal Crystals -- magic balls -- that function like personal computers and the Sharonans have Voices who can contact each other over long distances.Commander of Hundred Jasak Olderhan tries to keep the confrontation from becoming violent, but Commander of Fifty Shevan Garlath starts the firefight by shooting Ghattoun chan Hagrahyl with his arbalest as the leader of the Sharonan survey party rises empty handed to try to parley with their pursuers. Garlath is promptly shot multiple times by the survey party, but the Arcanan soldiers quickly retaliate and their flame weapons begin to take out the survey party.The only survivors of the Sharonan survey party are Shaylar Nargra-Koymayr and three badly burned men. Magister Gadrial Kelbryan recognizes the probable relationship between Shaylar and her husband Jathmar Nargra because of their identical wedding bracelets and uses her meager healing talents to treat Jathmar. Since this healing exhausts her minor gift, the other two men die of their wounds.After Hundred Olderhan gets his wounded men, Shaylar and Jathmar back to his base camp, he is promptly relieved by Hundred Hadrign Thalmayr as originally planned and Thalmayr disregards everything told to him by Olderhan. Jasak waits for his men to return from a reconnaissance of the Sharonan base, but eventually is forced to return to the fort. Thalmayr is still at the forward base when the Sharona relief column finds the portal and manages to get himself seriously wounded and many of his men killed by his arrogance and incompetence.Shaylar and Jathmar are taken back toward the center of Arcanan civilization. However, her telepathic report of the incident at Fallen Timbers has already enflamed most of the Sharonan people. Her experiences are relayed to Sharona in their totality, with her feelings coming through vividly. As a result of this shared experience, Sharona gains a world government in only a few weeks.This story is full of fools, mostly in the Arcanan military, but some on the Sharona side as well. Some on each side were deliberately trying to fan the flames, with their own agendas leading them into folly. Others lacked imagination and often refused to believe the reports until they found themselves in deep trouble. Both sides march directly down the path of folly.The Arcanan military has a transportation advantage, since they can use dragons for airlifts and tactical fire support, but they know nothing about the railroad equipment available to the Sharonan military. The Sharona military has a strategic advantage in their telepathic communications, but knows nothing about the various enhanced animals -- including dragons -- available to the Arcanan military. Both sides are beginning to understand each other, but each has surprises in store for their opponents.Highly recommended for Weber & Evans fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of military conflicts, exotic Gifts and Talents, and a touch of romance.-Arthur W.

And personally I'd rather have a book with an extra 100 pages then leave you in the dark about a great many facets that are in this story.Other then that major concern, I found that I really connected with the characters in this story, and I found they really had good character depth. By the end of this book I felt pissed that Shaylar and Jathmar weren't returned and that this whole war was spinning out of control.Overall, I found this book even with its drawback of a bit too much back-story to be thoroughly exciting and I can wait for future books in this series even if they have the extra 100 pages of back-story. If you've got the least bit of patience then do your self a favor and get your hands on this book. I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"Start with the very standard idea that a multiverse exists in which the universe has repeatedly separated into different alternates in which the same event has different outcomes. Now add a much rarer twist - contact is possible between universes with common history tens of thousands or more years in the past, but not with more recent ones. Gone are the \\"Nazis won WW II\\" or \\"Roman Empire still lives\\" contacts. Instead, humanity finds a chain of Earths in which there are no humans, but which are in an \\"Age of Mammals\\" which is pretty much as that period on our Earth was pre-human.Such a scenario allows for contact between (and clashes between) two human cultures which have developed in vastly differing manners - one discovered technology and the other magic. Each approach blinded its adherents to even the possibility of the other way of life.Further, to make things more even, the technology people have not yet achieved flight or radio communication, but do have railroads, steamships and late 19th century artillery and machine guns. Further, they have some psi \\"Talents\\", which may eventually balance the \\"Gifts\\" of the magical adepts.Both civilizations have been actively spreading through the chain of alternate Earths, without meeting other humans, until they meet in a world newly discovered by both and far from the home world of either. A clash ensues, started by accident, but fed by paranoia, incompetence and egotism.A interesting twist is the existence in the technology world of a pseudo-British Empire (headquartered in Ireland, so not quite British) whose past resembles Rome and its Byzantine avatar (including a clone of Constantinople as its past capital) - they even have \\"joint\\" sovereignty over pseudo-Gibraltar - and a psuedo-Ottoman Empire (\\"Othmaliz\\") whose Constantinople-clone capital is the site of the world conference called to address the crisis resulting from the clash of cultures. Why create a history very different from ours and then copy details of our history into the new history? Since that is what happens, I suggest the reader label a blank world map with the local names from the story to keep track of what's happening on \\"technology Earth\\" (\\"Sharona\\" - incidentally, Weber's wife's name is \\"Sharon\\").The early section of the book, is, as other reviewers have mentioned, disjointed and hard to read. I almost gave up. After the first 50 or so pages, the story becomes much more interesting and is hard to put down.The scenario has potential for a long series of high quality stories."},{"Title":"Hells Gate :Multiverse 1","review":"Hell's Gate by David Weber and Linda EvansBook one of the Multiverse series is a most engrossing 1200 pages. Evan's and Weber portray two unique civilizations on a road to conflict. Arcana bases their technology on magic. Sharona has psychic talents but bases their technology on science. The multi-universal aspect is that both civilizations have discovered portal to alternate earths that have no populations until they confront each other.David Weber and Linda Evans do a superb job in describing two dissimilar cultures and those cultures' idiosyncrasies. As they alternate back and forth from culture to culture you find your sympathies vacillating as well. The beauty of their work is that you truly find things that are both laudable and stimulating for each culture. They are being drawn into conflict by serendipitous contacts and malicious behavior in spite of their root similarities. I can not wait to read the next volume, \\"Hell Hath No Fury\\".I highly recommend it and all of David Weber's Work."},{"Title":"Pocket Bible Dictionary: Nelson's Pocket Reference Series","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Meanwhile let us read this present dismal history of one of our early colonialist enterprises as if well and truly limed by this Oxfordian scholar Raymond Carr, chosen by the editorial team as one who bears no ideological ax to grind, and thus published by the academic Vintage Classics in its Twentieth Century Fund Study series.This thick 500 page study serves the interests of every researcher from neophyte to the field to those seeking a valuable, reliable and comprehensive resource under one cover for any academic and historical purpose.As the Director of the Twentieth Century Fund, MJ Rossant, explains their difficulty a quarter century ago in selecting a researcher for this project who had not already made up their mind regarding the relationship of the USA with Puerto Rico: \\"The major problem in mounting a Puerto Rican study had been the difficulty of finding a scholar whether Puerto Rican or American (sic - Puerto Ricans are US citizens and America encompasses an entire hemisphere of separate nations, Rossant himself displays prejudicial thought patterns and set political paradigms in this one word) who had not already made up his (sic) mind about what the relationship ought to be. The Puerto Rican scholars, I must add, are even more committed to specific points of view than Americans (sic) perhaps because nothing is more important to them than the US relationship with Puerto Rico. Our solution, arrived at after careful deliberation, was to interest an English scholar, one who could handle the peculiar history of the Puerto Rican - US relationship with dispassion and sensitivity, in the project. In Raymond Carr, a (sic) historian noted for his work on Spain, now Warden of St. Anthony's College, and formerly professor of Latin American studies at Oxford, we found the ideal choice for the assignment (p. viii).\\"Overlooking for now the underlying and fallacious misconceptions evident in that statement, let us see the back matter which states: \\"In its depth and insight (this work) is certain to prove a major contribution to the resolution, not only of the growing controversy over the political status of Puerto Rico, but of the larger problems of colonialism and imperialism in the modern world.\\"Although such a \\"resolution\\" is even further off now than ever, unless through a deeply undesirable violent revolution or further unsustainable military occupation, we find in this scholarly analysis of a quarter century ago important reflection for our current position not only in our expensive and fruitless Iraqi efforts, but also in our so-called \\"free trade\\" agreements which destroy local independent farmers and industries, and in fact evidence the effects of multinational for profit corporations and globalization as a whole. Despite the rather fallacious selection of the author by the editorial team, whose continued anglophiliac and colonialist subservient mindset should be obvious to all in the contorted quotation cited above, one may discover here an important and highly recommended study which we do well now to read again. Let us free ourselves from our own continued colonialist oppressive mindset which entraps us unto emperor worship of the British throne most embarrassingly revealed in the Torry Bush regime, and let us liberate as well those whom we ourselves oppress. The greater and more difficult liberation of mind which we require is in believing ourselves superior to other nations in any way."},{"Title":"Queering the Pitch: The New Gay and Lesbian Musicology","review":"Queering the Pitch is the first anthology to be published in the new field of queer musicology (although it does draw from works like Solie's &quot;Musicology and Difference&quot; collection.)The quality of the fourteen essays here varies greatly. Some, like Philip Brett's &quot;Musicality, Essentialism, and the Closet&quot; are absolutely earthshaking-provacative, well-written, and inspiring. Other essays seem a bit out of place, and show how much work their needs to be done in this field. It occasionally feels as if the editors had to scrape around to find enough material for the collection.The three editors, all well-known musicologists, are to be commended for this effort. The book is already something of a classic, and has certainly helped to legitimitize this field of inquiry."},{"Title":"Queering the Pitch: The New Gay and Lesbian Musicology","review":"I love this book. The style is approachable and dynamic, and the ideas are still exciting ten years after the book was published. The authors cover a wide range of topics both historical and contemporary and come from different theoretical stand points. The articles not only focus on composition and performance but also on listenership and the gendered power relationships involved in that. As a first year postgraduate student involved in gay and lesbian studies of music I found this book inspirational and invigorating because of the high quality of scholarship involved. Queering the Pitch is a much more interesting read than several more recent collections of queer musicology because of the strength of the ideas involved but especially energetic and transparent writing styles which avoid the stogyness that musicology can often suffer from."},{"Title":"Daughters of the House","review":"This is not only the story about three daughters from an aristocratic family in Victorian England, but a detailed and well documented insight into a changing family in a changing society as well as valuable insight into English history.Starting with The Great Exhibition in London in 1851, we follow the three daughters of the Vestrey household as they choose entirely different paths in life. One of the girls rises to the ranks of the Royal Household, another models for the Pre-Raphaelites and defy her family in a dangerous affair.But perhaps the most interesing of the three is Caroline, who joins Florence Nightingale as a nurse in The Crimean War. In fact, the book tells a lot about Florence Nightingale as a person and her extraordinary work laying the ground rules for warfield hospitals, rules which are as up to date and useful today. Actually, as late as in the Iraqui war, the American health force used Florence Nightingales's basic rules as their main guidelines for setting up an American war hospital.Nicola Thorne has a fantastic ability to write both entertaining and highly interesting and educational books. In this book, in addition to the personal stories of the main characters, the reader gets a wide insight into the political situation in Europe and the background for The Crimean War, as well as social life in England at this particular time.Nicola Thorne is a highly intelligent and knowledgeable lady and a remarkably gifted storyteller. (She was born in South Africa, educated at London School of Economics and is now living in England.) To be entertained and taught at the same time is a most wonderful experience. At the back of the book there is an extensive list of literature referring to people and events in this novel - and I have personally been most keen to read more about Florence Nightingale.I would like to give this book my warmest recommendations, as well as all Nicola Thorne's books, both in older and contemporary settings. There are lots of contemporary novels, preferred by many readers.Due to a car accident, Ms Thorne is no longer able to write a new fictional book, but she has given us an extensive production to choose from. I urge new readers to get to know her, and \\"Daughters of The House\\" is a brilliant book to start with."},{"Title":"The Detox Book: How to Detoxify Your Body to Improve Your Health, Stop Disease, and Reverse Aging, 2nd Edition","review":"I discovered this book about 12 years ago at my local library and decided to read it.

It really has just about everything you would need to know about the subject. Aside from a couple of minor typos, it's extremely well-written and engaging. What's really nice is that the author covers all the bases...I was left with very few unanswered questions after reading the entire book. I've just completed a fast, kidney cleanse, and liver cleanse and everything that was mentioned was right on the money. My eyes have brightened up tremendously and a fibromyalgia-type pain and numbness in my leg that has been bothering me for several months gone. One thing that was unexpected is the psychological effects that its caused as well - just astounding! My overall mood (which I thought was pretty good before) has improved, my ability to cope with stresses is increased, and I've shed myself of some addictive behaviors (completely quit smoking - it was on its way out the door before - and totally lost any desire to drink alcohol). One caveat...this is no quick fix, it really does require a lifestyle change. However, in one review they mention that the author says not to eat meat at all and pushes a vegetarian agenda. This is not the case. The author simply says that the amount of protein that we consume is far in excess of what is necessary and recommends cutting meat down to smaller servings 2 or 3 times a week (and only organic meat, the fat which is in all meat and dairy is basically a toxin sponge)."},{"Title":"The Detox Book: How to Detoxify Your Body to Improve Your Health, Stop Disease, and Reverse Aging, 2nd Edition","review":"I did the oxygen therapy and it is amazing.

I feel incredible almost immediately! The taste of the food grade hydrogen peroxide is awful to me, so I plug my nose when I do a few drops in PURE juice like apple or cranberry and drink it. The juice has to be pure, no sugar or anything. It took any pain I had away within minutes. You can feel the oxygen go through your body.

ER doc said that I was not having heart attack. Doc suspected a gall bladder problem instead. I was given an ultrasound of my gall bladder, & the pics of the ultrasound showed either a gall stone or \\"sludge\\" (a real medical term). The ONLY solution, according to ER doc, was to have my gall bladder removed. I was then given names of surgeons who were in my medical plan. ER doc said there was no other remedy (even though the ultrasound pics were not definitive). Having detoxed my gall bladder decades earlier on different recipe which I could not find now, I used the recipe from The Detox Book which I recently purchased-- it was very easy to do for me, no bowel distress at all, unlike my former recipe. Noticed much of this \\"sludge\\" come out in the toilet bowl. I then went to see my personal doc. I gave her copy of the ER report and told her of my detox. She ordered a more complete and exact pics of my gall bladder. Results: gall bladder is totally normal; No need for any follow up.She had no comment about the detox.NO JOKE. Buy this book!!! Read it.

It would take pages to describe the health benefits and DRAMATIC improvements it helped me achieve the first time and on all occasions since then. I am 52 now and was heading for a wheel chair 10 years ago, before I read his book. I am getting ready to start my tenth (approximate) liver cleanse. I need to repeat them every six months (probably due to a very high heavy metal burden, partially chelated). I do a second cleanse each time (3 weeks later). The improvements are fantastic each time. Only one failed in all (the latest), because I was very acidic. I had acid reflux and after drinking the olive oil/grapefruit drink it just sat in my stomach. What did I do wrong? I did not follow the recommended diet this time. Ate too much meat AND, drank beer! Big NO NO that put me in an acidic state.Please don't --DO NOT-- listen to those who say that cleanses do not work, or who complain that the \\"stones\\" are just saponified oil. I am not a lab tech, chemist, physician, scientist, etc. and am not qualified to say what they are or are not. What I am qualified to say is \\"so what!\\" I am qualified to say that within one hour after drinking the very first oil/grapefruit drink 10 years ago, the horrendous pain in my shoulders disappeared for the first time in 3 solid years. I could not lay on my right or left side without horrid insomiac inducing pain. I had horrible neuralgia in my arms from my clavical to the tips of my fingers losing feeling in my arms all night long as I repeatedly went through endless cycles of falling to sleep and waking to numbness in my arms that turned into shooting pins and needles and aching deep arthritic pain! I am qualified to say that my asthma, carpal tunnel, arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, to mention just a few of a long long list of improvements also disappeared! So whatever those little pebbles are that exit my body, be it stones or compacted olive oil they ARE somehow are responsible for seemingly incredible changes! Don't listen to those naysayers, they are misleading or mislead. We are out here experiencing these life changing improvements. We are not making these things up. There are too many of us saying the same thing.I never write in forums or make comments but I could not pass this up. I am writing to help others, but even more to thank Bruce Fife for his hard work putting together this exceptionally readable and easy to understand book. I have studied health and nutrition since I was 18 and was aware of many of the principals in his book but there were many gaps in my understanding especially many of the whys and wherefore's. His book helped me fill in those gaps and helped me to see the need to perform these series of cleanses in logical order, for optimal results.Up to now I have felt more like the NINE unthankful lepers that Jesus asked about in the gospel of Luke (17:11-18) than the ONE that turned back after being healed by Jesus, to glorify his father and thank him. Jesus asked \\"The ten were cleansed, were they not? Where then, are the other nine?\\" Bruce Fife is a skilled N.D., and deserves expressed appreciation from all who have been helped by him. Thank you Dr Fife and bless you! You have helped me eliminate a great deal of future pain and suffering."},{"Title":"The Detox Book: How to Detoxify Your Body to Improve Your Health, Stop Disease, and Reverse Aging, 2nd Edition","review":"This was carried in a health store but I got it for less on Amazon.

Friends and co-workers keep commenting on how healthy and radiant I look and they have all ordered the book.

It lists out specifics such as which preservatives to stay away from and which foods to eat on a regular basis (Natural Foods diet). He even talks about the benefits of fasting and the juice diet which was all new to me and very interesting. My major complaint is that all of the main points are restated 4 or 5 times. It can get frustrating reading the same thing over and over. Then, some really interesting points (like the fact that cola soft drinks can deplete bone marrow) are understated and can be missed if you're reading too fast.

Get the good stuff in. Give your body the fuel and tools it needs to work at an optimum level. Good food, nutrients and all the proper vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Make sure you aren't deficient in any of the major nutrients as the different nutrients all work together.B. Get the bad stuff out. Make sure your body can detoxify out all the toxic substances and toxic by-products of bodily processes properly. Stop as many toxins from getting in in the first place, and do a detoxification program to get rid of the ones you have. Stop doing or eating the things which cause inflammation and have a pro-oxidant effect, and so on.C. Reduce your body's total load. The total load concept is that lessening the body's overall burden/work and stress level in one area, will improve health generally and improve the body's ability to heal because the body's total load (or burden) is lessened. Fixing one problem frees up bodily resources that can be then be used to help other parts of the body function getter or to heal. In other words, you need to look at the body as a whole in order to heal, and not just the one part of the body that is generating the most symptoms.This book discusses subjects such as environmental pollution, nutrition, fasting, juicing, oxygen therapy and sauna therapy, enemas, exercise, and kidney and liver cleansing.This book is helpful to some extent and quite good in parts, and of course the theories it talks about have a lot of merit and are very important to read about, but I found it nowhere near as detailed and thorough as the books and websites listed below. It was good in parts but nowhere near the best book available on this topic, in my opinion. It provides a very brief and simplified overview of the topic that may be and probably is very useful for newbies, but for those serious about this topic and dealing with serious disease it lacks depth and breadth.It also lacks documentation to some extent.To get good information on healing reactions and detoxification for free online, check out the website of Dr Lawrence Wilson. To read books on this topic see books by Dr Lawrence Wilson (the book on hair mineral analysis and the one titledSauna Therapy for Detoxification and Healing) and Dr Sherry Rogers (most especiallyDetoxify or Die).These books contain not just far more detailed information on detoxification programs and sauna use, but also far more cautions and information on avoiding problems - which this book very much lacks.This book also lacks any type of serious discussion of nutritional supplements and testing and the importance of correcting serious nutritional deficiencies BEFORE putting the body under the stress of a detoxification regime. This is a very serious oversight. Just eating well is not enough, especially if you have gut issues affecting nutrient absorption as most ill people do and especially if you have had these issues for many years, as many people have. This book needs a lot more focus on 'getting the good things in' through diet and also through supplements. Supplements are necessary where illness is long-term and severe and so this information is vital. Detoxification will not be very helpful and may even be dangerous if these gut issues and nutrient deficiencies aren't dealt with first.(I also disagreed with Fife's opinion on the superiority of vegetarian diets, the 'dangers' of saturated fat and the recommendation of a high carbohydrate and lower calorie diet and comments about how eating sugar wont make you fat, but eating fat will. For more information on these topics I highly recommendGood Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health (Vintage)andKnow Your Fats : The Complete Primer for Understanding the Nutrition of Fats, Oils and Cholesterol. It turns out that 'calories in, calories out' is just plain wrong!)Highlights in this book were the section on how nutritional deficiencies during different stages of pregnancy affect different organs in the foetus, the discussion of life expectancy vs. lifespan and how we have been misled on this issue, and why we need to boost our immune systems to beat super-bugs rather than focus on developing new drugs that the bugs can become resistant to. The 'real age tests' section was also interesting, as were the comments on healing reactions and the importance of healing fevers, and why homogenisation of milk is even more harmful than the pasteurisation of milk.Fife writes, 'True life expectancy hasn't changed for 3000 years. People didn't die of old age at 45. Sanitation and less early childhood deaths has raised our life expectancy, but not our lifespan.'This book is an excellent beginners guide and may do very well for those that are healthy and want to stay that way but it should not be the sole source of information for someone that is seriously ill and trying to regain their health as it lacks certain elements that are vitally important.Far better Fife books to buy are his book on coconut oilThe Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil)and his book on healing reactions titledThe Healing Crisis, both of which are excellent.BTW I'm writing all this as someone that that is slowly improving month by month from a very severe neurological disease - thanks in part to the work of Dr Rogers and Dr Wilson and others like them - that has left me housebound and almost entirely bedbound for many years. I wish so much I had had this information early on in my disease, rather than coming to it more than 10 years in. Healing is so much easier the earlier you start it.Whether you choose this book or others on the topic what is important is that you read as much as you can about this type of medicine if you are ill as it really is the only way to really get yourself as well as you can be, and to prevent further problems arising.Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

It has a lot of do it yourself help pages that are easy to understand. This is a must book to buy."},{"Title":"The Detox Book: How to Detoxify Your Body to Improve Your Health, Stop Disease, and Reverse Aging, 2nd Edition","review":"Having read a few of books written by Fife, I can tell he is a staunch believer in eating very puritanically. At the end of the day the decision is yours on how steadfast you choose to be in how you eat:I think it is commendable if the person makes the change from junk food to whole foods and that in itself is what makes a massive difference to a person's health. I like to think I am sensible so I have made my own decision as to how far I will take the author's advise. I love my fish and seafood and will not be cutting that from my diet. I don't eat alot of meat but I do like grilled turkey steaks so yet again, this is not something which I am willing to cut from my diet as I don't eat it often and I feel having a balanced diet for me is important. I don't eat organic food because it is far too expensive, however I do practice common sense and wash and peel everything I eat. And since I buy my water in a plastic bottle and consume it in a water bottle this is not something I will be changing anytime soon.A bit of common sense and discernment goes a long way for doing what works for you. While there will be people who will follow Fife's every word exactly as he has advised I doubt doing so will garner greater results than choosing a middle path of a moderate way of eating healthy.While the information in these such books might be interesting please keep in mind that the author has written the book to make money,(if distribution of information were the author's main priority he would be offering the books/information free of charge) so ultimately if you are unsure whether you are 100% healthy before starting a detox,it is best to check with your health practioner first.As I have discovered (despite feeling very healthy and having never had any major illnesses) the detoxing process in whichever form it comes in is never as straight forward as these books make it out to be because everyone is different.These type books on the market cater for one size fits all.Therefore I think these books should be read as a reference only and could perhaps be inspirational and motivational to prompt a change in diet and lifestyle, but it is always prudent to contact a naturopath or nutritionist to ensure that you are following a plan that is right for you, your health and body, EVEN IF YOU FEEL HEALTHY!"},{"Title":"The Detox Book: How to Detoxify Your Body to Improve Your Health, Stop Disease, and Reverse Aging, 2nd Edition","review":"Although I am still reading the book I find it to be very informative and very well written.

Although, I do not agree with 100% of what it says, I really have learned alot and it has prompted me to purchase several other books to learn more about this. Definitely worth reading and keeping on hand, if you are new to this and want a general overview and some advice. I refer back to it on a regular basis."},{"Title":"The Detox Book: How to Detoxify Your Body to Improve Your Health, Stop Disease, and Reverse Aging, 2nd Edition","review":"It's a shame that I only pull this book out when I can tell I'm a little \\"off\\" somehow. I've honestly had great success following various cleanses outlined in THE DETOX BOOK. I am indebted to my mother for owning a copy of this book while I was younger and still living at home, where I first enjoyed reading through it; I bought a copy for myself and find it just as invaluable now. I've gone through liver detoxification, juice fasts, a gallbladder cleanse, parasite cleansing, kidney cleanses... there is a definite sense of clarity that comes one or two days into a juice fast, it's indescribable how good you feel! Individuals who are more \\"toxic\\" may have bumpier roads ahead of them as their bodies are cleansed from the inside out (and individuals who have never fasted or cleansed before should probably let their physician know before they attempt such things), but Fife discusses possible, uncomfortable side-effects of such activity as well--so there are no surprises. It would make sense to follow the cleanses outlined in the order they are presented, although I will admit that I never have, and I personally have felt no ill-effects because of such. (I do think I am generally healthier than most, however, and younger than many so perhaps my whole body system can afford the cut corners in ways others may not.) I believe that THE DETOX BOOK is perhaps the best and most thorough book on natural health and healing methods that I've ever read, at least the most useful! Nevertheless, I will say that I don't cater to some of the dietary limitations that Fife espouses for general health (during a cleanse of course I alter my diet as necessary for the cleanse/herbs to be most effective). I perform and feel best as a 'carnivore' but eat whole foods and grains, legumes, organic vegetables, fruits, and et cetera in addition to the grass-fed meats I enjoy, the occasional fast-food notwithstanding. And as a recreational athlete I do think the extra animal protein is helpful for me and perhaps more necessary than it would be for others of different body types and lifestyles. Still, Fife's guidelines are good starting points and I appreciate how he encourages the consumption of complex carbohydrates, which are so often shunned in this era of no- and low-carb dietary plans. Humans are easily omnivorous and to ignore an entire macronutrient category, with all of its inherent vitamins and minerals, really does an individual a great disservice."},{"Title":"The Detox Book: How to Detoxify Your Body to Improve Your Health, Stop Disease, and Reverse Aging, 2nd Edition","review":"I bought this years ago and can't believe I'm now commenting on this.

Other than that it was in simple language and easy to follow - not to mention making perfect sense: in a very small nutshell - eat what is not processed, and if it's not organic, peel it first before eating. There is lots of other enlightening information about shellfish and what types of fish to eat/avoid, problems with certain meats, types of oils to avoid and use, water and air purifiers, things you can do for your body to help with cleansing, etc. If I followed the detox programme the author mentioned that I'd become sick, and boy did I ever. My body was getting rid of so much built-up toxins that I was flat out in bed in a sweat for two days solid. I knew it was coming and why, so I didn't bother with doctor visits or pills to stop the fever, which would stop the detoxification process. When the fever broke I sat up in my bed and could only blink my eyes as I was so shocked how great I felt, even sitting there in a sweat-soaked t-shirt, I never felt better. Although I have waned from eating properly again and I feel tired and drained most of the time through poor choices with my diet, my New Year's resolution is to follow Fife's detox programme again and this time, make a lifestyle change with it, rather than a temporary fix.

I've actually implemented much of the advice given, such as the All Natural Diet. This book has a lot of really good, useful information, and I was very enlightened on the chapters about fasting. I plan to try my first fast in the next week or so.My biggest issue with the book was some of the unrealistic and biased information the author gives. For example, the author is clearly a vegetarian. While I have nothing against vegetarians, I do love my meat, which he suggests people should not eat at all. He also suggests that people should not drink water from plastic containers, or eat food from cans. I use broths from cans all the time. I've never seen broth sold in glass jars, nor do I have the time to make my own broth. He gives a lot of very enlightening information on the hazards of eating fish. Much of the world's fish come from polluted rivers, streams, and bays, so it makes sense that the fish themselves are polluted. But I think most people know the health benefits of eating fish. So this was a confusing point for me. In general, he suggests eating and drinking only those foods that are completely toxin free, which in our world is virtually impossible.If you are a carnivore, and you can look past the author's anti-meat campaign, as well as many of the completely unrealistic suggestions on eating/living toxin free (e.g. no water from plastic, no food from cans), the rest of the book should be very interesting and helpful."},{"Title":"The Detox Book: How to Detoxify Your Body to Improve Your Health, Stop Disease, and Reverse Aging, 2nd Edition","review":"This book was very helpful during my first body cleanse.I especially liked the chapter on the healing crisisyou go through while cleansing.

I highly recommend this book. I'm studying to be a Naturopathic Doctor, and did many years of research before choosing this route. This is a book I still pick up a couple of years later.

Chesterton probably know him for his novels (The Man Who Was Thursday), his stories (The Complete Father Brown Stories (Wordsworth Classics) (Wordsworth Collection)), and his non-fictionORTHODOXY). Even the fans may not be aware that his chief profession in life was as a journalist. Indeed, Chesterton wrote a stunning 3,000 columns during his lifetime. Many collections were published at the time, and others have been added since then. It is said, by the true fanatics, that all 3,000+ are quite good. I wouldn't know, since I've only read a hundred or so. But I can say this. Among all essay collections by any author that I've ever read, \\"Tremendous Trifles\\" is the best.\\"Tremendous Trifles\\" is, to put it simply, a series of reflections on everyday life. In \\"The Twelve Men\\", Chesterton recounts the story of his call to jury duty. Being chosen merely because his name starts with 'C', he ends up hearing the case of an accused bicycle thief. \\"We did indeed, well, and truly try the case of the Crown versus the defendant in the issue of stealing bicycles, and we concluded, after much debate, that the Crown was in no ways implicated.\\" Several cases later, Chesterton has an epiphany and realizes why we need juries rather than judges. To professional judges, judging seems ordinary. Only a jury of normal citizens can remember that putting men on trial is an extraordinary thing to do.In \\"On Lying in Bed\\", Chesterton reflects on the ceiling, and the joys of observing it from a bed. In \\"The Extraordinary Cabman\\", he tackles the philosophical question of whether anything is actually real, and answers with a definite yes. It's hard to pick the best essay in a collection like this, but I can definitely pick the best title: \\"The Advantages of Having a Broken Leg\\". But regardless, every essay is well worth reading, and the whole book is a worthy addition to any library."},{"Title":"Tremendous Trifles","review":"2009 marks the hundredth anniversary of this book from 1909, which is a collection of columns the author penned for a British newspaper, the Daily Mail. As such it's a mixed bag; some of the writing is, in my view a 3, and some a 5, thus my rating of a 4. Sometimes I don't know what he's talking about. Other times I find myself quoting a paragraph in an e-mail. This book contains my first encounter with Chesterton, a brief essay called \\"On Lying in Bed\\", which I still think one of his best. But when I began this book, although I avidly devour G.K.'s novels, and some of his nonfiction, like Orthodoxy, this one didn't hold me.I returned to it now and then, as one does, after reading rather more gripping reads. Then its magic kicked in, and in my view, some of the later essays, particularly those that are travelogues, are the best. Other readers will have their favorites; some of mine are:\\" The advantages of Having One Leg\\"; \\"The Twelve Men\\"; \\"The Wind and the Trees\\"; \\"In Topsy-Turvy Land\\"; \\"The Tower\\"; \\"The Orthodox Barber\\"; \\"Humanity: An Interlude\\"; \\"The Little Birds Who Won't Sing\\"; \\"The Travellers in State\\"; \\"The Prehistoric Railway Station\\"; \\"A Glimpse of My Country\\"; and \\"The Ballade of a Strange Town\\".That's my dozen keepers from these 39 essays, a rather good haul from a book a century old. The difficulty in this volume is that the references, as in most newspaper columns, are to current controversies, culture, and even jokes of the day. The reason this book celebrates a centennial when so many others of the era are forgotten, is because for Chesterton, those passing fancies, all the rage at the moment, are signposts to conditions common to humanity. That's why he remains so quotable. But neither did he write vaguely about universals; he observed and commented on particular people and places in his time. That's why he remains readable.Few read the sort of column collected here in our day, and fewer now write it. What one notices on reading any Chesterton, however, on dipping into any book almost anywhere, is his delight in living, and looking, and reuminating. This is not a self-help book, but any reader who helps him or herself to it, may be helped regardless, to see more, and enjoy life more. Because his message at bottom is it's OK to enjoy life, to see it as a good gift, to be thankful and revel in it. This is not the frantic optimism of a prescriptive self-help book. To Chesterton, it's simple realism. As he writes in \\"The Ballade of a Strange Town\\":\\"The false optimism, the modern happiness, tires us because it tells us we fit into this world. The true happiness is that we don't fit. We come from somewhere else. We have lost our way.\\" A hundred years later these words still ring true. Which is why we're still reading him."},{"Title":"Tremendous Trifles","review":"I have read some of G.K. Chesterton's fiction and religious non-fiction but had never read any of his newspaper articles. These reflections cover a variety of topics -- mostly light.

I recommend this book to anyone who wants to see another side of Chesterton's interests and writing skills."},{"Title":"Tremendous Trifles","review":"This is a compilation of essays written for his newspaper column. I am always impressed by his poetic and detailed descriptions of the world around him. He covers a variety of subjects and always turns the observations about life into truths that I did not expect.

Each story within the collection is short, maximum 4 pages, and they get right to the point. However, like any great story, they save the best for last and you will find yourself looking forward to reading the last paragraph within each story as it is truly the best and most invigorating. Chesterton's control of the English language is stunning and his direct matter of proving a thing is awe-inspiring. If you're a fan of his other works, you may like this one even more because it doesn't take as long to get the same great Chesterton-messages out of the reading. I give this book 5 stars because it really is wonderful when you don't have all day to read, yet still want to learn something or be motivated that the world is not all bad throughout the day.

The book contains little mathematics, but what it has, is well chosen.Like many biographies of mathematicians, the books errs a little on the side of excessive hero worship, and as such it gives a somewhat simplistic and distorted view of Coxeter's contributions to mathematics and his status in the mathematical community. In particular, the supposed opposition between Coxeter and Bourbaki really misses the mark; and the portrayal of Jean Dieudonn&eacute;, a truly inspirational intellectual, is very shabby.While the book isn't a scholarly work, it is nevertheless very well documented. The book has lots of interesting information, particularly on Coxeter's early years, and his connections with Buckminister Fuller, and Escher. And it contains interesting interviews with numerous mathematicians. Above all, the book is well written and entertaining. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"KING OF INFINITE SPACE","review":"An enjoyable biography of one of the 20th century's great mathematicians. It shines is in its description of Coxeter's interaction and influence with other luminaries including Veblen, Wittgenstein, Lefshetz, Conway, Escher, Bourbaki (the author holds back for a while, playing into the deception that Bourbaki is a group, not an individual), Buckminister Fuller,Hofstatderand others. The time at Princeton has its moments but at best Coxeter was at Fine Hall at the same time as Einstein and Von Neuman, but that's about it.The book does drag when it delves into his marriage to Rien Brouwer and his politics. Coxeter was a pacifist but an armchair one. His most dramatic act was to walk out on a talk at Hart House by George H. Bush along with about half the faculty. It picks up again when discussing the relevance and importance of his work to such diverse areas as logistics, immunology and molecular structures, telecommunications, string theory and ultimately the shape of the universe. Geometry is incredibly important to physics as parallel to every symmetry that you find in n-dimensions there is believed to be a corresponding conservation law. They become one and the same.As I grew up in Toronto and was a student who took several courses in the Math department at UofT I found it interesting how Coxeter had in various ways indirectly affected my own life. As a teenager I spent many happy hours figuring out magic squares and other puzzles in his edited version of H. Rousse Ball'sMathematical Recreations). I still have my copy of Father Magnus Wenninger'sPolyhedron Modelswhich I used to create numerous stellated polyhedra and hang them in my room and give them as gifts. Father Wenninger corresponded with Coxeter and is mentioned in the book, however you need to delve into the End Notes to get more of the details. Coxeter had already retired when I entered the University of Toronto. Apparently he was glad that the department had hived off Computer Science. I wound up with a minor in Applied Math and was not required to take a computer course, though I did learn SPSS in order to chug out statistics and that proved to be fairly useful.There's some good understandable coverage of some mathematical concepts such as Coxeter numbers and diagrams. Siobhan Roberts communicates the sense that Coxeter kept the field of geometry alive, but the lack of successors is troubling.Coxeter's life message would be about the importance of diagrams and visual geometry as a foundation of Western intellectual thought. He apparently disliked computers and never learned how to use one though there is one short excerpt that says that he set a problem for his calculator - either it was a TI programmable, or he did a combinatorial calculation and had a great deal of faith that it hadn't died on him as it worked out the answer overnight. What I find paradoxical about this is that towards the end of his life (and he was quite active) some of the most interesting descriptive work in geometry was in computer generated graphics for GIS, Engineering and Film.In classic tradition the Quadrivium - Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy and Music along with the Trivium - Grammar, Logic and Rhetoric, formed the basis for a liberal education. As the book notes, we've somehow lost the idea that Mathematical Thinking is part of that. Looking over my eldest's options for electives in University I was appalled to find that other than an Astronomy course there wasn't a single course in Math or Science offered. More Coxeter, please."},{"Title":"KING OF INFINITE SPACE","review":"Welcome!

Thereza, my mom, noticed my curiosity and decided to take advantage of the opportuntity to teach me about numbers as much as she could using the measuring tape. With my mom's help and using a simple measuring tape I learned to add, subtract, multiply and divide. From there on and until later in college, numbers, and later mathematics, were an integral part of my life. As time went on, my love for mathematics waned. Eventually I embraced a career in software engineering. Although I never lost my love and passion for it, I have not been able to connect with it all these years.Around one year ago, a friend of mine mentioned this book during a casual conversation. I bought it and let it sit on my books to read pile for almost one year. I packed it as I prepared for a trip to India. Half way through the trip I finish whatever I was reading and started on it. Starting on page one, I was totally enthralled. It took me a while to understand. Now that I finished it I know.Geometry got me going. Slowly but surely it was replaced by Algebra, which was the focus of my studies during my college days. The New Math of the sixties and ealy seventies was the ultimate expression of this movement. I remember a scene in college where an Algebra teacher told me I had no future in mathematics after I asked me to explain to me the practical applications of some complicated theorem she had just completed to demonstrate. That was the turning point. It became clear to me that, regardless of my love and passion for Mathematics, I had to go. And go I did! So have gone millions of kids who are born bubbling with the desire to learn the world about them, are endowed with the geometric instincts to do so, but are also robbed of this opportunity by the austerity of the analitycal thinking imposed on them by the dry algebra based mathematial curriculum of nowadays.Coxeter biography brought it all together for me. In addition to chronicling the life on an imensily interesting man, it also provided me with an incisive look at what happened with Geometry in the early part of the twentieth century and how the analitical reasoning required for Algebra replaced the intuitive thinking required for Geometry on our curriculum. My poor Algebra teacher had been a victim and with her a number of students that need an intuitive perspective to comprehend the complex Algebra before us.Coxeter lived to prove her wrong and to rekindle my passions. This biography is well written, anyone with a modic level o interest can enjoy it. Those with lingering and unspent passions will feel compelled to learn more about his works and contributions to Mathematics and society.I have a very hard time to finishing reading certain biographies. Coxeter's was one of them. No matter how great the life, it has to come to an end, and I struggled with it for quite some time. Coxeter will be with me for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"KING OF INFINITE SPACE","review":"Biog of Coxeter, a Canadian professor who flourished in the 1960s and was famous for having 'saved geometry'. Famous amongst mathematicians, at least. His books were and I expect still are on university maths reading lists. The authoress is Canadian, and it's her first book. It has to be said she hasn't been bold in her comments. For example it's not entirely clear what Coxeter's life work really amounted to. Nor does she try to tackle the highly disputable elements which seem taken for granted by these people, on such things as multiple dimensions and groups (defined in ways not in conformity with the usual meanings, I'd guess deliberately), geometry of curved surfaces - which has been given a sort of fantasy ethereal feel, and the extremely simple and therefore implausible derivation of e=mc squared.Coxeter seems to have been happiest with extensions of the Platonic solids (in 'Regular Polytopes'), and related activities, such as the standard system for describing crystals (by their nodes etc), geodesic domes, possible implications for molecular structure, and so on. There's quite a bit on domes (which he didn't invent) and buckminsterfullerene, a form of carbon generated by evaporating carbon in a vacuum whereupon the atoms because of carbon's valency of 4 tend to like as sheets, but by default curl round. Whether anyone's found a use for this, seems not to be known by Roberts. Another thing Coxeter didn't find was Penrose's simple-seeming slightly asymmetrical tiles.Coxeter used algebra rather heavily and extended into regions where he then tailed off and others' expertise ruled. His book of 'twelve essays' hardly sold any copies. There are quite striking accounts, if you read between the lines, of inter-departmental and inter-university rivalries.Coxeter was a pacifist and appears to have had little to do with WW2; and was also a vegetarian. Although highly praised (e.g. there's an intro by Douglas Hofstadter) his own university (Toronto) seems to have eased him out - though this may have simply been standard practice.Various other figures - Newton, Kepler, G H Hardy, Escher, Martin Gardner, Buckminster Fuller, Polya, Einstein, several Penroses etc naturally enough appear.Recommended as a general biography though it's light on both explanations and sceptical analyses."},{"Title":"KING OF INFINITE SPACE","review":"Siobhan Roberts first book is a gem. This is up there with Hofstadter's books in terms of the content. I was very impressed with the depth the author went to in describing mathematical objects.

In this reverential account of a great geometer, Siobh&aacute;n (I have reinstated the accent she eschews; it is pronounced Shove-awn) Roberts is so keen to get the details right that the end matter (notes, appendices, indices) occupies Pp 259-399. Indeed, whether to focus on the copious notes or the main narrative is a real issue.Coxeter first came to my attention in the beautiful \\"hypergami\\" work described by the Eisenbergs in my \\"spatial cognition\\" collection.Spatial Cognition: Foundations and Applocations : Selected Papers from Mind Iii, Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society of Ireland, 1998 (Advances in Consciousness Research)He had three adversaries; the anti-diagram Bourbaki school(150-170), anybody who wanted practical applications like Buckminster Fuller (180-181) and , finally, non-classical geometry like Riemann. The book is extremely informative, and should perhaps have received more attention. It is still not too late to combine with the likes of the Eisenbergs to revive this project; pace another reviewer here, another book on this subject may take a long time.Se&aacute;n O Nuall&aacute;in Ph.D. 5u Meitheamh 2009"},{"Title":"KING OF INFINITE SPACE","review":"In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit from the start that I started to read this book because of the tireless promotion of Glenn Smith, my father-in-law, friend of Coxeter and passionate geometer (who also happens to be quoted in the book). I even went to U of T, even if my studies kept me far from the mathematics department. But although geometry was my least favorite of all the maths in school, with Glenn's passion for this book there was no way I could continue to ignore my husband's copy lying in the living room. I had to pick it up and see for myself just what his excitement was all about.I expected to be in over my head, possibly bored, reading it more out of curiosity than intrinsic interest. But after the first few pages I was hooked. This book, while delineating the history of geometrical inquiry, is also a captivating narrative of Coxeter's life. This is the story of a man who pursued his passion with his own quirks and habits, told in a way that rendered him human to me even as it allowed me to fully understand why he is considered a genius in his field.Yes, there were certain paragraphs full of mathematical explanations where I had to simply breath deep and hope that whatever on earth that meant had no direct impact on the unfolding of the narrative at large. The abundance of footnotes were also awkward at first, a sign that the author wasn't sure if her audience would be academic or popular, but after a while they faded from my attention as I became engrossed in Coxeter's story.By the end, I was ready to pull out the Zome tools and mirrors so that I could start building models and see if I, too, could see in four dimensions or more. So far I'm still stuck in the regular three, but with the inspiration of Coxeter to guide me there's always hope."},{"Title":"KING OF INFINITE SPACE","review":"Siobhan Roberts' King of Infinite Space: Donald Coxeter, The Man Who Saved Geometry is by far one of the best math related books I have read in years. Admittedly I am a geometer at heart, but it was far more than the mathematical content of the book which excited me. First of all, the author provides a detailed and very human look at the life of a world class mathematician. We follow Coxeter's career from Trinity College to the University of Toronto with stops along the way at Berkeley and the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton. Secondly, we get a good look at how and why geometry fell out of favor in the twentieth century, thanks in good part to efforts of Bourbaki, the French mathematics critical montoring group. Thirdly, we see how Coxeter developed many of his important results in a way that is accessible to anyone with a decent secondary mathematical background. The book contains seven appendices and an extensive set of endnotes all of which I found to be both very readable and very helpful. The author does a nice job of showing how the concept of symmetry was central to Coxeter's work in second, third, fourth, and higher dimensions. I found particularly interesting Coxeter's admiration for the work of M. C. Escher but as hard as Coxeter tried he could not get Escher to understand the mathematical significance of his own art work. During the later part of the book, the author shows how Coxeter's work has been used in a variety of fields both inside and outside of mathematics: Buckminster Fuller, in his work with geodesic structures, was inspired by Coxeter's polyhedral theories; Macarthur Fellow Jeff Weeks employed Coxeter's work with higher dimensional polytopes in developing his theories on the shape of the universe.One theme that occurs again and again throughout the book is that Coxeter's work was always characterized by his excellent taste, his sense of beauty, and the exquisite simplicity of his mathematics. I hope that anyone who reads this book will run out and get copies of Coxeter's three wonderful books: Introduction to Geometry (2nd edition 1989), Regular Polytopes( 1973 ), and Geometry Revisited ( 1967 ) (co-authored with Samuel Grietzer ) . Finally, the author has shown how Coxeter's efforts have helped rekindle people's interest in geometry. Many prominent people in the mathematics community, such as Douglas Hofstadter and John Conway, have been inspired by Coxeter's work and are helping to revive interest in this beautiful subject. This is a book that should be read by everyone who teaches geometry and by anyone who has any interest in the way in which some of the most elegant work in mathematics during the last century evolved.Siobhan Roberts has been working with members of the York University Mathematics Department to put together a web site for the book.

H. S. M. \\"Donald\\" Coxeter, a classical geometer interested in shapes, lines, vertices, polygons and the visualization of such geometric entities, saved the world from being overtaken by formalists who wanted to algebra-ize everything in geometry. Coxeter is not well known by most people; his geometry encompassed higher dimensions than most of us can think about. But he was truly a hero for the mathematicians who knew him and worked with him, and he did make differences in their discipline that have proved to have surprisingly widespread and even practical results. He has had the good fortune, four years after the end of his long life, to be the subject of a full and admiring biography _King of Infinite Space: Donald Coxeter, the Man Who Saved Geometry_ (Walker) by Siobhan Roberts. Roberts is a journalist who interviewed Coxeter himself over a period of two years toward the end of his life, and has interviewed many leading mathematicians and scholars who were the best ones to explain the exalted status in which Coxeter is held. Roberts's book is not a geometry text; she give analogies about Coxeter's work and hints at its themes rather than going into any mathematical detail, so even if you are intimidated by mathematics, you can get an idea of Coxeter's thoughts and just why he was such a revolutionary. This makes not only for an interesting biography, but an agreeable tour of just how mathematics has gotten done in the past few decades.Coxeter, born in London in 1907, was one of the mathematicians that broke the rule that doing math is a young man's game. He did make his first discoveries when he was thirteen, but was active until his death in 2003, still writing, proving, and presenting. He was a student at Cambridge, and in 1936 he immigrated to Toronto and took a teaching post at the university there, where he remained for the rest of his life. There are many descriptions of cranky mathematicians in these pages, but Coxeter was never like that. A fellow mathematician said, \\"He was almost courtly. He was very gentle, even when he managed to show you that you were thinking like an idiot.\\" He had the archetypal lack of interest in any practical applications of his ideas, appalled that his lovely theories could be sullied by practical utility. He firmly believed in pictures, visualization, and intuition, putting himself successfully at odds with the formalists who had inspired the New Math that was taught in grade schools forty years ago. His insistence on visual appeal linked him to M. C. Escher who incorporated mathematical ideas into his art. Coxeter even wrote explications of certain Escher prints; that he did so gratified the artist, but privately the non-mathematician Escher said that the \\"hocus-pocus text is no use to me at all.\\" Coxeter also had a close, not always collegial, relationship with Buckminster Fuller, whose geodesic domes he admired.Coxeter's professional life was without reproach. His family life was much less than perfect. Part of the problem was that he had all the bumbling of an absent-minded professor, causing his wife Rien to screech names at him in her native Dutch. Coxeter conceded, \\"I was not able to love Rien as fully and completely as one should his wife,\\" but when she developed Alzheimer's, he took uncharacteristically close care of her bathing, dressing, and feeding. Neither of their two children had interest in mathematics. His daughter \\"ran hot and cold on his status as a mathematical legend,\\" but escorted the elderly Coxeter to his last conferences. She said, \\"Dad would hate to be equated with Elvis Presley, but Elvis gave people some moments of joy, happiness, inspiration. And if that's what Dad's work does for these people, that's wonderful. Personally, I get more from Elvis Presley.\\" She isn't the only one, of course, but Roberts's delightful biography can't help but show even non-mathematicians just how important a figure Coxeter was. Do not fret that you don't understand all the math here. Coxeter once admitted that even in the geometry that he loved, \\"There are so many branches of the subject in which I am almost as ignorant as the proverbial man in the street.\\""},{"Title":"KING OF INFINITE SPACE","review":"Let me say at the outset, I was very excited when this book came out. It was awhile before I got around to reading it, and in the interim my expectations grew. Having just finished KoIS, I am sad to say, my expectations were greatly disappointed. SR may have written a fine magazine profile (I haven't read it; I can't say; but I don't doubt she did), but as (evidently) neither a mathematician nor a historian(/biographer) by training, she was not, in my view, up to the task of developing a book length treatment of her subject. The opening chapters of KOIS read as competent if uninspired biography. Coxeter strikes me as perhaps not the most scintillating of biographical subjects. But judging from his massive scholarly output, and the influence he has exerted on several generations of mathematicians and scientists in disparate fields, he is a patently fascinating intellectual subject. Clearly SR knows this too, and tries admirably to convey as much. But to do her subject true justice, she would have needed to delve far more deeply into his scholarship, and the fundamentals of his discipline, than she is able to. I can only hope that Conway or Hofstadter or Dyson or some other deeply knowledgeable -- and sympathetic -- Coxeterian will take up the challenge of writing a real scientific biography of HSM. He richly deserves one.One additional criticism of KoIS: in its concluding several chapters, KoIS nearly abandons its subject altogether, and roves randomly over topics in the geometry of biochemistry and physics. These are fascinating topics, to be sure, but a) RS treats them only superficially and b) their connection to Coxeter is far from clear. The subtitle of the present book seems to suggest that but for Coxeter advances in biochemical and string theoretical thinking might never have occurred. Really? I don't doubt Coxeter's key role in keeping geometry alive in the mathematics of the 20th century. But he was not THE only geometrist of the era nor THE only geometry-minded mathematician or scientist. SR is practicing an annoying kind of hyperbole here that is all too common in popular-science treatments. These closing chapters, then, read almost entirely as a kind of filler, chock full of interesting details, but of only tangential relation to the topic at hand: Coxeter's life and work.Having come down on KoIS rather negatively, I do credit SR with taking this project on. She clearly has great affection for Coxeter the geometer and the man, and the density of her endnotes (a bit excessive to be sure) attest the hard work she did in the library and on the phone. She is an engaging writer and will doubtless do fine work in the future. That said, both the biography and the intellectual biography of HSM Coxeter have yet to be written. I look forward eagerly to reading them one day."},{"Title":"KING OF INFINITE SPACE","review":"Is geometry dead? For most of us, geometry is but a faint memory of school days, an old-fashioned toy collecting dust cast in a corner of our childhood memories. So old-fashioned indeed that geometry was indeed pronounced dead by a group of French mathematicians, Bourbaki. In fact we find in this first book by Siobhan Roberts that geometry was already falling out of fashion when the protagonist of her work, Dr. Donald Coxeter, chose the subject to be his lifelong pursuit. What he made out of it for his extremely long and fruitful academic career, therefore, is an indispensable lesson that one's passion and talent would eventually lead to extraordinary achievements regardless of the trendiness of the nature of one's target subject.\\"King of Infinite Space\\" is about a mathematician who reinvented and reinvigorated geometry. It will be a delight to anyone with basic understanding of geometry, but readers' enjoyment does not depend on it. It can be read also as an arresting biography of a lonely scholar who sought solace in the beauty of mathematics while being emotionally alienated by his family. Instead of his wife, it seems as if geometry was his partner of life, bringing him many joys and even unexpected interactions with artists such as M.C. Escher or with George Odom, an admirer and a resident in the Hudson River Psychiatric Center in upstate New York who kept sending Dr. Coxeter numerous models.For the rest of us less endowed with mathematical talent, this book offers a glimpse to life and mind of a genius. The unfashionableness of his research subject seems to have been compensated by the longevity of his academic career -- he was writing new papers well into his nineties. Offering also a digested and concise version of the rich history of geometry, Roberts' work is a wonderful choice to a wide range of readers."},{"Title":"KING OF INFINITE SPACE","review":"I am very happy to have received this book as a gift from a former math professor when I began teaching high school geometry last year. Initially during the year, it was difficult to get the students excited; I found that having them read excerpts from this book really helped! The narrative way the book is written allowed students to follow along, and they began to understand some of the joy that can come from mathematics.I hope this book inspires a new generation of geometers!"},{"Title":"KING OF INFINITE SPACE","review":"If you enjoy Mathematics and particularly Recreational Mathematics;you'll find this book a real treasure trove. This book touches on so many interests I've had over the years,that I was mesmerized how one thing after another kept popping up.I have been interested in Recreational Mathematics,Puzzles and a wide range of things these pursuits lead to. I have over 500 books in my library connected to these interests in one way or another,but this book really shines in that it covers so much and over such a long period.Starting off with the author's name. It's pronounced \\"she-von\\" and is the Irish form of Joan,a name which was introduced into Ireland by the Anglo-Normans.It has been anglicized as Judith and Julia.I have also developed an interest in the concept of \\"connections\\" and as one goes through the fascinating journey of Coxeter's life ,connections endlessly come up. I started getting interested in puzzles in school during the early 50's and have never ceased to be drawn to them.It's amazing how one encounters things without really trying.Two years ago ,while Birding at Pointe Peele,another obsession;things were quiet one evening,and I was doing some Sudoku puzzles when a young lad came by. I got him interested,and his uncle also came by. He told me that if I liked puzzles,I should meet his friend who constructs amazing stick and ball models.I took him up on it and met a retired engineer ,like myself,and for a whole afternoon,he showed me a number of models he had constructed.They were fascinating polyhedra,similar to those being held by Coxeter on the cover of this book. One big difference though;he used wooden balls,about 3/4\\" diam. and sticks about 1/8\\" diam. to construct his models. He painted the balls different colors to emphasize their positions in the structure. This approach allows the internal structure of the model to be seen. They remind me of the way chemistry uses similar balls and sticks to display molecular structures.This man told me about Coxeter and that he discussed his models with him and how he actually built a computer to determine what stellations of models were or were not possible to construct.At a later visit to his home,he showed me dozens of other models he had constructed and even a machine he had built to drill the holes in the balls. By that time I had turned up \\"Polyhedron Models\\" by Magnus Wenninger and my friend told me he also discussed these models with him.He gave me one of his models and it is one of my prized possessions.Later on I found Wenninger's website,and if you'd like to see his wonderful models,visit it.So, naturally,when I got Robert,s book,I knew it would be of great interest.Although I had purchased Rouse Ball's \\"Mathematical Recreations\\" in 1960,and had even constructed a Rotating Ring of tetrahedra,I hadn't noticed that Coxeter had done the revision.I recently read \\"The Universal Book of Mathematics\\" by David Darling,(see my review on June 22,2007)and found it a very handy reference as I read this book.There is so much covered in this book ,one hardly knows where to start in writing a review. It has us meeting so many people in Coxeter's world;Einstein ,Buckminister Fuller,M.C.Escher,Martin Gardner,Paul Erdos,and on and on.You will meet their families ,students,likes and passions. These great minds are the people who have been in the forefront of Mahematics during the 20th Century and all who took over and expanded the horizons of the great Mathematicians who paved the way.Like ,in the world of music, there are the great composers and great players,but even though most of us can never really enter their worlds or minds,we can thankfully still enjoy and appreciate their work. Such is the same with mathematics.I was glad to read where M.C.Echer couldn't begin to follow Coxeter when he tried to explain math to him.It just confirms that one does not necessarily have to understand something to enjoy it. Even Coxeter understood that, and felt likewise about many areas of math and science.If there is anything that this book really brought home to me is that it shows why I have enjoyed my pursuits in Recreational Mathematics and Puzzles so much over the years.On top of being a wonderful biography on the life of Donald Coxeter and his associates and friends;it is a goldmine of a reference. 63 pages of Endnotes provide endless resource information;coupled with 13 pages of Bibliography and an extremly well compiled Index;makes this a major reference source that I will turn to often."},{"Title":"KING OF INFINITE SPACE","review":"KING OF INFINITE SPACE: DONALD COXETER, THE MAN WHO SAVED GEOMETRY could also have been reviewed in our Science Shelf area but is featured here among recommended biographies as being so much more than just a math read alone. Coxeter turned geometry from a dry science into an intellectual survey with links to civilization's evolution: the evolution of his theories and applications is traced in a blend of biography and math insights perfect for any interested in an unconventional scientist's genius. A lively format blends math insights with biography and makes for a recommended pick for general-interest libraries and schools strong in math theory alike."},{"Title":"KING OF INFINITE SPACE","review":"As I very rarely read biographies and almost never books about math, this book, recommended to me my father, a geometry and coxeter enthusiast, came both as a pleasant surprise and a nice change in my reading habits. First of all, I must admit that it upsets some of the stereotypes we may have about mathematicians being rigid minded reasoners, inclined to reduce reality to barren numbers and calculations. This, as we are shown, is not the case for Coxeter.In King of Infinite Space, Siobhan Roberts depicts Coxeter as a veritable artist: driven by esthetic impulses and indifferent to scientific utility, we are shown Coxeter's geometry as being inspired overall by a sense of beauty . Roberts also shows how Coxeter's work, in spite of all this, has a significant place in the history of mathematics, as well as its current developments, and how it has found practical applications in many scientific fields.Avoiding tedious technical descriptions that could weigh down the book and providing adequate clarification when needed (usually indexed), the writing is accessible and engaging; it is written in an intelligent yet unacademic style which is inviting to all types readers, mathematicians and biography enthusiasts alike .One thing I especially enjoyed about this book is that we are given an image of the artistic, imaginative side of mathematics much different from the pencil and paper problems and encumbering calculations that many of us are put off by. Coxeter's mathematical world is replete with dynamic, rotating shapes and multi-dimensional figures, kaleidoscopes and mirrors, honeycombs and reflections; all of these are of interest not for their scientific utility or practical purposes but rather because they satisfy Coxeter's penchant for symmetry, harmony, and beauty. No matter how indifferent you may be to the math, what comes across in this book is something undeniably appealing in Coxeter's romantic quest for higher spaces and heroic in his attempt to 'save geometry'. Really, what is there not to like about an aloof mathematician whose primary tools are folding mirrors, kaleidoscopes, and escher paintings?In the end, we can make no claims of understanding Coxeter's math or individual work, a special privilege afforded only to geometers, career specialists, or die-hard enthusiasts (my father); however, what we can appreciate is the spirit and nature of his thought, its scope and importance, his esthetic approach to the subject and his humble outlook regarding his own work. This book, written for a popular audience, excels at informing us of just that."},{"Title":"KING OF INFINITE SPACE","review":"This is a fascinating exposition of one of the great geometers of the 20th century The author has a style that grasps the reader's attention and evokes the excitement of discovery in a mode reflective of the man.

Jaunal, a veteran of W.W. II, Korea and Vietnam, decided in 1981 while teaching history as a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle to write his first book. Serving as what he described himself as an \\"old salt\\", he went to Vietnam as a Marine Noncommissioned Officer with the First Marine Battalion at age 44. The result of Jaunal's experiences from December, 1967 through December, 1968 was transformed into this book, \\"Jack's Journal\\". How did Jaunal write this? Jaunal explains: \\"Like many veterans of various wars, I remember more than once saying, I could write a book about this\\". The two times probably we say it most emphatically are during recruit training and during a wartime experience.The Only War We Had: A Platoon Leader's Journal of Vietnam (Williams-Ford Texas A&M; University Military History Series)I never wrote anything about my experiences in W.W. II-all that remains are some memories and a few letters I wrote to my mother. I never wrote anything about my experiences in Korea-all that remains are more memories and several letters I wrote to my wife. I did write stories about my experiences in Vietnam. These are compiled now as \\"Vietnam '68:Jack's Journal. This book is a daily record of events, my experiences and thoughts at that time. The stories are true, written at the time recorded or very soon after from notes on a desk calendar, in a pocket notebook, on backs of envelopes, or the top of a C-ration box\\".Jaunal puts together a Vietnam expose where he writes about his day to day experiences with the enlisted Marines of \\"Heat and Steam\\" (Headquarters and Service Company), the \\"Third Amphibian Tractor Battalion\\" and the \\"First Reconnaissance Battalion\\". Starting day by day from the staging battalion at Camp Pendleton, California on December 12th, 1967, including his airline flight to Vietnam via Okinawa and Japan, Jaunal describes his experiences all the way to December 25, 1968.An Infantry Lieutenant's Vietnam: January 1967 to March 1968 with the 4th Infantry DivisionThe reader gets a feel of what it was like to experience the Tet Offensive of January, 1968, patrols in the steamy jungles of S.E. Asia, as well as Jaunal's reaction to witnessing tragic death. However, if you are looking for the gory details of raging battles in Vietnam, this book is not for you. Jaunal warns the reader early that this book was written in a tasteful way: \\"The stories are not of the \\"blood-and gut\\" type, or glory, or an expose-those are for others to write\\". This self described \\"old salt\\" (he was 44 years old in a war where the average age was 18!) points out how different this war was from past wars. Jaunal explains on his entry of 12/23/67: \\"The new breed goes jet-set.That could be the slogan of the new breed marine. I can remember the last time going to war, Korea, 1950, and being down in the hold of a crowded troop ship with the sleeping racks stacked six or more high. Seasickness was the order of the day;it took hours to feed, and the trip lasted two weeks.Crucible Vietnam: Memoir of an Infantry LieutenantNow, we travel aboard a World Airlines Boeing 707 charter flight at Travis Air Force Base, California. Thirty minutes after we are airborne the stewardess starts to serve breakfast. At one o'clock in the morning! Four very attractive stewardesses take care of our needs, plenty of room, and in ten hours we land in Japan. Jet, the only way to go!\\"Very early in his entries, Jaunal comments on the sneakiness of the way \\"Charlie\\" (slang for the North Vietnamese Army/Viet Cong) fights. He writes on 12/27/67 while inspecting the enemies caves and tunnels inside \\"Marble Mountain\\" the following: \\"When Charlie opens up it is normally at night. He fires from the mountain and the villes. Last time Charlie wounded three Marines during a fire fight. Also, lobbed in some mortar rounds. One went through a hootch damaging a Marine's TV set. Charlie really knows how to hurt a guy!\\"Grab Their Belts to Fight Them: The Viet Cong's Big-Unit War Against the U.S., 1965-1966There is also humor in this memoir. Jaunal recalls in his entry of 1/3/68 about his recollection of \\"Lily\\", a South Vietnamese prostitute who would stand at a road outside the U.S. compound and attract her customers by wearing a very skimpy and revealing mini skirt and lifting it up as the troops drove by. Jaunal recounted in this entry what happened the day the Chaplain was in the passenger's seat with his driver and they passed by Lily at the roadside and she decided to flash them. Jaunal explains: \\"You should have seen Lily the day the Chaplain's driver stopped by-with the Chaplain. The driver knew what would happen but the Chaplain didn't. Lily lifted her dress to show the Chaplain the wonders of the Orient, and the Chaplain almost fell out of his jeep!\\" There are multiple entries after the \\"Tet Offensive\\" that are extremely accurate and poignant. His descriptions of the Vietnamese country folk (who our troops tried in vain to win the \\"hearts and minds of\\" ) were exceptionally accurate:\\"Old ladies smile showing rotten teeth and betal nut stains all over their mouths. The kids in this village are brats. We cannot shake them off the last man, but they leave us at the village line\\".However, I found in Jaunal's most vivid description of a particular patrol on 1/13.68 clear evidence of the unwinnable nature of this war. Jaunal states:\\"We leave the road now and start across country-sometimes referred to as \\"Indian Country\\". There are many native graves through here. We see bullet scars on many a headstone. Sometimes Charlie sets booby traps along here. We call it \\"Booby Trap Hill\\". We always think of them-and the mines, down the hill now and along the trail through the heavy brush.The Shake 'n Bake Sergeant: True Story of Infantry Sergeants in VietnamWhat a spot for an ambush! Can't see much in front or to the sides at times, It's \\"hairy\\" at night. Good spot for Charlie to hit at night. Now we come out of the brush and cross the dikes through a rice field. There are times Charlie plants booby traps on the side of dikes, and then fires. If you jump off and into the paddy, you may land on a booby trap.\\" Certainly, this was an elusive enemy fighting an unconventional war, that the U.S. was not at all prepared for. In addition, Jaunal lamented: \\"All along the route Charlie can open up on us, as he has at times on other patrols. But usually it is at night when he comes out of hiding around here and throws lead at you. That guy in the field back there-you wonder what he does for a living at night\\".On the climate of Vietnam, Jaunal wrote: \\"Now it is warm and humid and almost everyone has a wet spot around the arm pits, the back, and where any equipment may be hanging. From cool and wet to hot and humid in a few hours-that's Vietnam.\\" Curiously, Jaunal skirted the whole U.S. \\"fumbling\\" of the enemies' nearly successful \\"Tet Offensive\\", choosing to be \\"politically correct\\" and avoid any inflammatory statements. Jaunal also didn't touch, despite being stationed near Danang in I Corps, the whole issue of the Viet Cong Massacre at Hue in February, 1969. He did, however, include an indication of the \\"character\\" of the enemy in his report of 8/23/68 when he described the enemy's behavior during the Marine's defense on the attack of the Danang Airbase.Booby Trap BoysJaunal explained: \\"When the VC and NVA forces attacked the bridge, they forced some civilians in front of them for cover.\\" Most of Jaunal's book seemed accurate to me. There were two discrepancies that stood out to me that seemed to contradict other historical evidence. There was a program that the U.S. military initiated to weed out and kill the enemy called a \\"County Fair.Jack Jaunal described this as a benevolent affair similar to one in the U.S. which would bring to mind images of livestock shows, baking contests and greased pig races. It was intended to win the \\"hearts and minds\\" of the indigenous South Vietnamese to turn over and expose the Viet Cong hiding amongst them to the American forces. Jaunal described in his entry of 2/9/68 the following \\"Country Fair\\": \\"Leathernecks of the 3rd Amphibian Tractor Battalion and the First M.P. Battalion with elements of the U.S. Army and Navy, and elements of the local Vietnamese Regional and Popular Forces gathered to conduct the two day \\"County Fair\\" operation.When We Walked Above the Clouds: A Memoir of VietnamOn the first day at dawn, the allied forces moved into the village and escorted the Vietnamese to a pre-selected point in the nearby, abandoned French fort. As the villagers started gathering, friendly forces systematically began to sweep through the area in search of the Viet Cong. The Villagers soon discovered that a day of fun and assistance had been set up for them to offset the inconvenience of keeping them away from their homes. At the fort a field dispensary was opened. Navy doctors and hospital corpsmen treated any Vietnamese that needed medical assistance.\\"Jaunal continued: \\"A mobile broadcasting van was located at a collection point, and throughout the day music and speeches were played for the villagers' listening enjoyment. A movie was shown that evening for their entertainment. Toys and games were handed out to the children to keep them amused while the forces continued their search. Many other items were distributed that day, including soap, clothing and one ton of rice in addition to other food stuffs. An almost festive holiday atmosphere prevailed at the fair.\\" Certainly, the way Jaunal described it, our military was winning the \\"hearts and minds\\" of the villagers, while the only people that didn't enjoy themselves that day were the Viet Cong. However, if you read Martin Russ's \\"Happy Hunting Grounds,\\" a picture of intimidation and Allied terror actually existed.Happy Hunting GroundRuss wrote: \\"Here's how a \\"County Fair\\" works. Long before dawn a company of Marines surrounds a Viet Cong-controlled hamlet. At dawn a company of ARVN's (Army Republic of S. Vietnam soldiers) moves into the hamlet and gathers all the civilians in one spot. Then the hamlet is searched. Anyone found is captured or killed. Tunnels and caves are blown up\\". Certainly, this doesn't jive with Jaunal's description. The second discrepancy is Jaunal's description of the average grunt in Vietnam at the end of his tour in 1968. In his entry of 9/11/68 (a bad date in American history!) Jaunal wrote this description of an American soldier: \\"They don't doubt the future. They have plans for going home, getting married or continuing college. Some will extend their tour in Vietnam or re enlist. They express no doubts. They have hunted and met the VC squarely. They know the cunning spread of Communism, the \\"never had a choice\\" victims. They express no doubts as to why they were here.\\"This view of Jaunal's is not supported by the multitude of memoirs that abound. John Trotti, a Phantom F-16 pilot who served in Vietnam from 1965 to 1966, re-upped for a second tour in 1968 close to the time Jaunal made this entry. Far from worrying about the perils of Communism, Trotti wrote about the changes he perceived from 1965 to 1968 in U.S. troop morale: \\"I was prepared for differences in the attitude of the troops, but I was totally unprepared for the magnitude of the change. From the moment I stepped off the transport, I sensed the mediocrity of the situation.Phantom Over VietnamIt was if our troops were wallowing in molasses. \\"Four hundred days and a wake up, baby\\" became the duty slogan for soldiers no more than hours off the plane. \\"Just make sure there's cold beer at the club.\\" Trucks and jeeps with lolling drivers from the Americal division cruised the main service road (in Saigon) as if it were Main Street on Saturday night. Hundreds of soldiers with long hair and seedy fatigues lounged around outside the Americal PX smoking dope in blatant defiance of their officers and NCO's. \\"Bust me, you sucker,\\" their postures said, \\"and see what kind of grenade comes through the door to your hootch.\\" Certainly, it doesn't seem like the threat of Communism was on any of the minds of those Trotti described. Needless to say, I found Jack Jaunal's \\"Vietnam '68\\" a worthy read, an informative timepiece that should be among any ex veteran or historian's collection."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"Creativity is the residue of time wasted.~Albert EinsteinHe wasn't a genius for no reason was he?

I've also seen how agile is misused - so that \\"Agile\\" means 100% engaged, damn the torpedoes and go full steam ahead. I've also seen the damage these styles can do to a software organization.In Slack, Mr DeMarco talks about how having some time to stop and poke your head up can actually lead to a better organization. An organization that can respond to change, that can retain employees, that can manage risk, and that can deliver product. The book is a manifesto - there isn't a lot of footnotes or empirical studies to back him up. Instead, we are getting a glimpse of his experiences at companies over the years.I can also say that this rings true to me. Even as a start-up junkie, the past few years I've found myself working smarter so that I have more time to stay on top of the changes in my industry. Or that I have the time to spend with my co-workers; where idle talk can transfer a lot of knowledge.

So much so, I would recommend reading it with plenty of breaks. Each chapter is short, to the point, and packed with useful information. Let it sink in for a while before proceeding to the next.The only thing I can find fault with is DeMarco's lack of quantifiable or even anecdotal support for his arguments. It's a shame too. Though, if he did this book would literally have to be 1,000 pages long.I found his discussion of Risk Management poignant and his graphical \\"risk diagrams\\" especially useful. His graphs depict project finish dates as a probability curve across time. Convincingly, he argues that a useful project must have risk and if there is risk, then there must be uncertainty over meeting the finish date. Therefore, the finish date is a probable point of completion and not a definite. If it were (or must be) a definite then it is the goal of the project.Most of this book pertains to the poor job managers are doing leading staff. His exposition on \\"slack\\" (or that employee time which is driven out of existence by efficiency) and busy work is wonderful. He also rails against the culture-of-fear institutionalized by many companies. He does propose ways to positively lead the knowledge workers of today through a win-win relationship.This book should be required reading in high school. I say that because everyone in the workforce should read it. The earlier, the better. The most important lesson in the book is that it is ok and commendable to say 'no' (or even sayonara) to an employer that manages through fear.Much of his philosophy and advice, as well as the tone of the book, will ring familiar to readers of Peter Drucker.

It also has some really startling, yet obvious after-the-fact, advice about the lack of quality that happens when people feel rushed. Even if they're only working their day job hours, if there isn't slack time in their days, it'll affect their output.The missing piece was really, in my opinion, how to measure 'how much' slack time to have. It seemed hard to get a metric for whether it's being used effectively or not.This book follows in the rich tradition of &quot;Lean&quot; processes -- there's a whole wealth of literature out there on how to measure and assess the amount of &quot;slack&quot; in use and its effectiveness. It would've been good to make references to some of that information, though I'll be the first to admit that the dryness might have impacted the light tone of the book.

Now many corporations are suffering from the same problem: downsizing, pushing their remaining employees to the limit, yet becoming less profitable and, in many cases, eventually going bankrupt. Apparently the breakneck 24/7 paradigm of modern life is seriously flawed. In this excellent book Tom Demarco presents a compelling case that neither individuals nor companies can be truly efficient unless they have some slack available to them. Slack is also essential in order to allow both people and companies to adapt to -- and survive -- the rapid changes which are the norm at this time.

It was one of the first books I read that provided a more 'human' side towards projects in general and software development in particular. While slightly different in it's approach, I believe that if you enjoyed Peopleware, you will generally enjoy Slack too.Slack begins with a significant amount of materials highlighting the need for knowledge workers to \\"slow down\\" and introduce slack (flexibility) into their work. He asserts that organizations today tend to be focused overly (and perhaps solely) on fast deliverables and maximized efficiency at the cost of effectiveness.Unfortunately, the post dot-con era and the weak global economy have both made slowing down an even less acceptable option today than 3-5 years ago. In order for the author's ideas to work, there has to be a significant number of highly motivated and talented people present in an organization, which is usually the exception rather than the norm.There's a section devoted to the topic of overtime. The author puts forward substantial evidence that (constant) overtime is actually detrimental to the productivity of an organization. If only bosses will believe it!Let me provide an Asian perspective on overtime. If you work 80-90 hr-weeks, you are considered a hardworking worker. If you work normal 45-50 hr weeks, then you are deemed as not \`tenacious' enough! It simply does not matter if the 50hr worker has completed twice as much work as the 90hr worker. The 50hr worker is deemed less worthy, believe it or not!There were two interesting chapters on \\"Process Obsession\\" and the \\"Culture of Fear\\" somewhere in the middle of the book. If you like Dilbert, I am sure you will enjoy these chapters. (There's actually a chapter on Dilbert)Up to this point, you could indeed consider this book as the written version of Dilbert. But while you are likely to get more than a few good laughs, you probably will not pick up too many ideas on how to actually solve the \\"problems\\" brought up. But I guess there are a zillion management books out there claiming that they offer the solutions to these problems. (Hey, even being a PHB isn't all that easy, you know)Chapter 25 asserts that middle management (probably the level hardest hit in recent days) plays an important part in the reinvention of an organization and that they are actually the people in the best position to bring companies beyond the current economic crisis.The last 1/3 of the book is devoted to Change Management and Risk Management, subjects that I am admittedly not familiar with, so I cannot provide any insights into them.The book ends with a short story about \\"The Needle in the Haystack\\". I could simplify it to \\"Are you looking for the needle in the haystack?\\" If yes, \\"Why don't you look for the hay in the needle stack instead?\\" I am not too sure how this story fits into the overall picture of this book but it certainly provoked my thoughts.This review was written by a 26 yr old software engineer in Singapore.[name] [email]"},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"In a culture where busyness is lauded and celebrated, where the reminder beeps of a palm pilot are viewed as measures of worth, where \\"success\\" is measured by the sole productivity of a person or a system, Tom DeMarco offers a new and refreshing look at life, both personal and professional. The worst thing to be called in this day and age is a slackard. DeMarco proposes that there is something worse in life than slack; it is the myth of total efficiency, the myth which heightens burnout and serves as a nemesis to effectiveness.Tom DeMarco's Slack is not just about doing less; it is about being effective. It is not just about better management techniques; it is about better living philosophies. DeMarco is not introducing a new variable into the management equation; rather, he calls us to give heed to a critical element of organizational and personal life that have been ignored or resisted, which have had adverse consequences so obvious that we cannot or choose not to believe or give credence to.Henry David Thoreau's aphorism to \\"suck the marrow out of life\\" has been abused and maligned by people and organizations alike to become the mantra of the current age which calls us to do more, be more, lest we fall behind. Behind what, we don't know. We just don't want to be behind. And so we run faster and do more. Space and rest are to be avoided. We can have space and rest when we die. But as long as we are living, life must be filled to the brim, and even overflowing. The opiate produced by the call to be totally efficient has lulled people and organizations into an unsound belief that if you can produce 100 widgets in 8 hours, then you can produce 300 hundred widgets in a whole day! Ignoring the concept of the point of diminishing return can indeed have profound and hurtful impacts on an organization and those who are a part of it.DeMarco exposes the myth of total efficiency! From the first page to the last, he turns conventional management beliefs and tenets upside down and invites his readers to look at things from different perspectives and with new eyes. He exposes what has been deemed to be \\"common sense\\" or rational logic of the do-more-make-more culture to be uncommon and irrational. DeMarco reminds us effectively that carpe diem, seizing the day, does not mean to choke the life out of the day. To effectively seize the day, DeMarco would argue, we must allow time and space for the day to breathe and to flourish.If you think slack is a dirty word, then pick up this book and be ready to be changed. If you long for a 36-hour day, if your life meaning is bound up in your daytimer, if you have ever felt like you cannot afford to be sick for a day, then this book is for you. If you believe that there must be a better way to live and to work besides in an environment that is filled with the fear and a constant call to do more with less without consequence, then spend some time with DeMarco in this book.The profundity in this book does not lie in the newness of a concept; rather, it is in the wisdom that is inherent in slack... since the beginning of time."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"This book is very humble both in its size and format but contains some true pearls of wisdom. Here are some of the highlights that I will retain from this easy and pleasant read:* In our constant quest to make our organizations more efficient (reduction of overhead, standardization of processes, overworking management and resources), we have actually made them less effective. The solution lies in (re)introducing \`slack'. Slack is the lubricant required to effect change, it is the degree of freedom that enables reinvention and true effectiveness.* Multitasking and overtime, thought to be ways of getting the most out of the teams, are actually having a negative impact on productivity. Multitasking, specifically for knowledge workers, causes at least a 15% penalty in productivity. It is much higher for tasks (such as troubleshooting or design for instance) that require complete immersion before the resource can actually make progress. Systematic overtime is also proven to be an ineffective way of improving project cycle-time. While it may provide short term gains, the demands it puts on resources quickly reduces their productivity and effectiveness. An alternative to systematic overtime are well calculated and well timed sprints (focused and value-added, yet handled as exceptions).* Overworked managers also have a very negative impact on organizational effectiveness. It is indeed managers, and more specifically middle managers, that can the most effectively champion and effect change in organizations. The more overworked they are, the less time they have to reinvent the ways of working. Those same middle managers will be most effective in bringing about positive changes if they can collaborate with each other, which in turns requires that organizations stop fostering destructive internal competition.* Prescriptive processes, pushed top-down, are a form of disempowerment. They are a result of fearful management that is allergic to failure. These processes succeed in dictate every aspect of how you should do you work but fail in providing guidance in doing the \`hard parts'. They are often heavy and form an armor that reduces the mobility and agility of teams, hence resulting in less competitive organizations. The solution is to put the ownership of processes between the hands of those who do the work.* An effective change manager is a person that can remonstrate, repeat, correct, encourage, cajole, motivate, and has great powers of persuasion. He/she is less of a boss and more of a negotiator. Great change managers have a lot of markers to call in. Markers come from favors done and confidence earned in the past. They have built a reservoir of trust and tap into it to entice their people to embrace change. Change managers have to come from within the organization, a stranger has no markers to call in, just a little \`honeymoon capital'.* The best time to introduce change is in a period of growth. Decline causes anxiety and makes people more resistant to change."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"It's about 100 years since Frederick Winslow Taylor introduced the philosophy of \\"scientific management\\", with its offspring such as the time-and-motion study and the mythical man-month. That's about how long it takes for a big idea to soak into the awareness of managers everywhere - especially those who are more committed to looking good than to managing well.Tom DeMarco, co-author (with Tim Lister) of the magnificent \\"Peopleware\\", has done it again. Although \\"Slack\\" runs a little over 200 pages, you will probably read it in less than four hours because it is actually quite hard to put down. You will keep on thinking, \\"Yes, I've seen that!\\" and \\"Those words ring a bell\\".In the course of his consultancy practice, which has taken him into many organizations including Apple, HP, Lucent and IBM, DeMarco has noticed a lot of counterproductive management behaviour. Many acts and policies that look good in the short term lead to corporate death in the longer term. More specifically, it is always possible to squeeze out a few more percentage points of \\"efficiency\\" - but only at the cost of damaging morale, precipitating burnout and losing the flexibility without which sensible decisions cannot be made.Faster isn't always better. Effectiveness matters more than efficiency. People are not interchangeable \\"resources\\". Without challenge and growth, the best employees soon leave. Overheads are not necessarily bad. Consciously or subconsciously, we already know these things. DeMarco just hammers them home so we will never forget them again.I really have only one quibble with \\"Slack\\". DeMarco has no business criticising Dilbert and his fellow engineers for \\"giving up\\" on their pointy-haired bosses. Sure, employees have a responsibility to make allowances and go the extra mile - but the PHBs systematically abuse every extra bit of slack that anyone cuts them. That's part of the joke, of course.This is not just a book that will confirm your suspicions, and reassure you that you are not the one who is going mad. It's a simple, easily-understood message that everyone in business needs to hear.

The myth of &quot;total efficiency&quot; still persists in the workplace.This book is in sharp contrast to practices that have plagued the workers for decades; women who sewed in sweatshop factories in the early 1900's were carefully monitored on how long they took to make bathroom breaks. Even now software is available that can count every keystroke a worker makes (to check on their efficiency.) The dream that careful monitoring and structuring of the workplace to get the maximum &quot;juice&quot; out of workers is disproved in this book.This isn't even totally new information; a very old study found that brightening the lights in a factory improved performance. Then another study found that DIMMING the lights also improved performance. In other words, people are not machines. They need downtime, change, meaningful work and mental breaks or they burn out.

Vegitarian, MBO, low carb/high fat, authoritarian, Pilates, ecommerce, TaeBo. Someone is always offering up a new recipe. Invariably, the offer is accompanied by something to buy - a book, some software, consulting, equipment. Initially, the results are promising (or at least presented that way by the buyer) but the real test is the success of the program is over the long haul. Too often the old problem resurfaces but fortunately, for the seller, there is a new and improved solution. And the cycle starts over again. Tom DeMarco does a good job of exposing this folly but the book bounces around to different topics and covers them too superficially. There really isn't much tying the topics together even though he makes an initial attempt at bringing them together under the &quot;efficiency has wrung out the time needed for more important things&quot; umbrella. Admittedly, he calls his effort a diatribe and an airplane read but I think the book's theme could have been more developed. In the end, he challenges many of the silly institutions that organizations have established - which is good, but he never quite gets to the solution, which, like diets, is probably much simpler (and costs less) than we realize - everything in moderation."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"I just finished reading Slack by Tom DeMarco, and it's not usual for me to agree with consultants. However, DeMarco hits the mark on a lot of points with me, particularly the issue of burnout. The book's major premise is that companies are so preoccupied with making themselves &quot;lean&quot; that they are overworking the middle management layer that is left to pick up the pieces. I think everyone knows that Wall Street loves the restructuring charges and the layoffs that come with it, but DeMarco illustrates effectively how overworking your &quot;knowledge&quot; base can actually decrease productivity in the long haul. Along with the overworking theme is the basic fact that middle management in an office environment is not like an employee in the factory - if you want to maximize the knowledge base, you need to provide enough support for them. Otherwise, without &quot;slack&quot;, management is not able to institute change and a positive work environment. I would recommend this book for anyone who works 12 hour days, weekends and/or can't take a vacation because a day away from the office = two days of work when you get back. It is a quick read - the chapters are brief and it is tailored for those who only want the facts.

He includes some simple flow charts to help illustrate these ideas, along with examples of management methods that work and some that don't.

This material would have been better presented in 30 pages than in this length. Toward the end, it felt like the author was simply reaching for more things to say in order to fill out his page count.

The absence of slack on the job causes changes in the way that information is dealt with. For example, in an effort to keep meetings short, handouts are the way to go which keeps questions and answer meetings from happening. This keeps production workers' thoughts from being heard. I would like to see Mr. DeMarco write a book about slack for the lower level of workers. The last chapters about risk and risk management were not relevant to me as a production worker, although I am sure that they may have been relevant to management.

More! More! Faster! Faster! How does the story end?DeMarco asks us to think deeply and with true insight into the nature of our everyday work experience. This book was especially interesting to me as a project manager in the speedy world of software engineering.Below are some of my random musings:1) Very interesting concept of a mental metric of efficiency... that being the # of \\"useful mental discriminations\\" UMDs! per work cycle!! I am not sure this is exactly the right method but if you have to create a metric of effectiveness for the knowledge worker what would it be. Drucker might have some ideas on this!!2) The tradeoff between fully utilized capacity and availability! If you are always busy how can you be \\"available\\" Is there some combination of \\"fast work\\" and \\"slow work\\". Work that is marked with lavendar dots takes the backseat when work marked with red dots shows up???3) Seems like in the work environment there is a bottleneck at the 20% of the nodes that are where the majority of the work is. How do we distribute effectiveness across a broader base of the work force?4) Can boredom actually be a catalyst for creative thinking?? I.e. spend a certain amount of time being bored. No, maybe relaxed though???5) My genius friend at work suggested the real work of the knowledge worker should be able to be done in 20% of the time. The rest of time in making things better..... really creative and critical thinking. Of course he is a genius so that might be why that seems the right percentage!6) Crisis in confidence. We are materially abundand but how are we feeling about ourselves in the restructuring process? Have we made the individual worker entirely fungible? DeMarco asks us to remember the costs associated with what he calls \\"task switching penalties\\"."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"Wouldn't it be great if we could all work less hard and get more done? The heart of Tom DeMarco's thesis in Slack is that workers, particularly middle managers, need time to be less busy so that they can bring change and reinvention to their firms. This means bringing back the extinct secretary and hiring more middle managers so that the firm can become a proactive engine of growth rather than a reactive 20th century relic.Alas, much as I would like to believe it, DeMarco's argument is unconvincing. This slim volume is self-contradictory and analytically weak. The author advocates many of his main points simply by repeatedly asserting them as fact, and his early admission of this flaw does not make it any easier to swallow. His assumptions about what motivates workers are nave. In a chapter entitled &quot;When 'Hurry Up' Really Means 'Slow Down'&quot;, DeMarco states that an underworked employee in an efficient organization will intentionally slow down his or her work in order to look 100 percent busy. Perhaps. But DeMarco's implied corollary - that the &quot;hurry up&quot; climate of the organization needs to change in order to prevent this - is simplistic at best. An employee with that psychology likely has the propensity to be an underperformer no matter how the organization is structured. This is certainly an important management question, but one that needs to be addressed through supervisor-employee counseling sessions and other methods before the entire organization is diagnosed with mismanagement.DeMarco says that Slack can be read cover-to-cover on a New York to Chicago plane ride. You might find better management lessons on the emergency landing card."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"Tom DeMarco looks at this one idea of &quot;slack&quot;, basically how hard management makes an employee work, and its effect on productivity.

Slack is not a book that is trying to \\"sell\\" you anything; but a book that advises you \\"don't buy it\\"!Downsizing, busyness, aggressive schedules, overtime, the culture of fear, and the obsession we have with process improvement are just a few of the total efficiency crazes that DeMarco addresses. He lays down a convincing foundation for busting these myths beginning in the first chapter. He explains that knowledge workers are not fungible resources, that is that they can not easily and freely exchange their work from a variety of tasks or projects, basically challenging the biggest myth out there, that of multi-tasking knowledge workers.The book is not all doom and gloom, but provides solid strategies for any manager willing to set aside the current corporate trends and enter a brave, new world of Slack.

It is well-written, easily understandable, and sectioned into small chapters for those of us on-the-go. The author brings into play the notion of \\"slack,\\" which is necessary for everyone to accomplish a project of any size.Slack is when you step back, remove yourself from the pressure of the daily grind and \`aggressive timelines' (which - the author notes in the section on risk management - are always doomed for failure), and allow yourself to free your mind - and hopefully this notion is supported by your management (if not, get them a copy of this book). During this slack time is when some of our best thinking happens - it could be while you're at your desk, on the road, or like many of us, laying in bed at 2am. Slack is about removing the proverbial gun from your head, proper planning, and support of initiatives.If you are working on a project with management-imposed \`aggressive timelines,' this book would be timely for you and your project team - not to mention your boss!"},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"This is certainly not the greatest management book ever written.

But it makes a fun, quick, read, and it will make you think. Check it out. It's worth investing a few hours of reading."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"Tom DeMarco wrote Slack in 2001. However, I have a ten-year rule on management books: if they're still around in ten years, then I read them. Slack has something important to say, but first, the bad news. Although the book is short (220 pages) it is often boring. However, it is also interesting and insightful in some important places.DeMarco starts out by describing an old puzzle you may remember: a square 2\\"x2\\"puzzle with 8 plastic tiles in a 3x3 grid with one space left over. The object was to order the tiles from 1 to 8 by sliding them around and interchanging tiles and spaces. DeMarco proposes a new \\"optimized\\" puzzle: 716/483/259. Great! If you like 716/483/259 then the puzzle is already in its final \\"optimized\\" configuration. The only problem is that there is no space left over to move the tiles around. Not much of a game, but think of the analogy with today's manufacturing model. All the air is squeezed out of the process. The minimal amount of effort is required to maintain 716/483/259. Everything is great, UNTIL you need to respond to changing market conditions, and then, you can't! There is no slack in the process. All unessential overhead has been cut. Folks are so busy doing their jobs and the jobs of one or two others that have been let go that they can't possibly do anything more.As far as DeMarco is concerned, optimization may work on the shop floor, but not with knowledge workers because thinking takes time and freedom, the very things that have been squeezed out of the process. Now, no one is available to redirect the process. The best one can hope for is some incremental improvement here or there. No breakthroughs can occur, just the same thing better, faster, and cheaper until better, faster, and cheaper can no longer compete.My first chemical engineering professor actually worked in a buggy whip factory. How much better do you suppose their buggy whips became before they went broke? How much faster were they produced? How much cheaper did they become? Here is a link to a better, faster, cheaper buggy whip.[...]Quite a bargain for under 13 dollars, especially when adjusted for inflation. So did a few better, faster, cheaper businesses survive? No. The above company started in 1973, and they do lots of other stuff besides buggy whips. Businesses only survive when they can adapt. Being best in class is important, but the ability to change or create the class is even more important.Slack is organized into 33 short chapters in four parts. Part One introduces the concept of slack. Part Two: Lost, but Making Good Time resonates with a saying of mine: \\"When you're headed in the wrong direction, speed is not your ally.\\" Part Three addresses change and growth, and Part Four speaks to risk and risk management.DeMarco makes many good points; e.g., people are not fungible; transaction costs are almost always underestimated or ignored; invention requires resources; tactics without strategy are disastrous, etc. However, he also makes a few blunders.In Chapter 5, Managing Eve, DeMarco's worldview gets in the way. According to DeMarco, Eve made the right decision by breaking the rules rather than limiting her \\"growth as a person.\\" I am no prude, but there are lots of experiences for which we are the poorer, not the better, and sensible policy is designed to limit bad consequences. Do organizations entertain destructive policies. Yes, but our job should be to reform the policy, not to do our own thing.DeMarco also analogizes blind obedience to management policy as religion, but this is a poor analogy. The Christian religion is responsible for the hospital, the university, and science. Let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater. Blind adherence to anything (including policy) is never a good idea, but that has much more to do with totalitarianism than religion.Elsewhere (Chapter 28, Change Management) DeMarco decries the family as a poor model for business, especially during the changing times that we find ourselves in. But this is founded on an inadequate and misguided model of family as an authoritarian regime. Good family does have clear structure and authority, but that is not all it has. It also has apprenticeship, nurturing, guidance, training; and it prepares its junior members for succession to greater responsibilities. All in all, I think that is a very good model for business.Yet and despite my disagreements, the book is a worthy read and a reasonable antidote to the blind dogma that poses for leadership in many organizations. One can only hope that those indicted are up for the challenge."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"In \\"Slack,\\" Tom DeMarco (of \\"Peopleware\\" fame) takes on a lot of old management practices that apparently are still in use today, with the precept that so-called \\"knowledge workers\\" need to be managed differently than traditional factory workers. DeMarco plays fast and loose with logic, relying on anecdotal summary evidence from his consulting experience (take my word for it) rather than giving the actual evidence or citing previous studies to back up his claims. If you can get past that, and have an interest in better managing \\"knowledge workers,\\" then this book might be for you. It's not that the theories espoused by DeMarco aren't solid; they just lack bona fide proof (and so are better labeled as hypotheses).There are fundamental differences between a building full of factory workers and a building full of code monkeys, engineers, accountants, etc....duh. DeMarco asserts that current management practices don't really account for this, namely that at crunch time you can push the laborers harder but \\"thinking\\" jobs occur at a fixed rate. A little free time, or slack, for all employees is in fact a good thing, because it allows for beneficial change to happen, or certain tasks to occur right away. Standing over a cubicle with a stopwatch won't help the worker or the organization. Laying off a full time secretary and splitting another half-time between two departments because she was timed to be busy only 50% of the day is a bad idea, because then the secretary is then always busy and you then have six-figure salary workers wasting their time making photocopies. The whole idea of slack is also useful when looking at risk analysis and planning, and many other aspects of corporate life.While I certainly don't agree with everything DeMarco presents, a lot of the ideas do seem very well founded in reality and are just plain all-around good concepts. I think it's worth a read and discussion with your colleagues if you manage people in polo shirts or neckties, but I don't think this is the end-all of management books."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"If you've read Peopleware, this book is the next logical step.You may get a sense of deja vu since this book reiterates and indirectly references Peopleware in places. However, even in these sections, Slack goes deeper. Peopleware tells you that certain things are bad, and Slack tells you exactly why it is bad and what you can do to avoid it."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"In his earlier works like &quot;Peopleware&quot; first published in 1987, Tom DeMarco tended to analyze individual aspects of corporate performance like quality of workplace, distractions and overtime. This may lead to impression that studying the parts is the key to understanding the whole (things are taken apart, dissected, and then put back together without any significant loss).Now in the brilliant work &quot;Slack&quot; the author has taken much higher leverage, focusing to organization as a whole, but not forgetting about people and interactions. The writer shows that what is critical is the relationship created between two or more elements. Systems influence individuals, and individuals call forth systems.The entire idea of the book is &quot;slack&quot;, and how essential is it for health and growth of an organization.While Brooks' most compelling idea was about the myth of a man-month, Tom DeMarco tells about the myth of fungible resource.Dom DeMarco does not avoid his traditional thoughts that &quot;Hurry Up&quot; really means &quot;Slow Down&quot; and the cost or pressure. The first two parts of the book are related to these problems.The whole part Three of the book is dedicated to &quot;Change And Growth&quot;. Part Four is about &quot;Risk And Risk Management&quot;, where Tom DeMarco shows how vital is risk management to any organization."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"I've had pleasure in reading that book, finding that the incredible Big Mess I'm facing in my company is not a new nor seldom case.All is common sense, like the one that could have preached an old wise Cherokee.

He explains the difference between slack and busywork and re-affirms the necessity for slack in every successful organization. &quot;Slack is the degree of freedom in a company that allows it to change.&quot; DeMraco has conveniently divided his book into four easy reading sections with their own&quot;mini-themes.&quot; I personally found Part Four on &quot;Leadership and Growth&quot; a thought provoking and inspirational &quot;how to guide.&quot; SLACK is directed toward management at all levels. It is especially a &quot;wake-up call&quot; to bad management and poor managers."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"Before I get harsh, I will say that there are definately some good points and ideas that you will go away with from this book. However, the author could have said it in fewer words, and clearer. If you're reading this, I'm sure you've read all the cliche mangerial types of books. This, to Tom's credit, is different than your average manager book, with a different perspective on the surviving the coporate world... but its also a stretch. Much of the points in the book are not only subjective, and not backed with real-life anecdotes and testimonials (there are few, but they are far between), but the analogies are weak, and the diagrams and graphs are subjective and border-line bogus (not constructed with real points of correlated data; they are more like guess-sketches). If you looking for a fresh, quick, to the point book that will keep your attention and that you can't put down, then this is not that book."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"Somehow I managed to give this book only three stars...I couldn't have been more wrong. Over the past several years this is the single management book I keep rereading. This is a brilliantly rationalist book arguing that maximizing the busyness of individual knowledge workers minimizes the effectiveness and productivity of the organization as a whole.This concept is promoted by Eliyahu Goldratt and his Theory of Constraints and in his books like The Goal. Goldratt argued that in in the case of discrete manufacturing-where individual goods are produced in a continual but not continuous process through the discrete application of heterogeneous transformations-as the utilization (or efficiency) of the individual steps approaches their maximum, the productivity (or throughput) of the system as a whole approaches a minimum. Now, knowledge work (like software development - my industry) looks a lot like discrete manufacturing. You have a set of inputs of varying quality: requirements, best practice documents, etc. In a factory, the machines that perform a step in the manufacturing process often differ - they could be different models, have different maintenance histories, have different tolerances with regards to inputs or throughput, or produce at different levels of quality. Tom DeMarco reminds us that knowledge workers are similarly not fungible. Not only does each individual have their own specialties and deficits but people have task switching costs analogous to the set up costs with factory machines.Anyway, this is my desert island management book - the one that's all depth with none of the fluff, and the one that I study for guidance with each management challenge."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"For an enthusiast who read &quot;Peopleware ..&quot; and &quot;Why does software cost so much &quot; this book is disappointing. It discusses a few relevant points, but never enough content and relevance to be a serious book. Demarco could have limited the subject matter into one cute little chapter of a collection to be published as a book. More importantly the idea of &quot;Slack&quot; as it is discussed by the book is not much of a fresh insight. It is coined around the general and obvious concept of a better environment, required for nourishing creativity and quality of 'mind work', which is relaxing and pleasing and not tiring and pressurising."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"Look around, do you notice how certain people get work done (and done well), hit deadlines and still have time to chat at the water cooler. These are the most valued people in any organisation. The 20% people out of the 20/70/10 rule, when given 'slack', over produce, everytime. This book explains how they can do this.Read this book, it will only take a few hours; which includes long pauses for \\"hmmm\\" and chin scratching moments. You'll be glad you did. Then implement what you've learned."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"Great general advice about the importance of slack-time and managing the production of schedules. It also has some really startling, yet obvious after-the-fact, advice about the lack of quality that happens when people feel rushed. Even if they're only working their day job hours, if there isn't slack time in their days, it'll affect their output.The missing piece was really, in my opinion, how to measure 'how much' slack time to have. It seemed hard to get a metric for whether it's being used effectively or not.As a warning, this book basically ignored low-level folks (like myself!), concentrating exclusively on middle-level managers."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"The author has a premise that in today's ultra efficient business we may have re-engineered out the ability to innovate. He argues that for innovation to occur there must be some amount of inefficiency. He calls this efficiency slack. Slack would include time think of the big picture, consider the future, theorize, and explore.This books one weakness for some readers might be the lack of empirical evidence to support these theories. I would argue if the book is approached with an open mind the contrarian viewpoints have considerable logical merit. Even without empirical evidence the author's views are convincing.The chapter on project risk management is an added bonus and it alone makes the book worth reading. I would recommend picking this book up."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"I have read DeMarco's other works with great interest and enjoyment. I agree that &quot;Peopleware&quot; is one of the central books every technology professional should read and apply. However, Slack does not deliver the same level of effectivness and impact.The first part of the book is ok as it discusses the need for &quot;slack&quot; and the negative effects of having all resources fully optimized on productivity and sustainability. However the second part of the book looses steam rapidly and seems to be just criticism of current conditions rather than helping people make the justification and incorporate slack into their business practices.DeMarco is a giant in the software industry that many of the new technology professionals should get to know and recognize. I would strongly recommend that they meet DeMarco through his other works -- Peopleware in particular rather than this work."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"I agree that this is simultaneously a great screed on the inanity of most corporate management, and also a powerful indictment of the tendency of IT management to just go along, accepting a premise that is false and on most projects, is life-threatening.I totally disagree with the one bad reviewer who claims the book is below the bar of even anecdotal, and boring. On the contrary, much of what is argued here is a logical, or purely rhetorical position, but that is the part that is the most refreshing! Whereas Peopleware may be more comprehensive, it is also less bold and rhetorically less daring. I love to see someone like DeMarco, who has proven all he needs to, instead of just churn out another episode in his established realm, provoke, argue, and show the amount of passion this book contains. Only someone who considers rhetoric sinful could find this book boring.That said, this book is also not from left field: it owes a lot to Lean, et al, on the biz and IT process side, and it is also of a piece with other writings like Mythical Man Month. Personally, I think the most important thing about this book is that it is original in its approach and size, etc.: computer science, folks, is not a science, and the fact that it has been controlled by science people all these years, is one of the reasons it has denied many of the hugely important aspects of its reality, e.g. psychology, sociology, etc. We desperately need more books like this that are broadly rhetorical, small, quick reads, that can penetrate into the more densely forested parts of the realm."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"If you are a involved in software management, buy this book. If you are a software developer, buy this book for your boss.Much of what DeMarco says goes against &quot;traditional&quot; management practice, but that is the point of the book. Software development - or the broader term knowledge work - does not present a traditional management problem. Trying to use such an approach robs organizations of their ability to change in response to the situation at hand as well as burning out their developers.Many organizations treat software developers as interchangeable cogs in the machine that cranks out software. The author explains that the people who write software are not such fungible resources. Matrix management is also exposed as not being a great idea for software developers.The author also points out how the overly busy organization is often driven by fear and control. Much of this is a result of the dreaded &quot;agressive schedule&quot; and the pressure that comes with trying to meet it. DeMarco also explains why Taylor's model that helped manufacturing really doesn't apply to software development. Scientific management used for software development is the square peg shoved in a round hole in an attempt to give management a sense of being in control.Then, DeMarco goes to explain what can happen in organizations that have slack. He focuses on the middle management layer as the place where leadership and vision of change for improvement can happen. Sadly, though, this is exactly what many organizations have cut out in the layoffs that have happened over the past few years. The author goes on to relate how trust and safety are necessary for change to happen, i.e. failure cannot always be treated as a bad thing. People learn from mistakes. It takes slack to allow for mistakes and learning to take place.The closing section on risk and risk management were a good conclusion to the book. Building on the notion of the &quot;agressive schedule&quot;, he goes on to explain how each risk is assumed to have a 0% chance of happening in these situations. The tradeoffs and payoffs of risk mitigation are also shown. With risk mitigation, the earliest possible completion date moves out by some amount, but the latest possible completion date moves in greatly."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"This book was recommended to me by a colleague and I was excited going into it but within the first twenty minutes I found the book to be difficult to read for two reason.The first is that I don't feel like this is well written. The author seems to bounce around from page to page. It has a very jarring flow. Perhaps there was too much slack for him and his editor.The second is it's hard to digest and accept a book that just makes sweeping generalities. More so when there's very little proof or info to back it up.Overall, this feels like management psychobabble trying to promote \\"the total paradigm shift to think outside the box\\" as a quick fix. I think he brings up real problems that exist but he seems to present little information of how this fixes it."},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","review":"In this work, DeMarco covers two important and interrelated topics: overcommitment and risk management. His basic thesis is that a fully efficient firm cannot change direction, and has very little flexibility. I do wonder, however, why he chose a magic square (without any explanation) as his example in the intro to part 1..... Was it a hidden point about uniformity?For knowledge work, I generally agree with his main points, and I have gained some inspiration in some other areas as well (for example, some specific cases where matrix management might actually be optimal).However, some other reviewers have misunderstood DeMarco's main point. Efficiency and flexibility are opposite ends of the spectrum. If you want real agility, you have to give up some efficiency, and the opposite is true too. This isn't a matter of work less and get more done (aside from issues of long-term overtime, where it is a valid point) but rather work a little less and regain some capacity to change direction.The second point though is that without slack, one cannot adequately manage risks. This slack not only gives you the ability to change direction to avoid risks, but it provides you with extra resources to overcome temporary and unexpected challenges.In general, I think these are important points and I think that most companies would do well to at least consider these two points."},{"Title":"An Introduction To Analysis","review":"In this textbook the authors have provided an important classroom tool for teaching undergraduates introductory real analysis. Without sacrificing rigor, they treat all the classical topics and principal theorems (convergence of sequences, limits and continuity of functions, differentiation, integration) in a lucid manner by exploiting the elementary machinery of sequences. This approach, free from the technical abstractions of general topology, makes the book much more readable for the average junior/senior level student majoring or minoring in mathematics. I have used the book for a one-semester course, and I don't think I would revert to the standard topological method for ordinary students in a first course in real analysis. Some of the main results can be re-derived as corollaries in a follow-up course on point-set topology for students interested in attending graduate school."},{"Title":"An Introduction To Analysis","review":"I have looked through several analysis books, but as an undergraduate student in mathematics, I found this textbook to be the most appealing. Here is why I'd give this book 5 stars:(1) The straight-forwardness of the text.Most undergraduate math students (it's a very large majority) find analysis to be one of the most challenging courses in the undergraduate mathematics curriculum. Building upon calculus, discrete mathematics, etc., the course delves into a lot of abstract and analytical material most math students have always taken for granted. The point is: it's a tough course, with incredibly dry reading. However, the authors of this book, while keeping the same rigor and thoroughness that the subject demands, write the book in a very reader-friendly manner so that with ample time and patience, students reading the book can fully grasp the material at hand. In classes like college algebra or even trigonometry, such a manner may not always be necessary as reasonably intelligent students can figure out a lot of the material; however, in a course like analysis, a straight-forward language goes a very, very long ways.(2) Examples.I have read other analysis books- some published by Springer, which publishes a series titled \\"Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics\\"- and unfortunately, most of them do not feature too many examples, thus leaving the student wondering if he has understood the material sufficiently. A little application can really help keep the confidence of the reader, and the authors of this book litter each section with an ample amount of examples.(3) The provision of- in a very cautious amount- of answers and solutions in the back.Again, unlike other analysis books, this text provides solutions to some problems in the book of the book. However, the solutions are sparse, so as to help the reader understand the solutions to similar problems in the section, but to protect the reader from the temptation of looking in the back for all the assigned math problems. Even well-meaning students fall in the trap of depending on the answers sections, and this book finds the great balance of providing just the amount of answers in the back.Honestly, if your intention was to learn analysis, whether part of a class or on your own, you will find that this book will provide you with more tools than obstacles. There are, unfortunately, many awkwardly written and confusing math books that exist; fortunately, this book is not one of them."},{"Title":"An Introduction To Analysis","review":"As a math major, this is one of the best books I have used yet.

I use it to teach non-graduate track math majors (many are math-secondary math ed majors). I absolutely love working with this book. Since it is currently out of print I have regularly sought the author's permission for the students to make copies if they can't find it used. I can't wait to see it printed again. It is a joy for me to work the material this way.It is very thorough math, while all the way allowing for almost taking the students by the hand through their first analysis proofs class. The exercises are a real gem.

Hooray! When I got this book from another Beach Boys bud, I never ever knew there had been big emotional victims in the Wilson family prior to Brian. Or that all sorts of other talents and interests had been inherited, too. Never before was the town of Hawthorne made sense of, either. Who knew what teen culture was like there in the 1950s? It was wild to get the day to day explanations. To see how Dennis and Carl, not to mention Brian, chose or got forced onto the roads in life they took. Surprises wait on each page. To ultimately feel so close to the family is a victory. Understanding So.California on up-close and personal terms is gratifying, also. This explicates sensitive people, a community and a microcosm in the detail it merits. It all makes sense."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"This fantastic book isn't just about the Beach Boys and their music. It's about the California that they and their parents grew up in, from the 1930s through the 1960. Surfing and hot rods and local bands take center stage.After reading this book one realizes that Brian Wilson was the creative genius behind the band. His sad emotional porblems and rehabilitation are documented here.Along the way there are many surprises, like Glen Campbell's musical involvement with the band. An absolutely riveting book."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"&quot;Summer Means New Love&quot; and this gets you in the right vibe. But the &quot;disappointed&quot; guy reviewing from Texas is a gremmie taking potshots. Some so-called Beach Boys fans have a chip on their shoulders. If anybody checks, you see the Wilson birthdates given in this book are right. Checking my copy on pg. 339, it doesn't say Dennis Wilson is the &quot;youngest&quot; Beach Boy, but the &quot;California Calling&quot; chapter says send suggestions for future editions, and that small bit was probably fixed. But why say Dennis Wilson isn't in this book, when Chapter 7, called &quot;Gettin' Hungry&quot; is all about him growing up and finding out about surfing? Brian sings, love and mercy is what we need. Amen."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"Wow. I'm embarassed to say that I thought I knew about the Beach Boys before I read &quot;The Nearest Faraway Place&quot;. I was wrong. The depth of vision and analysis is staggering and told through the elegantly unobtrusive Tim White style I have come to expect from the book &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; and his columns in Billboard. It is designed to give you a full picture of the Southern California experience, dating back to the earliest generations of the Wilson family, but,if you want to skip the early chapters, you can go straight to the meat of the Beach Boys' history. Unbelievable unedited transcripts of the dialogue during recording sessions and insightful deconstruction of the cross-pollinization of inspiration happening in the Sixties. Which Beach Boys' song inspired which Beatle song, with help from which Byrd song, etc.; and all culled with interviews from the actual players and composers. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"Timothy White gives us a view of the Wilsons History and the climate of the So Cal music scene of the 50's thru the 60's, where everybody practically knew everyone. It also gives us an insider view of the events that happened to the Wilsons, Loves, Berrys, Torrances, as well as The Wrecking Crew(Campbell, Tedesco, Blaine, Russell, Kaye, and others.....), Spectors, and just about everyone you've ever heard of that made music in the 60's and 70's in So.Cal. Even though he glosses over most of the material that the 'Boys did during the 70's, it's the early work in the 60's that made this for good reading. The recording industry was covered in good detail, especially what happened with the promotion of the Beatles, Beach Boys, and anyone else that was popular during the period. He also went over a lot of history of other groups, that had ties to the SoCal industry. He did a great job overall, and I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the history of music in general, and especially on the 'Boys. Surf's Up, Dude!"},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"A fellow commuter was reading this book and his recommendation was appreciated.

This would certainly be an ideal companion at the beach itself."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"As a transplanted Californian, this book made me homesick for the state and the music that made it world famous.

Loved the trip!"},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"I read this book first after seeing a favorable comment about it from Carnie Wilson, Brian's daughter, and how much she learned about her own family. It was really a fantastic read and taught so much about the music, an incredible amount about California history, and the explanation of the family too and what they went through to even get to California. Since then other people said to me that this book is the right one to read, not the gossipy, putdown books and stories."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"I got turned on to this book by friends after I had some issues with the AMERICAN FAMILY Beach Boys TV mini-series, like how did Murry get so angry, and how did his son Brian become such a delicate case? This book addresses those issues by going back to the very beginning of the family history and relating the origins of everything. Therefore, when the songs later get written, you've already experienced the origins of them. This book reminded me more of recent popular history books like NO ORDINARY TIME, but that's not a criticism. And it could have been titled BEACH BOYS: THE REAL ORIGINS, but what's most important is that it's very satisfying to read."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"Beachmoms respect the Beach Boys too. Brian was very honest with the author, as were the other Wilsons, and it brought a wider lesson to this story. To see greatgrandparents lord it over grandsons and on and on down the line is disconcerting. You see Brian grow up with fear, as he is abused in toddlerhood, suffers bedwetting, anxiety and more is terrible. And then he's made to feel ashamed of his angelic voice! The scene that can't be overlooked is the one where he tells his own mother he never had the courage to give his girlfriend the engagement ring he bought her. Brian was afraid love at that level didn't get returned. The scene in which Mike Love's mother puts him out of the house, throewing his clothes at him, was also important. This is our problem as a society and as parents. Can we teach our children, by our example, to love and return love? And not to break faith with love? We need to give back to Brian and all the other Brian's who only want to offer their loving side. It's time to start."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"I have read many a book on Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys. But I found this title taken from 20/20s Bruce Johnston song of the same name, a bit rehashed from past works. We look at the generations of the Wilson klan from the turn of the century, and thier story. Thier story is one that's pretty. It's obvious that Brian Wilsons problems stem from the abusive character that was his grandfather;but is anybody really THAT interested? This book is meant for the hardcore fan, the fan who has paid-in-full dues to the Brian Wilson Appreciation Society. Musically it doesn't gain any ground. On historical standpoint, however, it does offer a glimpse of the family's personal side. And it is with this, that it becomes seemingly disparaging."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"The Beach Boys and Brian Wilson made unique and wonderful music over their long and successful career. If you are interested in reading the story behind this music there are several books to choose from. This book is probably a good choice for a Beach Boys fan who wants to find out about their heroes' accomplishments without delving too deeply into the tabloid type scandals of Brian Wilson's personal life and the lives of the other Beach Boys. The best parts of this book are the critical examination and praise for the Beach Boys later albums, such as \\"Sunflower,\\" which are sometimes underappreciated, and the portrayal of Brian Wilson's bravery and persistence in battling mental illness. The biggest weakness of this book is the beginning, which seems to go on forever, describing the Wilson family background. Brian Wilson isn't even born until page 64! A smaller problem is that the dysfunctional lives of the Beach Boys, especially Brian Wilson, Mike Love, and Dennis Wilson, were a big part of the story, and probably deserved more attention than this author gives in order to get an accurate portrayal of the subject."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"Amazing: a serious book for adults on the Beach Boys and the place they sang about that treats them like human beings who made fine music. But why did it take so long?"},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"I have always loved the Beach Boys music. Only in the last 6 months have I been interested in learning about the group as individuals, etc. I read &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; by Steven Gaines first. I found the book very informative, with no sugar coating. Next I got this book to read.I can't tell you how disappointing this book was to me. Do I care to read about the grandparents and their lives in Kansas, and how they migrated to Southern California? The furthest back I want to go is to Murry and Audrey, maybe a brief summary of their upbringings, how they met, married, bore their three talented sons - and then off we go from there. I don't care about a long, detailed description of the vegetation and climate of Kansas OR California. Just give me the feel of the place, ok?I tried to read this book page for page, but I could not do it. I found myself turning the pages until I saw at least one of the Beach Boys names, and read whatever it said about them. Also I was very disappointed that this book concentrated so much on Brian and pushed Carl and Dennis into the background. Of course Brian was the songwriting brains behind the group, but without the help of his brothers (especially the inspiration Dennis provided for the writing of surfing songs and the Southern California myth), and the other members, Brian probably would have been just another &quot;genius&quot; songwriter who never got his recognition. I also felt that Mr. White went into long needless detours with characters whose impact on the Beach Boys was minimal, if at all.I would give this book two stars, but I cannot do it for one main reason. Towards the end of the book (page 339 of the hardback copy to be exact) Mr. White writes that Dennis Wilson is &quot;the youngest Wilson brother&quot;... This man wrote a book about the Beach Boys and didn't even bother to find out that Brian is the oldest son, Dennis the middle, and Carl the youngest? No excuses."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"Timothy White is an excellent writer, so it seemed that if anyone could write the definitive Beach Boys biography, it would be him. Unfortunately, his book has proven to be what Beach Boy Carl Wilson said about the group's album &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; -- a bunt instead of a grand slam. One of the book's more curious characteristics is that it goes into exhaustive detail on background matters such as the Wilson family's Kansas ancestry while skimming over major events in BB history. For example, so little is written about the creation of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; that an unfamiliar reader would almost be left with the impression that it was just another Beach Boys' album, which it most assuredly was not. Perhaps White believes that enough has already been written about &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and various other events in the group's history, and perhaps he's even right about that, but then again, aren't those events exactly what a person interested in reading a book about the Beach Boys would WANT to know about? The book's greatest flaw is White's failure to try to come to terms with the central mystery in the history of Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys -- the sudden collapse and withdrawal of Brian Wilson after years of explosive creativity, peaking with the twin artistic triumphs of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Good Vibrations.&quot; Was Brian's implosion the result of drug abuse? Was it the delayed but inevitable reaction to years of childhood abuse at the hands of his father? Did he simply give up because of the failure of the other Beach Boys to support his artistic vision? Perhaps White believes that these questions are unanswerable (and again, perhaps they are), but if so, he should say so rather than simply ignore them completely. Given his apparently unfettered access to Brian Wilson himself, why did he apparently never interview him about this? The loss of Brian left the Beach Boys stranded and changed them from one of the most innovative and important bands in rock to an oldies act literally almost overnight. (Although Brian himself now appears to be healthy and creative again, he has embarked on a solo career, leaving Mike Love to shamelessly cash in on the group's legacy night after night, cranking out the old hits with a group of other musicians he has the gall to bill as the Beach Boys. Mike Love touring as the Beach Boys is like Ringo Starr going on a solo tour and calling himself the Beatles.) In neglecting to address Brian Wilson's mid-60s breakdown, White fails to tell the real story of the Beach Boys, the story of artistic triumph turned to personal tragedy."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"Tim White's book is just as much about the history of California as it is about the history of the Beach Boys. As a non-American citizen, it was a wonderful way to learn about how California &quot;fits&quot; into American culture and how the rise and success of the Beach Boys mirrors the history of that state. I appreciated the personal approach of the story; reading about the personalities of the entire Wilson family and how they each contributed to the personality of The Beach Boys as we know them. It was an engrossing book and I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"Not if you are a true Beach Boys fan. If you think you know it all, think again. This book is so chock full of information you will find yourself reading it 2 maybe 3 times. It begins with the Wilsons migrating to Cailfornia. Tells how they settled, found jobs, all the way up to the births of the Wilson sons along with Mike. Then it takes off without missing a beat. You will picture yourself being there from the very begining. You'll get a good sence of California as well as the group. You'll also end up hating Murray's father Buddy more than Murray. Kind of makes you almost feel sorry for Murray. The only minor dissapointment was White ( Rock veteran Timothy White of Rolling Stone Magazine ) didn't dabble in the Manson stuff. I know, I know probably with good reason, but it is interesting. Enjoy !"},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"Only a handful of rock biographies have made the effort to place a band in its social, familial and historical context. The Beach Boys were America's greatest band in the sixties and this brilliantly researched exegesis tells the story of Brian Wilson's genius as well as such a mysterious phenomenon can ever be explained. In the process, it also tells the story of Southern California: both the escapist myth that came alive in the music of the Beach Boys, and the bizarre reality of a subculture that could nurture and destroy such creativity. Timothy White is the standard in music journalism."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"Like all great non-fiction, Timothy White's book is more than than a recounting of facts: it is literature. The Nearest Faraway Place tells us both the story of the Beach Boys and the society that shaped them. White's style is entertaining and authoritative. And, as always, his research is impeccable. A must read for Beach Boy fans and students of American culture."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"This is an odd book. Timothy White is a very good writer, but his attention to detail seems to focus in strange areas. His exploration of Wilson family history is exhaustive; his portraits of Brian Wilson's ancestors in Kansas and California and of the periods in which they lived is amazingly complete. Yet the book becomes inexplicably superficial when discussing many key events in Brian's life; the recording of &quot;Pet Sounds,&quot; for example, is glossed over so briefly as to suggest that it was just another Beach Boys album. Perhaps White felt that enough has been written about &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and other subjects already, and perhaps he's right; but then, aren't these the types of things that someone interested in reading a book on Brian Wilson would WANT to read about? Most frustrating is White's failure to address Brian's mysterious breakdown and withdrawal after the twin artistic triumphs of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Good Vibrations.&quot; Was his collapse caused by drugs? Was it a delayed but inevitable reaction to years of abuse by his father? Had he simply run out of creative steam? Perhaps these questions are ultimately unanswerable -- but if they are, White should at least say so, rather than ignore them completely. Many books have been written about Brian Wilson and/or the Beach Boys, but to my mind no one has explored this mysterious and central event in Brian's life in a satisfactory way."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"This wonderful work is as exhilarating as Dennis Wilson surfing Manhattan pier and as heartbreaking as Brian Wilson's psychedelic-fueled collapse. White uses the Beach Boys saga to tell the more sweeping tale of the creation of perhaps the most powerful American myth -- the California Dream. From Boeing dragsters in the Mojave to Les Paul's garage guitar genius, from Fairfax High (the nexus of LA music) to Brian Wilson's lonely search for &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, White leads us on a thrilling journey. This is the trip to take!"},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"This extensively researched tome by Billboard's Editor-in-Chief Timothy White tells the story of The Beach Boys while integrating California history of the period. The book was extremely tedious in the beginning; too much minutiae about the Wilson's ancestors and their migration from Sweden to Kansas and finally to California. I don't mind background history, but this was a little bit more than I wanted to know. Ditto for other sections of the book regarding aqueducts, the evolution of the surfboard and surfing itself. I craved for Beach Boys information and would have preferred culling these parts out of the &quot;California Saga&quot;. The actual story of The Beach Boys didn't start until page 85. However, the author provided new and interesting commentary on The Beach Boys, which made this book well worth the read. The thorough recounting of how the Wilson's father and manager Murry Wilson lost his eye in a work accident was riveting. Another section transcribed the dialogue that occurred during an infamous recording session that a drunk and unwelcome Murry Wilson crashed. This conversation illustrates Murry's frustration and jealousy towards Brian and his advancing record production skills. Also fascinating was a glimpse into a day circa 1976 with Brian Wilson at his home. Shattered mentally, he is being babysat by his cousin Stan Love (at a purported salary of $50,000 a year). Mr. White's mammoth research efforts shone with gems like these. Although I was occasionally frustrated with the peripheral California pap, I have to admit the invention of the hula-hoop by the Wham-O Manufacturing Company was a pleasant nostalgia trip. But to maintain my sanity I was forced to page through other non-Beach Boy sections of the book."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"Tying the Beach Boys into their Southern California milieu is an exciting idea; this book, however, fails to deliver. The writing is convoluted, the conclusions superficial and cliched, and the interviews with poor Brian Wilson much less than enlightening; and the narrative sags under the weight of Beach Boys trivia that crowds out what should be a truly compelling narrative."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"Readers will do well to remember the subtitle of this book: &quot;Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience.&quot; White wonderfully evokes the California Brian Wilson grew up in and how that California shaped the direction Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys followed. Indeed, we see how the Beach Boys were very much a product of that California. White is at his best in the formation and early years of the Beach Boys. He clearly fleshes out the people and the events that influenced and shaped them. White alludes to Brian Wilson's need to escape the influences, to push the band beyond surf and sand and hot rods, but he never fleshes out this part of the story. By the time we get to the late sixties, White seems rushed to finish his story. In the previous pages, White had chased every diversion and brought it into relief, but by mid book he glosses over events. As a result, we get very little insight into the workings of the Beach Boys during what was perhaps Brian Wilson's most creative era, the era of &quot;Pet Sounds,&quot; &quot;Smile,&quot; and &quot;20/20.&quot; The last third of the book is rather disappointing. Whereas White had brought the people and events of the early fifties and sixties surrounding the Beach Boys into relief, White relies instead upon his subjects' own words. Consequently, the last chapters read more like summaries of interviews with Brian Wilson, Dennis Wilson, and Carl Wilson than the serious biography of the book's first two-thirds. As a result, Brian Wilson becomes a parody nebulously floating about in the background of the pages. In some places, White's transitions are not the smoothest, and readers may question why certain material is where it is. For example, White writes about the reemergence of skateboarding during the late seventies, explaining quite well how new wheel designs allowed boards to go faster. The next paragraph returns to Brian Wilson, and the reader understands that the material is important to White's tracing of the sport from its early years and its impact on the &quot;Southern California&quot; experience, yet the material has nothing to do with the previous or subsequent paragraphs. White's book is a good history of the the band and its leader, and while not without structural problems, it is fairly well crafted and very well written. Indeed, readers will find White's style smooth and flowing. Those looking for insight into Brian Wilson's artistic vision, however, may be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"With David Leaf's book out of print, I settled on this book to fill me in on what the C.D. liner notes have left out. And what a great time I had. White provides a lyrical description of the Wilson ancestry to provide a history which explains the temperament and personality that came to influence The Wilson boys and Mike Love. All of White's diversions into the cultural changes that happened around the Boys serves to add more sense of how the Boys fitted in to the bigger picture... and how they didn't. Stick with what seems to be at first a grandiose approach to telling the story. Sure, some stuff is glossed over, probably from lack of information. And sometimes it doesn't go far enough to explain the heart and broken heart of Brian. Carl is strangely in the background. But I finished this book feeling much closer to the heart and soul behind the heartiest and most soulful, most honest music to come out of the ugly world that is rock/pop industry. God only knows what we'd have if Brian was allowed to be himself and do what he wanted."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"Vacillates between a geneology book and a book about Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys.

In fact, seems to gloss over the Beach Boys' story making it seem mundane."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"If you're interested in the early 20th-century westward migration, and in the early 60's surf and car culture, the first half of this book will be useful to you. As a history of the band, however, it's spotty at best, especially post-1970: an enthusiastic track-by-track review of 1970's \\"Sunflower\\" album is followed, not by discussion of the \\"Carl & The Passions\\" and \\"Holland\\" albums (which it doesn't even mention) but a capsule history of the discovery of polyurethane skateboard wheels and the revival of that sport. If you really want to know what was on every page of a newspaper from Hutchison, Kansas, circa 1910, then you'll probably like this book.White does seem to love the band, at least.

I would say that The Beach Boys and the California Myth is a better book, but many readers will disagree with that and say that this is the best Beach Boy book. The reason that I have trouble with this book is becasue I grew up in the 50's and 60's and I did't need some one trying to tell about what life was like during those days. Too much time is spent tell about the development of the Hula Hoop, Barby and Kens Dolls, and other late 50's and 60's events. Too much time was spent on the genelogy of The Wilson Family. Even though I did enjoy some of it since I was born and raise in the area of Kansas that the Wislons came from. This book really takes from all the other books written about the Beach Boys, but a reader will be pleased with the new information about the Beach Boys that can be found in this book. This is a MUST read and a book that you will want to keep on your bookshelf along with all the other Beach Boy books that you have."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"All in all a fascinating and detailed amount of interesting info on the Beach Boys marred only by side trips to the Southern California Experience. If you have no interest in geneaology you can easily skip the first 80 pages and not be at a loss. I read them but came away with not much being of interest or memorable. Also, if you have no interest in the various nuances of surfing or gas-powered vehicles you can skip over several more pages scattered throughout the book. But hey, I guess if you pay attention to the title you should know what to expect. The title certainly doesn't suggest that's it's totally devoted to only Brian and the group.But the Brian Wilson & the Beach Boys story alone is worth the price of admission. This includes behind the scenes studio session information, lots of details on all the side musicians who filled in with the group as well as Brian's tragic descent into mental illness. A very enjoyable read even if you just skim over the peripheral material."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"Timothy White's book is a compendium of odd facts and non-sequiters about California culture in the \`60s. The dense text, which wanders all over the proverbial map, sheds little light on the Beach Boys.If you want to know all about the Wilson brother's ancestors, this is the book for you. If you can't see the point in learning about these people, you should be forgiven. These obscure relatives seemed to have little impact on the musical direction of the Wilson brothers and Mike Love, other than frustrated songwriter dad Murry Wilson. And White tends to whitewash Murry, trying to soft sell his image as an abusive, overbearing father who damaged his sons. There are also numerous tangents about California pop culture figures such as car customizer Big Daddy Roth, notable skateboarders and surfers, and musicians who were on the fringe of or well beyond the Beach Boys circle, such as Randy Newman and Don Henley.A definitive Beach Boys biography does not exist at the present time. You have your choice of tabloid pulp such as Steven Gaines' \\"Heroes and Villians,\\" which almost never refers to the music, or total musical analysis such as Paul Williams' \\"How Deep is the Ocean.\\" There isn't much in between. This book doesn't fill the bill, as it neither has much pertinent biographical content or musical analysis. The only redeeming value is that it does give you a slight picture of the \`60s Southern California suburban lifestyle that helped inspire the music and lyrics of the Beach Boys' songs."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"Timothy White is a superb writer, and he really makes one understand why did the Beach Boys become who they were. Why was Dennis such a rebel? Why was Murry so abusive? The answers are here. Brian Wilson is a genius, but his fragile nature he was not born with. The Wilsons were a poor family, and full of hard luck until the boys struck gold with rock n roll.I am kind of angered and annoyed at the foolish people on this comment board that are annoyed that much of the book dealt with the ancestors of the Beach Boys. I am certain many of them are totally oblivious and ignorant of what genealogy is and how families, even way traced back, can influence and impact who you are today. The story of the Beach Boys is a truly American story with their roots going through NY, Ohio, KS, and finally California. Why were they in California? Why did they not stay in Hutchinson, KS? You just can't start with Murry and Audree as one needs to also study Murry's past...HIS relationship with his dad. Get a grip, genealogy hating posters!Why not critics here study their own genealogy if they have the intellectual acumen and they will see how the past can influence the present whether they want to believe it or not. Then they will understand the reason why biographies usually have a huge section on the ancestors of a person(s)."},{"Title":"The Nearest Far Away Place: Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys, and the Southern California Experience","review":"The level of detail in here is absolutely astounding and this is a fascinating book. If you enjoyed Catch A Wave read this next. It will help you understand the genius of Brian Wilson and how he evolved into the master that he is. The history of the Wilson family is so well researched that it taught modern Wilsons things about their heritage that even they didn't know.

I am homeschooling my 6 yr old daughter and we are doing a unit on \\"cavemen\\" before we start history studies with the ancient Egyptians. This book is thin. Physically as well as in content. A much better choice is the Make It Work series - Stone Age. I got this book because it was for a younger age range than most books about the Stone Age, which have an age range of 9-12. That was the mistake. Even at age 6 my kid understands the higher age range books. True, I had to explain some words and paraphrase some passages, but isn't that part of teaching. My advise is don't get dumbed downed books. Get books that are well written and interesting.

In light of this, it is significant that she's a pretty normal person: she neither is an apologist nor apologizes for the terrible times her father and communism wrought, and throughout \\"Only One Year\\", I found myself admiring her objectiveness and independent character. This is not a great book or --unless you're really interested in everything USSR-- a must read, but it paints a good picture from a personal viewpoint of Soviet times and Indo-Soviet and US-Soviet relations. As you may know, the book is autobiographical and about Ms. Alliluyeva's defection to the West while on a trip to India, but there are many asides about Stalinist times.

The stories of family feuds between the Blackthornes and Creeds, and Romeo and Juliette type romances over many years.These are the modern day ancestors of the Sisters of the Lone Star series(\\"Frontier Woman\\", \\"Comanche Woman\\", and \\"Texas Woman\\"), which is a prequel to Bitter Creek. \\"The Loner\\" follows, \\"The Texan\\", and \\"The Cowboy\\".If you have read those first two in the series, you shouldn't have too much trouble following the intricatcies of the family trees. Also there is some mention of previous characters and their roles touched upon in the story. If you haven't read the other two, I would highly recommend those first, to get a better idea of the complicated history these feudin' folks have with each other. This is the first in the Joan Johnston's books, that I felt would probably not stand on it's own.\\"The Loner\\", is the story of \\"Bad\\" Billy Coburn\\", the illegitimate son of the Blackthorne patriarch(\\"Blackjack\\"), and Summer Blackthorne, heiress to the Bitter Creek fortune, and daughter of \\"Blackjack\\". Okay now, don't worry, it had already been established that Summer was not really the biological daughter of Blackjack(see what I mean, it can get very complicated). There are other star-crossed love affairs going on as well. The older generation, has a serious and deadly triangle going on, and \\"Sam\\", the eldest of the Creed siblings, who you will remember from the first story is in a wheelchair due to one of the Blackthorne kids, has also fallen in love, and almost off the wagon as well! Whew!, are you with me so far?So there are a ton of romantic complications, and there is even a homicide to be solved, although the reader will already know who is at fault, even though the characters will try to solve the case on their own. This story though, was not up to par with the others of Miss Johnston's wonderful works. The others in both the Lone Star and the Bitter Creek series, always had some other exciting, page turner, intriguing adventure going on. Miss Johnston had previously seemed to do much research to support the sub-plots. Often even a bit of a history lesson was gained from the read as well. This story had none of that.Even without the adventure,if you have already been reading the Bitter Creek series, you will want to read this one, to catch up with the family story, before moving on the the next one, \\"The Price\\". \\"The Loner\\" wrapped up some of the story lines nicely, and was good but not great, as far as romance novels go. I personally prefer a little more of the action and adventure to go along with it.One of these days, one of the characters will fall for someone who isn't part of the family feud, and that should make for a pretty fresh take. So a bit predictable, but worth the read for fans of the series.Enjoy....Laurie"},{"Title":"The Loner","review":"This book was wonderful. Joan Johnston never fails to write a book that is exciting and romantic within its intertwined plots. I reccomend this book to everyone. I cannot wait until I can read Luke Creed's story."},{"Title":"The Loner","review":"In Bitter Creek, the Blackthorne and Creed clans have detested each other for eternity (or at least three series that has begot double-digit novels). Billy Coburn loves his father's daughter Summer, but they do not share a blood relationship. He is the illegitimate son of Jackson Blackthorne while she is the daughter of the lover of Jackson's wife.Billy has an affair that results in a child. He wants to raise the boy with Summer, but the biological mother sees the infant as a chance to bleed money from the wealthy Blackthornes. Billy proposes to Summer feeling he has a better chance of winning custody if he is a married man. She loves Billy and though angry that he deserted once before, she marries him. They return to his family home since he feels he needs to help his dying mother and his pregnant sister. However, Billy's female relatives loathe Summer though she is kind and sacrificed a comfortable lifestyle to marry her beloved.. The rest of the broods are in the midst of a soap opera too.The latest tale in the Blackthorne-Creed universe, THE LONER, requires a scorecard to keep track of the players. The tale will remind readers of when Bay City and Another World were running stories at the same time. The characters are fun to watch as hatred flows stronger than love in most cases. Fans of the series will find Joan Johnston's latest entry a triumph. For newcomers develop a distribution chart to follow who does what or wants to do what to whom.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Loner","review":"I am a follower of this series and I have to say that this one is another winner. Billy and Summer fell in love two years ago. But things happened that made there being together impossible. Now two years later Billy needs help with his son and Summer just needs to feel wanted. Blackjack and Ren will finally be able to be together if they finally say the heck with everybody else, and Sam finally comes out of his shell and falls for the most unexpected one of all. Luke is treated to a surprise and everyone must overcomes so much to be together. I loved it. If anyone missed the first two I suggest that you read them in order and fall in love with them all.

This book has to be one of the worst novels I have ever read, and I am an avid reader of romantic fiction. The characters are cardboardish and depthless. The plot is thin and contrived. The action is laughable and predictable. It read like a rejected Dallas or Dinasty script written by a 12 year old...It is hard to understand, or to care for the reasons behind the characters'impulsive actions. They go from liking to loving with remarkable ease and I could never get to \\"feel\\" for them. Ms. Johnston pretends to disguise her lack of writing skills with a novel full of black and white characters, subplots that don't make sense, and horrid melodrama (and no, I don't need to read the previous novels in the series to \\"understand\\" this one). The only reason I finished reading this novel was to punish myself for spending $...on trash. Don't waste your money on this one. BEWARE!"},{"Title":"The Loner","review":"I have read the CAPTIVE HEART series, then SISTERS OF THE LONE STAR series and now I've been reading the BITTER CREEK series. These series lead from one to the next. I liked all the books up to this one, J. Johnston was doing a great job! She almost did a good job on this one, but one thing spoiled the whole book for me and that could have been left out whith out spoiling the story. She has the main male character, Billy Coburn, having sex with a bar-maid as soon as he left town and she getting pregnant. He pays her to have the baby and then he keeps the baby and brings it back to his home town. What happened to birth control? That made Billy look stupid and uneducated. The story tells that he had had sex since he was in high-school and never got any other woman pregnant, so why now? If the woman was old enough to be a bar-maid why didn't she know enough to use birth control? The baby was an unnecessary addition to what could have been a good book. I had great hopes for Billy, he was a decent person with a lot of problems in the other books, the author did not treat him well."},{"Title":"The Loner","review":"After reading the The Cowboy and the The Texan, I could not wait for The Loner to come out.

However, if you're looking for depth of characterization or innovative plotting or story lines, don't go here."},{"Title":"The Loner","review":"This is the first book I've read by Joan Johnston and it was OK. Whether or not I read another by her remains to be seen.For me, there was too much going on. Perhaps if I had followed the other books about the Blackthrornes and the Creeds I would have enjoyed it more, but I doubt that. Just because a book is part of a series doesn't mean every character in the series has to be included.According to the back, this is the story of Billy Coburn and Summer Blackthorne. And it is; to an extent. It is also the story of Eve and Blackjack and Ren and Sam and Emma. There are also lots of babies with other people. It was like a theme.I hated most of the characters. Eve was a total fruit loop; Blackjack was an ass and I was never rooting for him. I think the author wanted us to. I think the author wanted the reader to want him to find happiness with Ren Creed. However, he achieved this goal by cheating on his wife. She was a nutter but his wife nonetheless. I also hated the way Blackjack treated Billy, his illegitimate son.It was mentioned at one point that Blackjack and his sons beat Billy so badly he ended up in the hospital. That issue was never dealt with. And then, later in the book, Billy punches the brothers and Summer is all hurt that he could do that to her brothers. On top of the beating, Blackjack went out of his way to make Billy's life hell. Why he was doing this was never fully explained.I liked Billy. He was a good hero to root for and I wanted him and Summer to be together. I wanted Billy to overcome his obstacles. I would have liked it better had he done it on his own. I wish he had come back a self-made millionaire instead of having to wait around on the Blackthornes to decide his fate.I even liked Summer and appreciated that she was not painted as a ditz. I do wish she had chosen Billy of Bitter Creek and the love of her \\"father\\".The book also became a mystery towards the end when Eve died in a helicopter crash thus sending Billy and Summer on a quest to free Blackjack from jail. Why Billy would do anything to help this man who made his life hell is beyond me. This also didn't add anything to the story.Overall for me, there was too much going on. Too many people were having babies with other people either in the past or the present. It was ridiculous. There were too many people and sometimes I felt like I needed a family tree to keep everyone straight. I wish more time had been spent developing the relationship between Billy and Summer because I liked them. For me, The Loner was too much of a soap opera."},{"Title":"The Loner","review":"The 2nd bk of this contemporary western series is &quot;the Texan&quot; and while it stands alone, I think it should be a pre-requisite for this book. The series is wonderful with twists and feuds and love and deception. &quot;Bad Billy&quot; has paid a terrible price because of the treacherous Eve Blackthorn. You keep rooting for him to finally get a break and find some happiness and recognition. Enter Summer Blackthorn, a forbidden best friend.Together they try to weave through the web of lies that have affected their lives. Summer initially is a weak, spoiled little rich girl trying to win her mother's love and her fathers respect. But she evolves and defies them by cancelling her engagement to geoffrey and eloping with Billy Creed. Her father does everything to undermine billy and summers relationship and his family is none too pleasant either! Summer takes the flack and learns to exist in a poor man's world. And she learns to sacrifice for Billy and his son. Although I loved the story line, the author had to repeat so much of the previous history (obviously for those who hadn't read &quot;texan&quot;) that I found that redundant and annoying. Author Joan Johnston is definitely worth watching! She has a wonderful way with words and her characters are realistic, fiesty and the dialogue is witty. A great wrap up."},{"Title":"The Loner","review":"I purchased this book thinking it was a romance novel - boy was I wrong!

In general I have loved Joan Johnston's Blackthorne/Creed series. The characters all have flaws and yet they are all deeply romantic. However this installment seemed to not develop the richness of the characters in the same way the previous books did. I also realize that it's difficult to keep up the intensity of a series that has so many installments; and I do look forward to the next book nonetheless.

My 3 sons rated them better than &quot; The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot;. They each had their favorite chapters which we read again and again. Absolutely Wonderful Books."},{"Title":"Tales of the Restoration, Book 3","review":"David &amp; Karen Mains' Kingdom Tales consist of three volumes: Tales of the Kingdom, Tales of the Resistance, and Tales of the Restoration. First published in hardcover in 1983, 1986 &amp; 1996 with delightful illustrations by Jack Stockman, these three books have been reissued in softcover in 2000, but now with a limited number of black-and-white illustrations by Linda Wells which don't do much to enhance the text. Each volume consists of twelve fantasy short stories, set in a city ruled by an evil Enchanter who has usurped the throne from the true King. The stories are all separate events often involving different characters, but are bound together as part of a larger story as the Enchanted City is rescued by the exiled King and becomes the Bright City, leading to a joyous conclusion as the people of Great Park and Bright City begin the Great Celebration at the conclusion of the Restoration. The main returning character is Scarboy, an orphan boy who escapes from the Enchanted City with his brother, Little Child, and becomes Hero in the service of the King.Although the stories have distinctive allegorical qualities, they are more like religious fables or fairy tales, drawing on the imagery of the kingdom that Jesus Christ Himself taught in His ministry. Under the influence of the evil Enchanter, the people of the Enchanted City prefer darkness to the light, and so sleep during the day and work at night. But the King is at work delivering the city and rescuing the poor and needy and bringing them to the Great Park. Even though the Enchanter's men proclaim \\"There is no such thing as a King\\", the King's men know \\"that \\"Things are not what they seem.\\" They realize that even though the Enchanter had said \\"Seeing is believing\\", reality is different: \\"You have to believe in order to see.\\" Christians will understand that these are important spiritual truths about faith and serving the King Jesus Christ.Each volume has some stories that were especially memorable. With the lifting of the enchantment, the Enchanted City has become the Bright City and in volume 3 the evil Enchanter has been vanquished to the Garbage Dump outside the city, but he and his henchmen still attack the city and try to penetrate its protection. One of the most memorable tales is \\"Mudslinging\\", which describes how some of the King's People in the Bright City are throwing mud at each other. In the middle of the chaos, is a streetcleaner, who cleans the mud from the street in the middle of the fight. The mudslinging stops when it becomes evident that the cleaner is the King himself. The lesson is clearer than mud: Frivolous arguments among fellow believers about who serves God best can detract from their real task in serving God's kingdom, and grieve the King Himself.How successful these stories are on their own apart from the underlying spiritual truths is hard to tell. The moral of the stories is generally quite transparent, although in the case of a few tales it is rather obscure. But on the whole the message about serving and honouring the King Jesus Christ comes through loud and clear. I found the stories thoroughly enjoyable particularly because of this deeper meaning. I suspect that those who don't appreciate the deeper meaning will find it hard to enjoy the tales as stand-alone stories for their own sake. The concept is similar to the Narnia Chronicles, although not with the same degree of success, because the Narnian stories can also function on the level of stories alone. But although the world isn't as fantastic as C.S. Lewis' Narnia, Narnian fans may find themselves appreciating the Kingdom Tales of the Mains for the same reasons: the spiritual depth. They will certainly lead to a greater love for the King and His Kingdom! -GODLY GADFLY"},{"Title":"Tales of the Restoration, Book 3","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful series! I recommend it to anyone who has children, or if you simply like fantasy. What I really appreciate, is although the Mainses are Christian writers, the stories aren't overly &quot;Christian&quot;. They are more like fables/fairy tales where the moral can apply to anyone, no matter their faith. I have to say though, I enjoyed Tales of the Kingdom a little more, mainly because the arwork was better."},{"Title":"Tales of the Restoration, Book 3","review":"\\"Tales of the Restoration\\" is the third book of the \\"Tales of the Kingdom\\" series.

It's truly one of the most beautiful analogies to my understanding of God's kingdom that I've ever read. Every child I read to wanted to hear the stories again and again.

His only hope is to travel into the future to find a doctor who can cure him... Golden-haired American doctor Chelsea Browne was in Saudi Arabia in 1993 helping the poverty-stricken Bedouins. When a violent sandstorm sweeps her back in time, she finds it hard to believe--in fact, since she barely speaks the language, she thought there was just a miscommunication. In a time/place she considered barbaric, justice is swift &amp; cruel, &amp; independence/outspokenness is deemed 'unwomanly'. She ends up alienating practically everyone, but manages to save the kid. Thankfully the 'magic' that brought her eventually enabled her to understand the local dialect. When Khalil becomes attracted to her despite her 'unwomanliness,' she wonders if she can ever go back home again.Ms. Valentine took pains to differentiate Bedouins from our notions of oil-rich Arabs. She also tried very hard to neither romanticize nor stereotype with the real actions/attitudes of such an exotic &amp; mysterious people.

One feature that stands out is her interaction with so many other influential characters of her day. (Though this may simply be a result of the way biographers obtain their material.)The reader must note that the book was originally written in 1944 and therefore the writing style is very challenging (and even dull, in spite of the amazing tale that is to be told) for an 8-year-old. The sentences are convoluted, the dialogue -- which is quite sparse to begin with -- is confusing, and many archaic words are used. My 8-year-old, who has torn through 700 pages of Harry Potter, was very excited to conquer this 188-page biography but got stuck very early on and it was like pulling teeth to get her beyond Chapter 4."},{"Title":"The First Woman Doctor","review":"I got this book to read out loud to my children. They seem to enjoy it (after all, Blackwell's story is fascinating and inspiring!), but I have been disappointed. The characters are rather flat, there is a lot of repetition, and the author moralizes a great deal. I have ended up reading only excerpts from it as I can't stand to slog through the whole thing. Although the book has been informative on the barriers that Blackwell overcame and on her accomplishments, I wish there was more social, historical, and medical context."},{"Title":"The First Woman Doctor","review":"Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman doctor after facing against all odds. When Elizabeth Blackwell was little she always made everything she did perfect. She was always learning more and studied her lessons very hard. As she got older she began to become restless. She felt as if nothing challenged her and that there was something more that she could do. She said that it felt like her life was being wasted. When she was caring for a sick friend, her friend told her that she should become a doctor. Elizabeth took to the idea. She soon went to Philadelphia to take private lessons with Doctor Elder. She stayed there for quite some time and learned a lot, but knew she couldn't go very far with private lessons. She decided to apply to a medical school. Every reply she got back said that they couldn't admit a woman to their school. She finally got a reply from the last school. She was accepted into Geneva College. She graduated from Geneva with a degree full honors. From there she went to work a Blockey Almshouse. She worked there for a while then thought that she would go to Paris to see if she could get a job as an actual doctor. She got a job as a nurse at La Maternite. She worked long hours and the work was very demanding. She had an accident that left her blind in one eye. She then came back to the USA and opened a small dispensary. After a short time the dispensary closed and with the help of her sister and their new friend they opened a hospital where women could work as doctors. The hospital became so successful that with Elizabeth's help a college was opened where women could study to become doctors. She was bored in America so Elizabeth went to England to work more. She did much there and founded the National Health Society which worked on preventing disease instead of just curing it. And finally she died in 1910, at the age of 89. This is a great story of a woman with a good heart and a strong will.After Elizabeth accomplished something she would start planning for something else. For example, after she came back to America from working in France, she started planning to open a dispensary. She thought that it would do some good giving medical help in a poor town. Also, after she opened the dispensary, she started making plans for a hospital where women could work as doctors. And after that, she had an idea for school that men and women could go to become doctors and nurses.No matter what, Elizabeth never gives up. When she was applying to schools, they all rejected her because she was a woman. But she kept trying until she found a school that would take her. Also, when she was working in Paris, there were such ling hours and she was working so hard that she barely had time to sleep or eat. Even though it was so hard she didn't quit. And when she first opened the hospital people were so against women being doctors. If someone died they would say if a man had been working with the patient then the patient would still be alive. Even with the riots she stuck with it until they accepted it.Elizabeth always goes above and beyond in what she does and how she thinks. For example, she always thought of herself as a pioneer. As soon as things went smoothly she got bored and always went on to do more. Also, when she was little and she got punished, she would think of a harder punishment and punish herself. She was always going further to challenge herself. And, when she was at school, she was always studying. She was always reviewing and taking notes. She became very smart and was a top student.This is a great book that shows how ambitious one person can be. I would recommend this book to everyone ages nine and up.C. Chapman"},{"Title":"The First Woman Doctor","review":"I thought this book was a thrilling book and I learned a lot about what is was like for women back in 1840 and about how Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman doctor in the United States. The book starts off when Elizabeth was younger. It talks about how she was a hardworking person. It said that in school she tried to make all of her letters as neat as the writing in the text book. Also that she wanted to do her stuff by herself like tying her shoe laces. Finally, when she was sick she even tried to cure herself. The rest of the book talks about how she tried to get into college and learn how to become a doctor. At this time there are no women doctors and no college would accept her becouse she was a woman. Most of the doctors told her to give up and treated her badly. Some time later, she got accepted into Geneva Medical School in upstate New York. She was happy when she got in but found out that it must have been a joke when she got there because everyone else was a man and she was not being treated fairly. At one point she felt like quitting but she stayed put and became the first woman doctor. When she became the first woman doctor, her example inspired other women to become doctors too. This girl followed her dream. I think this book is also a good book to learn about what it was like for women back than because it showed how just becouse she was a girl she could not do all the things she wanted to and was supposed to do all the things her mother expected her to do. For exsample, she was supposed to sew and clean. This book also was a book for learning. I would recommend this book to anyone how wants to learn about doctors and what it was like a woman in the 1840s."},{"Title":"The First Woman Doctor","review":"I really enjoyed learning about Elizabeth Blackwell in the biography \\"The First Woman Doctor\\" by Rachel Baker. The begining of this book describes Elizabeth's childhood in a fun and educational way. Elizabeth was born in Bristol, England on February 3rd, 1821. Elizabeth lived with her parents, who were very religous, and eight siblings. When Elizabeth was 11 years old her and her family moved to America in 1832 on a merchant ship named the \\"Cosmo.\\" Elizabeth didn't like the move but her father said America had more opportunity for the family. When Elizabeth was 17 her father died leaving her family with no money at all. So to raise money Elizabeth and her two older sisters, Anna and Marion, opened up a boarding school for girls. In 1847 Elizabeth was accepted into Geneva Medical College after being rejected by other schools. In 1849 she graduated in the top of her class at Geneva and was the first woman in the world to receive a medical degree. Then Elizabeth went to go study at La Maternite' in Paris, France. While attending to a baby with an eye disease she herself caught the disease and was blinded in her left eye. She visited England before returning to America.In 1857 Elizabeth and her younger sister, Emily, opened the New York Infimary for Indigent Women and Children. The infirmary wasn't very popular. The most people who went there were poor women who needed help. I think the infirmary was the biggest achievement in Elizabeth's lfe.ELizabeth went to England in 1869, along with her adopted daughter, Kitty, to remain there in until her death in 1910. Elizabeth died on May 31, 1910, in Hastings, England.I like this book because, it was very informational during Elizabeth's childhood and life in America. I like that Elizabeth NEVER gave up and was determined to become a doctor.I recomend this book for people who want to be the first at something and to not give up on their dreams. Also young girls who want to become doctors would really enjoy this book about the first woman doctor, Elizabeth Blackwell. Elizabeth's life story is an inspiration to everyone."},{"Title":"The First Woman Doctor","review":"This book is very informational. Did you know that Elizabeth died at the age of 89!!!

Thanks to a liberal education by her enlightened father in Victorian England all nine children were encouraged to follow their reams and develop their full potential, without regard to traditional social restrictions placed on girls. When the exceptional family emigrated to America Mr. Blackwell embraced the controversial Abolitionist movement--providing inspiration for his older sons wholater allied themselves with the vocal women's movement.Elizabeth proved amply suited for her self-imposed role of medical pioneer, by insisting on entering a medical college--despite the scorn and hostility of teachers, fellow students and even the townspeople of Geneva, NY. No medical school in the States or Europe would consider training a mere woman to compete with male doctors (a medical Citadel). Enduring both physical and psychological hardships she persevered with quiet determination, dignified earnestness, and intelligent observation. She spent a grim summer in Philadelphia's charity hospital and a year in Paris at La Maternite Hospital for Women.Her humantiarian objective to improve the standard of living for many immigrants in New York City tenements remained unflagging for decades. She wrote books, collaborated with other brave women in Europe, lectured extensively and raised funds to exhaustion--all with the goal of blazing new trails for women and community health. In her lifetime she realized many of her dreams: a Women's Hospital, a School to train Nurses, and an out-patient clinic. Most imporatantly she won the right for women to study alongside men and ultimately be recognized as fully competent physicians. Her sisters, Anna and Emily, and her adopted daughter, Kitty, provided encouragement and practical assistance as they adopted her cherished goals. She died in a beloved corner of Scotland, honored by grateful nations. This book is a Must for any course on Women's Rights and 19th century social reform."},{"Title":"The First Woman Doctor","review":"I thought this book was a thrilling book and I learned a lot about what is was like for women back in 1840 and about how Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman doctor in the United States.

He taught at Westminster Theological Seminary for more than 40 years, and was one of the leaders in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church.This little book (93 pages) contains a chapter first published in Van Til'sThe Reformed Pastor and Modern Thought.,, as well as \\"My Credo,\\" which was published inJerusalem & Athens: Critical Discussions on the Philosophy and Apologetics of Cornelius Van Til.In the first essay, Van Til presents an imaginary Reformed pastor, who reasons: \\"The Pope himself, though the vicar of Christ, would still be facing the same impenetrable mystery that is inherent in Reality which he, a pastor, faces. The revelation of God would tend to merge with the theology of man. Man would have to shift for himself; he would have no absolute authority speaking to him. The Pope, though the vicar of Christ, would tend to be no more than a wiser man than other men.\\"Van Til then proposes a dialogue between Mr. Black (a non-Christian), Mr. Grey (an Arminian), and Mr. White (a Reformed Christian). He concludes, \\"It has become even more apparent now that our Reformed pastor cannot, as he defends the Christian faith, cooperate with the Arminian any more than he could cooperate with the Roman Catholic. The Arminian as well as the Roman Catholic fails to present to the believer a challenge to the effect that he needs a radical conversion.\\"This book will be of most interest to persons \\"new\\" to Van Til, presuppositional apologetics, and Calvinist philosophy."},{"Title":"The Silence of God: Meditations on Prayer","review":"This book is extraordinary. It opens us to the possibillity for totally new ways to approach God, faith, and the life of the spirit. This opening is achieved by showing the critical difference between talking about God and talking to God, a God who is present to us in a silence pregnant with listening. This key entry point allows Carse to reveal new meanings of gift, receiving, property, division, and world.This book should be valuable to Christians, Muslims, Jews, and Buddhists alike. It is especially helpful to Christians as we have a faith so overladen with a deadly and moralizing familiarity.One powerful benefit for me in Carse's book is that he opened me up to powerfully new ways of receiving the parables of Jesus and to their intended gift of a disturbing, disorienting suprise. So many of the parables have been reduce to moral platitutdes. Moralizing the parables hides their shocking truth from us, blinding us to the astonishment of an entirely new way of seeing and receiving the world, a seeing and receiving that I think Jesus may have intended with his parables of the Kingdom."},{"Title":"The Silence of God: Meditations on Prayer","review":"A careful read-and it requires concentration, Carse reveals no interest in any mamby-pamby feel-good horsefoolery here-gains one of the rarest rewards in literature: not just the complex made simple, but the delicious experience of having something you thought was only simple turn abundantly complex. Another kudo: no particular religious persuasion, synod or theological bias seems to have sway. Which is not to suggest this isn't about God and talking with Him; rather, it's only about that."},{"Title":"The Silence of God: Meditations on Prayer","review":"Don't be put off by the title!

Carse makes a number of assertions that are material for reflection. He calls prayer begging, begging for life itself. He goes on to explain how our need to be listened to us based on our need to live.At times, though, his meditations are wordy and sound more like philosophical discourse. He makes use of examples and stories which enflesh his points. Kierkegarrd's story of the king and the peasant girl, the couple who through a medium believe they have contacted their son are among several.One can read this small book carefully and use it for meditation, but one has to read slowly. the structure of the paragraphing make it difficult to be meditative."},{"Title":"Introduction to Prakrit, (Panjab university Oriental publications)","review":"The title to my review is tongue-in-cheek; however, to use Woolner as an introduction to the Prakrits (Middle Indic languages) requires a grounding in Sanskrit and in historical linguistics.

I would also like to mention that I am a professional Computer Engineer. I bought this book to quickly learn php syntax/semantics so I could make a simple DB front end.Other than that,1.) The book is rife with syntax errors and typos. Much of the example PHP code won't even come close to compiling in PHP 5.I spent about 3 hours trying to figure out why a few simple lines of PHP code directly from the book wouldn't work. Since I had not been introduced to PHP previously (hence buying the introduction book) I was not able to recognize the errors in the text. The examples were apparently made for a previous version of PHP. It wasn't after googling around for a while I found out the error was in the book.2.) The author had no idea who she was writing the book for.The author states at the beginning of the book that it was not written for programmers (to my dismay), but for someone who could \\"take (the book) off the shelf, skim though, and say, Hey, this PHP thing looks like a neat language, and ever-so-easy to learn!\\"First of all, if you aren't a programmer, you don't learn programming languages. If you know a programming language and use it, guess what, you're a programmer.Secondly, the author wants to assume to reader isn't a computer scientist or programmer, but that they know how to properly set up a linux system with an Apache Webserver and SQL/PHP support. Anyone who is a novice user would probably spend days getting this to work correctly to begin with.Thirdly, nobody picks up a programming language book and randomly decides it's a \\"neat language\\" that is \\"ever-so-easy to learn\\". People decide what they want to learn first and then find a book on it. So writing an entire book on that basis is pretty flaky in my opinion.Another problem with this book I could see was that the examples were introducing unexplained elements. I.e. using language elements that were not previously described. I understood much of it, but for a true novice this could be extremely confusing.In summary, the book tries to compromise between technical value and accessibility to a beginner, but ultimately just ends up with a poorly crafted piece of literature.

It is all about a mind-blowing universal law of nature. Mind-blowing, because it is unbelievable that at the end of the 20th century a new fundamental principle can be laid down. Here it would be of use to remind one shocking lesson in the history of humanity's understanding of the universe. More than 22 centuries ago a Greek astronomer, Aristarchus of Samos, revealed that our planet actually rotates and revolves around the Sun. But only in the 15th century Copernicus dared to boldly recognized this fact of nature thus refuting the long established myth of the Ptolemaic geocentric system. Now from this generous with fresh ideas publication we learn another mind-bogling suggestion that all fundamental processes are reversible, or all processes in Nature stand in a relation of convertibility. And on reading the book one starts to believe that the principle of reversibility appears to be universal as the genetic code for all living things. Besides, on reading the book our everspecialized boffins and academics could eventually know why each physical effect has its inverse counterpart, chemical reactions are reversible, and basic biological processes turn the other way round. To prove his thesis, author created an extremely wide but precise theory of reality which reveals a single underlying mechanism of all natural, mental, and social processes and explains a challenging secret of nature - the causes of the cycling of matter and energy in it. From AI viewpoint, Abdoullaev's comprehensive and exact ontology may well serve as the fundamental knowledge framework for artificial systems with general intelligence, and it looks much superior in conceptual principle and practical application of extant immature and idisyncratic ontologies now hastely constructed for multifarious Web-based intelligent systems projects. Don't want to play a visionary and don't like bombastic stile, but the discovery of the universal law of revesibility is likely to come the most important contibution in the history of modern science and technology. Also the book is sure to become the number one intellectual event although it was not published by a prestigious publisher like the MIT Press preferring to feed us with cut and dried academic materials, as well as regardless of damning opinions of those one-star reviewers. Although, it is pity that the book missed their attention, then it could be distributed worldwide. But thank goodness, it's not lost in the sea of information noise. Let's not make the sad error with Aristarchus' discovery a sort of intellectual fault that is typical for human minds. Apart from this, we are already overloaded with many sorts of &quot;the idols of the mind&quot;."},{"Title":"Artificial Superintelligence","review":"The two tightly-connected ideas strike you as amazed.

This is an awesome little book that I have given as gifts to my business partners, coworkers, friends and family many times. Also a great gift to give someone starting a new job or as a graduation gift. I keep my copy on my coffee table so that it's handy when I need some motivation, inspiration, or just an upbeat, positive thought to clear my mind of all the negatives that we are faced with everyday."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"I never did very well in mathematics when I was in high school and in fact never went beyond pre-algebra. It is never too late to go back to a subject that once proved daunting to now be understandable through this helpful guide. The concepts and complexity of the equations in this guide are one notch below \\"Algebra I for Dummies.\\" It will take you through the most basic concepts in a straight forward manner with plenty of transparency and detailed explanations.I am four weeks into this guide and the companion workbook \\"Algebra survival workbook\\" (which I recommend), and I am nearing the end of it. However, you must go back again to make sure you refresh your newly acquired skills because I went back and realized I had forgotten some minor rules. Once you truly master this guide, you should consider the Algebra I for Dummies. The equations are more complex and demanding (although their equations are even smaller to read in the kindle format). The rules of Algebra is the foundation in understanding the higher order and complexity of advanced mathematics. It is important you don't gloss over anything if that is your goal (it is now mine). Also, this is a supplemental guide and not intended for anyone to master Algebra with it. Use as many various resources as possible. Then take a proficiency test to make sure that you have truly mastered the fundamentals of Algebra I if you're doing this on your own. I found a few random equations that demonstrate an earlier concept daily keeps your skills in order. Also look at Khan Academy online-another very helpful resource.My only reasons for a 4 star review is that I purchased the kindle edition for my galaxy pad and the expressions and equations are rather small so I would often misread the exponent value. You can double tap the embedded block of equations and zoom in. There are also minor editing errors and may be the result of converting a book into the kindle format.Overall I am enjoying and loving to learn about Algebra in a way I never thought possible and I am thankful to the author. This guide is quite useful from a middle school smarty that needs some supplemental guidance, to late bloomers in their forties like me. Adults may feel like the style of writing is rather juvenile-don't be put off or feel stupid because you need to have it spelled out for. Use whatever means it takes to know the fundamentals of Algebra and be set on the road to understanding.Update: After doing the \\"Algebra I for dummies\\" for a bit, I have come to realize this guide was a great starting point, but don't think for a moment you now know Algebra. The author is clear about that. In my continuing exploration I have found many concepts that were simply basic introductions and many concepts were not covered at all. I also found that the style of writing of this guide is by a right-brain dominant person and the \\"Algebra I for dummies\\" appears to be written by a more left-brain dominant person. I tend to be more right-brained. By knowing that I tend to think in a more holistic way, it helps me structure my studies in a more meaningful and accessible way. I need to see the bigger picture before I can understand how the smaller functions relate. The internet is replete with explanations and examples for almost every known concept so there is someone out there who can spell it out for you. My only advice is to stick it out. Learning math is more about perseverance than genius. Give every concept its due diligence and that problem that gives you a headache one day can become a wonderful revelation the next."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"Algebra Survival guide is colourful, fun guide with an answer to just about every student struggling through Algebra 1.

Algebra is not the big bad wolf to me anymore. I am passing this book down to my 16-year-old and my 11-year-old. I wish I had had it for my 20-year-old when she took algebra in high school."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"Oh, man, I can understand why a lot of people would like this book. If you have to simply survive, academically, in the theoretical world of algebraic letters and symbols and operations, then this book breaks it down pretty well. You're not going to be able to use algebra much as a tool in the real world, but you should do much better on tests in school. And for most kids who are being forced to take algebra that is good news.If you want to really understand algebra and how it is applied in the real world, by people who use it on a daily basis to do things and build things, this book is not going to get you there. But it was not written for that purpose. As the title says, it's a \\"survival\\" guide.I'll tell you this though. If you study the history of math you will learn that these early chaps got out into the world. They LOOKED at real things in the real world. They touched, they measured, they got dirty (literally and figuratively) trying to figure things out. Their early discoveries were not derived by pondering abstract ideas in the dark halls of academe. So why do the academics these days think this will work for you? Oh, it's a painful process learning this way - 90% theory and 10% practical. That's why so many kids never get algebra. It's like teaching a kid who has no interest in music all the physics and mechanics of building and playing a piano without ever letting the student see one or play one. I teach elementary school math and the number of kids that come to me who crashed and burned in 3rd grade you wouldn't believe. Why 3rd grade? That's where they throw everything in the kitchen sink at kids. That's where they introduce measurement and give kids no time to measure. That's where they introduce fractions and give kids no time to cut things up. That's where they introduce geometry and give the kids no time to measure perimeters, break spaces up into squares and build things with cubes. That's where they introduce decimals and give kids no time to measure and demonstrate these 10ths, and 10ths of 10ths, and so on. In 3rd grade kids have to climb \\"Mt. Everest\\" after scaling a few boulders in 1st and 2nd grades.What do you have to do to learn algebra? Break it down into it's fundamental component applications in the real world and then DO something with it - work back from real world problems to the math and then back the other way. But don't do it unless you sense a purpose in that direction. It's a soulless exercise otherwise as most students who have \\"survived\\" algebra will tell you.Oh, they do have word problems in this book - as a SEPARATE chapter way at the end of the book. Take a look at p. X in the \\"Hello and Welcome\\" section in the beginning. It notes that the book has 5 kinds of pages. I was especially happy to see the \\"QuikChek\\" page where there are problems which \\"give you a chance to check your grasp of the concept just taught\\". Not! The \\"problems\\" involve no real world application - just more manipulation of letters and numbers.Yes, there are students who can conceptually grasp algebraic operations almost intuitively. They just eat up formulas and symbols and operations. But such students are rare. Most of us need to get \\"dirty\\" in order to truly understand math."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"Book arrived in a timely manner and is a good suppliment for all people who are beginners in or having difficulties with algebra."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"Sorry, folks.

I am a private tutor and I am always looking for supplemental resources that will make things easier for my students, and this book is my absolute favorite math book. The first time I went through it, I even learned a thing or two (particularly about how different theorems relate) and I have been teaching Algebra for 10 years!What Works:- This book cuts through the extraneous clutter often found in most text books and succinctly gets to the heart of the lesson. Information is presented in a \\"question and answer\\" format - for each idea presented, a hypothetical student \\"asks\\" a question about Algebra, and the author conveys the key idea(s) in the answer. The \\"question\\" is phrased as if it were coming from a 9th/10th grader, and the language used is clear and concise.- The author will emphasize key points in a brief sidebar, easily highlighting the essential points.- The author will also point out common mistakes, also in a brief sidebar, and explain WHY they are wrong.- The book stresses UNDERSTANDING Algebra fundamentals, not merely memorizing abstract formulas or methodology.- Topics are organized in a way that highlights relationships between ideas, and shows how concepts build and develop.- The author really does try to have fun with the subject, even including an Algebra wilderness game. Its a bit cheesy, but I find most students do get into it, in spite of themselves. And I jump at any opportunity to show a student that math can be fun.What Doesn't Work:Umm. . . I'm drawing a blank here.I think the only thing I might change is that, in my experience, most Algebra 1 programs include Quadratics and Inequalities, and this book does not delve into those areas. It would be great if those tops were covered as well.I've also found this book helpful in preparing students for the SAT/ACT. Most students take one/both of these tests for the first time in the spring semester of their Junior year, and often repeat it in the fall semester of their Senior year. By that time, it has often been 2 or more years since they have actively done Algebra 1 work - most have gone on to Trig, Calc, etc. Given that the math sections of both tests are predominantly Algebra 1, and this book presents the concepts concisely, in a format that lends itself to easy review of fundamentals, this book can be very helpful when used as a review of Algebra 1 concepts in preparation for the SAT/ACT.He really needs to write an Algebra 2 book . . ."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"I have always noted the large number of poor math books available to the self learner, and so, as a retirement project I decided to set out to find the very best math books for learners, either student, or those that wish to be self taught or to review after many years of lapsesThis book and its associated workbook are two of the the very best 5 Algebra books that I have ever located.Let me say, that I have read and looked over hundreds of Algebra books.

He was pleased to find that the \\"Guide\\" allows him to work independently and at his own pace, and explains the topics covered in a concise, easily approachable manner. \\"Algebra Survival Guide\\" fits our homeschool needs perfectly, and I enjoy both the conversational style of the lessons and easy-to-follow progression of topics.The major flaws I found with other algebra resources we tried were that they focused too much on rote practice, with page after monotonous page of problems, or they used unnecessarily complex language and teaching tools that rendered even the most basic topics intimidating for student and teacher alike. The \\"Algebra Survival Guide\\" avoids these issues by striking the right balance between instruction and reinforcement, teaching well-defined rules via short, witty lessons, then offering adequate practice with the companion workbook.Take into account the great value \\"Algebra Survival Guide\\" represents when compared to other algebra curricula, and the choice couldn't be easier. I am delighted we found the Guide, and I will use it for my daughter in a few years' time as well!"},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"The Algebra Survival Guide is a good book.

This book was very helpful!"},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"What can I say about this book other than I FINALLY GET MATH! Algebra, at least. I bought this book before starting a college level algebra class because I was so terrified I would fail. I knew I was going to need extra sources of help as I have struggled with math all my life. I even put off pursuing the degree I wanted in college because of the math prerequisites. I am back in college now and decided enough was enough - may as well try again. I am so glad I did! I just finished my College Algebra class with a 97 term grade! Yes, a 97: A+! This coming from someone who nearly failed math, physics and chemistry in high school. My confidence in math was so low, I really thought I would struggle just to pass this class.Anyway, here's how this book made such a huge difference for me. Previously, I had picked up math books and begun trying to follow what seemed like illogical steps to me - the books would show examples but didn't explain or emphasize what was really being done in the steps and why. So I would quickly get in over my head because I didn't understand the concepts that the math problems were being built on. That led me to believe you must have a talent for math, an \\"engineer's brain\\", in order to \\"just know\\" how to do math. Sort of like how people have a talent for art or music. But it's not true - you don't need talent for math at all!This book made me realize that math is all about RULES. Simple rules. It's not esoteric, it's not intuition, it's not something you have to have a talent for. It's something that you must simply memorize rules in order to master. And you start not with complex rules - but simple rules, like about the types of numbers, what they are allowed to do, and about properties. MEMORIZE these things and when you see a math problem just apply the rules you already know! The key is memorization of math rules. Memorize, memorize, memorize - and don't move on to the next rule until you know the more basic rule so well that you could teach it to someone else.Take for instance a very simple rule, the rule of symmetry: if a=b, then b=a. Let's say you have an equation: 23 = 2x + 7. The rule of symmetry says that if you want to, if it's easier for you to read or just for the heck of it, you can rearrange that equation as follows: 2x + 7 = 23. You can write it either way because why - because if a=b, b=a, every single time! No guesswork! So if you see an equation written one way in one place, and then you see the same numbers and variables written on the next line in a different way, you can say, \\"okay, this equation was rearranged based on such-and-such rule.\\" And you have confidence then, because you KNOW what's going on, you know it wasn't just some random thing and you aren't lost. I know it sounds so basic and silly, but even something as simple as an equation being rearranged would throw me off in the old days because I didn't know the rules that allowed such things. I would see something like that and just go, huh, okay. I never GOT it and I never knew how to really ask for help because I didn't really even know what I was missing. I just thought I was stupid and would always feel debilitated when it came to math - I thought I would literally never get past it.Thanks to this book I am feeling confident about my future studies. As silly as it sounds to say that an algebra book changed my life, I truly believe this book has changed my life. It has broken down a barrier in my mind and therefore in my life - I am now free to charge ahead in the other math classes I have to take, and I know I have a great foundation to build upon. I encourage anyone who struggles with math to get this book. Sit down with it in a leisurely way, with a cup of coffee or whatever your pleasure, and just read it. Don't pressure yourself to get too many concepts at once - like I said, I really believe memorization is key, and you will know you know it when you can teach someone else. And believe me, you WILL get there! Best of luck to you from a very, very unlikely A+ math student :)"},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"Let me first admit that I am no math whiz, and unfortunately I passed my numerically-challenged genes on to my daughter. She has always struggled in math, and I haven't been able to help her much as the math has gotten harder.So I was really dreading it when my daughter had to take algebra this past year. I still have the emotional scars from hiding under my desk to avoid Mr. Wentworth calling on me!A friend told me about the Algebra Survival Guide, and I got it and the accompanying Algebra Survival Guide Workbook. This has to be one of the best book purchases I've ever made.We pulled out the Survival Guide at the start of the year, and used it alongside my daughter's textbook. Right from the start this book calmed down my daughter's anxiety with its humor and funny illustrations. But even more, it helped her -- and me -- grasp algebra with ease.The book uses a Q&A; approach, so first my daughter reads a question about algebra, and then reads the answer. Somehow this format makes the whole process more fun. The book has great explanations, and then examples showing how to work the problems. We did the examples, and soon my daughter was getting a solid B in the class, and enjoying it, too. As I started reading the book and actually helping my daughter, too, her grade actually went up to an A-, and it stayed there all year long.If you have a child who will be taking algebra, I can't recommend this book enough. My only regret: I sure wish I'd had it when I was in Mr. Wentworth's class."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"With the publishing of this book, Josh Rappaport now stands on the shoulders of another giant - John Saxon, whose respect for students, and love of Algebra spawned the SAXON MATH series which caused a revolution in Math education and almost-single-handedly demonstrated that the problem with Algebra never has been the students - but rather the texts the students have to use!I haven't had this much sheer FUN reading an Algebra book in - forever!Josh's ability to present Algebra concisely and clearly is refreshing andapproachable. There is nothing boring or \\"high-falootin'\\" about this book, and any student hungry to learn Algebra will find the learning with this book a REAL PLEASURE. Well done!

I was determined to return to school and finish my degree, but that would mean learning algebra so I could complete the higher level courses that I would need to graduate. I purchased several other books, and while they were good in their own right, my algebra skills were below even what *those* books required.Almost ready to give up again, I found this book and worked my way through it in about two weeks. All the complexity of algebra was completely taken away and I was able to work with concepts that I had never truly understood before then. Since returning to college, I've maintained a high A average in each math class I've taken and have encountered no difficulty in each course.Math begins at the basics and this book explains those basics like nothing else I've seen. 5 stars all the way, no reservations."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"After tackling a couple of the \\"Algebra classics,\\" and feeling a bit numb and disoriented, we finally reached for our \\"Algebra Survival Guide.\\" Its readability swept us away.

And now, I actually enjoy math. Would you believe that I'm practically a math major right now (actuarial science)?Anyway I'm 28 years old and hadn't taken a math class since my Sophomore year of high-school. So...when I went back to college, I was a little worried about College Algebra.I went on Amazon and just loaded up on math-related resource material.So, I purchased this book awhile back and (with the help of this book) managed to pass my Algebra class with a 92.Not too shabby.If you're one of those \\"Well, I see that, but what about/what if --\\" type people who gets the big picture but gets tripped up by minor details, then this should help you.The book offers nice info on the details. I like the way that it was written, too. The 'silly examples' help to build understanding.It seems so stupid to me now, lol -- but I was getting so bothered with the whole negative/positive thing...especially in lengthy equations.But, I discovered, when numbers and signs are lined up next to each other (applying the Same sign/Different Sign rule) combine and cancel the signs.Duh...lolWell, my textbook didn't explain it that way. But it seems that many math textbooks will just skirt over 'minor info' and common sense language in an effort to clog everything up with complexities....and unfortunately I had a robotic algebra instructor who taught just like the book. That is, if my math book could've sprouted legs and spoke...Anyway as a rule I tend to study with 2-3 books because the 'textbook' explanation is hardly ever clear enough.But, math isn't difficult when you take it piece by piece. Imo, it's just a skill.In my opinion, most ppl have issues with mathematics because they:a. Don't know how to study math. Sometimes you have to re-write in your own language.b. Don't 'practice' or perform math drillsc. Receive poor instruction. I know that many like to blame the teachers and there's some truth to that but this attitude just sets a child up for failure, imo. This way of thinking certainly won't help them in college. In reality, the individual is responsible for their OWN education and understanding. Ppl have to teach their kids how to take ownership. How to be self-reliant.Everyone WON'T hold their hand...even if it *is* their job....and, I've found that most ppl have difficulties because there are holes in their understanding.Can't do algebra if you don't understand basic arithmetic...and you can't do advanced math if you don't 'get' algebra'.Study using multiple resources. Buy a workbook or two. Get some tutoring.Whatever -- but you have to get the basics down.That's the core...upon which future understanding is built."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"My 12 year old (7th grade) was put into Algebra 1&2 with no pre-algebra.

Each chapter was easy to understand. By the time we finished each section, even I felt confident with the information. Both he and I constantly refer back to this book every night when he comes home with his homework. Even if the homework is not exactly like the projects in the book we can find info that helps.

But if you watch a lot of TV (as most young folks do), you would probably like the artwork - it has the scattered wild and crazy appearance found in many cartoons.I recommend this book if you need help with basic concepts of algebra.

There's also a workbook, which we later purchased. Some of our teachers use this book with their students to supplement the school textbook--but we really bought it to help the teachers re-learn algebra! The only quibble we have with this book is the background graphics, which are overpowering and kind of distracting. But it's worth it for the excellent explication of algebra concepts.

I breezed through the book in just a few days and have purchased the companion workbook to practice the skills covered before moving on to higher level Algebra, geometry, trigonometry and Calculus.While I never had particular trouble in grasping the concepts of math in a procedural \\"follow these steps to get the answer\\" sense, where I did always have trouble was in asking \\"why\\" in regards to the mechanics of the topic... why is a certain type of problem solved the way it is, why can't you do X to solve the problem, etc... and both the school-issued \\"official\\" textbooks on the subject and the teachers rarely seemed to have very good answers, mostly ones that could be summed up as \\"you just can't\\". On occasion, the answers provided even served to prompt additional questions or caused confusion. Whether this was out of unwillingness or inability to better explain the mechanics of algebra, I couldn't say.Since high school I have found myself using a surprising number skills learned in algebra, geometry and trigonometry in the fields of programming and web/graphic design (sometimes even enjoying it!). That said, there are many other skills in this subject that I haven't used since then and have subsequently faded from my memory, along with quite possibly the majority of the vocabulary. From this perspective, and that of wanting a thorough refresher of high school level math before tackling the college level math involved in computer science, I feel that this book is an excellent refresher. I read it from cover to cover, just skimming over some sections covering topics that I still know well, but taking the time to read some sections several times and following along with the break-downs of the sample problems covering areas where my memory is less clear. I never got that sense of \\"just because\\" that I mentioned earlier while reading this book, and feel that the approach the author has taken to dealing with areas of potential confusion are highly effective.As such, I definitely recommend this book for people in similar situations as me, and also feel confident that it would be a good extracurricular guide for those just learning it for the first time.

Also check out theAlgebra Survival Guide WorkbookIt makes a great addition to the Survival Guide, and gives excellent practice of the key concepts introduced in the Survival Guide in an easy and fun way. Don't be fooled by immitations! This is the real algebra help book."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"This book is basically a pre-algebra book. For students who have already completed pre-algebra and are now taking algebra, they would find \\"The Everything Guide to Algebra: A Step-by-Step Guide to the Basics of Algebra - in Plain English!\\" far more useful. The Algebra Survival Guide wastes a lot of space that could be used better for instruction. It also provides problems on each page, but also includes the answers on the same page which makes it difficult to use as an exercise book. Further, it emphasizes number properties such as reflexive property, symmetric property, and transitive property, which are rarely taught but ignores more common number properties such as inverse properties. But as for basic algebra, the book is very lacking."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"I bought this book to homeschool my granddaughter, and I am not good in algebra. It makes all the steps easy, taking them one at a time instead of going through a bunch of things at once. You need to get the workbook as well in order to have very much practice, as each step only has five to ten problems, and the answers are right on the same page as the problems. The workbook has many more problems, follows the guide for each step taught, and has the answers in the back.My granddaughter, who is in 9th grade, is able to go through it and understand pretty much on her own. This book is good for someone not very motivated to learn algebra, as the others I tried go into it too fast, which discouraged my granddaughter because she doesn't like math and doesn't try to understand it. The Algebra Survival Guide, along with the workbook, makes it much easier to teach her."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"This is a great resource - make sure to get the workbook as well! I'm totally satisfied with this purchase!"},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"I have a 12 year old son who has finished a pre-algebra course and now we're looking for a good algebra book. We stumbled across this and thought this might be a great introduction/review/bridge between algebra and pre-algebra.Each page covers one basic concept of algebra. It is written in a question and answer format. For example; What if the neighbor sign rule? Then there is a short and simple answer with some examples. Then there are a few problems for you to solve with the answer given on the same page upside down. The questions are grouped into categories such as negative and positive numbers with just about everything you might need to know for those types of problems.In my opinion, this is not a replacement for teaching algebra. It is a good book for reviewing what you already know. It is a good book for introducing you to concepts that are coming up. It is a good bridge book between algebra and pre-algebra. But to be a good book for teaching it needs a lot more practice problems. And although you can buy the Algebra Survival Guide Workbook, there are still not enough problems to really ensure you know it all.This is an excellent support book. It will be a great boon to those that need help with algebra. I just wish the authors would make more books like this in other areas of math (like geometry)!Be sure to get the workbook if you need more practice.Well worth every penny.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"This is a very good book. Math is definitely not a strong point for me, and I struggle with it and get frustrated. However, this book is laid out in such a way that it's easy to follow and understand, much like a good (and rather entertaining) set of assembly instructions would be, instead of a knot of letters and numbers. I used this book the year between when I took Algebra I and Algebra II, and I must say the review is helping; I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of Algebra fundamentals. So try it!"},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"As an adult who would prefer not to have to do math of any kind, this is one book that I have been able to get through. And it really went through all the algebra I had hoped to cover. Might have liked a few more practice problems and answers thrown in there, but I understand there is a separate workbook. There are practice questions, sometimes I would have liked a few more, though."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"I bought this in highschool,and I didn't like math fully until my last year of it. And then I've been keeping at it since. This book really helped when I got to college. I wish I knew that it had a workbook. I probally wouldn't of rushed through it. I'm going to get another copy and that workbook. It is worth having around."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"Great book! I bought this to help me brush up on my Algebra skills and test out of my college math placement. It worked. Very easy to follow. Author takes each problem step by step.

I'm terrible at math and my advisor registered me for PreCalculus Algebra. I was freaking out until I found this book and started reviewing it. While it wasn't the answers to everything there is to know about precal, it was an amazing book as it taught me everything I needed to know about the fundamentals of Algebra. It's written for high school students but it was still a great book and very easy to use and learn. The examples and the problems to work out were top notch. So far I'm doing great with precal and it's all because of this book! GET IT NOW!"},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"This book and its companion workbook are the best! It is step by step and EXPLAINS everything every step of the way. The book is very thorough without being overwhelming. Those afraid of math - buy this book as it doesn't talk over your head. Or worse, talk down to you. There are lots of practice problems with ALL the answers to every practice math problem. This is important because there are numerous math books that give practice math problems but do not give the answers to all the math problems leaving you to wonder if you got the answers right or not. AVOID THIS FRUSTRATION with this book and its companion Algebra Survival Guide Handbook.Buy the companion Algebra Survival workbook and you won't regret that purchase either. I purchased the Algebra Survival Guide and its companion workbook at overstock dot com. Use ebates dot com to get cash back. Prices vary so compare to see which website is cheaper. This book is a life saver. I have been out of school awhile and I understand this book better than my old high school teacher.June 2012 update: I purchased this book and the handbook AGAIN - this time as a gift for an older relative who decided to go back to college. She gave the books two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"This is the greatest math book you will ever read, but know that this is for Pre-Algebra. It does not cover functions or logarithms at all. I read this book thoroughly in 2 weeks and did all of the practice questions and did not find any major errors (a few grammatical errors). This definitely refreshed me in algebra and I even learned a few new things. I tried jumping from this book to a college algebra book and was completely lost. I will need to transition into Algebra I or II for Dummies before reading my college algebra book. I wish Josh Rappaport would write more books like this for advanced algebra and calculus."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"The Algebra Survival Guide by Josh Rappaport is the book I go to when I must tutor algebra to students who are truly and thoroughly befuddled. They find it clear, fun to read, well organized, and not at all confusing and in teeny type like their class texts. They like the size of it, the color, and the accessibility. As a tutor, I like all of these, as well as the fact that it does not divide Algebra into Algebra 1/2 and 3/4. Students who are lost don't need to know what level they are studying, especially is they are from very competitive schools where your level really matters. This little book takes a load off. If the tutor herself is not a math whiz (me) the books enables me to teach algebra well and to feel confident in what I am doing. Thanks for the work book and answers -- that really helps students solidfy their skills. I have looked at all products on the market in this subject area, and I always come back to this one."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"I love, love, love this book. I never thought it was possible for math to be fun, but this book manages it. I look forward to our math periods now and even my most challenged 7th graders can get the concepts the way they are laid out here. We will be through with this by the end of the year, so what next, Josh? Thank you for making it possible for a right-brained person have a blast teaching math."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"I purchased this book last spring in order to prepare myself to take college algebra this fall. In high school I failed algebra and I was beyond confused or befuddled. I put off going to college for 10 YEARS simply because I didn't want to do the math. I was dreading the idea of having to spend the summer studying it. I've always had a fear of math and algebra, and over time I began to hate it. Now when I say I hate it, the term hate may not be enough; my loathing was beyond measure; but from working through this book something amazing happened; I don't hate or fear algebra anymore! Seriously!!! And I understand it! And not only do I understand it; I enjoy it! If the idea of enjoying algebra makes little or no sense to you, if you have spent your time and your money struggling through books or classes that are boring, uninformative, over your head, and/or just plain stupid, then really, this book is for you! Please don't pass this book up; it will change your life. And if you could understand how much I hated algebra, you would understand how good this book really is.Josh, you changed my life! Thanks!!!"},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"This book is excellent. I took all the math offered in high school and college algebra (20 years ago!) My 7th gradedaughter is struggling with pre-algebra and I couldn't remember a thing to help her. I ordered the Survival Guide and workbook and they are both fun! My 12 year old works out of this book on her own. It really is self-teaching. Each section takes you step by step through the concepts explaining in simple terms how to do the problems. I am learning all the Algebra concepts and love the way the book is laid out. Very direct, simple, engaging & great to look at visually. I am an artist by profession and give you kudos on the graphics. I also substitute teach in our public schools and this is a great book to learn how to teach basic algebra. I work with a lot of special needs students and knowing how to explain the algebra in fun and practical ways is a blessing. I recommend this book to teachers, parents and students."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"Let me start by saying that in High School, I felt like a mathmatical retard. I failed math horribly. I never got the basics. It didn't help that I was a bit lazy, but nevermind that! At age 30, and a liberal arts degree later, I decided it was time to learn Algebra properly, once and for all. This book, and the workbook that goes with it was a balanced and enlightening start that truly was painless. I have just about finished the book and will be moving on to harder algebra.

I probably would not have shopped this book because the cover gave me the impression of chaos. I feared that the pages would be full of text that would baffle us even more. I bought this book and workbook based on the customer's reviews...and am I happy I did so. I learned not to judge a book by its cover. The book layout is easy to read with one problem per page in step-by-step detail. This is exactly what I've been seeking. Too bad Rappaport does not have a book on Geometry...that's our next level.ps.

The sheriff is named Josh Rappaport. But Mr. Rappaport doesn't tote a gun, no sir--his weapon doesn't mutilate, it enlightens. His weapon is the ALGEBRA SURVIVAL GUIDE ( A Conversational Handbook for the Thoroughly Befuddled). Oh my! This handbook has so charmed me, I'm reading it like a novel. Good sign, right? It's no chore reading Josh Rappaport's gem. And you will also love Sally Blakemore's illustrations. She gets it! that falling down a hole feeling ( You have to buy the handbook to see Ms. Blakemore's visual take on fear of Algebra).So, come on grownups-who-never-passed-Algebra...wouldn't you like to live a full life? wouldn't you like to give numbers, then Algebra, a chance?

I found this on a fluke and took a chance on it. Josh explains things so well, and his book is helping my daughter breeze through Algebra so effortlessly, that I catch myself thinking, \\"This is too easy; can she really be progressing?\\" We enjoy getting a little goofy with Josh's conversational Q/A style that introduces each textbook page; even when the concept is a simple one, my daughter comments that Josh makes \\"the obvious\\" funny instead of boring."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled","review":"I purchased this book because my eighth grader will be taking Algebra I this year and I knew that my rusty algebra skills would be of no help to her when it came time to slog through homework. The first thing I've got to say about this book is that I wish I had Josh Rappaport as a teacher all those years ago when I took Algebra I and II! With his book he takes you step-by-step through everything you'll need to know about basic algebra by using a very easy to read Q and A format. Best of all he does it with a delightful sense of humor and absolutely no suggestion that any question is too basic to cover.

Flipping it open, one finds such important questions as: who's the best baseball player? which art museum is best? addressed. These are all questions that people have idled away time answering; the value Poundstone adds is having researched them. He provides just enough information--even on topics for which I don't have much expertise I found his commentary interesting. Even for those who don't care about the details the book is worth flipping through to see the comparative charts and conclusions.Some of his choices of important questions to answer seem a bit odd (what's the most difficult shot in billiards) but even these result in a brief, interesting chapter devoted to some topic I'd never previously pondered."},{"Title":"Reputational bonding of job performance: The wage consequences of being fired (Working paper)","review":"There are not many books dealing with Joyce's literary opinions and few are privy to what Joyce actually thought about modern literature or modern writers. Arthur Power (1891-1984) was just establishing himself in the Paris of 1922 when by chance he met Joyce at at dance hall, the Bal Bullier, after a young French 'blanchisseuse' stood him up. What followed was an intimate friendship where the 40 year old Joyce and the 30 year old Power talked and discussed many topics such as Russian Literature (with surprising comments by Joyce on Pushkin: 'He was born a boy, lived like a boy and died like a boy'), the merits of Thomas Hardy, modern, romantic and sentimental literature and even a topic Joyce eschewed, religion. Power's recreation of his conversations with Joyce are almost Boswell-like in their idiosyncratic moments and literary style, no doubt due to Power scribbling down what Joyce said to him every evening once gettnig home to his artist's garret.This is a book to go alongside Budgen's own account of his frienship with Joyce and gives you a broader insight into Joyce as perceived by close friends in contrast to the distant, non-commital but polite evasiveness he often displayed when approached by strangers."},{"Title":"Meditations from Conversations With God, Book 2: A Personal Journal","review":"As stated in Book 1, God speaks to us through many forms and I believe these Books are a powerful message to a society that is in denial. They confirm the message that we are God created exactly as himself and that once we know ourselves we know God. This makes a whole lot of sense. The powerful message regarding religion has confirmed my feelings for years that religion is not good for us. I have grown as a person spiritually since leaving the church and the journey is one that gets better with the material that presents itself such as these wonderful books.

As a student of metaphysics for many years, this book is wonderfully expressive of all the things I imagined God to be. God's ideas about sex, religion, politics, education, and business are awesome. I tell everybody about this book and I wish everybody would read it and start to adopt the ideas put forth and really create some radical changes in our world as we approach the millenium.Even though we have been on this planet a very long time, we as a people have not advanced very far in our spiritual development and evolution as is in evidence by the sad state of affairs our world is in today.

Breaking the wisdom down into small &quot;daily meditations&quot; means you can ponder on the ideas and insights without having to read the original book properly!Since I first discovered the CWG books in the late nineties, hardly a month has gone by without me dipping into one or another of the series. Although I personally have not used this book in the way prescribed as I already keep a diary, I have folded the pages of my favourite quotes to glance at occasionally e.g. &quot;You call forth precisely what you think, feel and say&quot; (January 17th), &quot;The young people are destroying your way of life. The young people have always done that. Your job is to encourage it. Not discourage it&quot; (July 24th) &quot;All attack is a call for help&quot; (September 29th) and so on.The Conversations With God books, including this one, are contemporary spiritual sanity, clarity and hope for the future.

A follow-up to Culp's classic \\"Born of the Sun\\" this book continues the story of Kid; his pal Africanus Colt; cowhands Pegleg, Hash, Poco, and Clendenning; and the Tail End Ranch. The hog drive is only one episode in the story. Narrated in first person by 15-year-old Kid with a dry, self-deprecating wit, the book has a surpassing feel for the land and the authentic details of life in an era when a man could go into town for a rousing Fourth of July celebration where the highlight of the day was blowing up an anvil or could come home to find his wife and children had been carried off by raiding Comanches. Culp has a spare, understated, writing style and a gift for creating living, breathing, colorful characters liberally laced with both grit and humor. (Note: The only other hog drive story I know of is Julia Brown Ridle's \\"Hog Wild.\\")"},{"Title":"Nerve","review":"Dick Francis has written so many bestselling mysteries, it's mindboggling. He excels in crafting enormously engaging, civilized whodunits, which go down smooth as cognac. Mr. Francis has a habit of introducing elements from the racing world into his novels (for those not in the know, Francis used to be a jockey). Yes, it's true that his heroes all come from the same mold and the stories do contain certain formulaic elements, but I think Francis's magic lies in the humanity and empathic nature with which he cloaks his protagonists. His heroes are all too human, all too flawed, and uniformly unassuming and Britishly reserved. Yet, without exception, they all have unexpected pluck, hidden strength, and the inner fortitude to do the right thing. In four decades, Mr. Francis has written some of my favorite mysteries: Forfeit, Rat Race, Reflex, Hot Money, The Edge, The Danger, Decider, and To the Hilt. And then there's Nerve.Nerve holds a special place in my heart. I first stumbled across Dick Francis's mystery books years ago when I was a kid thumbing thru a Reader's Digest book. That book contained a condensed version of Nerve, which I went thru in a flash. As soon as I could, I went to the public library and borrowed the full-length version and tore thru that one, too. Since then, I've read everything that Dick Francis has ever written and I've enjoyed every one tremendously (even his anthology Field of Thirteen), but, thru the years, I've come back again and again to Nerve and its charismatic hero Rob Finn. It's just such a darn good story.Nerve, published in 1964, was only Francis's third novel at the time. Yet, even back then, he had what it took to tell a captivating, suspenseful story. The quick plot breakdown of Nerve: Rob Finn has started to make a name for himself as a jockey when he is kidnapped, tortured, and left for dead. Torn up and bleeding, he manages to escape and get help. He then coldly plans his revenge on the bloke what did him wrong. Sounds like a simple plot, but Francis uses his narrative skills to lure the reader into following Rob Finn as he attempts to get back at his disturbed tormentor. It's gripping stuff. Francis's detailed breakdowns of Finn's pain-filled efforts to get back to racing form so soon after he was tortured will make you cringe, as you wholeheartedly pull for the fella. Our hero is very human, vulnerable, and very relatable. Yet, Francis is talented enough as a writer that, by the end of the book, you'll feel some sympathy towards the dastardly villain. And, as an added bonus, Francis throws in one of those unrequited love subplots, as Finn, who has been eternally in love with his beautiful, talented cousin, Joanna, bittersweetly continues to carry his torch. Joanna, alas, does not reciprocate.I don't know how Dick Francis does it. I'm not into horses or horse racing. Yet, his books never get old for me, and the horse racing elements actually become interesting stuff. I really, really believe Dick Francis's gift, when it gets boiled to its essence, is how well he's able to make the reader relate to his lead character. Every one of 'em is immensely rootable. Before I read Nerve, I mostly read fantasy and sci-fi novels. Nerve introduced me to the world of mystery novels. So, for that reason and also because it's a crackling good tale, Nerve will always be one of my favorites.Also, glad to hear that Dick Francis has a new book (Under Orders, starring Sid Halley) coming out in a few weeks. I cannot wait."},{"Title":"Nerve","review":"This is one of Francis' very first books. Written in the early 1960's and set in England, 'Nerve' concerns the exploits of a young and aspiring top steeple-chase jockey. If you haven't read Francis before, you are in for a very nice and enjoyable low-key thriller. Its hard to point to another author and say that Dick Francis is like him or her, because his work is so unlike other writers. Every one of Francis' books has pretty much the same plot outline, but in a strange way, this is not at all bothersome. One reads a Francis book to enjoy the characters and the inordinant amount of plot laden tension that is somehow packed into such a mild mannered little book.Every time I pick up one of Francis' books I think of the Jean Cocteau movie from the early 50's I think called Orphius. Its based on the old greek myth where some guy goes to hade's (the ancient greek underworld) to rescue his wife who was stolen from him by a god. He gains her freedom on the condition that he not look at her on the way back until they are out of Hade's. Only at the very last step, he does turn around and she is turned into a pillar of salt or something like that... Anyways, in Cocteaus version of the myth, he has the main characters cast as poets, and they drive around the French country side being flocked by admiring fans and lovely young women. The poets there are the rock stars of that fictional society. Well, Francis creates a world very similar to that with his horse racing books, where the entire country of England revolves around the going ons of different aspects of racing.One interesting aspect of this book, discussed by other readers in this review forum, is that of the human condition known as 'Nerve.' Rob Finn is made to look as though he has lost it over the opening chapters of the book and the mystery revolves around why this was done and exactly who is behind it.I would highly reccomend this story to anyone... Its a short novel that has with held the test of time though it is entering its fifth decade since publication. It's not the greatest mystery ever written if only because Francis never really took a risk as an author. But this is also one of Francis' very best efforts and will entertain you in a mild mannered way."},{"Title":"Nerve","review":"I bet this is the best of Dick Francis mysteries. But I haven't been able to write a review for a long time. Because I can't describe why this book is so fascinating without destroying the mystery. This is a rather astonishing, extraordinary story, and I'd like you to read it without any preliminary knowledge if possible.If you are not interested in horse-racing at all, don't worry. I am not interested in horse-racing either, but I can enjoy Francis novels heartily."},{"Title":"Nerve","review":"Although I normally enjoy DIck Francis I found this particular book a little slow and hard to actually get into.Even that being said it was still a good read."},{"Title":"Nerve","review":"Wonderful!!

A great story, believable characters, interesting inter-personal dynamics, and very enjoyable. Probably one of my favourites."},{"Title":"Nerve","review":"I like Dick Francis' books as they keep you involved with more than one story woven together. Nerve also gave a glimpse into how people can let their childhood turn their minds to wickedness instead of moving on with life."},{"Title":"Nerve","review":"I always love Dick Francis books, they are easy to read but never predictable. It shows that his knowledge of being a famous steeplerchaser and devious mind go together to create many masterpieces.All people interested in crime stories should have a go at reading his books.

The plot seems to be shorter than Francis's other novels, but still enjoyable nonetheless.Story tells about a beginner jockey who takes advantage of a chance to race on a good horse. That chance takes him to the winners' circle. However, all this success is envied by some of those around him, that cause him to suffer loss after loss. The jockey starts an investigation that leads him to learn of his enemies. The hero's character is explained piece by piece as the story unfolds and becomes more interesting, especially with his love for his cousin.Whether you're a horse-race fan, or not (like me), you'll still enjoy this novel. The ending is missing a bit of closure, in my opinion, but still has style and reveals more of the jockey's character."},{"Title":"Nerve","review":"The plot of this story is fascinating. A man who loves, more than anything, to race horses finds suddenly that, not only can he not win races, he can't even put on a good showing. At first he dismisses the presumptions of those around him, that he has 'lost his nerve' due to an accident, but when his bad streak just won't end even he begins to question himself. While he searches for answers to his own inadequacies he also looks into the death of a colleague and friend. While the story is not earth shattering, it's certainly good for a rainy day."},{"Title":"Nerve","review":"At the start of \\"Nerve,\\" one of Dick Francis' earliest and best books, the hero, Rob Finn, has a a couple of problems. A rising young jockey, he is something of a misfit in a family of talented musicians. And he's in love with his first cousin.Soon there's another, more threatening problem. All of his horses turn into lethargic losers. The whisper at the track is he's lost his nerve.To save his career, Rob Finn must tackle the mystery of the sluggish horse as if his life depended on it.

Well done."},{"Title":"Nerve","review":"Every time I think Dick Francis cannot keep me interested anymore he does it again. I loved this story. He is the jockey in this one. There is the strangest love interest. As usual it gets really scarey!"},{"Title":"Nerve","review":"Nerve by Dick Francis kept me up long past my bedtime because I just had to know \\"how it was done!\\" This has happened to me before when reading Francis' books. Like always, the tale takes place amid the hustle and bustle of the horse racing scene and it never ceases to amaze me that he can write so many complex mysteries while never leaving the race track. This story is about rumors that are wrecking jockeys' careers. Once started, they grow like a monstrous virus, destroying careers, lives and men who are helpless to defend themselves against the unrelenting whispers. Mean spirited gossip changes quickly into dangerous malice when the evil tongues start trying to tear down a man who knows he hasn't lost his nerve. Rob Finn may have doubts about some things, but he has none about himself, at least not in the beginning. Then a strange run of bad luck begins to chip away at his confidence. Unraveling the mystery Rob figures out how and why jockeys are being ruined and by whom. Then I still couldn't go to bed, because now I just had to know what Finn was going to do about it!"},{"Title":"Nerve","review":"Rob Finn is a misfit in his family of accomplished professional musicians. Somehow he was born totally unmusical. Pretty much ignored by his parents, he learns to ride knocking around Australia and South America. Back in England he gets hired as a jockey.Trainers give him horses to ride that nobody else wants. Rob is fearless, even with the worst tempered animals.Meanwhile, strange things are happening in the racing world. One jockey commits suicide. Others are losing their jobs because of rumors of dishonesty, unreliability or poor judgment. Rob himself is suddenly accused of loosing his nerve. He can't figure it out. The horses he's riding are unresponsive, and he loses one race after another.Rob thinks there's a sinister influence behind all this. And since he's stopped getting any work, he has plenty of time to investigate. Dick Francis heroes are not usually bent on revenge, but in this case, Rob wants payback for all his jockey friends who have suffered grievous harm.As he battles a truly twisted, nearly impregnable enemy, Rob also finds time to woo his cousin Joanna, who turns out to be quite handy in a crisis.I'd rate NERVE quite highly among Dick Francis novels."},{"Title":"Nerve","review":"This book is responsible for my love of Dick Francis. The story of an up and coming jockey who finds himself in a slump, who is responsible and how he gets himself out of it is riveting.He writes beautifully and gives such good characterizations that his books are a delight to read."},{"Title":"Nerve","review":"This book starts with a bang and never lets up. Dick Francis' novels are admittedly formulaic, but it's a winning formula for sure. The ending is a bit unrealistic, but so what? In life there's a time for being serious and a time for losing yourself in an exciting story with an interesting main character."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"Here is another great adventure/romance from Suz Brockmann! Those who love her SEAL stories (and those who've never read them) will find this page-turner difficult to put down.Like her last release, she has more than one story line. In fact, this book involves three stories: Teri and Stan, Annabet and Herschel, and Sam and Alyssa (oh yeah, again!). Teri is a talented, confident helicopter pilot who freezes in the face of men's unwanted advanced. Stan is Mr. Fix-It who finds he can't get Teri out of his mind, yet believes he's not good enough for her. Annabet and Herschel live in Nazi-Era Denmark, and attempt to defy the Nazis and their families to be together. Lastly, Suz revisits Sam Starret, the sexy cowboy-SEAL, and Alyssa Locke, sharpshooter extrordinaire. Their relationship takes some giant steps forward here, but again Suz leaves us yearning for the next chapter. In fact, I felt that this particular Sam/Alyssa cliff-hanger was a bit too unsettling.Never the less, this book is a great action-packed, romance. Way to go, Suz! Counting down til your Spring release. I'd love to see you write a screenplay!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"First, please do not judge this book by the reviewer named &quot;One less Fan&quot;. If she thinks Suzanne is finished with Alyssa and Sam she is out of her mind. Ms. Brockmann is as much a fan of romance as her readers. I'm positive their story is far from over.As for &quot;Over the Edge&quot;, wow! I started reading this book at 7:00 am this morning and just completed it at 5:00 PM this evening. Absolutely pure, unadulterated joy. I loved this book and I love her testosterone-loaded team of sixteen SEAL troubleshooters. I laughed and cried and reveled in every word. If you are a sucker for action, romance, heroes (male and female) and lots of passion. Choose Suzanne Brockmann, she never disappoints.A message to Suzanne, I'm not worried about Sam and Alyssa. However, please don't forget Max and Gina. We need a happy ending for these two as well."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"Interesting characters, plenty of action and suspense, steamy and believable love scenes.....what more could a romance reader ask for?Suzanne Brockman's SEAL team men are the most realistically written romance heroes in quite a while. Not perfect, and with all the quirks of &quot;real&quot; men. Her female characters are strong and easily have you rooting for them.There are 4 different storylines going in &quot;Over the Edge&quot;, and they are all worthy of their own book. The pain of lost love and aging are treated with respect and dignity; their toll on Helga is bittersweet. Teri and Stan are the main story here, but the romance of Alyssa and Sam moves forward as well-don't worry, I don't think their tale will finish with this book! I also have to say, I'd love to see Gina and Max get a story of their own. Both are wonderful characters I really want to visit again.I literally couldn't put this one down. Started and finished it in one day! Hopefully Ms. Brockman will have the next installment of the SEAL series out earlier than planned!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"This review may sound like 90% of all the other positive reviews, but stick with me, please. Suzanne has written another great SEAL Team 16 romance, with multi-couple relationships &amp; a real-world mission plot to frame the story. (Perhaps a little too real-world, considering the attacks of September 11 &amp; the current operations in Afghanistan.) As with &quot;The Unsung Hero&quot; and &quot;The Defiant Hero,&quot; Suzanne writes a bittersweet WWII romance in memory of Holocaust survivors. Her main couple, Stan &amp; Teri, do get to go down the happily everafter route. However, I would like to note my dismay about her choice of sexual harrassment in the military as one of Teri's problems. As a female service member myself, I get REALLY tired of people thinking that the only story for females in the military is sexual harrassment. But I digress. Suzanne's 3rd couple, Sam &amp; Alyssa, have obviously generated the most comment, so I will follow suit. Sam &amp; Alyssa's unhappily everafter ending in &quot;Over the Edge&quot; has got nearly everyone up in arms. I would like to point out that their relationship is taking time &amp; effort to build, and the course doesn't always run smooth, sort of like real life. I appreciate seeing fictional characters struggle with problems even as they have hot sex and sensational dialog. Be warned though, this book didn't have anything as steamy as the chocolate scene from &quot;the Defiant Hero.&quot; My gripe with Sam's decision to marry Miss Pregnant Mega-Mammaries, is that it is so old-fashioned that it sounds like he stepped straight off the pages of a Regency romance novel. Come on, we all know a marriage between Sam and Miss P M-M is not going to work while he's lusting after/loving Alyssa. In real life, we're talking divorce in 2 years, tops. Let's hope Suzanne &quot;gets real&quot; with this dilemma in book 4, like financial support &amp; a parenting plan that allows Sam to participate in his child's life. Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't be able to give that story another 5 star rating. A final note, a 4th relationship was forming between Max &amp; the college student. I would prefer to see that develop in a stand alone book. Please keep the Hero series focused on the SEALs."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"Wow! Brockmann juggles three romance plots threading through a terrific military action/adventure story and she does it so smoothly you don't even notice until the end. She also does her usual very smoothforeshadowing to set up for the next book in the series, Out of Control (also *****). And the ... is hot - so what else do you want!Painfully shy Navy Reserve pilot Teri Howe, the one with the \\"Walk On Me\\" sign on her back, becomes Senior Chief Wolcholnok's special project; after all, he can fix anything, right? The Senior Chief thinks the ideal fix will be to set Teri up with his friend and fellow SEAL Mike Muldoon; after all, with a SEAL for a boyfriend, who'd have the nerve to ... harass her? But as the \\"Get Teri a Spine\\" op proceeds, Teri might just work up the nerve to say what she really wants...The Sam and Alyssa show continues, and even reaches resolution - twice. Max Bhagat becomes a fully fleshed-out character, as does Mike Muldoon (don't forget to look for foreshadowing). People live, people die, Alyssa gets her chance to participate in a SEAL op, Sam gets some very bad news, and WildCard is finally free of Adele.Unless you are a pacifist, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"Not a fan of over the top aplha males, this book was wonderfully plotted and a very welcome surprise. Crying males are so beta male wonderful to find given the current trend in contemporary romances. With OVER THE EDGE Ms Brockman has given readers smart, sexy sensitive heroes challenged by the strength and beauty of women: there are no whiney wimps in a Brockman book: male or female.Surely experienced romance readers will understand that Alyssa and Sam will find their own HEA down the road but she has created the ultimate angst for this couple. Nowhere is the reader mislead to think this is Sam and Alyssa's story, but it was nice to see them added giving the whole book a well plotted depth so lacking in other contemporary fiction.What made this one so enjoyable was there were three distinct couples to enjoy, but only one could be resolved at the end. To do more would be cheating both Alyssa and Sam and Gina and Max: each deserves and will get their own story. The only downer was the sub plot of Helga, the reader will figure out her problem quickly but Brockman let that drag on too much. Might be seen by some as filler, but as this was Teri and Stan's story it was understandable and gave Stan a more human side; the ulitmate gentleman.The story was gritty with language(but as a former service wife, it was well within the context of the characters,) and given the timing it might be a bit too close to reality for some because of today's headlines but it should be read by those who want to see the good guys win and win big. We all sort of need to feel that again. Given this past week it is refreshing to find that love like the mythical phoenix can rise from the ashes and triumph.Brava! Suzanne Brockman is romance's Tom Clancy and romance is so much better for it!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"OK-I'll admit it. I'm hooked on Suzanne Brockmann's Seal Team 16 novels and I want all the team members to eventually get hooked up with some fabulous woman who is going to make them happy for the rest of his life, etc., etc. This book was no different from the others--lots of excitement, a World War II subplot, and a happily ever after at the end. Except for Sam Starrett &amp; Alyssa Locke--the one couple you want to get together. Right up to the end, you know that everything is just going to work out for them, but then Brockman throws a big curve. Why can't these two just get together already? I know that I will read the next installment to the Seal Team 16 saga, but I was very disappointed at the end of Over the Edge. In fact, I was tempted to throw the book across the room!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I love this book. Ms Brockmann is awesome. Her ability to tell multiple stories in one book awes me.I cried while reading this book, that's how powerful and touching I found it.The past and present meld together in this suspenseful story from The Troubleshooters. While SEAL team 16 works with the FBI to free hostages from a highjacked plane in a dangerous, violent country, several stories unfold. Each story is compelling and captivating.From the past is a tale from WWII involving the plight of a Jewish family trying to get to safety.In the present, drama abounds. FBI Negotiator Max Bhagat fights valiantly to save the hostages, one young girl in particular who risks her life to save the other hostages. A special bond forms between Max and the brave Gina.Senior Chief Stan Wolchonok, an older, roughened warrior does his best to take care of a pretty young helo pilot, Teri Howe. Teri has set her sights on the Senior Chief and sexual tension erupts between them and steams up the pages.Navy Seal Sam Starrett and Alyssa Locke, a sharpshooter for the FBI, also heat things up with an intense love/hate relationship/attraction.Keep your eye on Sam and Alyssa. Their on-going feud is sure to lead to a story of their own.Shelley Dawn, author ofSweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"This book was so good that I couldn't sleep for two nights until I had finished the book and after that I couldn't sleep because I couldn't stop thinking about Sam and Alyssa. God what a sad story! Well ok in this book they were not the lead character and I know there is another book out there for them in the end they would get together forever which I haven't read so until I read it I feel sad for them! Sam is such a foul mouth sweetheart. A lot of people I have read in the reviews didn't like him being so generous in swearing but I for one like him because of it. It's hard to explain but I do like him. But I don't blame Alyssa for disliking him but it was too cruel for her to tell him that she could have sex with him only when she is drunk. I know Sam wasn't a very honorable man for taking her up on her offer knowing that she was drunk but I still like him. I felt like crying for him when he cried the morning after. It was very cruel of Alyssa to tell him that she wants him but doesn't like him. I was relieved when Alyssa saw the real Sam and started liking him but then again everything went wrong. Ok I am sad for both but it's hard to go in a marriage knowing that u would never be happy and u couldn't stop loving and wanting another person so once again I feel more sorry for Sam darling!Now I come to the lead characters to which I am being unfair by giving more importance to Sam and Alyssa's story. They were also good, not as hot as Sam and Alyssa but still good. But Stan's strength bothered me sometimes like when he was trying to make another guy imagine the woman, he him selves wanted and cared for, naked. Isn't it sad that he would go to so much length to keep his distance from Teri? He must have been miserable doing this. Although he didn't show it but I think he must have been. To think that Teri actually heard all that. How humiliated she must have been? But what followed after that well that I guess made up for the humiliating incidence for both of them.Max and Gina's story raised my curiosity so I am waiting for their story to come or is it out there already? I don't know. if some one know then let me know. WWII story was not interesting enough. But over all this book was too good for me to put down until it was finished. Thanks Ms Brockmann for writing these stories. I have read only 2 yet but I will read all soon."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I really enjoyed this one also, I liked the (kind of tough, teddy bear type) Senior Chief and found his love interest likeable.

A great story with great characters"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I was absolutely in love with the main couple, and even though the book wasn't perfect and had some things I would rather not deal with in romance novels, it was still so great. The secondary stories weren't completely dull, and I actually found myself interested in reading about them and not just skimming over it."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"Over the Edge is Suzanne Brockmann's Magnum Opus. It's got everything: great dialogue, great characters, great love scenes, and an excellent plot that allows every conversation and event to occur organically. Everybody has a part to play and they play it well, and when I read this book way, way back in 2002 during the beginning months of the war on terror, I was damned glad to have TS on our side--even if they were fictional.Stan and Teri are an amazing couple. And for the first (and only) time in a SB novel, the heroine plays an essential part in the resolution of the suspense plot. Teri and Stan belong together like Scarlett and Rhett, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, Peas and Carrots, and Forrest and Jenny, and every aspect of their relationship makes me smile.Sam and Alyssa....what more do I need to say about them? Has there ever been a more perfect example of opposites attracting? Alyssa is awesome, Sam is awesome (and hot) and sparks genuinely fly whenever they're within 10 feet of each other. Yowza!Max and Gina. Ah....Max and Gina. *Sigh*I love this book. But my love doesn't stop with these 6 characters. Nope, everybody is perfectly in character in this book, from WildCard (still nuts) to Tommy (still hot and balding) to Jules (hilariously fabulous) to Lopez to everybody in between. I've re-read OTE at least 100 times since 2002, and I never tire of it. Thanks for the memories, Suz!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"In the third book in Brockmann's Troubleshooters series, Stan Wolchonok gets a starring role. His Navy SEAL unit is sent to deal with a terrorist crisis in Kazbekistan (no, it's not a real place) and reservist Teri Howe accompanies the mission. For months, Stan has been spending way too much time thinking about Teri, a shy helicopter pilot with man issues. The close quarters on the Kazbekistan mission give Stan and Teri a chance to know each other better.Stan is an unexpected hero. He's no-nonsense and commanding on the job, but he's remarkably gentle and easy with Teri and her anxieties. Teri, too, displays surprising depth - she's often paralyzed by her fears, but once she's flying her chopper, she's unstoppable.Brockmann's books are particularly good reads because they usually include a historical WWII subplot told through flashbacks. Over the Edge showcases the story of Helga Schuler, an elderly Danish Jew who relives her own WWII experiences as she witnesses the unfolding of the hostage situation.Brockmann has the highest respect for the men and women of the American military, and her heroes are truly heroic. The Troubleshooters books are heavy on military jargon, and I honestly have no clue whether or not they're plausible, but they're realistic enough for me. The books could be read in any order, though there are some recurring characters and romantic subplots that might be unfamiliar to readers of the later books."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I loved the first book. Didn't really like the second book at all. But the third book...wow. This is the book that turned \\"good\\" into an obsession. I was happy with Teri and Stan, but I was in it for the super stressful excitement on the plane. The scenes with Max and Gina made my heart ache. I was on the edge of my seat and practically felt like I was in the story. This one was awesome."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I went back to book which is the third in the series after starting Breaking Point and realizing there was a back story to the fabulous FBI Negotiator Max Bhagat, whom is a very memorable character, and this story featuring Max did not disappoint. I can't wait to get back to finish where I left off in \\"Breaking Point\\" (book 9) that I started where Max made a smashing entrance early in his career and steels your heart. This is my first Suzanne Brockmann book and it won't be my last as I plan on reading the series.I love how the characters are drawn in this story. There are so many of them and I really felt that I came to know them. The story of Stan and Teri is fabulous and quite sweet. The tough senior chief Stan is just a softy underneath it all, with the presence of Teri Howe to bring that out. Teri is also great character. Not only is she beautiful, but she's extremely intelligent, a great pilot and has strong character.Surprizingly, I really enjoyed Sam and Alyssa's story and really felt their pain. I am hoping to see what if anything happens in future stories in this series.My only issue with this (as with others) was that I felt that Helga's WWII love story took up too much of the book and really didn't add to it. Also, I really wasn't clear as to what her job in the operation was at all. While it was sad to see the Alteimers taking over, it just didn't add much to the story for me. Even with that, I still think it's a 5 star read as I see myself going back to read it again.The story itself had such vividly drawn characters that you can connect with/relate to. It was pretty emotional at times and it's not often that I am able to really see characters like these. There's humor at times and I found myself laughing out loud a couple of times. It's certainly a romance, but it's not all sex sex sex. I can wait to see more from the characters in this series. So glad that there are about 16 in this series. I am going back to listen to the first 2 and will continue on from there.I love the job that Laura Hicks did with narrating this story. The voices that she did for both the female and male characters was outstanding and I found that the narrators to the first two in this series doesn't even come close to the job that Ms. Hicks did with this one. (I have sampled the first two and am in the process of reading them now as I enjoyed this book so much.) Her voices for Max, Stan and Sam are absolutely amazing. (and that's sometimes tough for a female narrator to pull off a male voice. To me, that sometimes makes or breaks the character when listening to audio versions like these.)"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"Let me start by saying I enjoyed the story overall, I enjoyed the characters, but I wouldn't want to hear it again (the audiobook) because it is way too long, at least 33% (or 4 CD's) too long. There's plenty to be critical of in this regard, starting with the repetitive dives into self-doubts and insecurities of the characters, and then there's the question of romantic maturity, rather the lack of, of people supposedly nearing middle age. But having said this I'm not bashing the book. In fact, overlooking these flaws, I enjoyed the story's many romances, and make no mistake this is a romance book first and foremost, and I enjoyed the many characters, and I enjoyed the suspense (a hijacked airplane with hostages). I even enjoyed the flashback side story of a family's travails during WWII and its relation to the current story as it unfolded.So what is my recommendation? I guess I'm saying if you like romance with a dose of suspense, and you have enjoyed other books by Suzanne Brockman, and you're between books you just gotta' read, there is a good chance this story will entertain you, and there is nothing wrong with that."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I loved the action around the storyline involving the hijacking of the airplane and the brave young girl who risked her own life to save other passengers on the plane by posing as the politician's daughter. I also was surprised that Brockmann gave this girl something of a pretty horrible fate which, in a way, I had to respect.The two main romances among the officers was awfully silly and transparent, but I'll give Brockmann points for some very sharp and funny dialog. The best romantic story was Helga's recollections of her brother and her best friend's sister during WWII, which I found very touching, and I also wished she didn't have Alheimer's.Some of the plots are silly and often bile inducing, but there are so many layers in this verbal cake that one can almost pick and choose their favorite stories and disregard the rest easily. A generally good, fast paced book with something for everyone, and for that reason it works."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"#3 in the series. Probably my least favorite so far. Not that I didn't like it. I did, just not as much as the others.This one is about SEAL Senior Chief Stan Wolchonok, and Navy Helicopter pilot Teri Howe. Teri is a skittish woman who backs away from any conflict with men. She's being harassed by another Navy guy, who she had a one-night stand with 9 years earlier. Stan notices this, mostly because he's attracted to Teri. He doesn't think she'd ever notice him though because he's not particularly handsome. So he decides to try to help Teri with her issues with men, all the while not knowing that she is very attracted to him. In order to help, he gets her assigned to fly helos (helicopters) on a SEAL training mission. When they are on their way to their destination, word comes in that the SEALS are being re-routed because terrorists have hijacked a plane in a (fictional) European country (think Afghanistan). Usually woman aren't involved in SEAL missions, but since she's there, and she's a great pilot, she stays.The rest of the book takes place in the foreign country where its very dangerous for Americans. The plane was taken over by a gunman who then forced the plane to land at an abandoned airstrip. When it landed, 4 other terrorists boarded the plane and held it hostage. They want 2 terrorists being held in jail to be released, and plan to use a Senator's daughter supposedly on board the plane as leverage. What they don't know is that the daughter never boarded the plane, having had her passport and boarding pass stolen beforehand. Another character, Gina Vitaglione, knows this and also sees that if the terrorists don't find the daughter, they will keep hurting hostages, so she says that she is the daughter. FBI top negotiator Max Bhagat is called in to try to talk to the terrorists. He and Gina develop a connection during this time.I'm tempted to reveal more, because this is the part of the story I really wanted to read. Gina and Max are in several other books, and then they finally get \\"their\\" story in book 9. Which I'm dying to read. I love them together.There's also the usual historical flashbacks - this time in the form of Stan's mother's friend, who has Alzheimer's. She keeps reverting back to her time in Denmark during the German invasion in WW2.All in all, it was a good book. The plot line was excellent, really kept me into the story. The romance pairing was okay. I liked Stan and Teri together, but yet I don't think she did as good a job building the chemistry between them. Not enough to ruin the book. There is also more of the Sam/Alyssa pairing that has been used in the first 2 books, which helped out the romance-y department.Rating: 3.5 / 5"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I loved this book so much! It was in a pile of books my mom had been given and i needed something to read, so I took it. It only took me a day to read through it. I loved it so much. Ms. Brockmann is definitely a great writer. At times I wanted to jump for joy, cry, smile....just every emotion possible. I love romance/suspense novels and this was definitely it. I immediately fell in love with the SEALs of team 16. I wish I could meet them in person.(dont worry, I know they're not real..I just wish they were so I could) I literally cried from joy and sorrow and the book took my breath away at times. When I finished reading I could barely see a thing cause my eyes were so blurry for reading for so long."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"Wow!!! This was my first Suzanne Brockman book, and I literally could not put it down. I'm very demanding when it comes to romance thrillers. So many authors overemphasize either the romance, or the thriller, yet Ms. Brockman delivered capably on both fronts. I liked the fact that she was chronicling several romances at once. These relationships were so believable, written with a lot of humor. My favorite scene is where Stan tells Muldoon he must be crazy if he doesn't think Teri's the sexiest woman on the planet. Stan's description of Teri was down-to-earth,yet eloquent, beautiful and moving. Also, the scene where Teri FINALLY makes the move on Stan was delicious. I loved the fact that Stan and Sam, although obviously strong men, weren't afraid to be emotional in front of their women. This is so unusual in romance novels, and I applaud Ms. Brockman for it. I did have a few complaints, though. First, Teri and Stan did a little too much waffling with each other. It made want to ask, \\"Are you two adults, or not? Get on with it, already!!\\" Yes, drawing out the conflict can create yummy anticipation, but at some point it gets tiring. Second, the character of Helga Schuler, who was valiantly battling Alzheimers, seemed out of place to me. She served almost no purpose in the book, and her connection to Stan and her \\"save-the-day\\" moment at the end of the book seemed concocted to me. Therefore, although her recollections of the romance between Annebet and Hershel were moving, when reading them I found myself repeatedly asking, \\"Why is this here?\\" Third, There was so much emotional drama going on between the characters (WildCard hit the nail on the head when he joked that their military mission was looking more like an episode from the Love Boat)that I didn't find it credible that these characters could still concentrate and perform well on the mission. They all seemed a little too adept at moving from emotionally wrought lover to ice-in-their-veins military mode. Other than those minor quibbles, I thought this book was sensational. I'm definitely going to read the prior Navy seal books!!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"Don't let this one disappointed reviewer fool you - this is another great book by Suzanne Brockmann (and by the way, I believe that we will meet Sam and Lys again in the next installment). Anyway, &quot;Over the Edge&quot; kept me up long after my usual bedtime and I simply could not read it fast enough. Perversely, I was also sorry to see it end. The typical dilemma one faces when reading a really thrilling and at the same time multi-layered book. It amazes me, how Ms. Brockmann managed to interlace so many different characters and story lines into one nearly perfect whole once again. Over the Edge is not a fluffy book - it covers many topics some may feel uncomfortable with. But it manages to do this in a way, that allows the reader to wholly sympathize with the characters. In the end, one simply has to cheer them for their staying power. I am definitely looking forward to the next installment of her ongoing SEAL's tale (and Ms.Brockmann, if you should read this, I would not mind meeting Max and Gina again ;-) )"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I picked up Brockmann's &quot;Into the Night&quot; mostly judging by the first few sentences on the back cover. If I'd known it was a romance, I probably wouldn't have read it. The cover is not the traditional bodice ripping illustration, and that tends to make the book look like it's not in that genere. After I started reading the book, I was drawn in to the world Brockmann created and began to read the rest of the series from the first book.So far, &quot;Over the Edge&quot; stands out as the best book in the series. Although Brockmann's plots exist secondarily, in place only as background for two characters to get together, this story of the hijacked airliner really kept me turning the page to see what would happen next.The character of Max Bhagat really shines in this one. I'd like to read more about him. In many ways he is more intriguing than any of the Navy SEALS who make up the crux of this series.I could do without the World War Two stuff though. I've gotten to the point where I skim it rather than actually read that part.Brockmann's strength is in her dialogue. Dialogue is difficult to make real, and some authors never manage to get it right. In this case, the words the characters say are what make me keep coming back for more. I'm not a romance fan, and I could care less about reading love scenes, but some of the things these guys say to each other have me laughing out loud and smiling to myself whenever I think about it later. I'll keep reading Brockmann's work on the strength of her conversations between characters."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"What happened? I was very disappointed with Sam and Alyssa's romance. At least 75% of the anticipation for this book was to see how this rocky,funny and deep hearted relationship would end. Sam was honorable, rough and somewhat of a jerk, but he had a mind of his own. The end of his relationship with Aylssa was a cop-out, so 1950's and very much out of character. He and Aylssa deserved much better. It was not an enjoyable read. It seems as though Ms. Brockmann got tired of Sam and Aylssa's story line mid-way through the book and just &quot;kicked it to the curb&quot;."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"OVER THE EDGE is a carefully constructed, well written &quot;romance&quot; novel, but be warned: it is extremely dark. This is not a &quot;get away from reality&quot; book. Themes include sexual harrassment, gang rape, Alzeheimer's, child molestation, Jewish-Gentile lovers caught in World War II. This is perhaps too much to carry in one book. Add to that at least one tragic romance and one that the reader expected to be resolved and was not. If Brockmann wants to write a really good novel and not a romance, she needs to change forums and go with it. This attempt to combine forms just doesn't work. The Sam-Alyssa romance has become a soap."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"STORY BRIEF WITH SOME OPINION:There are about six stories being told. Three of them are romantic relationships. Two of these have sad endings. The main romance has a happy ending.Teri is a young helicopter pilot who has been sexually harassed at work. She has trouble standing up for herself. Stan is a 39-year-old SEAL who tries to help her. He fixes her up with a nice young man Mike, also a SEAL. Teri wants Stan, not Mike. Stan doesn't know this and continues to misinterpret Teri\`s actions throughout the story. He is attracted to her but he doesn't believe he should have a relationship due to his traveling for the job.Alyssa is a sniper working for the FBI. Sam is a SEAL. Six months ago they had a one night affair. Afterwards she asked him to keep it a secret. Now they are at the same location. They both want each other but believes the other hates them. After they finally have sex, they continue to belive the other doesn't want them, and they continue being apart.Helga is an elderly lady with Alzheimer's. During the book she is remembering the story of her time in 1940s Denmark during the Nazi occupation. Her brother was in love with Annabet. He was Jewish, Annabet was not. Helga can remember the past but has difficulties remembering current activities. A fair amount of time is spent showing Helga taking notes so she can remember the names of people around her and what is going on. The Altzheimer's part of the story was ok as a side story but didn't add very much. I suppose it was adding depth to her character, but I felt like something more should have happened with it.The main suspense plot was terrorists hijacking a plane and taking it to Kazbekistan. They wanted two prisoners released: one in the U.S. and one in Israel. The SEALS and the FBI go to the Kazbekistan to plan a rescue. Helga is there as a representative from Israel. Gina is a 21 year old American passenger on the plane. A senator's daughter Karen was supposed to be on the plane but lost her ticket and didn't board the plane. Gina was aware of that. The terrorists wanted to know who among the passengers was Karen. They began killing passengers until Gina stood up and claimed to be Karen. From that point on, the terrorists had Gina do all the talking on the radio expressing their demands, etc. Max was the hostage negotiator on the other side, talking to Gina/Karen.MORE REVIEWER'S OPINION:The hostage situation felt like a minor background story. Very little happened regarding that. At the end when the SEALs assaulted the plane to rescue the hostages, it wasn't shown. It was briefly mentioned. I wonder if the sniper got anyone? If so, was it through glass windows? I wonder how the terrorists responded. I was disappointed that the Israelis learned something about one of the terrorists but they did not tell it to the SEALs. The reason given was \\"stupid.\\" The Israelis are smarter than that. Also how did they learn it? The book was unsatisfying from a suspense/thriller point of view. The suspense was mostly in the setting, not in action or events. Although there was one sniper shooting earlier which created some action.Most of the book was about the two relationships: Teri/Stan and Alyssa/Sam. I was frustrated and angry throughout the book. All the conflicts between these couples were \\"vague communication and inaccurate assumptions about the others' feelings.\\" This was a soap opera, not a story. No matter what one would say or do, the other assumed it had a negative motive. And they would ponder the reasons it was bad. And the things these people said and did? Nothing was true to how they felt. The men wanted the women but said they didn't. Teri and Stan finally have sex, but afterwards Stan said that was a mistake and it won't happen again. (He was in love with her why would he say that? It just hurt her.) Alyssa pretends to be drunk so she can have sex with Sam. But immediately afterwards they act like they hate each other and it will never happen again. I was angry. I wanted to throw the book. This is not good story. There was no decent plot. I was so mad that when the main couple finally got together on the last page - I didn't care. My reaction was oh, it's over. There was no \\"good feeling\\" in this book.The ending for Alyssa/Sam was terrible. It's like why was their story even in this book? Where did that come from? The author didn't know what to write next so she just invented something to break them up. It had a \\"thrown away\\" feeling. My reaction - ick.The Annabet/Hersel and Nazi story in the 1940s was ok as a story but it's been told before. It was predictable. I don't know why the author put that in the book. It was sad.The author starts a relationship between Gina on the plane and Max the hostage negotiator. But it wasn't developed. It could have been more interesting. Oh, and Gina does something \\"extremely stupid\\" which made me mad. Her stupidity caused something awful to happen. Let the terrorists be the bad guys, not stupid females - please?All of these stories went back and forth interrupting each other which is not a favorite device for me. Some readers need to know that there is one RAPE SCENE in the book. It is referred to, no details are shown.DATA:Story length: 395 pages. Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words. Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: 5. Total number of sex scene pages: 13 (plus one rape scene). Setting: mostly 2001 Kazbekistan with a little San Diego, California and Athens, Greece. Flashback story setting: 1940s Denmark. Copyright: 2001. Genre: military romance with some suspense."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"This book was good. Really, really good, and everything you could hope for from military romantic suspense. Suzanne Brockmann handled the military aspect wonderfully and - thank goodness - it was expertly woven into the main characters' story. The multiple storylines were very well done. The characterisations excellent and believable. On top of that, in amongst the tension of the plot, was a bit of believable humour and a whole lot of heart. I still despise the odd and unnecessary World War Two parts, but I won't be too harsh on them in this book. I didn't have much hope for this series at the beginning, but I'm loving it now.The book, featuring a plane hijacking, was released two weeks before the attack on the Twin Towers in New York City, which is kind of eerie. The story follows a number of characters - Navy SEALs, FBI agents, other military personnel, and even one of the hostages - over the days the plane stays grounded and everybody works to get the hostages free.Oh goodness, here we go again with the made up Islamic Middle Eastern country that somehow got transported to Christian Eastern Europe. Why do we need to have a \`European' country with oil fields and Islamic extremists? Why oh why does the made up country need to be called Kazbekistan?!That said, the made up country worked a whole lot better for me in this book, and by the end I could almost forgive it. I suppose there would have been plenty of people to upset if the author had had to choose a real country with real terrorists for this story.This story started well, picking us up and keeping us going. The men in the Navy SEALs team in this series are all individual and, for the most part, very compelling. When the book begins we're in a bar where our hero, Stan (Stan who goes to the made up Stan land! Ha ha) is trying to break up a fight between one of his men and a group of Marines. The action is incredibly well-written, and the jumping from one subplot to the next is handled expertly (bar the unnecessary Second World War flashbacks that detract from rather than add to the story). There are a lot of characters, but I was never overwhelmed by them, and because they were always working towards a common goal the whole thing pulled together.I liked the main couple - Stan and Teri - very much. I think I perhaps slightly preferred the relationship in the last book (John and Meg), but this pair were very good too. I like that Suzanne Brockmann writes strong female characters who may work in a \`man's' kind of job, but who manage to maintain their femininity. I like strong heroines, but dislike overly pushy, tough women. With Teri the balance was just right. Stan was a good, strong hero.I loved the story between Gina, the young woman hostage who was the \`spokesperson' over the days between the terrorists and the Americans, and Max, the FBI negotiator. It was one of the best things about the book, perhaps even my favourite thing in the whole story.I still don't get the fascination with Sam and Alyssa. Alyssa seems to have forgotten to develop a personality, and is a complete bitch most of the time. I simply cannot understand why Sam is so desperately in love with someone who's so nasty to him one hundred percent of the time. And, for Sam's part, he wasn't always the nicest person in this book either. I enjoyed reading their sections for the most part but I don't think they're the relationship of the century like the author seems to think, and I'm not sure they deserve all the page space - in every book.Suzanne Brockmann's heroes sure do a lot of crying! Just an observation.I'm continuing with my irresponsible reading style of skimming (or maybe even skipping!!) over the World War Two parts of these books, and I'm finding missing those parts make for a much better read. The plot is not so bogged down in erroneous secondary storylines, and the books don't lose their pace the way they do when you have to wade your way through unnecessary stories about the main characters' ancestors. I know it's wrong to read this way, but I don't care!On the subject of World War Two, I think it's strange the aspects Brockmann has chosen to cover in each book, as they really have nothing to do with the main story. It has been heavily hinted that made up Kazbekistan is a former Soviet country, so why not make the old war story of this one be relevant to the Soviet experience of that war? At least then it would make a little more sense to include those huge passages interrupting the story.Brockmann paints a very grim picture of Europe and in this book makes Athens out to be no different to Mumbai, or Baghdad. Riots aside (and any city in the world can have riots!), I've never once felt threatened in Athens - in fact it would have to be one of the safer big cities on the Continent.The dynamic between the characters of the series is starting to get good. There are some aspects of the Troubleshooters I do not enjoy, and yet I want to keep coming back for more because the friendships and relationships between the characters are well-written and while I can't say I love everybody, it certainly seems like these people really exist.In amongst the drama are some good dialogue and even some humour. It's imperative a reader likes both the hero and the heroine, and I liked both here. Though I cannot stand the flashbacks in these stories, the real story (the hijacking and the people involved in it) was so good, I am willing to give this book five stars."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"SEAL Team 16 is called upon once again, this time to take down a group of terrorists who have hijacked a commercial airplane and forced it to land in Kazbekistan, they are charged with the rescue of 120 passengers on-board. Joining the SEAL team is FBI hostage negotiator Max Bhaghat, agents Jules Cassidy and Alyssa Locke, and Reserve chopper pilot Teri Howe.Three romantic threads intertwine in this romantic thriller: a wistful WWII romance recalled by a Holocaust survivor; a turbulent relationship between SEAL Lt. Sam Starrett and FBI sharpshooter, Alyssa Locke; and a burgeoning romance between the team's Senior Chief Stanley Wolchonok and helicopter pilot Teri Howe.When Teri Howe, one of the best helicopter pilots in the Naval Reserves, asks Stan to help her keep a harassing officer at bay, his instincts scream to comfort her and crush the offender. To put her out of reach of the officer, Stan arranges for her to accompany his team on a training op that quickly turns into a real-life rescue mission. Teri doesn't mind being in the middle of the action, and she's eager to spend time with the fierce but compassionate Senior Chief. Teri Howe is the pursuer, while Stan tries to steer clear of the whole \\"enlisted verses officer\\" fraternization rule. Each step Stan tries to take away from her, setting her up with Mike Muldoon, she takes two steps forward. It is nice to see the least outwardly romantic of SEAL Team 16 show his softer side. Steamy love scenes are perfectly and tastefully executed.Meanwhile, Lt. Sam Starrett struggles to earn FBI sharpshooter, Alyssa Locke's trust. Max Bhaghat, FBI negotiator, endeavors to keep his dealings with American hostage, Gina Vittagliano, from becoming too personal; as the SEALs prepare to take out the terrorists. Over The Edge is fraught with so much tension and a harrowing assault of one of the passengers, that the team is forced to listen to in horror). Negotiator Max wrestles with his growing feelings for the hostage, and his inability to save her in time.I was hooked from the beginning, and enjoyed the story within the story and WWII background. Taut suspense, witty dialogue and dashes of humor help maintain the novel's swift pacing, and Brockmann has a way of making characters come to life and feel like tangible people you come to care about. She is able to maintain a flow of storyline that knits all of these different pieces together and simply leaves you feeling like you know these people well. 4 1/2 Stars"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"Brockman always comes through. Fast-paced, action oriented stuff with some great emotion thrown in. The characters are alive and multi-faceted. No cardboard cutout heros or heroines here."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I was kind of weary about this book when I got it, but I fell into the whole plot not long after I started it. I loved the plot!!! This book shows you a bit of the SEAL life and what they face. The romance in it was just enough to keep the book going and not over-shadow the true basis behind the book. The book was written with the feeling that you were part of the SEAL team going in to attack the terrorists. I so think that everyone should read this book if you like a little romance and a lot of action that makes you feel that you are right there on the line between safety and death."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I also hadn't heard of Suzanne Brockmann but was looking for some type of fantasy reading and picked it up at the drug store. I absolutely could not put it down. I was up too late last night and got up too early this morning to get through it. The story was wonderful (although as an aside - I'm afraid, that a story like this just reinforces the idea that men and women shouldn't be in combat together). Like everyone else, I'm dying to read about Sam and Alyssa. And, like several other reviewers - I didn't care for the WWII storyline. There was plenty to keep this book interesting and, after about half the book, I skimmed or skipped the WWII part. I'll have to go out and read the book that starts Sam and Alyssa's romance. And, I'm a little disappointed that it seems WildCard will be the next installment (although, it sounds intriguing). It seems that Sam and Alyssa deserved their own book, but by the end of the next one, what will be left for them?Suzanne Brockmann - Thanks!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I've read so may books over the years it's hard to find one that sticks out.

So the author has the absolute right to do whatever she wants to do with her heroes. She can kill them, she can throw them into any hell of a marriage, and she can break their hearts. She also has the right to try to change her writing style. Where you, gentle reader, were expecting a little recreational happy-ending-love-me-forever romance, you've got some drama attempt. With the real life hurt and cruelty. Mixed with romance. With lots of question marks at the end.Well, it does not matter that it is no longer just only a romance, I love drama too. Only I am hooked up on Sam Starrett and Alicia Locke's romance. I want to see what comes out of this, and I pray that they end up together. It is going to be a torture to wait.I am not buying another Suzanne Brockmann's book unless I've read a preview first and made sure that a) it is about Alicia and Sam as its main heroes, and b) why, it should have a happy ending, of course!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I was waiting for this book and was not surprised that I finished it in 1 day!.

This book had everything. A great romance...lots of action and the great dialogue that Ms. Brockmann is so famous for. I simply could not put this book down.As for the pet peeve: in the previous two books in this Navy Seals series, Ms. Brockmann incorporates an older character who spends alot of time reflecting back in history, all which the reader is privy to. This is very annoying to me. Fortunately it was less so in Over The Edge...not as much of the book was spent on reflections of WWII.You see, this book already had secondary characters which we had met in previous books: Alyssa and Sam..sigh..their story is actually more riveting than the main characters, Stan and Teri.I loved the ending, the Stan & Teri situation was wrapped up nicely and I liked that Ms. Brockmann left a huge twist in the relationship of Sam and Alyssa. They are definitely a tragic couple. I can't wait until the next installment. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"The Saltwater Cowboys are at it again, as they are charged with the rescue of 120 passengers on-board a hi-jacked plane which is forced to land in Kazbekistan. Joining the SEAL team in the covert operation is FBI hostage negotiator Max, agents Jules Cassidy (who merely is window dressing again) and Alyssa Locke, who continues her tortured romance with Lt. Sam Starrett., and Reserve shopper pilot Teri Howe.This time out, it is crusty Senior Chief Stan Wolchonok who gets the love interest, though he tries numerous times to blow it by setting her up with hunky Lt. Mike Muldoon. Teri Howe is the pursuer, while Stan tries to steer clear of the whole enlisted verses office fraternization rule (which does not apply to reservists). Each step Stan tries to take away from her, she takes two steps forward. It is nice to see the least romantic of the SEALs show his softer side.This one is fraught with so much tension and a pretty harrowing assault of one of the passengers (as the negotiation team has to sit by and watch and listen in abject horror). Negotiator Max wrestles with his growing feelings for the hostage, who is nearly 20 years his junior, and his inability to save her in time.One thing I can do without is the WWII junk. I just skip over that stuff. It does not add anything to the story line other than additional pages. I like when they use an alternate font so that skipping is even easier!I usually do not like serial books, but this particular series manages to make each book stand on their own merits. You really get to like the characters, and they pop up all over the series, but it is not a forced inclusion like some of the other stories I have read. I look forward to each new installment."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I'm glad I saved my first review for this book. I feel impelled to let people know what a wonderful book Suzanne Brockmann has written. As an African-American I'm used to many authors not including people of color, or when they do, not doing a very good job of it. Suzanne Brockmann has not only included characters of many hues and religious backgrounds, but she's concocted an engrossing tale of action and romance with multi-dimensional characters that leave you craving more. I am now a fan and I've just ordered all her books. She has written a book that other authors should take a lesson from. Stan and Teri, Sam and Alyssa, Max and Gina (she has to pursue their story!) would make great individual stories and all together they made one fantastic story. I disagree with some of the readers who didn't like the WWII component - this was also inclusive. Get your history wherever you can. It was a good history lesson. Also, Jules was a character that with a few words gave a look at a good friend, that had nothing to do with his lifestyle, but what friendship is all about. If you like romantic suspense, this will be on your list of favorites."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I went through a phase in junior high school where I'd read romance novels all the time. I must have read at least five hundred. And they were all awful with weak, stupid women and Neanderthal men. Yet I kept reading them because I felt they should more than what they were. I stopped reading those pieces of garbage but I came across excerpts of Suzanne Brockmann's novels last year. So I picked up The Defiant Hero and Over The Edge at the library. I liked the Sam and Alyssa story in The Defiant Hero but it's this book that made me a Suzanne Brockmann fan. This book is what I expected from a romance and what those hundreds of novels lacked.I enjoyed the multiple plotlines, interaction between all the characters, and the characters themselves. One thing about other romance novels I hated was that each \\"hero\\" was the baddest, best, toughest man around. It got laughable after awhile. In this book, although each man is the best and toughest in his own way, they're not in competition with each other. Stan is amazing. He can seemingly do everything yet he doesn't feel the need to be overbearing. And Teri is the one to chase after Stan, which is also a welcome change from other romance novels. Sam and Alyssa's story is bittersweet and addictive. And Gina and Max were a pleasant surprise. I've started buying copies of this novel to give as gifts to friends."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"Suzanne Brockmann has a way of making characters come to life and feel like tangible people you come to care about. This book in the Trouble Shooter series is one of my favorites. As is very often the case in a Brockmann book, you can read it out of order in the series and still love every minute of it, or read it in order and just find a deeper connection to familiar characters. Her wit is perfect. Steamy scenes, beautifully done. Her characters have heart!Terri Howe is one of the most approachable female characters introduced by Brockmann to date. Senior Chief Stan is far from Movie Star gorgeous, but is a character you grow to love in a few short sentences.Typical of a Brockmann book, she is able to seemlessly weave the story of Terri and Stan admist high action/adventure and danger in K-stan during a terrorist highjack situation. She offers a further unfolding of the story of Sam and Alyssa's explosive relationship as the FBI and the Seal's team must work together to resolve the crisis. Stan's mother experienced the losses of the holocaust and terror of the Nazi's. This story is beautifully told through the eyes of his mother's best friend, Helga - envoy to Isreal.For most authors, I would recommend simplifying. Too many stories being told at the same time create a hard to follow chaos. That is not true of Suzanne Brockmann. She is able to maintain a flow of storyline that knits all of these different pieces together and simply leaves you feeling like you know these people well.I've given this book to friends, male and female. They have all come back to me months later with the details of the story still fresh to them. I've never seen that with another author."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I bought this book the day that it came out. I am an avid reader. I started this book at 10:30pm and stayed up until 3:30am in the morning to finish. You know that you have read a really good book when several weeks later you are still thinking about the characters and their stories. I LOVE the 'troubleshooter' series. I enjoyed Heart Throb, and although it will also remain one of my favorites, it still takes a back burner to The Unsung Hero, The Defiant Hero, and Over the Edge.The SEAL Team 16 Troubleshooters are called on to take down a group of terrorists that have hijacked an airplane and forced it to land in Kazbekistan, which is better known as &quot;the Pit&quot; to Brockmann's readers. Lt. Teri Howe is a rescue pilot and a woman used to being harassed by men. Senior Chief Stan Wolchonok sees the harassment and does not like it. Stan gets permission to have Teri join his SEAL team on a training mission. Stan felt that it would get her away from the man currently harassing her and he would be there to look after her. Stan had no idea that a simple training mission would turn into a real mission, or that his feelings for Teri would become so complicated. Once landing in Kazbekistan the SEAL team began intense drills preparing themselves to overtake the plane with the hijackers. In the meantime, hostage negotiator Max tries desperately to speak to the hijackers, but is only able to speak to a young woman passenger. Gina has put her life on the line to protect the rest of those on the plane and now her only lifeline is the faceless man, Max. And in her usual style, Ms. Brockmann, gives us her story within a story that involves a tragic love story that took place during WWII. This story is told by Helga, a Holocaust survivor, who is currently suffering from Alzheimer's. Ms. Brockmann also brings back a very popular pair, SEAL member Sam Starrett and FBI sharpshooter Alyssa Locke.My favorite couple is, of course, Sam and Alyssa. Although at the end of Over The Edge I wanted to cry for them both. I am still reeling from what happened to Gina, Sam, and Alyssa. I hated the ugliness that happened to Gina. I could not believe I actually cried for this character and for Max and the others who were there to hear everything the poor young woman went through at the hands of the terrorists. I have hundreds of books from many different authors, but none have touched me like this series. It must be a great thrill to make characters come alive. I actually feel like I know all of them. I hope that Sam and Alyssa find there way back to each other in a future book. I also hope Gina finds happiness after all she has been through. And lets not forget poor Tom and Kelly who are still unmarried. Over the Edge takes you on an emotional roller coaster. I admit that when I got to the last page I, at first, felt cheated. I thought no way could this story be over. Like another reviewer said, I wanted to throw the book across the room. But, several days later, when I was still thinking about the story and its characters, I knew that the storytelling was beyond good. Yes, it was extremely tragic and emotionally draining with very small glimpses of romance and humor, but because of the dark side the reader was pushed into finding the positives of every story. The outcomes to several of the stories could have been far worse than they were. I have never read a book that has left me feeling as drained as this one did. As another reviewer stated, this is not a &quot;get away from reality&quot; book. I would also highly recommend that you read The Unsung Hero and The Defiant Hero before reading Over the Edge. Ms. Brockmann has me hooked and impatiently waiting for her next book in this series. Thank You Ms. Brockmann for the love and passion of the characters that you write about that is so clearly evident on every page."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"Brockmann has created a wonderful series about Navy SEALs and mangaged to add little bits of WWII history -- which also has a romantic thread.I've seen some reviews complaining about the &quot;end&quot; of Sam and Alyssa's story. This is *not* the end! The next book will be about Wildcard, but the book after that will be Sam and Alyssa's story, from what I've been told.I think what Brockmann is aiming for is a continuing series in the true sense of the word. Each book will stand alone, yet each one builds on the previous ones with characters and situations. Sam and Alyssa's story is a thread in a greater tapestry.Once Sam and Alyssa's story is &quot;complete&quot; I think there will be another story that will be a continuing thread -- hopefully for Max and Gina. Their story was introduced in Over the Edge and has a lot going against it, their age difference will be the least of their problem.This is no ordinary romance either. Lots of heavy topics are dealt with; from a hostage situation, to the Danish people protecting their Jews in WWII and a brilliant older woman's realization that her mind is going. I've been enjoying Brockmann's books for years now, and this is no exception."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I have become a huge fan of Suzanne Brockmann's books, and she makes me love her characters. In earlier stories, I had not been enamoured of this particular hero so was not sure how I would react to a whole book about him. No fear, I was hooked from the beginning, and as always, enjoyed the story within the story and WWII background.However, Suzanne, you have left a lot of us worried about Sam! I am not sure I can wait six months while he struggles in this unhappy marriage..."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"This is the book that got me totally addicted to all of Brockmann's SEAL team 16 books. If you have not discovered them yet you may want to consider hiring a housekeeper, babysitter, taking leave from your job etc. before reading them because you won't be able to do anything but turn pages for awhile! They are that good. Brockmann's books are in a class by themselves. The only problem is she can't write them fast enough for me! I fell in love with the character of Senior Chief Stan Wolchonok in this story."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"Suzanne Brockmann has fast become one of my favorite authors. With this newest installment of her newest Navy Seal Series, Brockmann shows us that we haven't seen nothing yet. Over the Edge, was a fast-paced, intense page turner. The romance between Stan and Terri was great and Brockmann tastefully blended it with the suspense and action that I have come to love. We get to see yet another installment of Sam and Alyssa...one that hints of MUCH more to come. Great book, great series, great author."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I absolutely could not put this book down! What a great book! It was so timely with world events and filled with action. Loved the story with Terri and Stan. However, I was loving the story with Sam and Alyssa just as much! Very good ending for Terri and Stan, but I was so disappointed with the ending for Sam and Alyssa! It hung with me for days! But that's what makes this book 5 instead of 4 stars! You don't always get what you are expecting and I like that in books that I read."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"Disappointed might be an overstatement, but this was my least favorite book in the series thus far. I thought the relationship between the main characters Stan and Teri was laughable - it just didn't click for me. And some of the silly things that Stan did and said along the way - setting tired, already overworked SEALS up to hit on her, kissing her himself while trying to pretend that it was all part of a strategy to build her confidence - you gotta be kidding me.The main story - the hijacking of a passenger airliner - was also not well thought out. We're told repeatedly that it's blazing hot, yet a passenger airline sits on the tarmac for five (I think) days with no air circulation and no air conditioning? Those people - passengers and kidnappers - would have roasted half to death and gone off half cocked long, long before the SEALS busted into the plane. There was only one mentioned delivery of extra food and water. No mention about how the toilets would have overflowed after the first day. The chaos, stench, and heat were all omitted from the tension and story telling.I mostly skimmed the WWII backstory, but I did love Helga, the Israeli envoy, in her current life as a negotiator and woman with an increasingly failing memory. I loved her bravery, her resourcefulness and her Post It notes.Once again Sam and Alyssa were my favorite sparing partners, and I look forward to the day that Mary Lou is out the picture, which I know she will be, and Sam and Alyssa are finally together."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I have really enjoyed reading this and the other books about Team Sixteen SEALS.

Who doesn't want to read about hot Navy SEALs and the women they love?"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"This book perfectly blended romance, suspense, emotion, and the past and present into a recipe made to win!The author focuses on Stan and Teri. Teri, a reservist helo pilot is fighting some pretty hefty demons, and her attraction to Stan. After he tries to push her into the arms of his teammate, he realizes her feelings for him may just be as strong as his for her. But they have a job to do, and over one hundred and twenty hijacked passengers on a plane hang in the balance.Meanwhile, Stan's mother's old friend is desperately trying to hang on to her memories of the present, though the past seems so vibrant.And Sam and Alyssa continue to do their dance of seduction.The tension, both romantic and traditional suspense, kept me rushing forward to read more, and the characters--major and minor--kept me riveted."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"Teri Howe loves to fly anytime anywhere but the unwanted sexual harrassment is scaring her away from reaching her full potential. Senior Chief Stan Wolchonok which witnesses one of the harrassments falls quickly into step as the rescuer & protector but sweet young Terri has her eye set on him despite their age difference & his attempts to set her up with someone her own age.The saga of the Navy Seal Team Sixteen of the Troubleshooters Series does not dissappoint. Somehow Suzanne weaves in the WWII history & incredible survival story in this one & it is a treasure. She is a brillant, creative interesting writer. Each one of her books stands on its own but starting at the begininng with \\"Unsung Hero\\" and moving forward gives you so much more to the whole picture you will not be dissappointed.The main headline is the hijacked airliner filled with passengers & what the terroists think is the Senator Crawford's daughter but little do they know a very brave & courageus subsitute stands in & engages in radio transmissions with the famous negotiator Max. You literally feel like you are on that plane in the middle of the horrific action & Suzanne reveals the actual terror of being held hostage & the terror of being assaulted & more. Somehow Max & Gina find a connection that can't be cut & grows. The planning & rescue takes on an action of its own with the other Troubleshooters team & is outstanding.The suspense and action keep you reading non stop. I mean NON STOP. You can't put it down.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"SYNOPSIS:Military Pilot heroine is in Eastern Europe helping a Seal team rescue hostages on a hijacked airliner. There is an intense love story with the pilot who is screwed up from being sexually harassed at work, and from childhood sexual traumas and her Senior Chief who is emotionally disabled. There is also a parallel love story between a Seal team member and an FBI Agent .A Senator's daughter was supposed to be on the hijacked plane. The terrorists were going to kill the passengers one by one until she is identified, when another heroine in the story - Gina put her life on the line and lied and said she was the Senator's daughter.Gina spends hours and literally days on the radio with the FBI hostage negotiator Max. Her intelligence, and innate skills helped save many lives on board the airliner during the siege.SPOILER: Just before the take down, the terrorists attack and rape her as punishment for giving the FBI guys too much info. Max has to listen and watch in helpless agony the cameras they managed to place in the cockpit of the plane as this girl is terrorized and nearly killed. A female terrorist disguised as a passenger was supposed to set off a bomb and kill everyone including the rescuers in a surprise attack. The Israeli's knew about the concealed bomber, but decided to let the Americans die so it 'solidify' the US against terrorism. The Israeli Envoy spoils their plot and manages to get the crucial info to the rescue team on the plane literally with seconds to spare.The original pilot heroine saves everyone's lives and manages to save her shot up lover.This is a multi-faceted book that follows the long ago story of the Israeli envoy as she slips in and out of memory problems. Her past is as real as the present, and she struggles to cover up the fact that her mind is going going almost gone.PROS:I loved the characters and the drama. This book had it all. I was absolutely taken by all the couples in the book, and hated to see the end of the book. The first thing I did was run out and buy \\"Breaking Point\\" which has Gina and Max's story.I loved the endings that were told for the couples. They didn't just ride off into the sunset.CONS:The story does jump around and is told from many point of views. You have to concentrate. I didn't particularly like the story about the WWII couple. IMO it had too much of a different flavor and feel to the rest of the book. It was jarring every time we took a trip back in time. I think the author meant it to feel like that. Perhaps to give the reader a little taste of what the Envoy felt every time she took an unexpected and unwanted trip down memory lane.This is a con and a pro - the FBI Agent and the Seal are deeply in love, but a mistake he made got another woman pregnant, and he does the honorable thing even though it's breaking his heart and walks away from the FBI Agent to marry the pregnant ex-girlfriend. The scene where he came to tell her in person was heart wrenching. It was amazing. Two people have never more belonged together. The story telling aspect blew me away. I did object to doing amnio on a fetus not just once, but twice. That's inviting miscarriage with a giant waving flag.OBSERVATION:This is easily read as a stand alone novel. But it won't be your last Troubleshooters novel. Once you sink your teeth into this series, you'll love it and find yourself at the bookstore or tapping 'buy it now' for your Kindle."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I can't stop reading the Troubleshooters series. I am completely addicted and love the way each book focuses on a different main character so that you get to know all of Team 16."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"This is the third book revolving around the elite SEAL Team 16 Troubleshooter squad. I haven't got around to read the prior two book yet, because the Chief Stanley Wolchonok's character caught my interest and I directly jump to Book 3. In order to develop up the characters for her upcoming book in the series, Brockmann included a few subplot on secondary character such a Ken Kamody, Sam Starrett and Mike Muldoon.Chief Stanley Wolchonok aka \`Stan' had a reputation of being the fixer of all problems for the squad and had always admire helicopter pilot Teri Howe from afar. One day, he witnessed Teri being sexually harassed by her officer, he offered to help her out by requesting for her service for his training op to get her away from the officer. However, the training op turned into a real life takedown of a group of terrorist that had hijacked a commercial airplane with hostages. Stan felt sorry that he had dragged Teri into this deadly mission and offered to fly her back to the base, but Teri was determined to stay.The large part of the story dwell on the squad plotting and training for the takedown, while the negotiation with the terrorist was ongoing, by FBI Max Bhagat. The plane that got hijacked was believed to have the Senator's daughter onboard, only that she didn't make the flight. In order to stop the terrorist from harming more hostages, Gina Vitagliano step in to give herself up as the senator's daughter. She acted as the tool to negotiate with the FBI for the terrorist. They wanted their leader who was imprisoned to be release.In the meantime, Stan noticed Teri nervousness and inability to protect herself when being pursue by aggressive man. The funny part is when Stan trying to ask his buddies into role-playing to harass Teri, so that she get to practise how to response. Stan even tried to set up his friend Mike Muldoon to date Teri because he believed she need a man to protect her, while all this time he had feeling for her himself.I laughed in front of the book when Stan came up with such crazy ideas of role-playing with Teri and keep pushing Mike towards her. He kept planting the idea of Teri is such a great woman in Mike's mind. It might seem asinine to hear this, but Stan actually felt he was doing everything that's best for her. The romance plot is different from all the other generic plot that I had read before. The subplot about Sam and Alyssa is interesting as well. I'm sure we will get more on Sam in the future book."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I love Suzanne Brockmann, especially the Troubleshooters series. She's a master in action/suspense/thriller/romance.The early ones in the series are the best, in my opinion, and this is one of them. It features Teri Howe and Senior Chief Stan Wolchonok as the primary love story, and Sam and Alyssa as one of the secondary stories. It's also where Max first meets Gina.If you like fast paced romantic thrillers, and you haven't read Brockmann, try this series, and start at the beginning."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"This book was far better than the two previous ones I read of the \\"Troubleshooters\\" series.As usual there are three love stories in this book and as usual one of them goes back to WWII.I will give this book four stars although I thought that the part referring to WWII was just horrible. Firstly, the introduction of this romance was very badly done. The atmosphere created around Stan and Teri was torn down - as if an amateur had written this introduction! Secondly, this part wasn't interesting at all. It just kept interrupting the other strings of the story without leading somewhere. Of course Brockmann managed to save the story with its final developments but again, a feeling of annoyance stayed with me up until I reach the turn of this story.The romance between Stan and Tory was nicely done, although parts of it were unrealistic. I can't really get into details without giving too much away but Stan trying to work therapeutically with Teri? Especially in the way he did? Her using part of her inheritance in the way she did (towards the end of the book) without having clear \\"signals\\" from Stan? Anyway, apart from these the romance wasn't too bad.Hopefully I haven't yet read the last of Max and Gina. There's a lot of potential for a really intense love story.The same goes for Alyssa and Sam.

I thought: Thriller. Hijacked plane, navy seal...all the right stuff.And the beginning was promising. Stan fixes everything, and has a human side to him that was compelling.Then the plot hit the fan! As a thriller it stunk. The highjacking was interwoven into the plot weakly, as an after thought. The romantic \\"tension\\" between the protagonists was forced and irritating. The dialogue is mundane. The message that horniness leads to true romantic (Sam and Alyssa) love is rubbish.The only worthwhile character was the highjacked girl, and I think it was brave of the author to not have her come out unscathed.The historic (WWII) componant was interesting.But overall, I kept asking who the audience is for this book. Not lovers of thrillers like me--and I wonder, do romance readers even care about a highjacked plane, or was that just getting in the way of wondering whether Teri will ever tell Sam that she loves him!?"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"This is the first Suzanne Brockmann book I've ever read.

I don't normally write reviews, and never any bad ones, but I was so annoyed with the ending of this book I decided to vent a little of that here.

The twist at the end just broke my heart, but I am hopeful for more. Just a fabulous read."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"Suzanne Brockmann has done it again! In my opinion, this is the best so far. Not only do the leading couple (Terri &amp; Stan) get your attention but also all of the other charaters. You come away from this book feeling as if you really do know these people.As an avid reader I find myself being very critical when a book just doesn't deliver. I have always found Ms. Brockmanns story telling to be very acurate &amp; believable. Great Job. Can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"A great addition to a fine series, Over the Edge holds your attention from beginning to end. Weaving together the life stories of several characters, the novel is suspensful, full of action and touching.Teri and Stan's story is great, but a warning to those who were (as I was) anxiously awaiting the continuation of the relationship between Sam and Lys - be prepared for a surprise. I now find my self counting down to the NEXT book!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"One of the main reason I was so excited about this book was to see the outcome or at least the continuing saga of Alyssa and Sam. If ANY two people belonged together its those two. Needless to say, I was not very pleased. Of all the characters Suzanne Brockmann has written about Alyssa and Sam had the most depth. I think the way their relationship ends is almost criminal!!!!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I am an avid reader and this book is the best that I have come across in a long long time. I had never heard of Suzanne Brockman and randomly picked this book up at the airport, not expecting anything spectular. I was not able to put it down. I fell in love with all of the characters. especially Stan. Ms. Brockman paints the characters in such a way that you feel like you know and like them all, men and women. There is plenty of action, suspense and romance to keep you intrigued. I couldn't put the book down but I hated to finish it because I knew I would miss the people I had met in the book. Then I found out this was oonly one book in a series of books about the same charcters. I immediately went out and purchased as many other books as I could find by Ms. Brockmann. I am now a huge fan and highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"This novel needs to be in the general fiction category, it definitely is NOT your typical romance novel. It has everything you could want; intrigue, drama, action, and heartstopping sensuality. A few readers may find some of the dialog offensive (lots of F**K's flying around) but it's Navy SEALs that are talking. Anything else would have been totally unrealistic. I would also caution squeamish readers, there is a measure of extreme violence in this book that is also not found in a typical romance novel. I, for one, applaud Ms. Brockmann for not taking the easy way out and making each subplot have a &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending.The storyline that began with THE UNSUNG HERO and continued with THE DEFIANT HERO just keeps getting better and better. According to Ms. Brockmann, she has already written the fourth installment in this series (OUT OF CONTROL, due out early 2002)and at least two more will be coming soon. They can't come fast enough for me!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"The characters were all brilliant. The primaries, secondaries, even the minor characters were all so real you felt you could touch them. The action was well woven into an intricate and intense story that made it an all-night, I-can't-put-down-no-matter-how-early-I-have-to-get-up read.All of the characters were so different than the tired romance novel norms that I felt a bit like Alice, falling through the romance into a completely differnt genre. Teri is capeable, but afraid of men. Stan is a fix-it man who doesn't think of himself as attractive. Though he is attracted to Teri, he spends almost the whole book pushing her away, or setting her up with someone else. Sam is macho and rough, with a wall a mile thick to keep Alyssa from breaking his heart again, while she is a sharpshooter who has to be falling-down drunk to spend any time with him.If you a re a bit tired of typical, cookie cutter plots and characters, this book will renew your faith in the romance novel. Take heart, there are original authors out there."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I can truly say that Over the Edge brought out every emotion that I have and some that I didn't even know that I had. Stan and Terri will make you laugh and Sam and Lys will break your heart. I recommend that you purchase this book and the other's before it if you haven't already."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"This book is absolutely fabulous. It has everything, Love, action, danger, humer, history, romance! I could not put this book down and my husband even wanted to know what was happening (and he hates books).

Stan Wolchonok is the senior chief of the SEAL Team known as Team Sixteen Troubleshooters Squad. Stan notices her immediately and though he vehemently denies it to himself, he cares for Teri a great deal. When he sees her unable to defend herself when accosted by a former lover and unable to defend himself, he subtly breaks up the battle of the sexes and takes her under his wing.He arranges, with Teri&#65533;s consent, for her to be assigned to his team for an exercise in the Azores. However their flight is diverted when hijackers force a landing in Kazbekistan, holding over a hundred men, women and children hostage. Teri surprises herself by becoming emotionally involved with Stan and under wartime conditions, the pair finds a love that is strong, real and beautiful. Now, all they have to do is free the hostages without getting killed.Suzanne Brockmann has written one of the best books of her career, a novel that has action, adventure, intrigue and most of all, romance. It is the story of two lonely people who come together in the middle of a war zone and out of the ugliness comes something almost too beautiful to behold. This is a tale of finding the strength and courage to fight when common sense says flee. OVER THE EDGE takes the audience to the edge and back again.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"The relationships between Teri and Stan and Alyssa And Sam did not resemble in any way real life. Either Mrs Brockmann has had a number of poor relationships herself and does not know real life or she can't write about man and woman as they would normally interact. The story is good."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"Ms. Klausner described the book very well in her review. There is not only the romance between Teri Howe and Stan Kolchonek but also a story of a group of people during World War II that is sad and wonderful at the same time.There is the ongoing romance between Sam Starrett and Alyssa Locke which finally is turning around for the better when Sam is told a girl he had been having a tryst with declares she is pregnant by him and when he returns to the states he makes plans to marry her. Well, that's all well and good, but he swears he also used protection, the protection never broke so how can he accept the baby being his so easily? He doesn't even find out how pregnant she is, i.e. how many months and plans to marry her within a few days. Besides that she is a tramp who hangs out in a low class bar. Give me a break. They are both adults, he is supposedly very intelligent and we are expected to believe he will leave Alyssa behind and marry this tramp? I did not like this at all because it was not something that would happen in the real world today.I love Ms. Brockmann's books but this part left me cold."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"The past story in Denmark was fascinating made me research the history to learn more. Wanted Alyssa and Sam together but they are good enough to wait for!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"This book includes setups for some future story lines. It's not a case of read this first or you won't understand future books, but it adds to what you'll read or listen to in the future, especially books six, \\"Gone Too Far' and nine, \\"Breaking Point\\". To a minor degree this builds on books one and two, where we met Sam Starrett and Alyssa Locke and their feud began. All of the books build on information from previous books but that's especially true in this book.I love the series and the two stories entwined in this book, the main story and the sub-story from WWII. This is set in Kazbekistan, a fictional middle eastern country known as \\"the pit\\". The central characters (in case you know the series and care about who's being introduced) areFBIAllysa Locke, a sharpshooter recently retired from the Navy and recruited by the FBI's elite anti-terrorist team;her partner, Jules Cassidy, an openly gay FBI agent, we don't learn much about Jules yet, he's a fairly minor character;Max Bhagat, their boss who's the world's best hostage negotiator,Seal Team 16This is Senior Chief Petty Officer Stanley Wolchonok's story, if there's a problem, the Senior Chief can fix it;Sam Starrett, the man who makes Allysa Locke crazy with his redneck attitude;Wild Card Karmody, betrayed by his love of ten years, Adelle, Wild Card is a computer nerd who can't stay out of trouble;Mike Muldoon, very young, very pretty, very new, doesn't know how to approach women because \\"women just invite me up. So then I go to their room or their apartment or their house and they take off my clothes and I can pretty much handle it from there\\"The rest of the team float through the story.Other main characters:Teri Howe, Navy Reserve helo pilot, considered to be one of the best helo pilots available;Helga Rosen Shuler, an Israeli envoy who is dealing with beginning Alzheimer symptomsThe primary plot has to do with terrorists hijacking a plane and holding the passengers hostage in Kazbekistan. The secondary plot has to do with occupied Denmark. The Danish government surrendered to the Germans only two hours after the invasion and were able to negotiate better treatment than most countries. Also remarkable is that of 7,800 Danish Jews all but 474 escaped to Sweden. The Danish people did their best to protect their Jewish neighbors rather than trying not to see what was happening.Brockmann does a great deal of historic research for the sub-plots in the early part of this series and this is one of my favorites, the story of Helga Rosen and her friend Marte Grunvald, ten-year-old girls living in occupied Denmark.What really makes this series is the characters. After 16 books it's as though these people are part of the family. I think that some of the male sensitivity is a little over-done, at least from my experiences with men, but I'm not a man so maybe I stereotype them and they really are sensitive underneath. As I approach 60 and have increasing problems with my memory I really relate to Helga who is facing completely losing her memory at only 68.Although I've read this in print format this review is being written as I listen to the audio book and this part is only relevant to the audio book. I give the narrator only 2 stars though the book itself is a 5 star for me.Think about how it is to read a novel full of bad grammar. It can yank you right out of the story with a need to correct it. It's jarring. Just so with the narration here. Every time Hicks says the name Karmody she pronounces it with a long \\"o\\" and emphasis on the second syllable. It come out \\"car MOE dee\\" instead of \\"CAR muh dee\\". That seems like nit picking when I think about it or write it down, but every time she says the name it breaks the flow of the story for me. Maybe I'm over picky about narration, I've done some volunteer narrating using the Library of Congress rules and my producer would never allow a mispronunciation to pass. If we came to a place or name that neither of us knew it was looked up. It seems slip-shod that professional narration wouldn't be held to those same standards. Hicks also used a high whiny voice for some of the Navy Seals. I thought at first that she was interjecting some adolescents in the story, but then realized that these were grown men, of a particularly Alpha Male type that she was narrating. I'd rather have someone not try to differentiate the voices so much if she or he can't to it appropriately.Other than that caveat, I really enjoy this story. I don't know how many times I've listened to it or read it but it's more than half a dozen times. One of the benefits of a poor memory is the ability to enjoy a story many times before you know it so well that it loses some of the punch!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I was so anxious for this book to be put on the shelves for sale. I read it primarily to find out what happened to Sam and Alyssa. Then the ending for them left me so diappointed that I wanted to cry. Surely, this isn't the end for Sam and Alyssa. I read some of the other reviews implying that another book is in the works for Sam and Alyssa. I sure hope so! I love Suzanne Brockmann's books."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"This is the first Brockmann book I have read and the first review I am compelled to write. The book for the most part was very well written, however was most dissapointed with the story between Alyssa and Sam. Take this to heart readers, I don't want to read another one of her books because of the unresolved story line and am worried if I do I she will just leave me hanging again. I want to feel happy at the end of a book, not sad that two main characters did not get together. I was also dissapointed that one female(Teri)character who was a helicopter pilot for the Navy was so weak minded that she could not care of her own problems, but did like the story between her and Stan. The WWII I completely skimmed through."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (Troubleshooters, Book 3)","review":"I was enjoying this book right up until i read the rape scene. Like other people who gave a negative review i read romances for a guaranteed happy ending.i can handle the Sam and Alyssa ending because it was obvious that SB was building upto their story later.Nothing and i mean NOTHING kills my enjoyment of a book (whether it is a historical, contemporary, thriller, sci fi genre etc.) quicker than a rape scene, i don't care which character it happens to, it does not belong in my gooey romantic world! So now i find myself at midnight having to go through my book collection to find a nice gooey romanctic comedy to try and obliterate the nasties out of my head because i won't be able to sleep until it's gone.

If you haven't read Suzanne Brockmann before, or haven't read The Defiant Hero, I'm sure you'll love this book. It was very well written and it was a great story. But if you were waiting to find out what happens with Sam and Alyssa, you may not even want to read it. Oh, I'm sure this isn't the end for them. But how long will it go on? Will their story be resolved in Out of Control, or will I be disappointed again? I don't know if I want to know or if I'll even read any more by Suzanne Brockmann. Maybe by March I'll be over it and ready to read on.I just feel like I can trust romances, that I can care about the characters because I know there will be a happy ending. I don't feel like I can trust Suzanne Brockmann for that any more. I don't feel like I can care about her secondary characters, and then have it end like this, even temporarily.I guess I just wish Sam and Alyssa had had their own book, so I could read start-to-finish at one time. Then I could have hurt with them but still been emotionally safe. Then I could have been looking forward to little glimpses of them in future books, and been secure that they were happy. Instead I'm just disappointed, and not sure whether it's emotionally worth reading on.I was going to say that the rest of the book was awesome, and end with a positive. Maybe what happened to Gina was realistic, and definitely I don't like gritty reality. And at least Gina's story ended on a positive. But I really don't need the images it put in my head, and I skipped over the worst part."},{"Title":"Is-136 Tdma Technology, Economics and Services (Artech House Mobile Communications Library)","review":"If you need to know Is-136, this is the book.

In simple verse the author deals with issues such as how one's imagination can play tricks with the unknown on the other side of the fence; as well as the dilemma of being too small to see the other side. The book teaches the reader that sometimes these problems are solved on their own, just by getting older and how that's a nice thing.

The translators also provide a fascinating introduction (pp. 7-22) that discusses Celan's life and career. Semilian and Agalidi note that Celan, who is considered a major German-language poet, grew up and was educated in Romania, and that German was spoken in his parents' home. They also note that the poems and prose poems contained in this short volume (76 pages) were written during time that Celan spent in the Romanian capital of Bucharest between 1945 and 1947.The introduction further describes these Romanian pieces as \\"somewhat 'secret' or private\\" writings--texts that Celan \\"did not translate, publicize or intend to publish.\\" I found these pieces to be strange and surreal--overall this body of work reminds me of some of Gertrude Stein's adventurous writings. Celan uses words in odd, hard-to-decipher combinations; he often creates weird and striking imagery. There are occasional cultural references--Spanish dancers, Columbus, the Great Southern Cross, etc. But overall, there is very little in the poems that anchor them to identifiable historic or cultural moments. They feel more like deeply personal psychological phenomena. He also frequently uses the pronouns \\"I,\\" \\"you,\\" \\"we,\\" or variations thereof.Here are sample fragments that may give a sense of the overall flavor of the book: \\"Our phosphorescent eyeballs will scurry down from the walls\\"; \\"I offer my fingers bloodied by the floating spines of the nocturnal sky.\\" Other interesting phrases include \\"a chiming of celibate coins,\\" \\"the leprosied curtain of the bloodstained tents,\\" and \\"the razor-edged fanfare of the eyeless platoon.\\" This bilingual edition presents the Romanian and English versions on facing pages. Although I can neither read nor speak Romanian, I appreciated having the distinctive-looking Romanian text available; it adds visual excitement to the overall presentation. Overall, I found these poems too obscure for my taste. Still, the cryptic quality, dreamlike images and often striking language of these pieces make them oddly compelling."},{"Title":"The Billiard Guidebook","review":"The Billiard Guidebook is a must have if you own or plan to own a billiard table.

As the police investigated further into what they thought to be outlandish rumours of satanic rituals and child sacrifice, a strange story began to take form around a number of high profile individuals, notably the jealously obssessed and now out-of-favor royal mistress, the Marquise de Montespan, concerning a plot to assasinate the King and Queen themselves. The Marquise was said to have turned to the performance of satanic rites of the Black Mass, using the blood of child sacrifices, freshly killed by the self proclaimed abortionist and sorceress known as La Voisin. When her most desperate attempts to win the King back through black magic failed, the Marquise is said to have turned to murder, first of her competitors at court, and finally hatching a plot to poison the King himself. The details themselves are never truly know as the journals, testimonies, and eyewitness accounts taken down by the King's appointed investigators were locked away and later destoryed by the King himself, in a desperate attempt to avoid a potentially ruinous scandal that threatened to shake the very foundations of the monarchy.The Affair of the Poisons is a fascinating look into the strange world of the French court and the lengths one woman went to maintain her exalted status among the glittering yet hopelessly vain and self-destructive upper eschelon of French society. Perhaps the truth of these dark events of history will never be known for certain, but whether or not the Marquise was indeed guilty of the miriad of vile crimes attributed to her, her name has come down through the centuries as synonymous with evil. Sommerset has done an excellent job of retelling this tale with attention to detail, particularly the chapters concerning the highly complex intrigues of the court of Louis XIV and the machinations of his many mistresses. It also provides an fascinating glipse into the dark underworld of Parisan society and the many shady characters who inhabited it."},{"Title":"AFFAIR OF THE POISONS","review":"I bought this book in the bookstore at Versailles. After my tours of the palace and the gardens looking for ghosts and wondering what life was like and what was in the heads of the people at courts of Louis XIV, XV and XVI.

This is a well footnoted scholarly history but it is also a very good read, a very unusually good read."},{"Title":"AFFAIR OF THE POISONS","review":"I knew nothing about this period of history, other than having a vague knowledge of Louis XIV (\\"the Sun King\\"), before picking up this book. It is remarkably easy to read, packing in a great deal of information without ever being dry or tedious. The author takes a simultaneously critical and sympathetic look at the passions that drove the nobility and hangers-on at court, and makes shrewd estimates about the validity of various contemporary and historical theories regarding the events in issue (including observations about the biases of the various letter writers and memoirists on whose writings she draws as sources). I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in this period of French history.Also recommended: \\"Ridicule,\\" a film about the French court under Louis XVI, which bears out many of the observations in this book about the period a century earlier."},{"Title":"AFFAIR OF THE POISONS","review":"Since reading Alexander Dumas novels as a child I have always been fascinated with the intrigue and byzantine plots of the French Court. I was first made aware of the accusations against the Marquise de Montespan in a history book by Jacques Barzun which made her out to be a female anti christ or the whore of babylon. Somerset's history of the events goes into more depth and paints Athenais to be more of an earlier version of the witless Marie Antoinette than a French Lady McBeth.The whole affair of the poisons caused a paranoia that turned a criminal investigation into a Salem Witch Hunt or better yet a grassy knoll conspiracy that reached into the highest level of government. The fact that torture or the threat of torture and painful death were used to gain most of the 'confessions' was not seen as detrimental to the case by the public makes me glad in live in more modern times.The court of Louis XIV was the height of decadance and its opulance eventually caused the bankruptcy of the French treasury during the reign of his descendants leading to Revolution, Terror, and the Rise of the First Empire."},{"Title":"AFFAIR OF THE POISONS","review":"This was an interesting excursion into an area of French history I didn't know much about.The accusations and in some cases just hearsay,I found had similarities to a the hysteria InvolvingThe Salem Witch Trials.Would reccomend this for anyone withan interest in life at french court/Louis XIV."},{"Title":"AFFAIR OF THE POISONS","review":"Ever since reading Judith Merkle Riley's excellent novel \\"The Oracle Glass,\\" about the Affair of the Poisons, I have wanted to know more about the actual history that Riley based her book on. \\"The Affair of the Poisons\\" is a wonderfully detailed, well-written study through this strange time in French history, when courtiers at one of the most elegant courts in Europe turned to poison, fortune tellers, and even black magic to gain influence, money, lovers, and to keep their social standing.

It is, as stated at the front of the book, \\"an authentic reproduction of the text as printed by the original publisher,\\" and may come as a surprise to some since the printing in 1880 was not what it is today. At first I found the font to be a minor annoyance, but soon entered into the spirit of the thing. Henry James wrote the book in real time looking back at the time of Hawthorne forty years before, (which would be 169 years back from today) but it seems when reading it as if he had written it yesterday.I felt several emotions both towards Hawthorne and James. In parts James was patronizing, such as when he discusses Hawthorne's Notes, in \\"Early Manhood\\" Ch.2. \\"He appears to have read a good deal; and that he must have been familiar with the sources of good English, we see from his charming, expressive, slightly self-conscious, cultivated, but not too cultivated style.\\" This was after he had scornfully criticized passages in which Hawthorne had written about a dog he had seen chasing its tail and about \\"the aromatic odor of peat smoke in the sunny autumnal air.\\" This led me to believe that James was not always as objective in his critique as he intended to be. It showed especially in the last chapter where Henry James vents his displeasure to such a degree over the publication of \\"Septimius Felton,\\" professing to know what Hawthorne would or would not have wanted after his death, that he sees it ONLY from his point of view. Hawthorne was a romantic, Henry James more of a realist, so certain things grated on James' nerves, such as for instance, \\"The Elixir of Life.\\" James found it preposterous, \\"Indeed, this whole matter of elixirs and potions belongs to the fairy tale period of taste, and the idea of a young man enabling himself to live forever by concocting and imbibing a magic drought has the misfortune of not appealing to our sense of reality, or even to our sympathy. That should have read, \`my sense of reality, or even to my sympathy' since it was purely his view, and others including his family and the publisher had a different opinion.Henry James takes great care to impress upon us how much he admires Hawthorne, referring to him several times as a genius, but the two men were very different. Henry James seems to have enjoyed walking among people, Hawthorne was more of a recluse. James stands back mostly in an objective way to assess this shy sensitive man, but sometimes as I said, in a patronizing way. Perhaps it was that Hawthorne was woven from such fine thread, the finest silk, that he hid behind his shyness to keep himself aloof. His musings could be read as self-pity, he had not been discovered early enough, he never had enough money, some men would be bitter, Hawthorne licked his wounds. Hawthorne seemed to bear the weight of the sins of his forefather like a nail sticking up in his boot, but it was the very irritant which gave him the stimulus for his amazing creativity.A very thought provoking book, highly recommended"},{"Title":"Hawthorne, (English men of letters, ed. by J. Morley)","review":"James says of his book on Hawthorne that it is not a biography but rather a critical essay. Edmund Wilson says of it that it is still one of the finest literary biographies ever done on an American writer. As William Howells in his somewhat chiding but appreciative review said of it James is perhaps a bit harsh on his 'native ground'. James makes mock of Thoreau and does not have the kindest words for Emerson. The book contains the famous passage of 'Nos' in which James lists all the elements of a country which make it suited to produce the highest culture. He notes that America is without 'sovereign' without castles, without courts, and without Ascot and Epsom. The implication is that there has not been enough history in America ( until that is James time when the 'Civil War' changes everything) to produce the highest form of Literature.Yet James has great appreciation for the singular genius of Hawthorne. He considers him to be the greatest imaginative writer that America had produced. He too is appreciative of the character of Hawthorne about which he has extremely kind words.James in a sense indirectly in this work written by the way for a British publisher and audience is defining and defending his own absconding to Europe for the greatest part of his literary life. Here perhaps Howells criticism of him touches not on the wisdom of that decision but of that snobbish failure to recognize that the ordinary hurly- burly of American daily life, could become as it already had in the great work of Whitman Melville Thoreau Emerson subject of great Literature.In any case reading this work one comes into contact again with the masterful voice and style of James, whose long sentences rich in perception and fine moral distinction prove to kind of refined literary delight that his master Hawthorne too exemplified."},{"Title":"Aditya Vikram Birla, a biography","review":"Book is a masterpiece and depicts the life of one of India's greatest business tycoons, Aditya Vikram Birla.

Today's successful salesperson is a better listener than talker and emphasizes relationships instead of high pressure sales.2. Types of personal selling approaches.3. The importance of trust and how salespeople can earn it.4. 6 primary facets of effective listening.5. Initiating a harmonious atmosphere and displaying proper etiquette and grooming are very important in making a favorable first impression.6. Summaries of the different types of approaches salespeople may use in a sales call.7. Reasons why customers resist buying.8. Techniques to get a commitment from a customer.9. Repeat business is the lifeline of any business. While new business is important, it is more important to keep existing customers happy.10. Tips on handling customer complaints.While the book is meant to be more of a college textbook instead of something you may find by Zig Ziglar, John Maxwell, and others, the title contains good practical advice for the beginning or veteran salesperson. Having been in sales for over 10 years, I still benefitted from reading the book and will apply the pointers in future sales calls.While the book is pricey compared to other authors (Ziglar, etc.), the book would be an excellent sales class taught at the college level.Recommmended.

It is a good and most adequate introduction to the language. However, the exercises do not go far enough. For those students wanting to take a more serious and approach, I would recommend 'Shin Nihongo no Kiso' which can be found at most specialty language bookstores.

This is one.Polly Berrien Berends is wise and gentle. She brings lofty or deep spiritual insights to the rubber-meets-the-road issues of daily parenting: how is one to approach fears of childbirth? How should one talk to a toddler? How does one decide which toys to buy?I had the good fortune to read this book just prior to becoming a parent, and if possible, you should too. It is not a quick or easy read, rather a very meaningful one. Sometimes I had to stop and think after only three or four pages. But this was well worth it.If you are already a parent, or if you may never become a parent, read this book. Although it addresses parenting issues it is really a book about human-being-hood."},{"Title":"Whole Child/ Whole Parent","review":"I had the fortune to begin to read this book 10 years before our twins were born. Whether you are a parent or not Berend's statement of the perennial spiritual wisdom is to be savored and dipped into over and over again. The book is so rich, so moving, so poetic that frequently you will find that you need to stop and reflect on her words after a page or two.This book, along with Berend's unfortunately out-of-print &quot;Coming To Life&quot;, is a true spiritual classic."},{"Title":"Whole Child/ Whole Parent","review":"I discovered this at the discount table of a bookstore in Lexington, Kentucky. It does not get old or outdated.How easily this book could have drifted off into self-indulgent Freudian psychobabble, Fundamentalist moralism or New Age narcissism--all of which Alice Miller has warned us against--in the hands of a less gifted writer. The fact that it doesn't at any time in 340-plus pages is nothing short of miraculous. Polly Berends not only challenges one's view of parenting and loving, but also of Christianity and culture and the universe itself, by bringing mysticism back to the modern Christian mind while not alienating those of other (or no particular) faiths. Filled with transcendent prose, quotes of everything from Buddhist sacred text to the New Testament to e.e. cumming poetry, and the writer's own heart (the heart of a proud mother and wife who walks with God), this is a truly beautiful work that made my mind scream what was important about my personal relationship with my son to me, above the distractions of my ego, with virtually every page.Consider yourself the child, and this book will help you raise yourself. And then imagine what kind of real parent you can be while following its lessons.This is the ultimate holiday, Mother/Father's Day or birthday gift for anyone with children, bar none.Beautiful."},{"Title":"Whole Child/ Whole Parent","review":"Wow, this book is the one parenting book that I have read that I can say changed my entire way of looking at my job as a mother. The spirituality of being a parent and the spiritual lessons that await us every single day are now so apparent in my mind after reading this book. My relationship with my spirited child and nursing babe has completely been transformed as I process this book and consciously live out the spiritual moments of my day. Please give this book at least a chance to enter into your journey of parenthood."},{"Title":"Whole Child/ Whole Parent","review":"When you find yourself wondering how you can continue doing the mundane, day to day, oft mindless work of raising children then you need to read this book.I am raising 4 children in a culture that does not value community or child rearing as a noble vocation. Polly's book gave me strength in the face of despair. It taught me that my children had chosen to come into my life to teach me how to live as much as for me to teach them how to be. Do not let the spiritual nature of this book frighten you. Her teaching is gentle and wise."},{"Title":"Whole Child/ Whole Parent","review":"Peace, this book brings peace to those early years of new parenting. I remember how much it helped me deal with the emotional and identity adjustments a new mother has to make. It was priceless in terms of getting me past my own ego. I found that reading this book for a few minutes each night, especially in that first year of being a mom, really helped me stay focused in terms of the kind of parent I wanted to be for my daughter. Not the kind of child I wanted my daughter to be. I think this is some of what other reviewers might also be referring to when they say it changed their ideas of parenting. This is not a book with a list of things you must buy-- on the contrary, the author makes an enlightened case for how little you actually have to buy when you have a baby. The only problem is that the beliefs in this book are not popular ones in our mainstream society. This isn't a book about controlling your child or making him or her smarter."},{"Title":"Whole Child/ Whole Parent","review":"I highly recommend this book to any parent. I am expecting my first child any day now and it has been such a comfort reading this book as I prepare for parenthood! My mother had the original version long ago before she had me. I must say I like this updated version better--even the author says she needed to make the changes/updates as she had become older/wiser. I believe the first version was writtin in the late 60's early 70's, so this version, written in the mid-late 90's is definitely an update. Regardless or time or era, this book is essential, in my humble opinion! If you consider yourself a spiritual person, this book is for you. If you don't, it could still be helpful."},{"Title":"Whole Child/ Whole Parent","review":"This book was suggested to me over 26 years ago when I began my family.

I do not know if this is an isolated incident (I didn't dare buy another 1997 edition and have since bought a copy of the 1987 edition, which is complete) but do want to warn others and find out if other copies of the 1997 edition are missing pages.Thanks to anyone who wants to take a look at their copy and post a response!"},{"Title":"Black Rock: A tale of The Selkirks","review":"Mining and lumberjack boom town in the 1880's, where a new minister brings a fight for men's souls against saloons and drug pushers.

Author Jason Weiss writes clearly and has complete command of all the relevant primary and secondary literature. The book is valuable because it fills an important gap in literary scholarship by analysing in detail the enormous importance of Paris for the whole phenomenon of Latin American literature. Knowledge of the role of Paris in the lives of these writers is essential for any reader's understanding of their works. Mr. Weiss provides the historical background by discussing the changing perception of Paris throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. He then discusses in roughly chronological order the Parisian experiences of about two dozen important writers from Rub&eacute;n Dar&iacute;o to Hector Bianciotti. In the context of each life, he discusses the reasons, personal and often political, that brought the person to Paris, how they lived, whom they knew and how they worked. The book is, however, much more than a mere collection of biographical sketches; the discussion is enriched by intelligent literary criticism that shows how the Parisian experience became a lens through which these writers saw the Latin American world that is the subject of so many of their works. The book is also valuable because of its excellent discussion of the broader topic of writers in exile or at least living abroad and writing of home, and sometimes even writing in a new language. Finally, throughout the book Mr. Weiss never forgets to examine the reception of Latin American literature in France."},{"Title":"Sisters, Sexperts, Queers: Beyond the Lesbian Nation (Plume)","review":"I bought this book as it was noted as having \\"broadened the parameters in which lesbian sex is discussed.\\" by the author Tee A.

I think you'd like it."},{"Title":"Manson: The Unholy Trail of Charlie and the Family","review":"If you want to OWN every book ever written about Manson and his family, then by all means purchase this book.If you want to KNOW everything there is to know about Manson and his family, then by all means stay away from this book.The chapters are redundant. You'll find the same quotes from chapter to chapter. While reading a chapter all of a sudden the authors will change subjects, sometimes without finishing the thought that they were working on. This makes the book a somewhat difficult read.In some instances in the book, family members are given pseudonyms when it's not really called for. For example, the authors repeatedly call Mary Brunner, Marie O'Brien. At the same time they have a photo of Mary Brunner with the right name captioned. Made absolutely no sense to me at all. Her role in the family is also downplayed. She appears in the book only a few times. Her role in the Hinman murders is also downplayed.There are also instances where some of the picture captions are incorrect. There is a picture of the \\"girls\\" on a garbage run that lists Gypsy - Catherine Share - as one of those in the picture. She's not in the picture. However, Mary Brunner is, and yet she's not listed.It would appear to me that there was very little verification or editing done with this book. You would expect, at the very least, for a re-released (with additions) book, that SOMEONE would have had the forethought to review and edit it.Lastly, the addition of new photos to the book are uncalled for. There is no reason, whatsoever, to put in death photos. The photos do not in any way enhance this book, they actually diminish it. The pictures are gruesome and brutal. Why not show the vibrant faces of the victims as they were in living, not as they were in death? The only pictures of the victims, other than the death photos, are of Sharon Tate. Somehow the other victims always seem to get lost.Not exactly a book I'd recommend to anyone other than those that want to fill their \\"Manson Library\\"."},{"Title":"Manson: The Unholy Trail of Charlie and the Family","review":"It's difficult to put my finger on why, but I found this book to be somewhat lacking. While it was indeed a good read, a lot of the information was contrary to what has been published in other books, at times leaving the reader unsure of what the truth really is. Perhaps I've read too many books about the Tate-Labianca murders, but these books were written by the murderers and the prosecuter, Vincent Bugliosi. I found little new information about the case, but did find something I hadn't quite expected---very graphic photos of the murder victims after their arrival at the morgue. Having never seen these photos before, I was sickened at the sight of just how brutal these murders were. Yes, I had read how many times each victim had been stabbed, but to actually see these photos was very disturbing.While I do recommend this book as a good read, I would caution anyone to think twice before viewing the photos---they are not images that are easily forgotten. I sincerely hope each time one of the heartless murderers appears before a parole board, these graghic photos will be presented as proof that none of these people should EVER be set free!"},{"Title":"Manson: The Unholy Trail of Charlie and the Family","review":"This book is an exploration into the world that was created by Charles Manson. The writer, John Gilmore (Los Angeles Times says of Gilmore's book, COLD-BLOODED, \\"An essential masterpiece in the true crime genre\\"), has created a window to Charlie Manson's world by close involvement not only with Manson but with all facets of this incredible, terrifying mise en scene. One reviewer has seemingly faulted this book for not being \\"entertainment,\\" and sites Helter Skelter as their choice of entertainment. No, Gilmore's book is not \\"entertainment,\\" but rather ENLIGHTENMENT. Helter Skelter was an excellent offering from the author's point of view, that of the prosecutor in the case against Manson and the girls accused of murder. Helter Skelter is told exclusively from that point of view, examining Manson and the Family at a safe distance, as beasts in cages, much as we observe animals at the zoo. That is entertainment. John Gilmore's examination of this case has no bars separating us from the beasts. We are accompany them on their lives, are placed right in with them. We share life with them, we watch their heads ticking, and we kill with them. This is a terrifying place to be. Gilmore's book was one of the earliest books to be published on the Manson case. There have been a number of imitations, trying to lead us into this twisted world so effortlessly accompolished by Gilmore. He has lived inside Manson's head, and his book stands alone in taking us into a warped world that will remain as timeless as the Holocaust. So, no, this is not \\"entertainment.\\" For entertainment, one must visit the tube for a sitcom or a movie made for TV. For education, for enlightenment, though, Gilmore's book is the one to read. It dark, yes. It is shocking, yes. Helter Skelter gives us a broad and worthwhile study of the legalities and the case from the prosecution's personal, bestseller-style, perspective. In fairness, I suggest reading Gilmore's book and Helter Skelter, to gain as much insight as possible into this mindboggling horror that seems right at our fingertips. I was smelling the blood in Gilmore's book, and yet I could not turn away.As for the photographs of the victims from the murder scene and at the morgue, this was the first time these photographs were published in a book dealing with this case. What appears online were \\"borrowed\\" from Mr. Gilmore's book. They are now world-wide, and nonetheless disturbing, frightening, or unforgettable. Gilmore's book is not \\"entertainment,\\" unless you subscribe to the same nightmare view created by Charles Manson. This book and these photographs remind us that true evil is very close, so close, in fact, it can reach out and touch us at any time."},{"Title":"Manson: The Unholy Trail of Charlie and the Family","review":"Published years ago as THE GARBAGE PEOPLE, this revised and updated classic is still the reliable text dealing with Charles Manson and his ragtag, violent family. The real horror and sickness of these people comes through the text. It is disturbing and unforgettable indeed, and none of these individuals should EVER be let out of prison. No one can commit such horrible deeds as this and hope to be reformed in the same lifetime. Yet Manson, who apparently never did any of the murders himself, comes through as this broken Svengali who orchestrated the evil deeds. The photographs are very graphic, showing all of the victims in death. The writing is terse and sharp, almost hard-boiled, as is much of what John Gilmore writes. Yet that can be deceptive, as one enters this world Gilmore creates in much the same way you would let your child walk into a lion's den. An education, indeed. There is a powerful lesson here and I'm still trying to sort out...I'll never undserstand how the lovely Sharon Tate, eight months pregnant, was butchered like a lamb being slaughtered, and for what? Though confined for life, these killers have been able to marry, have children of their own, and claim to have found &quot;God&quot;. They ask us to forgive them while we are still weeping for poor Sharon and the others. In an indirect, oblique way, Gilmore, in reminding us of things we should never forget, seems to drive this question into the reader. He has fixed it so I'll never forget, nor will I ever understand such brutality in the human condition. Despite some petty grumblings from other reviewers (who have obviously missed the point), this book is an imporant aid in our attempt to understand and deal with the darker side of the human experience."},{"Title":"Manson: The Unholy Trail of Charlie and the Family","review":"I was expecting more from this updated version of the 1971 book ,\\"The Garbage People\\"As a period piece its just ok.

John Gilmore does it again: burrows inside the skins of Charlie, Susan Atkins, the totally dysfunctional (except to kill!)Tex Watkins, and dangerous Bobbyh Beausoleil. This is probably the most vital document on the flipside of the American Dream; the book makes no compromise, promises or expectations. It takes the reader inside the heads of these people; we are right there and part of this terrible, tragic history. Gilmore's writing nails the reader page by page. The many photographs of Sharon Tate's body (alive and dead) are almost unbearable. There are many other very brutal photographs in this book and the easily shocked reader must be warned. This book is without peer."},{"Title":"Manson: The Unholy Trail of Charlie and the Family","review":"John Gilmore's account of Charles Manson and his followers (the &quot;Family&quot;) is the stuff of which nightmares are made.

Helter Skelter was an excellent offering from the author's point of view, that of the prosecutor in the case against Manson and the girls accused of murder. Helter Skelter is told exclusively from that point of view, examining Manson and the Family at a safe distance, as beasts in cages, much as we observe animals at the zoo. That is entertainment. John Gilmore's examination of this case has no bars separating us from the beasts. We are accompany them on their lives, are placed right in with them. We share life with them, we watch their heads ticking, and we kill with them. This is a terrifying place to be. Gilmore's book was one of the earliest books to be published on the Manson case. There have been a number of imitations, trying to lead us into this twisted world so effortlessly accompolished by Gilmore. He has lived inside Manson's head, and his book stands alone in taking us into a warped world that will remain as timeless as the Holocaust. So, no, this is not \\"entertainment.\\" For entertainment, one must visit the tube for a sitcom or a movie made for TV. For education, for enlightenment, though, Gilmore's book is the one to read. It dark, yes. It is shocking, yes. Helter Skelter gives us a broad and worthwhile study of the legalities and the case from the prosecution's personal, bestseller-style, perspective. In fairness, I suggest reading Gilmore's book and Helter Skelter, to gain as much insight as possible into this mindboggling horror that seems right at our fingertips. I was smelling the blood in Gilmore's book, and yet I could not turn away.As for the photographs of the victims from the murder scene and at the morgue, this was the first time these photographs were published in a book dealing with this case. What appears online were \\"borrowed\\" from Mr. Gilmore's book. They are now world-wide, and nonetheless disturbing, frightening, or unforgettable. Gilmore's book is not \\"entertainment,\\" unless you subscribe to the same nightmare view created by Charles Manson. This book and these photographs remind us that true evil is very close, so close, in fact, it can reach out and touch us at any time."},{"Title":"Manson: The Unholy Trail of Charlie and the Family","review":"I have read most, if not all, of the Manson books out there and this is by far the worst Manson book I have ever read. Why does the author use Marie O'Brien instead of Mary Brunner?? I would never recommend this book to anyone and I regret buying it."},{"Title":"Manson: The Unholy Trail of Charlie and the Family","review":"I regret buying this book. Although Mr. Gilmore substitutes some names like \\"Marie O'Brien\\" for Mary Brunner, it is obvious who \\"Marie O'Brien is. Yet he shows pictures of Mary Brunner using her real name.

Unless you are an avid collector of Manson Family books, I would let this one pass. Wish I had."},{"Title":"Manson: The Unholy Trail of Charlie and the Family","review":"This book gave a interesting glimpse into life in the late 1960s. It also presented versions of those involved that you will not see fully in newer books, interviews or books authored by the \\"family members\\" themselves (after time in prison and some being \\"born again\\"). This book described Manson's early life in detail without the typical \\"he was sold for a pitcher of beer\\" stories. Some things that I could've done without were the lengthy interviews with Bobby B; they began to ramble and sound like babble to me. Also, the description of Manson in the beginning of the book was a little overly dramatic for my taste. I have never bought into the media's version of Manson - a hippie guru who has the power to change in front of your eyes and control those around him. That is what the media wants to portray, not anything Manson wanted portrayed. Also, the pictures were a bit much and not necessary to sell the book. I think it was disrespectful to the family of the deceased to publish morgue and autopsy photos. All in all this was a good book and I would recommend it for those interested in this subject."},{"Title":"Manson: The Unholy Trail of Charlie and the Family","review":"errie and different then the other books on Charles and his disiples.The shaven head and cross on the forehead is a Jewish way of showing that they are not gomorrites ( without morles ) and have remorse for what they did."},{"Title":"Manson: The Unholy Trail of Charlie and the Family","review":"This book on Manson is quite interesting.....Not a bad read at all.

Quite Morbid, horrifying, and scary. You can see what Manson and his monsters did to all those poor victims. Quite shocking. So take this review as a &quot;warning&quot; when you buy this book.

It's a waste of time and recycles information and exaggerates other information. The book has three chapter on Beausoleil, which was interesting but skips over key Family members like Squeaky and Mary and only focuses on the more known ones. The book obviously intentionally uses adjectives like \\"Hypnotic\\" and \\"evil\\" over and over again to make innocent situations seem evil. It's just horrible tabloid-esque writing.It's too bad because the book has some useful information wedged in piles of crap.The writer obviously had no clue about the case other than the silly \\"Helter Skelter\\" fairytale.

The author is a Yale sociologist who uses knowledge of his chosen vocation to peruse scripture and church tradition for Christian teaching on gender roles. In a little less than 800 pages Clark offers up a stunning theology of how the church has responded to gender issues in the past and how we as modern-day believers should respond to this current hornet's nest of political correctness. I am so convinced of the importance of the gender issue debate and the strength of the work Clark has done in this book that I believe every Christian should read it. The Christian church is stagnating and ineffective in today's issue debates not because her positions are poor, but because she has become ignorant and apathetic."},{"Title":"Man and Woman in Christ: An Examination of the Roles of Men and Women in Light of Scripture and the Social Sciences","review":"I read Clark's masterpiece in the late 1970s or early 1980s, and it has formed the bedrock of my thinking about men and women in (or out of) the Church ever since.

The back section of Volume II/2 (pages 821-939) has solutions to the exercises in both the books comprising volume II, that is \\"Introduction to Calculus and Analysis II/1\\" and \\"Introduction to Calculus and Analysis II/2\\".Note that when Volume I of the original Courant and John \\"Introduction to Calculus and Analysis\\" was published in the 1960s by Wiley, an accompanying solutions manual for Volume I was prepared by Prof. Albert A. Blank. When Volume II was published by Wiley, Prof. Blank's solutions were incorporated into the back of Volume II (in other words, Volume II comes with the answers to the questions at the back of the book... or in the back of Volume II/2 in the case of this Springer \\"Classics in Mathematics\\" reprint.) However, the Springer reprint of Wiley's Volume I lacks solutions to the exercises in the textbook.If you buy Volume I, do a check on the Internet for an old 1960s copy of Prof. Albert Blank's \\"Problems in Calculus and Analysis\\", which is the original solutions manual to Courant's Volume I."},{"Title":"Introduction To Calculus & Analysis Volume 1","review":"I don't use the word \\"superior\\" lightly, but this book definitely warrants it. Courant was a first rate teacher and mathematician, and his brilliance shows in his exposition. The main obstacle to some readers may be that Courant does not follow the \\"cookbook calculus\\" approach that seems so rampant today, but actually bothers to prove his results. He does, however, reserve most of the more difficult proofs for the appendices at the end of the chapter, which is most appreciated.The result is an exciting read, yet rigorous. The reader is very well prepared for future courses in mathematical analysis, and even has a leg up on real analysis. While Courant's insistence on proof does mean that the student needs to have a basic grounding in proof methods, this is usually a standard part of the undergraduate curriclum. Courant rightly recognizes that calculus should be taught in a logical, yet rigorous presentation from the beginning. The absence of this in modern texts mean that students learn how to manipulate formulas, but have no idea what makes the results they are assuming true. The \\"mechanics\\" of calculus and analysis, the most crucial thing to be learn, is missed.In particular, I enjoyed his presentation of integration *before* differentiation, which goes against the grain of basic calc texts, yet is historically and pedagogically correct. Integration actually paves the way for differentiation, and gives more motivation for the FTC. Most texts on real analysis work in that order anyway, as an understanding of Lebesgue measure and integration is crucial to understanding the process of differentiation.In addition, I don't think I have ever before or since seen such a careful explanation of the theory of the logarithm or exponential functions. Again, the presentation makes it work, as just introducing the \\"exponential function\\", then a little later, the \\"log function\\" as the \\"inverse\\" of the exponential function is, to put it mildly, artificial and distasteful. The natural progression from the definite integral definition of the logarithm to the exponential function is displayed in its full glory.In short, Courant manages to present some of the most crucial results of calculus and basic analysis without boring the reader to tears with arcane details, or worse, leaving the reader hanging on important theorems and ideas. This is a balance only a great mathematician could strike, and it is clear why this book remains a classic after almost 60 years.Note: The second volume of this work covers the multivariable portion of calculus, and will be more difficult to follow without prior exposure to the subject. However, the introductions to the theory of matrices and the calculus of variations are very readable, and it is recommended that the reader take the time to peruse them. Also, don't miss the material on special functions, lightly touched on in the first volume, but explained in fuller detail in the second."},{"Title":"Introduction To Calculus & Analysis Volume 1","review":"Those books (volumes 1-2) can be seen as a new edition of Courant's classical Differential and Integral Calculus, volumes 1-2 (that can still be used for general calculus courses). The first volume was written while Courant was still alive, and the second was postumous. I believe that they are the best work to start understanding analysis. Indeed, for the general scientist (as a physicist) it contains all the theory needed for any application. The book is not easy reading though. Much of the text can be understood on first reading, but there are pretty profound sections, mostly on the appendixes, that turn the book genuinely onto a book of analysis. The second volume requires some mathematical maturity, and I doubt whether it is suitable for beginners, but it is simply the best book of multivariate calculus that I know - and it is really difficult to think of a better presentation. Courant was a giant, and his concept of mathematics shines in every page of those books (although he did not see the publication of the second volume, his hand can be seen in every page). For the serious mathematician, a must-have. For the beginner, the best way to get in love. Courant and John don't lie, they give every proof and guide you most gently in this complicated garden called mathematics. I'd give it aleph stars if it was possible."},{"Title":"Introduction To Calculus & Analysis Volume 1","review":"Richard Courant was a master of mathematical exposition, and this is one of his best works. In keeping with Courant's philosphy, this book is free from the excessive abstraction often found even in introductory calculus textbooks. Nevertheless it does not gloss over difficulties in the material, and is in no sense an easy book. This book a complete rewrite of Courant's original &quot;Calculus&quot; which first appeared in German. An especially good chapter is the one on the &quot;Theory of Plane Curves.&quot;"},{"Title":"Introduction To Calculus & Analysis Volume 1","review":"This book is excellent for an introductory course in calculus and/or analysis. Through each chapter Courant familiarizes you with the principal ideas of analysis and leaves the proof of the theorems for the supplement at the end of each chapter. It has a lot of interesting examples and exercises as well. This book is so well written that is a joy to read. Though it lacks the brevity and the straight-forward approach of more modern books like that of Apostol, I strongly recommend this book to beginners and to those who have experience with more restrainted texts. I also recommend Hardy's book &quot;A Course of Pure Mathematics&quot;."},{"Title":"Introduction To Calculus & Analysis Volume 1","review":"Courant and John have done an excellent job in making me a Calculus-and-Analysis fan. The book is very well written, well motivated and easy to understand - even for me, as an absolute beginner. This doesn't mean it hasn't got any difficult parts, but because the books is so well written, it becomes even more challenging. One of the best books on Calculus and Analysis, even on Mathematics in general. It makes you want to throw your poor high school textbooks in the waste bin."},{"Title":"Introduction To Calculus & Analysis Volume 1","review":"This book is one of my favourites. It coversa /LOT/ of ground with ample explanations and an approach that favours an intuitive understanding of the basic elements of Analysis along with a certain amount of necassary mathematical rigour.It introduces Integration before Differentiation, which is historically correct and allows one to understand the intricate tie between the twoprocesses more thoroghly. A pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Introduction To Calculus & Analysis Volume 1","review":"This is a rewrite of the great book by Courant, and it does justice to its origin. I prefer the somewhat more charming original book of Courant myself, but I have taught from this one too and learned something more.Since the original Courant costs $120 for the 2 volume set, this volume at $33 is a bargain, so snap it up. This is 10 times as valuable as most current $130 calculus books."},{"Title":"Introduction To Calculus & Analysis Volume 1","review":"I bought the book some time ago, but I haven't read all of it. However, I have used it as a reference whenever I need to clarify a mathematical concept. Hence my (incomplete) review is based on the \\"feeling\\" of the book rather than scrutiny.The book has helped me clarify some things. The thing that surprised me the most is that once I open the book I cannot seem to drop it and I find myself looking for more than I originally planned, due to the clarity and elegance of presentation. Moreover, whenever I bump into a relevant mathematical concept, I am eager to open the book and see what the authors have to say about it. I only wish I had this book in my early years as an undergraduate engineering student.One can read the Preface, especially page vi (it is part of the preview offered by amazon), and grasp the spirit of the writers and their attitude and beliefs about mathematics and education. I guess most of the readers would prefer a review on the details of the mathematical methods used and may think that these are trivial matters but for me they aren't. The authors' views on mathematics, as presented in the preface, are supported by short historical overview of the development of mathematics and resonate through every section of the book I have read (see for example the introduction to the Supplement on p.87). These can prove helpful especially to those interested in self-study like myself."},{"Title":"Introduction To Calculus & Analysis Volume 1","review":"For people taking a very rigorous calculus course or an introductory Analysis course, this is a good book.

My research interests are neuroscience, vision, statistics, classification, and machine learning.While this text is not directly in my line of research, it offers a superb and comprehensive mathematical treatment of many topics in physics. Such treatments are useful to researchers from other disciplines.In statistics, I could not find a treatment of tensors, spherical harmonics, and orthogonal polynomials (as they relate to multivariate probability distributions). I was forced to turn to this textbook for the Physics-related treatment. I soon discovered that it is a treasure-trove of knowledge. It is beautifully written and accessible to the mathematically inclined reader without proper training in Physics. (I took AP Physics in high school -- and that was it.)This is a very thick text. A great reference for many topics."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"This book is the epitome of useless texts. I used this book for graduate mathematical physics as well as the \\"essential\\" version for undergraduate math methods. I have yet to learn a single thing from this book or find it remotely useful as a reference.The explanations range from non-existent to shockingly awful to terribly incomplete.It appears that the authors simply vomited a collection of formulas into a word processor and sold it as a textbook.Mathematical Methods of Physics (2nd Edition)is much better."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"This book atempts to cover most of the fields one runs into while studying physics, starting from scratch, without resorting to multiple volumes or 10kg tombs. With over 1100 pages this is no pocket book, but is still the right size to not become too cumbersome. Finding a particular topic can be at times time consuming since the index isnt of the best, and some topics are spread out over various chapters, putting you in the position of having to jump chunks of pages all the time to find the specific item. However in the end one generally succeeds and the explanations are mostly clear and well made. Arfken covers vector analysis, group theory, complex analysis, differential equations, special functions, series, integral transforms and equations and many other topics and this choise of a vast selection reflects in what is sometimes a too little detailed description of what one is looking for; this book will be of little use to someone trying to solve any slightly advanced problems (the hypergeometric function part for example) and another text will be prefered (Whittaker & Watson, ...). You cant have it all; this book is overall a good example of stocking up alot of stuff giving you a general idea about it all, without entering in too many (unneccessary) details, and succeeds in giving the sensation that u can reffer to it for anything, getting enough knowledge to then be able to search for a more specific description in other litterature if needed. Moreover it contains very many problems (most unsolved, some with hints) that can help clearify the basics, if one has the time to scroll through them.The hardcover is neet and well made, however the paper quality is pretty bad and does not fully justify the price of the HC version."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"So you know who's writing this, I'm a grad student in Mechanical Engineering.This book is definitely not for anyone who is not already familiar with the subjects in the book, especially if you're in a class that uses this as the textbook since there is not enough explanation in the book to do the problems.Other reviewers have recommended using this as a reference and getting other books if you're trying to learn the material for the first time. I have to agree with that since this was my first exposure to subjects like tensors and the &quot;explanations&quot; in the book are disgustingly incomplete.There are several errors (especially in the problem sets) that were not in previous editions. This is unfortunate as one would expect a text to have less errors as time goes on.

In each section, Arfken teaches the bare essentials and then asks the student to work out the rest of the body of knowledge in the exercises. Each new theorem or principle is clearly developed in small learnable steps, and the student has the feeling of Developing Physics, instead of just learning about it. Most exercises are of the type &quot;Prove that statement (or equation) X to be true&quot;, so the student doesn't have to worry too much about numerical answers. Each exercise or topic is carefully built on the foundation of what went before. When finished, I *really understand* the deeper issues of the topic.Dr. Arfken's perspectives on the subject matter also open up entire new worlds to explore. Many times, at the end of an exercise, I realized I had just proven a statement of which I had always wanted to see the proof. There is a strong Aha! content to the entire book."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"I find the book by Arfken and Weber very usefull as a reference book in everyday work. I study experimental physics on university level. It is very good as an experimentalist to have had all the courses in higher mathematics but 2-3 years later, when you have have a concrete problem in physics, you do not want to spend a whole day looking through all your fancy textbooks.The book is written for physicist only and they do it well. When they give an example, and they do that a lot, they choose from the problems you find in physics textbooks. E.g. the Angular Momentum operator is used to show how ladder operators works, giving Clebsch-Gordan coefficients (they remember Wigner 3j-symbols) and the Wigner-Eckart theorem at the same time. Young-tableau, Calculus of Variations (Lagrangians pop in naturaly here), Rayleigh-Ritz variational method, Greens Functions, Dirac-equation (how to handle it and use the Pauli and Dirac matrices ...), Commutators, Bra-ket notation, all the complex integration stuff (residues, ...). The functions of the trade (Legendre, Bessel, Hermite, Laguerre, ...) what they are, how to use them, their properties (exact and asymptotic behaviour), how to do the numerical evaluation, ...The most helpfull property of the book are the examples. From classical to quantum mechanics, chemistry (e.g. reflection symmetries of crystals) to coulomb exitation of nuclei. They are well choosen, e.g. the mathematics used for describing coulomb exitation in nuclei is very close to what is used to describe gravity fields, both are essentially particle motion in a potential field. Just because a problem is stated in one field of physics this does not play a major role in the example.The book can be used as a first textbook on mathematics, but not (in my opinion) for self study! It is too compact in its explanations for that. I do not think that it can replace a &quot;real&quot; textbook on mathematics i.e. with formal proofs to give understanding etc.But for a student in physics when you have to learn to APPLY the mathematics and as a reference book when you have a given problem it is VERY useful.There are a lot of problems WITH answers AND hints, again problems that are often found in physics textbooks.There are references at the end of each chapter to books about mathematics and physics, e.g. where to find a book that deals with the more detailed mathematical treatment of a given problem in physics or a more advanced study of the mathematics itself.There are drawbacks: nonlinear dynamics and fractal behaviour is all but absent. Wavelets are completely missing, a very sad thing since they are so useful in signal analysis. Statistics and how to calculate errors given a data sample is missing. How to handle those errors in further calculations is also missing.You have to limit the scope of the book somewhere but nonlinear dynamics is something you often find in articles and experiments and statistics is vital in understanding experimental results to say nothing of the expanding field of Random Matrix Theory.The index is sufficient but can be improved a lot to make the value as a reference work greater. It is the index and the lack of a section on statistics that makes me rate the book 8 and not 9."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"I am a graduate physics student with a strong mathematical background. This is the textbook used for our 2 semester course in mathematical methods for physics. The book is massive, both in content and physical weight. The cover is attractive and the printing seems to be fairly high quality. Now comes the difficult part of the review: finding other positive comments. First of all, I have only used a few chapters of the book thus far, so my comments pertain only to those. Some difficulties I have found... There are no answers to any exercises making the book fairly useless for self-study. The material is very uneven, as if each section was written by a different author (graduate student?). The explanations and examples are mediocre at best (contrast with the Mary Boas book). There are MANY typos - what ever happened to proof reading? The class INSTRUCTOR doesn't like the book, but is forced to use it by the department, and has regularly emailed the authors with corrections and recommendations. None of the students in the class like the book. You may be forced to use this book, but I would recommend other books as supplements (e.g., the book by Mary Boas and several in the Schaum Outline Series)."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"My instructor chose Arfken as the text for our Mathematical Physics class. He has a high opinion of the book, although he did not require it to be read and did not assign any of the exercises. Rather than using Arfken, most of the students in my class used various mathematics and physics books from the university library. My opinion of Arfken is that it is so condensed that it is not understandable to undergraduates. You need to consult other texts extensively to fill in the gaps. For example, Arfken develops tensor analysis on pages 126 thru 130, 5 pages total. My copy of Applications of Tensor Analysis by McConnell does the same on it's first 171 pages. I hesitate to say that Arfken is useless, but you can draw your own conclusion from my last example. Arfken is so abbreviated that it is not useful to the undergraduate as a reference either, in my opinion. Perhaps it is useful to persons who are familiar with the subject matter in advance, I am not sure. Were one or a group of people to flush this book out it might be more useful, but it would no doubt become many volumes."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"The lecturer of our undergraduate Mathematical Methods for Physics course said that he recommends Arfken's book because it will be useful also later as a reference book. Hearing those words, I could not help but to think &quot;this is one of *those* books&quot;. And indeed, although Arfken's and Weber's book covers quite a wide range of mathematics, it does so by being very concise, e.g. there is usually only one example per topic. This is one example of why it is not a good textbook. Not following Arfken's course, I will give another example: there are no answers and no solutions for any of the problems, making it very undesirable from the viewpoint of the person who cannot attend all the lectures. Finally, text itself is quite concise, and often it stops at telling the things rather than explaining them also. I guess I have to admit that I am not one of the excellent students mentioned by a reviewer, for I liked Kreyszig's Advanced Engineering Mathematics much more. As a contrast to Arfken's book, it offered many examples and helped to understand what the thing was all about. Unfortunately, it does not cover nearly all of the topics covered by Mathematical Methods for Physicists. If Mathematical Methods for Physicists is going to be your first introductory text to these topics and if you are not supported by very good lectures I can only say that may God have mercy on your soul."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"I invite the students on this page to take, or at least appreciate, a long-term view. Arfken pays off in the working world, with its comprehensive coverage of topics, short self-contained discussions which don't require a lot of flipping back and forth to other chapters, a clear writing style, and few proofs to get in the way.When I need to tackle a new problem which results in a coordinate system, function or technique that I'm rusty on, Arfken is usually the first book I pull off the shelf. Properties of Chebyshev polynomials for filter theory, or elliptic functions for the current density on a microstrip transmission line? Integral transforms? A comparison of Green's functions in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions for different electromagnetic diff eq's, all in one table? Group theory for certain phased-array antenna analyses? (really!) Tensors for analyzing flexure in superconducting magnet structures? Error functions for communications theory? It's all here in a quickly digestible form, with enough depth to solve a problem or at least prepare you to turn to a specialty text and quickly extract what's needed.I always learn something from the examples, which typically apply the same mathematical tool for my problem to some completely different area of physics.Arfken may not be an optimal text for a one-year course, but it's been my reliable working companion for 24 years. When my 2nd edition finally falls apart, I'll probably replace it with a new one."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"Arfken's book has become a classic in mathematical physics teaching, but I don't think it could be regarded as a good text for such purpose because its is not really a mathematical text. This book is just a collection of formulas, EASY examples, problems, and references, and as such it is quite good, but the indefense undergraduate needs more than that to tackle the subject.As a working mathematician I use the book mostly as a list of formulas. When I was a teacher I also found here a lot of interesting exercises to include in the exams.As a conclusion, I find the text good as a reference, but bad as a course text."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"I have been a physics professor now for nearly 18 years and this is one of the worst TEXTbooks I have seen. It is essentially a large reference book for those that already have mastery of the topics and is of very little use as a textbook.Basic pedagogical problems abound such as: 1) Topics in many chapter sections are dependent upon other sections perhaps many chapters ahead of the current topic... and those referenced sections are in turn dependent upon other chapter sections elsewhere in the text. This leaves one to wonder if the Authors had meaningful structure of the text in mind when they wrote it. 2) There are few useful examples for students. Most of the useful information is left to the student to work out as exercises without textbook guidance. 3) Section problems are unclear as to what the Authors are asking and since students are largely left to their own devices to discover crucial concepts, the text becomes largely irrelevant.This book is a reference NOT a textbook. Students will need to have other well written Textbooks on hand such as Mary Boas's \\"Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences to make sense of the material THEN go back to this book once they have mastered a topic to see if they can glean what the authors intend.In physics, there are \\"status symbol\\" textbooks that, unfortunately, departments adopt to try to impress others of their rigor, high level and expertise. These books do little, if anything, to help students learn and therefore are poor textbooks. This is one of those books."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"I have had the misfortune to teach from several editions of this pathetic textbook. The later printings of the 3d edition, by Arfken alone, were quite free of mistakes and of typos. But the early printings of the 5th edition by Arfken and Weber are loaded with typos and have some errors. Most of these typos are in equations that were correct in the 3d edition.My students have had a hard time learning from this book.Also, the binding of this $99 book is cheap cardboard -- the hardcover edition does not really have a hard cover. All in all,this is a typical Elsevier product: inferior and expensive."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"The best thing that can be said about this book is that it reads like some kind of encyclopedia of physics math ( and not a complete one at that). There is a lot here but the author is another one of those who believes the student is best served by working it out for himself. That may be true but it is also the easy way out for textbook writers and teachers. Also, the course should at least be set up so that the student can find out the correct answer. My experience is that the mathematical physics courses that use this book are not. At the time this book first came out there was no other suitable book. That, unfortunately, is how so many of the physics texts become classics, not by being useful or good. Also, the treatment is mostly of very classical mathematical physics. I pity the student who attempts to get a good background in group theory from this book for use in GR or particle theory. Better books exist nowadays partly as a reaction to this book. Find one you like and use it."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"With due apologies to the \\"practicing industry physicist,\\" who must think that students are just lazy muttonheads flip-flopping to class so they can flirt with adjacent babes, this book is truly quite poor. Oh, it certainly looks very boss on one's shelf, and those tastefully formatted integral equations bursting with funny symbols and Greek letters really turn the grandchildren's heads. But this book is utterly useless for teaching mathematics. It offers the worst of Jeffreys and Jeffreys--profoundly overdone conciseness, lack of anything resembling practical explanation, few if any examples--and none of the good features of that I'm-not-sure-why-it's-a-classic classic. You would do better to combine Kreyszig (good book but less comprehensive coverage) and Churchill & Brown (excellent coverage of complex variables and conformal mappings) with Lanczos (all sorts of great stuff found neither in Kreyszig nor in Arfken & Weber); then look into Collin on microwave circuits for a superb treatment of Green's functions and, if you're bold, Spain or Gurtin for something on tensors (though you really need a good TEACHER to learn THAT). Relegate Arfken & Weber to doorstop duty: it will perform admirably. I am witless to understand why its reputation is so, well, reputable. The book plain stinks as a TEACHING tool."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"Most physicists I know say that while this is not the best of textbooks, it's a great reference. I sometimes ask them to refer me to a useful section. They usually can't.This book is the standard in graduate math courses for physicists. It's a shame. We buy this book for the course and then either seek out other texts (or the internet) for elaboration, or more often, we trudge through all the math that Arfken leaves out. I've rarely used any math not found in this book, but also rarely has this book been useful enough to show me how to use the math. It's sort of like a dictionary. Everything is mentioned, but if you want to learn about something, you need to know a lot more than just a definition.Boaz's undergraduate math book is a good text for this subject. Unfortunately, it doesn't go in depth enough for all of a graduate course. For the same price as Arfken, I own about a dozen Dover editions, one for each of the important sections covered in a year long course.A topic that we thoroughly exhausted but is not taught too often these days is complex analysis and the calculus of residues. Residues were much more important for solving complicated integrals before computers became so commonplace. For this, I recommend \\"Complex Analysis\\" by Tristan Needham. It's a tome of all things complex, but if you have the time, or are just curious, it's a great book.If possible, get a list of alternative sources from you professor before you take the class requiring this book.

My intermediate Math Methods class used this book and I have not yet enountered a math problem in any of my grad classes that I couldn't use this book as an aide to solve. The book is clear yet concise, which allows for a large breadth of material to be covered in one semester effectively. Yes, some material is not covered with great depth, but I think that Mathematical Methods Books by design are not meant to be thourough, mathematically rigourous books but rather books that will present the method of solving, if not the exact solution, of most problems one might encounter in the physical sciences.I reccomend this book.

The book has sat on my shelf since that class, despite many people telling me it was a good reference text. I'm in my second year of grad school, and I have yet to find a need to turn back to this book. If I need to relearn math I have forgotten, I look at texts from the classes I learned it from or first really used it in. If I need to learn new math, Arfken is definitely NOT my go-to textbook (still looking for one, if you have recommendations). If I need to look up special functions, I will either google them (can't be lugging around a tome of this size EVERYWHERE I go). In short, I have not used this book for anything other than a doorstop.That said, the stint of research I did as an undergrad did not require me to crunch very many numbers, and I have yet to do anything major as a grad student.

However, since I had to special order it at the time, it has dutifully remained on my shelf through graduate school (where it was consulted on and off) and now into my professional career.It is, as many have pointed out, not really fit as a textbook.

This is why I recommend you to start learning this subject by reading several books simultaneously. Once you get the hang of it, I think you will prefer this book in the long run, since it tells you all you need to know with no fuss!The material covered is pretty much the standard that you will find in any other mathematical methods book: Tensors, Matrices, Groups, Series, Complex variables, Differential equations, Special functions, Integral transforms, Integral equations and Variational calculus, etc.The typeface and layout is smooth - there is an even amount of text and equations.

Pedagogically, it may not be the best book in the market, but it covers almost all subjects a physics student can ever encounter. Therefore, it is a complete, well-organized, and comprehensive book from that perspective.Each chapter contains problems at the end, which are quite useful. The level of difficulty of these problems varies but one can certainly gain a fair practice and knowledge of mathematical physics.If you are taking a \\"mathematical physics\\" course first time, many topics may not make sense, but as you move forward in your career, you will appreciate its significance and necessity.

For this it is totally useless. There are only few examples, and they are not very informative. Important theorems are sometimes only quickly mentioned, some are only implicitly suggested. And the exercises seem to expect a whole lot more mathematical knowledge than the text gives. Of course there are no answers to most of the exercises.Especially undergraduates (at least not the very brilliant ones like me) should really, REALLY get themselves some other book. Try related titles from Schaum's Outline series, for example.However, I've also used this book later on as a reference text when I've forgotten some concept that I had already learned earlier. For this purpose Arfken is ok. Usually you find the information you are looking for quickly and find a formula or two you can use.But all things considered it really isn't worth the money.

There is too much content to thoroughly review it all and, as many others have said, the value of this book depends greatly on how one uses it. I can say one thing for certain: this book does not deserve five stars.I bought this book for an introductory graduate level physics course. Our professor said there are no good books for the course but this one was the \\"least bad\\". I was initially impressed by the breadth of material covered in the text. I still am somewhat impressed, but I see now that there are major holes. For example, there is a section in the book on Hermitian and unitary matrices. The two kinds of matrices are defined in about a page, but the rest of the section (three pages) is devoted to a whirlwind tour of Pauli and Dirac matrices that would make all but the steeliest physicist's head spin. In fact, unless I'm sorely mistaken, it is never explicitly stated whether the Pauli and Dirac matrices are Hermitian or unitary. An astute reader can discover that for himself by inspection, but I would prefer the authors state it so that their discussion ties in with the section's heading.The following section is on the diagonalization of matrices. I was appalled to find *no* clear mathematical expression of diagonalization-- i.e., expressing a matrix as a product of a matrix of its eigenvectors, a diagonal matrix of its eigenvalues, and the inverse of the first matrix. Instead, they opt to cover examples such as the moment of inertia matrix, Hermitian and anti-Hermitian matrices, and matrix exponentials. The moment of inertia tensor is explicitly diagonalized, but this is only a special case. In two pages, I see *nothing* on the diagonalization of Hermitian matrices, which is a shame because it *could* be tied in very well with the section. Once again, an astute reader who already has a strong background in math and physics could probably put all the pieces together, but that should not be necessary. This spotty coverage renders some of the problems at the end of each chapter essentially impossible to do. I find myself often citing properties that should have been covered in the book but weren't.As I said, my two star rating has some caveats. First, we have only covered a few chapters so far, so it would not be fair to judge the entire book based on such a small sample (perhaps one of the authors is far better than the other). Second, despite what I've said, there is quite a bit of material in this book and at least some parts of some chapters are quite accessible and valuable. If you are a well-versed graduate student, post-doc, or professor, I can easily imagine this being a handy supplement to have on your bookshelf. As a struggling student, however, I cannot recommend this book, especially as part of a class.Final verdict: two stars, plus or minus two stars."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"This is a 1000 page supplement to other textbooks or courses, and works best when combined with an instructor that knows the material in depth. Personally, this book was a required text for an intro to theoretical physics class that I took a few years ago, and combined with the instructor's lectures that were partially supplemented by other authors (Boas), I learned quite a bit.Now I am in graduate school and I am still coming back to this book as a solid reference for bessel (and other special) functions, complex variables, etc. This book has many problems, a lot of them have solutions, and most of the time you can determine for yourself if you have the correct answer. I would say a great strength of this book is the difficulty of the problems. Sure, it will take some time to work through them to a solid solution, but in doing the problems in Arfken and Weber I've found I had more depth in understanding after finding solutions. Other textbooks will have loads of problems all with very little differences. You have to actually think to solve the problems contained within this book, which will sharpen your mind for quickly solving problems that you otherwise might not attempt. At least that has been my experience."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"We used this \\"textbook\\" for an undergraduate math physics course. I am in full agreement with the other reviewers in that this is really an encyclopedia. However not one thing in this textbook is explained in an understandable way. The material is so condensed that any attempt by the author to give any physical insight or background into something is completely futile. I am not stupid but there were parts of the book that I could not understand even if I stared at them for hours. I have never experienced that with any other undergraduate textbooks. This quarter I am using the Boas textbook and even though Boas does not give a mathematically rigorous presentation, it is many times more approachable and just over-all user-friendly. In fact reading Boas is like reading poetry compared to Arfken. Arfken is like trying to understand the meaning of a short story being given only the first letters of every word. The only reason this book gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because I can imagine using it as a reference book when I have my Ph.D doing research in theoretical physics."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"I had to use this book for a graduate level engineering math class. It may be the worst book I've had the displeasure of using. The chapters are very short and very light on details. There are no answers to the practice problems, which makes studying all but impossible, and even if there were, the chapters do not give nearly enough information to allow you to work the problems. Please math departments, find a better book!"},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"My feeling is that Arfken tries to cover too many topics in one volume, and ends up being shallow. That being said, the exercises are very good. I would describe it as boot camp to prepare for graduate study in theoretical physics or engineering. The only downside is to get some proper understanding, supplemental reading using other books is probably necessary. I found the section on tensors to be particularly weak. I do like the chapters on special functions. In the end I have to recommend the book as necessary for the aspiring physicist so that they can master the important mathematical topics they will need in their toolkit.Also recommended: Special Functions & Their Applications, by Lebedev"},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"I used this book in a Math Methods 1st year Graduate Physics course, and I dont think I really learned anything from it.It doesnt do well at TEACHING you anything, you'll have to buy another book with examples or find them somewhere, and that itself can be difficult.I found myself referring to Mary Boas' book for a few examples if I wanted to learn anything, but when you get to Group Theory you'll end up lost because the professor will run right over the material and textbooks on that subject arent that great.If i'm looking for an equation or a mathematical rule, this book is great.

This book has helped me solve many problems quickly that would have otherwise required much library time. The only negative, the last chapter on Chaos theory (new to the 4th ed.,12 pages long) is good introductory reading, but it is week in comparison to more advanced books, and does not provide enough info to be useful in solving problems."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"I am convinced that the author of this book has made the assumption that the reader has had pretty significant exposure to most of this already. Therefore, this is nothing more than a &quot;all in once place&quot; reference on math methods for physicists. The reason for the diverse range of opinions on this book is due to the various backgrounds of students. For most physic undergrads now taking a grad level math methods course, our exposure to differential eqns, complex functions, tensors, group theory, etc. is superficial. Here is a good entrepreneurial idea for an accomplished physicist that can relate to us mere mortals. For each page that Arfken has provided on a topic, ELABORATE (add 5 pages per page to it and now you have a useful textbook that every graduate student in physics should have). It would save us a fortune in buying the many additional supplemental texts required if you are stuck with Arfken."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"Looks like most negative comments were prompted by the fact that this book is advertized as a textbook, which it certainly isn't, at least not for Physics. On the other side people seem to be content wiht using it as reference, expecially in hi-tech engineering work whihc more often then not can't be sharp classified as on or the other classical academic discipline.I remember that Russians used to have separate math references for &quot;engineers&quot; and &quot;scientists&quot;, so maybe this book should be called &quot;Math Compendium for Hi-Tech Enginners&quot; and then people wouldn't be buying it for wrong reasons and then feel cheated."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"I bought the fifth edition because someone suggested it as the modern text.

Some books have much overhead notational and stylistic information which needs to be understood before a particular section can be profitably read. This puppy I find I can just open to a random page and start reading. This book does not give lots of explicit examples, but there are lots and lots of problems and they vary greatly in difficulty and often apply to multiple physical situations where the machinery in question finds application. I really like the problem sets and also the fact that there are explicit answers given after the problem as well as answers given explicitly in the statement of the problem. For those who crave explicit examples I think I would suggest several of the schaum's outline series as being a nice complement. There is not an explicit Schaum's on math methods but there are several on subsets of Arfken's book. I'd specifically mention those by Murray Spiegel."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"I write this review because I believe the other two reviews in the customer section give the wrong impression. The material in Arfken should be known by any beginning graduate student in physics. If however one is not familiar with all the topics, one should study an undergraduate textbook concerned with the area of deficiency (which ever is most popular for that subject). Arfken is then best used to jar the memory with examples that are often abridged examples from the aforementioned undergraduate texts. As for an undergraduate taking a course where Arfken is the primary text, I'm confused. Obviously you should know everything in Arfken but he doesn't get to the meat of any given subject. You might as well get cliff notes for physics.

Unfortunately, this work is becoming the classic text for such courses. The text is too concise to be useful for most students at this level. However, it may serve as a good reference book for those who have already learned the material. Good luck to those trying to learn it for the first time! The book is loaded with oversimplified examples of tough concepts and then leaves the difficult problems AS AN EXERCISE FOR THE READER. You will definitely need a supplemental text or two! Try Mathematical Physics by Eugene Butkov for a more thorough treatment of the concepts."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists can be seen as a reference on the mathematics that appear in physics. The style is brief and most topics are scattered throughout the book, which is designed to allow readers to catch up at any point. On the back-hand side this implies that the provided information will be brief and does not make use of the mathematics that should be explored, examples will follow.Chapter 3 Determinants and matrices fall short of the jordan canonical form, which is at the heart many areas in physics, such as dynamical systems. Also, due to the theoretical applications of this form, such as in proofs, the discussion of linear algebra remains very unsatisfactory at best. The next chapter is on Algebra, the discussion is mostly in terms of examples, that the book discusses differential forms, considering the prior technical discussion in chapter 4 can, and should, be questioned. An alternative, and good, reference for this topic is Peter Szekeres A Course in Modern Mathematical Physics.Chapters 5-8 are considerably better, although if new to calculus of residues the reader is advised to refer to eg. Sadri Hassani, Mathematical Physics.Chapter 9. Differential equations is very informal, mostly examples, and actually almost no theory is developed, and systems of differential equations remain untouched. The Frobenius method, although important, is only briefly discussed, which is hardly enough to anyone. All above also applies to PDE, almost no methods are developed. Fourier series and Fourier transforms are almost non-existing here (appear only later, in chapter 14.), although very important and should be appearing alongside the theory of PDE.Chapters 11-13 are devoted to special functions, and the approach of generating functions has been largely adopted. On the positive side this simplifies a lot, but again many will feel the discussion too brief and glossy.Chapters 14-16 are adequate, but again remain mostly apart from the theory of PDE, which is a clear downfall. Chapter 18. Nonlinear Methods and Chaos is in terms of examples and not much, if any, understanding can be gained. This theory relies much on differential geometry, linearisation and theory of ODE, which are not presented in this book, making the entire chapter more or less page filling.All in all, the book has more short-comings than strengths, and the linkage between the chapters, such as integral transformations and PDE, is unsatisfactory at best. As such the book fails as a good reference. Also, a large amount of important theory is missing."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"In my early days as a lecturer I did attempt to use Arfken but found it rather treacherous in that it wouldlead one into difficulties and strand one.

Yet modern physics calls for proficiency in an esoteric array of mathematical concepts which are both deep and broad, and which most American undergrads are poorly versed in. As a result, at the doorstep of grad school students are handed a gigantic lookup table of mathematical formulas, of which Arfken and Weber is just one of many, labeled as a \\"textbook\\" on mathematical physics, and are expected to learn the tools of the trade in one semester. The result is largely a waste of time and a fountain of frustration for the students. Arfken and Weber is especially guilty in the sense that it is a fairly widely adopted text. Unfortunately, it is largely an exercise in giving half-assed explanations on a very comprehensive collection of topics. It tries to cover many topics but does not cover any single one well. It tries to teach but in the end assumes that the student already knows the material and need not be taught. It is comprehensive but the whole turns out to be far less than the sum of its parts.If you are an undergrad and are theory-inclined, do not count on books like Arfken and Weber to gain mathematical prowess. As someone who has gone through the \\"pipeline,\\" I suggest the following as the mathematical must-haves: one semester of linear algebra and group theory; two semesters of real analysis, differential equations, and complex analysis. Make sure you take them from the math department. Once you have these under your belt, you should go on to study \\"A Course of Modern Analysis\\" by Whittaker and Watson at the earliest possible opportunity. (Or, at the very least, work through Copson's \\"Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable.\\")If you are an undergrad and are experiment-oriented, no worries. You are not expected to have a good handle on math, and Arfken and Weber suffices."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"Arfken and Weber is a wonderful reference text covering a large number of topics that are not too easy to understand at first glance. I think of it as kind of a 'bridge' between Abromowitz and Stegun on one side and Jackson on the other. Most purely physics books do not explain how the mathematics is developed, instead assuming that the reader already has some kind of familiarity with the subject in advance. On the other hand, most purely mathematics books are far too abstract to be of immediate use to the physicist. Arfken and Weber develop enough of the mathematics to give the reader the gist of how the arguments go, then present a number of good problems to practice the techniques.Many of the other reviews of this book are very low - especially from students attempting to learn the material for the first time, presumably without a good teacher. I will admit that this would be a very daunting task! However, the material is quite accessible once the student gets the hang of it. This book has been one of the most prized volumes on my shelves for the better part of 10 years. The sections on special functions are especially useful, and I really like the way that interesting and important functions permeate the book rather then being trapped in their own chapter. This gives the reader a sense of how all of the topics are interrelated rather than separate entities. I do understand how it would be very confusing to a student trying to learn the material for the first time, however. As a textbook, this book is best used with a teacher who directs students to specific problems associated with the material being covered in class so that the class can fill in the holes.The fourth edition does have a large number of typos - some in complicated equations where they can lead to problems for the unsuspecting student. I wonder if this is the source of some of the negative reviews.. I can only hope that the sixth edition contains less of these...All in all, a great reference that uncovers some of the 'secrets' associated with the formulas found in Abromowitz and Stegun. I find it fun to sit down with AMS-55 and try to derive some of the relations found therein after reading a section in Arfken and Weber. Maybe that's just me... If all you need is a formula book, pick up a paperback copy of AMS-55 and save yourself $60 or more. If you want to have a deep understanding of the mathematics behind it, take seven or eight graduate level courses from the mathematics department at a respectable university (good luck learning the ins and outs of the special functions...!). If you just want to see how the functions and techniques are used in practice and to explore some of their properties, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"This book is pretty encyclopedic, and is quite easy to look at, but please to not attempt to actually LEARN from this book. Some of the sections are good, but many are shamefully terrible, such as the treatment of complex variables or Green's functions. Overall, the book just seems sloppily thrown together. The quick-reference equations in the front and back, for instance, are conspicuously mis-indented and mis-aligned. Really a shame, because his book has a lot of potential.

Instead of discussing differential forms, lie groups, differentiable manifolds and things of theoretical interest, he spends hundreds of pages on all sorts of odd equations which you'll probably never run into during your lifetime except in a course on mathematical physics. Perhaps engineers might adopt a different view, since they tend to deal more with differential equations - I'm talking from the theoretical perspective. I would recommend Hassani's book instead of Arfken's for these matters. Make sure you check it out before you decide on buying Arfken's book!I will not deny it has its value as a reference, but even as such it also has its faults -many results are not demonstrated or even stated in the text, and are left as exercises for the reader. If this is supposed to be a reference, where are the results???Another problem this book has is that it lacks any sort of unifying theme, e.g., recasting mathematical physics using exterior calculus, or using vector spaces. Again, this might be a good thing when using it as a reference, but then again, I already mentioned it stinks as a reference as well. There are many books out there that summarize neatly the properties of all of the special functions you'll need in your lifetime."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"As a math reference, I give Mathematical Methods for Physicists by Arfken a five-star rating. It is a brilliant, comprehensive reference of most of the mathematical methods that a physics major might employ. However! As other reviewers here (the angry ones) have pointed out, this book is really for people who have already learned the math (pretty well) at some point in their lives. For that type of person, it is definitely a five-star book. The book works really well to refresh (tired, old) memories. You can open the book to any math topic and relearn the material without having to flip backwards to find associated pre-learning.As a textbook for first-time learners, I would have to give this book a three-star rating. When I learned this subject matter in college, we did not use a textbook; instead we used chalk-board lectures, with a few handouts created by the professor. I doubt if anyone could learn this material without an instructor. The book is often light on explanations and leaves out steps. Tragically, what is obvious to the author (and the old learner) is not (at all) obvious to the new learner. If this book were revised to completely accommodate the new learner, it would double in size.If you are taking a college course using this textbook, before class starts, ask your professor or former students for a list of additional references. Schaum's Outlines used to be of help to me. The Arfken book at least will give you an idea of the type of math you need to learn as a physicist. Therefore, at least leaf through the book and identify topics to study (with other references).If you are a professor, then assigning this book will at least communicate the course objectives to your students (i.e., they can look in the book and see what is expected of them after they learn the material). However, if you are a professor, you should put together your own lesson plans and handouts (or your very own e-book or iPad lecture notes).I do not know of a better textbook that also covers all of the subject matter that is in this book. If you know of such a book, please post your recommendation as a Comment.Lastly, a bit of advice: If you want to be a physics major, then take a double major in math."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods for Physicists Solutions Manual, 5th edition, Fifth Edition","review":"This text is a decent text for graduate level mathematical physics.

This book told me more about anime than any other book on the subject. Sure, there's a lot of stuff in here about erotic anime, but there's even more about the business as a whole. The authors include &quot;cut-scenes&quot; of material that was removed both here and in Japan during production of the originals, they go through the material that's been lost in translation (explaining why people often think that anime is trash, when they're just missing out on the background details), and there's an awesome chapter on journalism that every fan of anime should read and memorise. My favorite chapter of all is about archetypes in anime. If an anime has been written in a hurry (too true, too often), the scenarist will follow certain set patterns of &quot;ideal women&quot; to meet the requirements of marketing and authorship. The &quot;inside information&quot; on how anime are written and translated is worth its weight in gold. And there's no denying it, but the best-selling anime are the ones that the fans DON'T buy. They sell to the public at large, and this book tells you what they think. It should be part of every thinking anime fan's collection."},{"Title":"The Erotic Anime Movie Guide","review":"Anime fans frequently praise this book as an explanation of the sexuality in anime. This is a COMPLETE AND TOTAL misunderstanding of what this book is. In truth, this book is a work of apologetics against the \\"sex and tentacles\\" reputation that anime has in Great Britain-- the residence of the authors.The key to understanding this book is the chapter on the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) which must rate and evaluate every movie that is released in the UK. If the film contains content that is deemed too explicit, the film must either accept cuts or be banned from being shown in the UK. Anime, particularly the adult titles that came out in the early days of the anime explosion, tended to require frequent cuts (Johnathan Clements translated some anime titles for the UK, which the BBFC cut or banned. This may explain his venom in the chapters he wrote).All the other chapters center around the fact that anime has a bad reputation in the UK. This history (which gets some facts wrong) is meant to say to the British reader: The Japanese are not a nation of sexual perverts. The discussion of certain series (notably Urutsukidoji) are meant to inform the British reader what actually happened in the stories as opposed to the distorted rumors that were going around the country. The movie section gives a selection of titles (which is NOT intended by them to be exhaustive) meant to show the British reader that not all anime is porn.The book has problems. First, is their ludicrous attempt to explain away the fact that some anime sexualizes minors. They claim that these people wearing school uniforms are actually junior college students and all females that are sexual objects are adults. This is a statement that is irresponsibly false. If they knew it, it is a complete lie. if not, it reflects poorly on their knowledge of Japan. College students don't wear uniforms, and in Japan, up until 1999 (after the time the book was written) the age of consent in Nagoya and Tokyo was 13 and girls could get married at 16. Moreover, the concept of enjo kosai (compensated dating-- a sort of informal prostitution by high school girls) was a factor at the time of their writing, but it goes unmentioned by the authors-- a point that puts a big hole in their argument and hence omitted.The second major problem is this book was written by some angry people. In fairness, I would not care to live under the BBFC determining what I can watch. However, with anger, clarity and rationality suffers. The book seems vitrolic and frequently fails to come to a point. There are distortions (They imply that two episodes of \\"Crying Freeman\\" had so much censored by the BBFC, that the distributor had to put them together on one tape. In actuality, less than one minute was cut from both episodes combined. As a result, their credibility suffers. Also, they seem to operate under a belief that a high quality story that is sexually explicit ought not to be put in the same category as a sleazy porn story. So they classify anime as being mainstream, erotic or porn. The problem is this makes everything relative: Only stuff I *don't* like can be considered porn.So essentially, the book does not deliver as a rational discussion of erotic anime. It comes off looking more like a 191 page rant against the BBFC."},{"Title":"The Erotic Anime Movie Guide","review":"If you've tried a couple hentai anime films and liked what you saw, this book is a MUST-HAVE! Gives a great overview of the history of anime, all the different subgenres, and delves into the culture, industry, and marketplace that creates them.The chapter on the Overfiend series is terrific and provides great insights into the themes behind the series (including plot points that got mangled by western editing)."},{"Title":"The Erotic Anime Movie Guide","review":"While this book provides detailed coverage of much of the dark side of anime, it is marred by very lackluster writing and a dearth of illustration. The writers shift back and forth from a dry academic philosophizing which sometimes borders on apologising for Japanese tastes to an equally dry reporting of film contents. This should be a fascinating subject. The Japanese have focused considerable writing, illustrative and musical talent on sexually oriented anime, and this strange little book seems to want to downplay all of that. Hopefully someone else will be inspired to create the book this should have been."},{"Title":"The Erotic Anime Movie Guide","review":"This one's a bit of a mixed bag. Part of the problem is that the same author's later Anime Encyclopedia makes the latter half of it (a list of Erotic anime), completely redundant. However, the first half, comprising learned essays on anime topics, remain very intriguing. In particular, this book contains a fascinating study of the media's reaction to anime, and the first account of the shonen ai genre to go into any reasonable depth. Very important for anyone who takes anime seriously, but bear in mind that only part of the book is still relevant today."},{"Title":"The Erotic Anime Movie Guide","review":"This is an extremely in-depth look at the history of anime and the role of eroticism in shaping it. It also covers the views that have shaped how anime is perceived. It has a guide to individual movies which takes up about a third of the book, but only half of those are erotic films. A must for increasing your understanding of anime, but it is not really a film guide."},{"Title":"The Erotic Anime Movie Guide","review":"Covers quite a bit along the lines of erotic anime. The discussion is intelligent, with &quot;inside&quot; information, as the co-author himself translated a title or two. Unfortunately, it isn't very good for determining which are the _best_ titles, only those which are most significant. A slightly slanted view towards the brittish reader, but still a good read if you enjoy this topic, and may even provide good discussion fodder if you aren't a fan."},{"Title":"The Erotic Anime Movie Guide","review":"191 pages of a serious study of the anime's history in Japan and impact of ... anime in the western world. The book deals with its roots, how much of it is made in Japan (when compared to other categories), the many types (..., horror, ..., so on), the characters, anime games and even how translations, from Japanese to English, sometimes made a normal anime into a ... version that will increase its selling power in the English and American market BUT destroy the story line. It also deals with the media's reactions to anime and how marketing strategies make a cartoon worse than it started out with. For example, ... boys are more likely to buy a cartoon with a adult rating than one for family viewing. Also the book shows how most ... anime is bought up by mainstream video/DVD viewers NOT anime fans (who are more likely going to want the Japanese, and therefore pre-eroticized, version of the story).Contains adult material, so only for 18 years or older AND only for the serious reader."},{"Title":"The Erotic Anime Movie Guide","review":"I agree that this book is only a rant against the BBFC, which the author may have found justified to put in print, but I simply want to correct the correction to what Mr Wenat qualifies as \\"poor knowledge of Japan\\" on the part of the author which, again, may be true, but his correction isn't quite accurate either.As the Japanese school system is divided into primary school, junior high school, high school, and university levels and that, in fact, primary, junior high, and high school students DO ABSOLUTELY have to wear a uniform. I do not exactly recall if McCarthy used \\"junior college\\" or not in the text, but in some parts of the English-speaking world, as far as I remember, it refers to high school students. Japanese students enter high school at age 16 and graduate at 18. Whether the age of consent is 13 in Nagoya and Tokyo is irrelevent, because the universal age of majority in Japan is 20. Thus anything below that is underage sex.As for enjo kosai, this is not usually somehting present in anime (although I've seen some), but that is not a phenomenon only present amongst high school girl, but also amongst housewives, office ladies, university students and freeters, thus can be considered prostitution with all it implies. However, its ommission from the McCarthy text does put somewhat of a hole in their argumentation about school uniforms, but is not entirely relevent from the discussion either.As for all anime not being ero-anime cannot be effectively shown or understood through this guide, since the flow of nonero-anime to the west is still at a trickle. The number of OVA is decreasing because of late-night TV airings, and a simple search on Amazon.co.jp through DVD and video demonstrates this fairly quickly.The fact remains that the erotic undertones of anime are strong, but when one thinks about who they REALLY aim, which is mostly pre-teens, teens, and young adults (sex notwithstanding), anime simply attempts to capitalise on what boys want (big breasted characters and mecha) and the girls with idealised love stories, beautiful men and women characters, and cute stuff, something they yearn for and try to achieve themselves. But then, if anyone has recently seen a film from the United States without any erotic undertones, you are welcome to drop me a line.Besides, this book was written in 1999... This is getting aged."},{"Title":"Stand in the Wind","review":"I loved this book when I was a child. I recently reread it, and found that it hasn't lost any of its appeal.

Native Americans suffered in military, social, and bureaucratic maneuvering versus the European settlers and later the United States. In the 1970s, the strategy altered to seeking advantages as another special interest group. That approach benefited from poorly drafted laws, politicans' need for campaign funds, and a bad conscience among politicians to create unexpected and unequaled success for the formerly impoverished handful of Connecticut-based Mashantucket Pequots. The resulting gaming empire of Foxwoods (from the one-time name of &quot;Fox people&quot; for the Pequots) now wields far more power than the tribe ever had in its entire history.This story reveals a great deal about the nature of modern American politics and law that shows the need for broad reform at every level of government. The weakness of this book is that it takes on the Pequots almost as a special case, rather than as a more typical example of the system we have now. The book is also overly detailed for the interests of most readers, and does not make very entertaining reading except for those who are fascinated by legal and political intrigue from an academic perspective.The author revels in the irony of President Clinton courting the Pequots for funds and political support in 1994. Historically, it had been the other way around with U.S. presidents and tribal chiefs. In 1994, tribal chairman Richard &quot;Skip&quot; Haywood personally donated $500,000 to the Democrats for the congressional campaigns. After he and the president spoke by telephone, other members of the tribe donated an additional $800,000 to the Democrats that year. After the Republicans won the election, a further almost $200,000 went to the Republicans. But this is just what any other special interest or business does all of the time. The wealth of Foxwoods made it possible for the Pequots to have a large seat at the negotiating table.Casinos were bound to come someday to New England. Legalizing gaming has been sweeping the country, often led to state lotteries. Cash-strapped state and local governments are always looking for new sources of funds. So the fact that these casinos ended up being owned by Native-American tribes is probably the only surprise to most people.If you are like me, you have read some of the details of how this happened, but have never seen it all woven together. I was very impressed by the legal innovation of attorney Tom Tureen and the entrepreneurship of ex-chairman Haywood. The work of either one could be the subject of an interesting leadership case history.The full vision of ex-chairman Haywood is mind-boggling. He worked on bringing a professional football team into the tribe, building a theme park, and tried to establish a bullet train to the casino among other ventures.I hope someone will also write a business-oriented history of the same events to add more of that dimension to this story.The lesson of this book is that you can achieve great things by setting very ambitious goals. Are you goals too puny? Why don't you increase them? How much more could you accomplish as a result?May the odds always be in your favor!"},{"Title":"Revenge of the Pequots: How a Small Native American Tribe Created the World's Most Profitable Casino","review":"This is the book I wish I had written -- but I never would have spent the time and effort on research that the writer did. As a Ledyard-based reporter in the early 1970s, I knew about that part of town referred to as the Indian Reservation, and I'd heard of the only old lady who lived there in a trailer, and her occasional grandchildren. Trouble is, in four years I never had the slightest inclination to write about her or the land or the story behind either. Nonetheless, as the casino developed, I was pleased that someone was beating city hall. In painstaking detail the author tells how it happened, including a good bit of history. It's a serious book, not just a compilation of gossip. An interesting part of Americana. But as Ledyard today tries to deal with all the traffic and tourists, I can't help but remember the hundreds of meetings I sat through where the town fathers agonized over how to attract visitors and to expand the town's economic base. The leader of the Historical Society was sure that restoring the vertical saw mill would do draw crowds. He never could have imagined that the answer could have been found in that trailer on that reservation at the far end of town!"},{"Title":"Revenge of the Pequots: How a Small Native American Tribe Created the World's Most Profitable Casino","review":"As one who has been in the center of this matter for more than 20 years, I was delighted with this book. The author is historically accurate and captivating at the same time, and the book holds interest throughout. His early American history of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe is instructive as to not only what happened to that New England Tribe but what happened to most tribes. The excellent description of the land claims suits by the tribes in Maine, which was the model for the Pequot suit, is mesmerizing. The Tribe overcomes the attacks from the State led by Governor Lowell Weicker as well as Las Vegas interests who were desperately trying to prevent Native American competition to their monopoly.Through an incredible concurrence of events, brilliant strategizing, and perhaps a lot of luck by the modern leader of the Pequots, the Tribeit rose from poverty to the owner of the largest and most profitable casino in the world. The litigation and political battles with the State of Connecticut moved the Tribal leaders from Governor Weicker's principle foe to his and the State's ally.I do take strong issue with the author's portrayal of current developments within the Tribe. Perhaps it is most difficult to judge history while it is taking place as opposed to waiting a few years.I would recommend this book to anyone and unlike a previous book that was published on this subject, this book is written honestly and accurately and by an author who obviously did his research and had no need to fictionalize the account."},{"Title":"Revenge of the Pequots: How a Small Native American Tribe Created the World's Most Profitable Casino","review":"As the two-star authors wrote, this book has very little substance. It's a soft, air brushed account of the tribe and frankly not very engaging. Eisler is a poor writer. While he is clearly literate, he does not write in a compelling way nor does the story necessary hang together. It seems without focus and depth and that he just cut various facts and excerpts from other publications and glued them together to form this book. His writing lacks passion, intellectual rigor, and compelling narrative. This book is adequate, but I am giving it one star rating for paying $10 for what is essentially puffery. This book is probably worth pennies from a dime store. I would not recommend this book for an indepth understanding of the Pequots. Frankly, I want my money back."},{"Title":"Revenge of the Pequots: How a Small Native American Tribe Created the World's Most Profitable Casino","review":"I always wondered how Foxwoods came to be. Now I know thanks to this witty and ironic account, which the Boston Globe says is far more accurate and attentive to the facts than the other book on the topic. Also contains a lot of good insight into gambling, why people gamble, and unlike a lot of non fiction, it doesnt bog you down. Great book!"},{"Title":"Revenge of the Pequots: How a Small Native American Tribe Created the World's Most Profitable Casino","review":"After reading the terriffic &quot;Without Reservation&quot;, I egarly anticipated getting another detailed view of how this &quot;tribe&quot; became what it is today. Unfortunately, I got a &quot;soft&quot; account of what happened in this author's view and IMO completely whitewashed the story behind the story: how government at all levels engaged in dereliction of duty and gross negligence in allowing this group to gain the recognition and power it has secured.While the author does an OK good job of linking many of the favorable aspects of the court rulings to the &quot;tribes&quot; generous gifts to the DNC and Bill Clinton, he fails to delve into the corruption and naivite of the State and Federal governments and how this was a direct driver of the final outcome.In fact, the author whitewashes a fundamental aspect of this &quot;sovergn nation&quot;- whether they acutally qualify as an Indian tribe according to clear Federal criteria on the subject.If you want a &quot;soft&quot; and relatively &quot;warm&quot; view on the birth of the Foxwoods windfall, one that is short on details and long on political-correctness, you might enjoy this read. If you want a much more compelling and believable account of this situation, I suggest you read Mr. Benedict's &quot;Without Reservation&quot;. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Revenge of the Pequots: How a Small Native American Tribe Created the World's Most Profitable Casino","review":"This book relies entirely too much on clips from previously published sources.

Too bad."},{"Title":"Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 9: Skin Deep","review":"The four-part \\"Skin Deep\\" storyline in \\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\" is a tale that bring's Peter Parker's past together with Spider-Man's present. Collected in Volume 8 of these trade paperback reprints, the story is written by J. Michael Straczynski with pencils by Mike Deodato, inked by Joe Pimentel and colored by Matt Milla, the flashback sequences are penciled by Mark Brooks, inked by Jamie Mendoza, and colored by Brian Reber. The contrast between the past and present might be too much, but you have to admit that you can tell them apart as you go along.The story begins with Peter late for school and substituting for another teacher and dealing with an unruly student. That he looks out the window and sees Charlie Weiderman. Sudden we are back to when Peter was in high school and Charlie became the new kid in class. You see, \\"The unwritten law of the classroom is that the school geek only gets a break when and if an even bigger geek moves into the neighborhood.\\" You guessed it: Charlie is that geek, and when Peter finds he is no longer low man on the school totem pole, he makes sure he has nothing to do with the new kid. Peter was ashamed of what he did that day, so when Charlie shows up to ask a favor he is more than willing to listen.Charlie wants to get a big military contract for coming up with a new type of body armor. It would have to be from some kind of porous polymer compound that could cover every part of a soldier but still let oxygen breath through. That last part is what is stumping Charlie, along with something to absorb the energy of the incoming bullets. Charlie thinks the answer could be vibranium, the expensive natural material found only in the kingdom of Wakanda, soif he uses Peter's name as a reference when he goes to an interview with Tony Stark. Peter agrees and Charlie thanks him, saying that he has always been a friend. But when Peter remembers high school he knows that he was anything but a friend to Charlie.Stark gives Charlie a check, rounded off to the nearest hundred thousand, basically because Peter wrote a letter of recommendation. Peter shows up to help with the experiment but discovers Charlie is taking a dangerous shortcut, and if you do not know what is going to happen then you simply have not read most of the previous 514 issues of \\"The Amazing Spider-Man.\\" Peter walks away from the experiment and once again we have a new supervillain for Spider-Man created by an explosion tampering with science. Peter tried to help, but no good deed goes unpunished in his world and Charlie still wants Peter's help, or else he is going to kill him and everyone around him.Stracynski maintains the present and past threads of the story line throughout the four parts of \\"Skin Deep,\\" and while I am not sure what I think about going back and rewriting that part of Peter Parker's past, it certainly makes sense to be reminded of the geek that was left behind when the radioactive spider bit him. This is not a great storyline, but it is solid enough and after \\"Sins Past\\" (Volume 8) it is certainly a breath of fresh air. Besides, \\"Skin Deep\\" ends with a major change in the life of the Parkers and anything that sets up Aunt May taking on Wolverine is a good thing in my book."},{"Title":"Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 9: Skin Deep","review":"This Spidey story was not one of the worst things that I have ever read. I guess the artist Deodato saved this story with his artwork.There was an attempt to delve a little deeper into Spidey, sort of fleshing out his character, that sort-of-thing. In addition, Peter's relationship with Mary Jane and his Aunt May are also explored. THe problem is the shallowness of this exploration. A pity as Mary Jane is a potentially interesting character with the babelicious factor. Tony Stark is depicted as the all-knowing, all-caring paternalistic do-gooder with deep pockets. The relationship between Aunt May and Jarvis was developed too fast and the other Avengers have the usual walk-on roles.The villain is just forgettable, Charlie whatever, and the constant flashbacks between the present and the past is irritating. How he can get Tony Stark to give him research funds just by name-dropping Spidey's name is ridiculous. Doesn't Tony Stark do background checks etc? Hence the general shallowness of this book."},{"Title":"Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 9: Skin Deep","review":"This, like all of JMS' Spider-Man stories since \\"Sins Past\\" has been disapointing. It is not completely unreadable, and I continue to enjoy Mike Deodanto's art since he came back onto the scene, but compared to the the the great Spidey tales out there, this one is very missable. If you're new to Spider-Man check out Essential Marvel Team Up to see some great Spidey, or the first few trades of the current run with JMS and Romita Jr. they're a lot better than this one focusing on some minor character from Parker's past (who I don't beleive we, the reader, have ever met before). It starts out interesting exploring what could've happened if Peter wasn't so responsible, but quickly turns into cliched hero vs. villain fare."},{"Title":"Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 9: Skin Deep","review":"While not nearly as bad as the previous arc, SINS PAST, the story in SKIN DEEP is still very poor. It focuses on some obscure character who hasn't existed in prior to this arc. Yet, this new character who has never been mentioned all of a sudden shows up and goes on a personal vendetta, and the target is Peter Parker. The villain in this arc seems like a bad rip-off of Molten Man, an older villain who dates back to the Ditko issues of Amazing Spider-Man. Overall, the story is dull, unimaginative, and predictable. The only reason you might want to pick this up is so you know why Peter, MJ, and May move into a new residence right after this story..."},{"Title":"Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 9: Skin Deep","review":"From the very beginning, you could predict the story along with the cliche flashback of Peter reminicing on his teen years as the bullied geek. This time a fellow geek is introduced. You feel sorry for him, but you realize early he is another cross that Peter willingly bares. I gotta say I really love the artwork over John Romita's work. I was kinda getting annoyed with the occasional, out-of-place anorexically skinny people (including Spidey!).Artwork is an upgrade while the plot was downgraded. After the last issues being so powerful I guess you're due for a \\"relaxing\\" issue. This issue didn't move me in any way except for the improved artwork."},{"Title":"Shaman, M.D.: A Plastic Surgeon's Remarkable Journey into the World of Shapeshifting","review":"Shaman MD is a compelling story of a journey into one of the last refuges of human and planetary mystery. This is a journey not for the weak of heart. The risks can be life changing, or life threatening. Hiking along the high jungle deep into the Amazon forests of Ecuador with Jaguar, Anaconda, and hundreds of species of poisonous snake hidden from sight, is not always something many in our domesticated culture would care to risk. Or high in the Andes entering into poisonous fume producing caves seeking knowledge and power.Bruce's story unfolds as autobiography on the plains of Africa where she grew up in a family not afraid to march to its own beat by abandoning the comforts of western culture. With great courage, Bruce, tells her own story as a fifteen year old girl getting pregnant and choosing to keep her baby. The astonishing story unfolds in her return to America by entering college and then medical school followed by completing a surgical residency no other women had achieved to that point.The story eventually takes her into the world of indigenous healing and cross cultural norms on many different continents working with elders, shamans, sangomas, and sages. The story underscores the personal transformation she finds in these simple and honest communities still honoring our Earth Mother and those who remain conversant with her language.As someone who has walked this same path, I can only attest to its power to transform lives. The question, of course, can you let go of your cultural inhibitions, to enter into another way of knowing?This is a great book, by a modern visionary.

These and other studies such as the Columbia Miracle study in which it was reported that women prayed for from thousands of miles away by strangers were more likely to become pregnant than those who weren't are studies that have turned out to be a fraud.Although the book is interesting when Bruce talks about her family and her reasons for studying shamanism, her details and descriptions of the visions are just too freaky.I also don't buy what she says about a person being able to genuinely change from without before changing from within. I think this claim is only used to justify her career."},{"Title":"Forgiven: One Man's Journey from Self-Glorification to Sanctification","review":"Russo starts off the book talking about how he is now a minister and a born again christian. Most of the book is written by a bitter Vince in 2002, with chunks added by the re-born author. The \\"new\\" Vince starts off by saying that this book HAD it all for a wrestling fan. All the dirt, all the behind the scenes stuff, all the stuff that fans who will actually pay 25 bucks for a wrestling autobiography will want to hear! But \\"new\\" Vince then adds that it's not the christian thing to do, and that he has excised all of that stuff out. Great... What did I just buy?The narrative is quite entertaining, but everytime \\"new\\" Vince interjects you really just want to puke. All he does is say how horrible a person he was and glory be to jesus, he is the light, glory be... glory be! I have no idea how a person can go a complete 180 and be legit. He WAS cocky, arrogant and had a real Howard Stern sense of humor, and now is a bland, neutered, bible thumping bore-fest.The book is ok, but the tease that all of the \\"good stuff\\" was removed and the pages of \\"new\\" Vince really leave a bad taste. Also the book ends very abrubtly at the end of his WWF tenure, and has no WCW or TNA content.Alot of people either love Russo or hate what he did. I'm a hater, I really don't like the Springer like phase of pro wrestling he's responsible for, but I was legit looking forward to hearing his side. Unfortunately, due to the author's self-censorship I was really disapointed."},{"Title":"Forgiven: One Man's Journey from Self-Glorification to Sanctification","review":"Vince Russo throws his name into the ever growing wrestling biography books. Russo claims to have written this book and then went through and commented on it after he 'found Jesus Christ'. This is alright to begin with but all his \\"New Saved Vince\\" comments quickly get annoying and pretty much says the same thing over and over again. Russo puts himself on quite the pedestal claiming to have been the sole force of WWF writing and idea man through out the late 90s.Russo begins by telling us this is going to be THE tell all book, he'll name names, reveal dirty little secrets, hold nothing back, and hurt some feelings. He does none of this. He also tells us he's not going to fill the book with \\"trite details\\" of his life then spends the first 150 pages doing just that. According to Russo, he was pretty much McMahon's sole defender in 'wrestling journalism/broadcasting (radio)' during the steroid scandal, even though he was only a co-host on a small, small time radio show that aired once a week (with the guy who lead the 'smear campaign'). He constantly insults Jim Ross, \\"The Man from Bland\\" (his words) and makes a lightly veiled comparison of how could TBS continually put Hubie Brown \\"the ugliest announcer ever\\" on the air when his appearance alone will make you not watch the basketball game.Among his more suspicious claims are that he has \\"deep respect\\" for everyone but the only non-main eventer he mentions is D-Lo Brown. He also managed to see that all the megastars were going to be megastars prior to them doing so (conveniently his stories made them so, he hints at). And finally pretty much everything in WWF in the late 90s was his idea including: Rocky Johnson refering to himself in third person and call himself The Rock, DX, reinstating the womens title to push Sable into the limelight, putting previously unheard of Stephanie McMahon on tv for the Undertaker kidnapping story, Wanting to put Mick Foley into Wrestlemanias, Triple H being called The Game, Chyna being called the 9th Wonder of the World, Owen Hart's Memorial show, and you guessed it - Russo also lays claim that the Bret Hart-Shawn Michaels screw job in Montreal was all HIS idea.He speaks about how he wrote all the stories not only for the main eventers, but the opening and mid-card guys so he was putting in over 80 hours a week. Guess that explains things like The Gang Wars (DOA, NOD, Los Borriquas), Mark Henry, Tiger Ali Singh, the 24/7 hardcore title, Beaver Cleavage, and the likes.Based on this book, the WWF was saved by Russo alone and the only reason Austin, Rock, Triple H, Foley, Sable, Chyna, and others were megastars was all because of him. He names no names with \\"dirty little secrets\\", reveals no dirty laundry, and is generally rather egotistical and juvenile. It's great he has found the Lord but I wonder if he claims this because so many other wrestlers have done so and published books (such as Sting and Shawn Michaels). Also while claiming others have to be careful of what they write because WWE is publishing there books, Russo doesn't have to do this because WWE is not behind his book, he then continually kisses Vince McMahon's ass through out the book. It's lacking but readable."},{"Title":"Forgiven: One Man's Journey from Self-Glorification to Sanctification","review":"I was interested to hear Vince Russo's side of the stories that abound in wrestling. He was at the centre of a lot of the big events for the last 15 years and hoped to get his version of events.What I got was a watered down version of his pre-WCW days with him giving space to his thoughts today, now that he has found God.I have no problem with his religion except that his new belief meant that tha book was weak and feeble. Barely could read it as it came across as too preachy for my taste."},{"Title":"Forgiven: One Man's Journey from Self-Glorification to Sanctification","review":"This is the first of two bios that Vince has written. It gets a little too \\"preachy\\" at times as he is a born again christian, but he makes some solid points about the death of WCW, and his involvement with WWE. I read this after his second book \\"Rope opera-how WCW killed Vince Russo\\" and was surprised at some of the revelations he made. (Im not giving them away here, buy the book like I did!)If you can get through the efforts to save your soul (As I do believe Vince is sincere in his efforts, just really preachy!) you can find a really good read. Vince has had a rough time adjusting to the \\"Real world\\" as most guys in the business do. He discusses a lot of those difficulties.All in all, a good read."},{"Title":"Forgiven: One Man's Journey from Self-Glorification to Sanctification","review":"Vince Russo's Forgiven is a fairly good read with his versions of his time in the WWF. The book does not cover his time in WCW or TNA and that is the book I would like to read. In this book he states several times how he was a changed man and would never go back to wrestling. Well shirtly after the book was released guess who went back to writing for TNA after his christian themed wrestling promotion crashed and burned after one show."},{"Title":"Forgiven: One Man's Journey from Self-Glorification to Sanctification","review":"Let me begin by stating that religion plays a huge role in this book. Vince Russo published his original manuscript from 2002 before he became a Christian, however he often interupts the manuscript to include his views on how he has changed from that point due to his religious beliefs. If you are a Christian or even interested in this, I would suggest reading the entire book. If you are simply reading for the wrestling information there is plenty available, but you'll need to skim over quite a bit from time to time.As for the wrestling information it was quite interesting as Russo documents his long journey to get into the WWE and then work his way up to becoming head writer. He talks in depth about his relationship with Vince McMahon as well as WWE Superstars Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, and Sable among others. Russo discusses many of the ideas and happenings in wrestling from the mid-90's to the \\"Attitude Era\\" boom of the late 90's. Some of his topics include the Montreal Screw Job of Survivor Series '97, the creation of D-Generation X, and the tragic death of Owen Hart.The original manuscript is somewhat confusing to read as Russo has a tendency to jump around and get off topic, I often found myself skipping entire sections as he would go off on a tangent about Jerry Springer, the San Francisco Giants, or Leah Remini. However the wresting history is really interesting to read as Russo takes his fair share of the credit of WWE's success but in a realistic manner. If you are a an of the WWE and especially if you were a fan in the 90's (era of Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, Undertaker, Stone Cold, The Rock...) I would strongly suggest picking this book up and giving it a read."},{"Title":"Forgiven: One Man's Journey from Self-Glorification to Sanctification","review":"This is an interesting bio unlike any other wrestling biography. If you're interested in WWF through the 90's this is a must read."},{"Title":"Forgiven: One Man's Journey from Self-Glorification to Sanctification","review":"I wasn't expecting to enjoy this one, but I was pleasantly surprised.

This book has truly enriched my life and others I have shared it with.Don't miss the opportunity to invest in your deliveance, and HEALING ."},{"Title":"Miscarriages, Abortions & Stillborn Babies (In The House of God)","review":"I was very impressed with her book for many different reasons. Lorna addresses some very real issues that arise in the church. Pregnancy and abortions are a underground tunnel that seems to have no end. Even though she comes from a natural metaphor there are some very serious spiritual implications. I myself have aborted some spiritual babies myself and felt very dead inside. I had no one to tell me how to handle my baby or even nurture it. God has sent forth much healing through this book, and I also believe that there will be many more healings that will take place around the world. From a prophetic perspective Mrs. Wren has foreseen a coming of the next move of God in the Apostolic and Prophetic. It is imperative to be free from such horrific issues of the past and to face them upfront because if we don't face them the devil will expose them for us ( in this next move ). I'm very proud of this writing and I pray that she will come with the sequel very soon. It is very easy to read and heartfelt, I like her realness. I'm of the persuasion that God can't use anybody who refuses to be real and share with the hurting that We've been hurting to you're not alone. Even though this book would appear to be for women, I charge and urge every man that has a relationship with God to allow this book to minister to them. It will also teach us the importance of pushing our spouses into purpose and support them in what God has called them to do and not be jealous of them. I'm a man and this book touched the very core of my spirit and my being. If you haven't lost,aborted, or miscarried any natural children check out the spiritual one's. According to Mrs. Wren we're going to have to answer to God either way. I applaud her.Thank you"},{"Title":"Miscarriages, Abortions & Stillborn Babies (In The House of God)","review":"This book is a must read.

Her writing is one of a kind, and she always captures the heart with her words. If you want to read another book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing.

But they were all entertaining. There's a nice mix of historical and contemporary romance."},{"Title":"Gift Bks Gift of Love h/B","review":"I normally don't care for anthologies, for two principal reasons. First, many stories in these anthologies suffer from being over-short; the usual 70 - 100 pages is simply not sufficient to develop the storyline in a sufficiently satisfying manner. Second, there is always at least one story in each collection which is disappointing and lets the others down.However, I saw this book in, of all places, a bookshop in Manchester (yes, in the UK). An import, at a very reasonable price, so I decided to give it a try. And I'm delighted I did, having had several days of very satisfying reading from five authors, none of whose work I had read before.These stories all have a strong Christmas theme, which is done properly, in sharp contract to many Christmas-themed books these days in which the festive season gets perhaps a couple of lines at the end with no other mentions anywhere in the book. Each story in this anthology *feels* Christmassy, in different ways. And yet each story is very different. There are two contemporary romances in US settings, two British historical romances (in the Victorian period, though again each very different), and one time-travel, again set in the US.We have a modern career woman reunited with the childhood hero who devastated her years ago by a careless act; a still-grieving widow who discovers that the boss of whom she thoroughly disapproves has an incredibly romantic heart; a poverty-stricken young woman finds out how it feels to play the role of angel to a lonely widower and his son; a young Victorian choolmistress enters into an arranged marriage with a reclusive Earl so that his orphaned niece will have a governess, and quickly finds a way to melt his frozen heart; and a 1990s woman is transported back to Pioneer country, finding herself married to the man of her dreams.I loved each and every one of these short stories. None - well, except perhaps the last, which ended a little abruptly - seemed over-short or insufficiently well developed. And each had its share of humour, angst, romance and heartwarming seasonal cheer.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Gift Bks Gift of Love h/B","review":"I enjoyed this book so much I had to buy it.

But,the other stories are additional benefits and gifts for the readers. Heartwarming stories from these five leading ladies. Judith McNaught's and Kimberly Cates' stories make me cried with its own twist of heartwrenching emotions. Andrea Kane and Jude Deveraux excelled in delivering quick,witty romance stories that surely make readers laughed along as the plot progressed.

Readers who have joyed in the writings of such authors as May Sarton, Terry Tempest Williams, Annie Dillard, to name but a few, will find &quot;Weeding At Dawn&quot; another source for inspiration and delight. Madrone's memoir is richly detailed, deftly turned with just the right metaphors and images; the content is sometimes serious, sometimes humorous, sometimes sensual. It is an evocative portrayal of lesbian country life as well as an invitation to all readers to the meditative richness of rural solitude. Frankly, Thoreau's writings, while certainly full of words to ponder, pales in comparison to this memoir's life in the Oregon woods. I guarantee readers will love the pleasure of Madrone's company not once but many times."},{"Title":"A treatise on the preparation and delivery of sermons","review":"This book was the classic text for homiletic in the nineteenth century. It is interesting as a study of what preachers were being taught about preaching back then, and one can glean nuggets of wisdom, but otherwise it's a rather ponderous read. The author has a section on rhetoric that is especially helpful, even for modern preachers, who could learn a thing about the basics of communication from it. Given the almost absolute dearth of books out there that actually talk about how to actually write and preach an good sermon, this is still not a bad choice for the preacher who wants to improve at his craft."},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the","review":"Mrs. Keckley presents her life as well as those around her duringthe era of slavery and post slavery.

The introduction took longer to get through than the book did! I thought it was amazing how the introduction discussed that many people really dismissed Keckley's account of what happened during the Lincoln years. I found her insights very interesting and personal, but I have to wonder about Keckley herself. If she was that close to Mary Lincoln (Keckley reports that she was the ONLY person Mary would see following the assassination of the president), why have I not heard of her before? She offers a fascinating insight into the sale of Mary Lincoln's personal wardrobe (which is so commonplace today that it barely registers), and how vilified she was in the press for even attempting such a thing. If you're interested in the Lincolns at all, or on the slave experience (albiet a really unusual slave experience), I would recommend Keckley's book."},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the","review":"This Babblebooks MP3 Audio CD, read by Anais 9000, (purchased from Amazon) is a total disappointment.

For example, despite the book's basic authenticity I find its account of Stephen Douglas's love for young Mary Todd and her jilting of Lincoln implausible despite Keckley's claim that she got the story directly from Mary Todd Lincoln and Anson Henry (a close friend of Abraham and Mary, who was a matchmaker encouraging their romance). Possibly some errors might be attributed to one or more literary assistants who helped compile the book. If a reader needs to be certain a about a particular statement, comparison with other sources is wise. Still, the volume will be valuable to anyone interested in firsthand impressions of the Lincoln White House."},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the","review":"I very much enjoyed this book.

It is a memoir of sorts of Elizabeth Keckley, who was Mary Todd Lincoln's modiste (dressmaker), friend, and confidant. Chiaverini's book closely follows Behind the Scenes, so there was not much that I gleaned from reading it. The interesting part, though, were the letters of Mrs. Lincoln's at the end. It was interesting to understand Lincoln's thoughts in her own words and see just how distraught and sad she was after her husband's assassination.

I found the description of the legal process for the emancipation of a slave and life in the whitehouse interesting. The sophistication of the writing style and the lack of any reference to Keckly's education leads me to suspect that it was put together by a ghost writer. That's OK but the historical coverage, while occasionally interesting, was very limited.

Mention is made of the use of a &#34;ghost writer&#34; it seems likely that the author's use of one is more likely to have been as a advisor rather than our modern understanding of ghost writing. I've read other books of the era and the way language is used appears approriate for the era. Although the phrasing may seem out-dated to a modern reader, it is very understandable.

Yet, the children of her former master search her out and reunite with her after the Civil War because they loved her so dearly. Truly one of the hman paradoxes of enslavement.Her accounts of the Lincoln household, as Mrs. Lincoln's seamstress, enhance and expand the movie &#34;Lincoln.&#34; Her courage reminds me of the poem &#34;Still I Rise&#34; by May Angelou."},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the","review":"This woman, Elizabeth Keckley, had real guts. Born into slavery, she keeps a surprisingly upbeat outlook on life. After many years she is able to buy freedom for herself and her son. There are hardships galore, but this woman never feels sorry for herself. Here she tells stories about her life. She is very articulate for a former slave - or for that matter, anyone of a lower rank without the benefit of formal education. She was older when she wrote her story, and I had to wonder if some of it was embellished favorably as old memories sometimes are.This was a real woman. She was a seamstress for and a confidante of Mary Todd Lincoln. Ms. Keckley gives a more favorable portrayal of Mrs. Lincoln than I've ever read before in any book. The book is a captivating story of strength. Black or white, rich or poor - everyone should be as strong and upstanding as this woman. I was impressed by her fortitude and no nonsense approach to life. Lazy was not in her vocabulary. If I could travel back in time, this is one woman I'd like to meet. Her story is what America is all about - coming from nothing and making something of yourself.

I was fascinated by her story as it unfolded. I was also caught off guard by the diction and the syntax of her written words. Given the times when slaves were not permitted to read and write, her ability to address the issues was most impressive. I was further impressed by her actions and verve. This book is a great tribute to her entrepreneurial spirit and her tireless efforts to be free and independent.While enslaved, she stood her ground when her master attempted to beat her. She repeatedly remarked, \\"no man will hit me unless he proves the stronger\\"! After many attempts to thwart her offenders, she was overpowered and succumbed to being sexually and physically abused. These whippings were done to subordinate her \\"attitude\\". It did not work for she continued to speak against slavery and its abuses.Her early life as the offspring of a white father and a black slave brought her in daily contact with the sordid life of slavery as she witnessed blacks being auctioned and families being sold and separated. She gave birth to an unwanted son and lived as a concubine. These conditions strengthened her resolve to gain her freedom. Undeterred, she worked hard and earned enough money to secure her freedom and continued to speak out against slavery.After many ventures as a seamstress and dress-maker, she was sought after by Mary Todd Lincoln, wife of President Lincoln, and became her close friend and confidant through the remainder of her life. She was there when President Lincoln's son Willie died; when President Lincoln was assassinated; when Senator Jefferson Davis' wife ordered a dress. As an eye-witness to history, this ex-slave wrote a compelling book filled with a treasure trove of information of tragedies and tormented times gone by. Her words flow like poetry and prose as if told to music. This book contains personal letters exchanged between Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Keckley that reveals the intimacy of their relationship.You will not be disappointed as you read these wonderful lines. This is truly a great book written by a strong, vibrant, and courageous woman. Her remarkable journey from slavery to freedom exemplifies the tenacity and determination it required for such a bold and dogged move."},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the","review":"I'm a Lincoln buff and enjoy reading different books on his life. This is a very simple book which would be a great introduction to a history novice. It was written by a former slave who bought her own freedom and became a seamstress to the rich of Washington--Mary Lincoln included."},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the","review":"Awsome book! As you read it you can really feel what life was like for the author, Elizabeth Keckley. Her ability to draw the reader into her world is amazing. The deeper I got into the book, the harder it was to put it down. This book would be a GREAT asset for schools to use as part of American History."},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the","review":"As an avid Lincoln fan, I have been meaning to read this book for years. I found it free on Kindle and read it immediately.It was an intriguing memoir which gave me insight into the experience of slavery, Mary Todd Lincoln, and the Civil War Era. I had read several accounts of Lincoln's visit to Richmond at the end of the war. I never realized that Mary Lincoln's closest friend at the time -- the former slave, Elizabeth Keckley -- went with them. Reconsidering the tour of that fallen Southern city took on a more profound cast when considered through the eyes of a former slave who was now a family friend of the President. Another touching detail in the book is that Ms. Keckley tells how Mr. Lincoln would have her comb down the back of his unruly hair before he'd go downstairs for official occasions.Connie Neal, author of many books found at www.amazon.com/author/connieneal"},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the","review":"I really loved this lost piece of history. I didn't like the way it ended so abruptly, but she tells us what the real Mrs. Lincoln was like. Even though it is about her life with Mrs. Lincoln, as her maid she would have seen what went on in the Lincoln's home and described it as it really was during that time. I am ashamed that the people of that time didn't provide for her or her sons in a better manner. She should have received enough to afford to live modestly with her sons in a nice neighborhood without worry for basic essentials. If you want to know what went on in the white house with the Lincolns then you will want to read this book. Real history never told."},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the","review":"I was amazed, truly, by the vocabulary and writing style of a former slave.

It was wonderful to read of two women during the darkest time of our country became the best of friends. The book is worth reading."},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the","review":"I was enthralled by every page of this book. I couldn't put it down and was disappointed when it ended. As I was reading the book, I felt like I was stepping back in time witnessing the ordinary, human, day-to-day life behind the historical events we studied in school.The story was simple and yet it presented a very intimate glimpse into the genuine personalities of Abraham and Mary and the life the author shared with them. Elizabeth Keckley was not writing to impress anyone with her &quot;insider&quot; position in the White House, she was just sharing her story.The stories about her life as a slave also offered the reader an opportunity to experience slavery through the eyes and heart of a slave.How lucky we are that she wrote this book."},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the","review":"Well, you can't get closer to being in the Lincoln White House than this. The story of Mary Todd Lincoln's dressmaker is written by the seamstress herself, Mrs. Keckley. She gives a fine, but brief, narrative of herself - starting out as a slave, a brief marriage and eventually buying her own freedom from the talent of her needle. Selling dresses to the wealthiest women around, she eventually catches the interest of Mrs. Lincoln and becomes her dressmaker. Her interactions with the President up to his assassination, though few, are remarkable and give us another eye witness glimpse of the Personal Lincoln. Most interesting is her account of Mary Lincoln after leaving the White House. Detailed are Mary Todd's efforts to sell her dresses for income, with the assistance of Mrs. Keckley. She tells about Mrs. Lincoln traveling incognito, which is extremely interesting. Mrs. Keckley writes in a very educated manner and shows her caring self through her words. A short book, and nominally priced, it is good for pleasure reading or as a source book for researchers, containing information that may not be found elsewhere."},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the","review":"I got a copy of this book from a book fair not on purpose. As a non-native English learner, what strikes me is the ability of Keckley to express rich emotions in very simple words and sentences. I always like reading first person narratives, fictions or true stories, but seldom find one as captivating as this. A five-star from me and it's a pity she didn't seemto have written other books."},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the","review":"Elizabeth Keckley's memoirs caused shock waves when they appeared in 1868. The press lambasted Keckley for daring to unveil the secrets of her betters. Mrs. Lincoln, who always called Elizabeth \\"my best and kindest friend,\\" abruptly dropped her. And Lincoln's eldest son had the book suppressed.Why Elizabeth Keckley wrote this intimate chronicle at the height of her involvement with Mary Lincoln is a puzzle. She thought she was justifying Mrs. Lincoln, whose erratic behavior was always under fire by observers and the press. We must read between the lines for insights into Keckley's motivation, and that's precisely what makes the book so fascinating.Keckley revered President Lincoln as the liberator of her people. But she portrays Mary Lincoln as paranoid, jealous, capricious, extravagant and prone to hysterics. At the same time, Keckley shows great sympathy for Mrs. Lincoln's sufferings.The memoirs begin with an account of Keckley's life as a slave and how she rose to become a fashionable dressmaker, able to buy freedom for herself and her son. As a free black in Washington, her talents and entrepreneurial spirit won her the patronage of the elite.Eventually she became Mrs. Lincoln's dress designer, personal maid and confidant, heavily relied upon in every crisis. She also became an activist, organizing relief for penniless newly freed slaves.What followed the memoirs? Troubles of every sort. Mrs. Lincoln was at one point committed to an insane asylum by her son. Keckley never benefited from her memoirs. She spent her last years in a home she herself had founded for destitute women, a picture of Mrs. Lincoln hanging in her room.Elizabeth Keckley's autobiography is a remarkable document, and I heartily recommend it to anyone interested in Black history, the Civil War - or the complex psychology of human relationships."},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the","review":"This is a memior written by a woman who started life as a slave, then managed to buy her freedom, and later set up a successful living as a seamstress, eventually going to work for Mrs. Lincoln in the White House. As such, it is a bit rambling. There are two chapters about her early life as a slave, but the author knows that what is most interesting to the readers is her life in the white house, and so she skips ahead to that period, giving us her personal \\"insider account\\" of daily vignettes with Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln. These vignettes include an eyewitness account of Lincoln's second inauguration address, the death of Willie Lincoln, and events immediately after Lincoln's assasination. The author then goes on to describe her post-white house associations with Mrs. Lincoln, who became a personal friend, as Mrs. Lincoln deals with post-presidency debts. The book continues with an in-depth account of how Mrs. Keckley assisted Mrs. Lincoln with attempting to sell her personal effects (dresses) to raise money. This must have been of great interest to readers when the book was first published in the 1860's, but has limited appeal to modern readers.Overall, however, the book is a very interesting glimpse into the daily life of a slave, an independent businesswoman in the 1860's, of someone who worked in the white house during the civil war, and of someone in the close confidence of the Lincolns. It is well-written and engaging."},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the","review":"Behind the Scenes by Elizabeth Keckley is an interesting tale which inspired me to do further research on her and the Lincoln family as well.I would like to have read more about Mrs. Keckley's experiences as a child and young adult. One reviewer put it well that the 30 years Elizabeth was a slave covered such a short portion of this book, while her four years in the White House and several years afterward claimed most of this work.Mrs. Keckley states in the beginning of this tale that part of the reason she wrote this book was to \\"attempt to place Mrs. Lincoln in a better light before the world\\". Personally, I don't believe that this goal was met. While Mrs. Keckley shares some lovely inside moments in the lives of the Lincolns, the overall impression I was left with regarding Mary Todd Lincoln after reading this book was that Mrs. Lincoln had some severe problems...and not just of a financial nature.Much has been speculated and written about Mary Lincoln and what drove her. Was she simply an outspoken woman who was ahead of her time or was she mentally unbalanced?The evidence of this book, to me at least, seems to point strongly to the latter. At the very least she had extremely entitled, narcissistic tendencies.The letters included in the latter part of the book from Mary Lincoln to the author are disturbing to say the least. Reading Mary Lincoln's constant missives to this woman, who was a trusted friend and who closed down the shop that provided her livelihood so that she could attend to Mrs. Lincoln's interests in New York, proved to be quite irritating to me.Mrs. Lincoln's whining about how poorly treated she was by just about everybody and how destitute she was grew tiresome. This woman obviously blew through money like it was water and then had the gall to complain about the government not giving her more. She left Washington at least $70,000.00 in debt...and this was in 1865. This sum would be a daunting debt in today's society, let alone then.I found her high-handed orders, couched in self pitying rhetoric, directed at Mrs. Keckley to be in very poor taste.All in all, I could have done with more of Mrs. Keckley's personal history and a bit less of the Lincoln years...especially involving Mary Lincoln."},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the","review":"This book gives a first hand, up close and in person view of the marriage of Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln during their White House years. Mrs Keckley, born a slave near Petersburg, Virginia, purchased her freedom and that of her only son. Like Mary Lincoln, she, too, lost a son during the Civil War, her only son.The book is full of wonderful quotations that have found their way into nearly every account of the First Couple. Her account of Willie Lincoln's death is especially touching. Mrs Keckley was a truly wonderful friend for Mary Lincoln, but the publication of this book ended their friendship. The reader is introduced in these pages to two remarkable women and made painfully aware of all the sadness they lived through. The reader will be grateful to have learned their story from someone who lived thru it, even though a ghostwriter assisted the former slave in her writing. The book never reached it's contemporary audience. Mary Lincoln's son, Robert Todd Lincoln, personally suppressed it. It is far more worthy to be read than the recently published &quot;book&quot; by the Lincoln's trifling Springfield maid, Mariah Vance, which is indeed a &quot;Mammy&quot;/&quot;Aunt Jemima&quot; diatribe if ever there was one!"},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the","review":"In 1868, three years after the War Between the States ended and Abraham Lincoln was murdered, Elizabeth Keckley sat down to write a partial history of her life as a slave and modiste (dressmaker) for Mary Todd Lincoln at the White House. If readers judge \\"Behind the Scenes\\" by the standards of modern biographies, they won't do the book justice.\\"Lizzie\\" Keckley was a slave who insisted on buying her freedom, even after being offered it for nothing. In modern terms, she was an \\"Aunt Tom\\" for validating the notion that any human being can be bought and sold for a price. By her own standards, she was affirming her value to society. It's impossible to judge such a person in contemporary terms.Lizzie's dressmaking skill attracted the attention of Mary Todd Lincoln in 1861. Mrs. Lincoln was quite addicted to clothes, and hired \\"Dear Lizzie\\" as her private modiste. Their association solidified into a deep friendship after the death in 1862 of Willie Lincoln (in the White House); Lizzie offered warmth and solicitude, badly needed by an erratic First Lady whose intemperate ways and harsh tongue had made her perhaps the most disliked person in Washington. The friendship persisted after Lincoln's assassination, when Lizzie aided Mrs. Lincoln in purging her monstrous debts (she owed $70,000 to department stores) by trying to sell off old dresses and jewelry.\\"Behind the Scenes\\" ended the friendship. After its publication Mary Lincoln, her pride wounded, dropped \\"Dear Lizzie\\" and referred to Mrs. Keckley as \\"that colored historian.\\"For students of the assassination Mrs. Keckley's reminiscences are especially helpful. Several weeks after April 14, 1865, while Mrs. Lincoln was still in mourning inside the White House, Lizzie told her \\"the new messenger\\" (not identified by name in the book, unfortunately) was on watch, he being the same man who had abandoned his post outside Lincoln's box at Ford's Theater. Mrs. Lincoln excoriated the \\"new messenger\\" and accused him of complicity in the assassination. The messenger admitted his carelessness but denied complicity, insisting he had simply taken a seat where he could better watch the play.Except for the ambiguous word \\"messenger,\\" this account conforms precisely to the convential wisdom that prevailed until about 25 years ago, i.e. that John F. Parker, a Metropolitan Police officer assigned to White House duty, was responsible for guarding Lincoln's box on the night of the assassination, but left his post and allowed John Wilkes Booth clear entry (and how would Booth have known the coast would be clear?). Post-modern historians, possibly seizing on Keckley's use of \\"messenger\\" to describe Parker, contrived a theory that Parker's duties never included protecting Lincoln...which idea begs the obvious question, \\"Why would Mrs. Lincoln have been so angry at someone who wasn't responsible in the first place?\\" And, since Parker supposedly went on trial for negligence (the records were mysteriously destroyed), \\"Why would anyone have been put on trial for neglecting Lincoln at Ford's Theater if he had been only a White House functionary all along?\\""},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the","review":"Great book, if you are interested in the Civil War, I heard about it at another Civil War display.

I can understand why a publisher would think this book would be important.However, even if a book is someone as interesting as Mary Todd. Some things quiet honestly should never be published.There were a few interesting moments about Mary and Abraham Lincoln in the diary. That is really the only reason why I gave it two stars.The person who published this book. Makes it seems like there is more info on the Lincoln's then there acutely is.It's more about the hard times of slavery. I don't have a problem reading about such things. However, there are a lot better books out there written about the subject.If your really new to learning about the Civil War, slavery, and the Lincoln family.

The material presented seemed to be shallow and superficial, and I didn't appreciate the often flippant and dismissive comments attributed to the discredited historian Edmond Morris and the glib comments ascribed to Lou Cannon. I couldn't help but wonder why the author persisted in quoting these two men. I was also put off by the fact that the book appeared to have been published without any serious attempt at proof-reading.As I got farther into the book, however, the author began quoting a broader spectrum of sources and the book became much more interesting and more to my liking. Although I don't consider it to be one of the better books which I have read about Reagan, his family, or his administration, I still found it to be of interest and perhaps of some historical value. It still, to me, reads somewhat superficial, rather like a stone skipping across the water of Reagan's political career without ever going beneath the surface. I.e., the author tells us what happened, mostly in the words of those who contributed to the book, but seldom does she tell us why it happened.In any event, if Nancy Reagan, her children, and others associated with the Reagan Administration trusted this author and agreed to contribute to her book, who am I to criticize? What did I like most about this book? The insights contributed by some of those interviewed, many of which I have never read before. What did I like least about this book? Most of the quotations from Lou Cannon and Edmond Morris, and the serious lack of editing (hardback edition)."},{"Title":"Reagan An American Story : The Writings of Ronald Reagan That Reveal His Revolutionary Vision for America","review":"Reagan had no revolutionary visions, he had reactionary visions. His ideas are not looking forward,to some great hill of freedom. They're looking backward to a utopian past that never existed. He believed that the MacCarthy Hearings, which he was instrumental in organizing, were a good thing. He thought that confronting the Soviet Union at every turn was a peaceful solution. He took credit for things he didn't do, like knocking down the Berlin Wall and he never heard of Iran-Contra or the deficit.

The people are so different and the stories vary so much one from the other that it defies anything you have ever heard about Italian stereotypes. If the immigrants could be classified at all it would be that they all worked tirelessly in their pursuits. Not all achieved success as we know it. Take the story about &quot;the Human Mole&quot; , Baldasare Forestiere who bought a large plot of land and, to the embarrassment of his family, spent forty years creating a ten-acre subterranean maze of curving passageways, rooms, courtyards, patios and grottos beneath the surface of his property. There is a description of life on a mushroom farm; a beautiful poem about a summer kitchen in the middle of a garden in Brooklyn; a housewife who took in single Italian boarders and treated them like family. Then there are the famous Italians, Giannini, Mario Lanza, Enrico Caruso and the infamous Lucky Luciano, Al Capone etc. I highly recommend this book it is filled with interesting information, a great reference book, heart-warming and entertaining. This book is a joy to read and a treasure to own."},{"Title":"The Big Book of Italian American Culture","review":"This book was a given to me as a gift many years ago, & have in turn I have given it to many friends and family. Prof DiStasi has gathered stories on some of the most well-known and not so well known Italian Americans to created one of the best books on the Italian American culture. The contributors vary but Prof DiStasi wrote many of the articles himself, which is a treat as he is so well versed on the history of Italian American culture. Many of the stories are tales of what we grew up with, but quite a few surprises were there. Who knew that the real Mr. Peanut was an Italian American name Amedeo Obici, who realized that during poor economic times, one would pay a nickel for a bag of peanuts, or that Charles Atlas was really Angelo Siciliano? So many wonderful stories, totally unbiased, covering every field, every view, plus it covered various parts of the United States. The book is split in segments, covering the world of politics, sports, music, agriculture, arts, social leaders as well as industrial leaders. Thanks to The Big Book of Italian American Culture, I went to see the Forestiere Gardens, not too far from me, but who knew it existed? I now know why Italians went to Arkansas.

I wish I had read it when I was a young man. Back then, Marxist historians like Christopher Hill and controversialists like E.H.Carr ruled the roost. In their view, history had a purpose. H.A.L. Fisher had lamented that he could see \`only one emergency following upon another, as wave follows upon wave'; but for Hill and Carr, there was indeed \`a plot, a rhythm, a predetermined pattern'. History (and historiography) must be more than just \`one damned thing after another'.Sir Herbert Butterfield (1900 - 1979) was Master of Peterhouse in Cambridge (1955 - 1968) and then Regius Professor of Modern History there (1963 - 1968). He thought that individuals were more important than systems of government or impersonal economic forces. History was a matter of chance and accident and therefore unpredictable. Any grand theory of history was a fiction, which reflected more on the historian's prejudices and predilections than on the age he was writing about. Although Butterfield was a Christian, he did not believe that historians could \`uncover the hand of God in history'. Providence was indeed at work, but it did not do so in any simplistic way. The true struggle between good and evil was a struggle within the soul of Man, not between rival political systems. The main driver in human history was Man's ineradicable cupidity and self-righteousness.A few quotations will demonstrate the quality of \`Christianity and History', which was written in 1949, when many thought that some kind of Communism would eventually prevail throughout the world, and that we had better get used to it, even if we didn't like it much. Butterfield's remarks about capitalism would still seem to be highly relevant - since I write at a time of widespread \`anti-capitalist' protest:\`History is always a story in which Providence is countered by human aberration.'\`There is one sin that locks people up in all their other sins... namely the sin of self-righteousness.'\`The industrial revolution and the rise of the capitalist system are the best that Providence can do with human cupidity at certain stages of the story'\`Men are often governed more by their hatreds than their loves, and some men have more surely hated the capitalists than they have loved the poor.'Stephen Cooper"},{"Title":"Christianity and History","review":"This book is a tour de force of how a Christian can regard history. I find it corrects my poor thinking at every turn and introduces and reintroduces critical subjects such as judgment in history, man's human nature, and historical development.The last line of the book is remembered by everyone who has later commented on it. It is a testament to how far and fast the book moves."},{"Title":"Christianity and History","review":"Herbert Butterfield (1900-1979) was a British historian and philosopher of history, who also wroteThe Whig Interpretation of HistoryandThe Origins of History. He explained, \\"The Introduction and the seven chapters of this book are an amplified version of the six broadcast lectures delivered ... [in] 1949... These were based in turn upon a series of seven lectures originally delivered at the... University of Cambridge in ... 1948.\\" (Pg. vii)He observes, \\"Christianity is an historical religion in a particularly technical sense that the term possesses---it presents us with religious doctrines which are at the same time historical events or historical interpretations.\\" (Pg. 3) Later, he adds, \\"And if God works upon our lives in detail or touches men in the things which are most intimate, then He is affecting history in any case...\\" (Pg. 59) He states, \\"it is only by catacalysm that man can make his escape from the net which he has taken so much trouble to weave around himself; and that is why the judgments of God so often appear to be remedial to the future historian.\\" (Pg. 61) He ultimate concludes, \\"certain historical events... are considered to have a spiritual content and to represent the divine breaking in upon history.\\" (Pg. 119)He suggests, \\"If there is a meaning in history, therefore, it lies not in the systems and organizations that are built over long periods, but in something more essentially human, something in each personality considered for mundane purposes as an end in himself.\\" (Pg. 66-67) He adds, \\"If the end of history lies in personalities... when we must face the fact that the purpose of history is not something that lies a thousand years ahead of us---it is constantly here, always with us, for ever achieving itself---the end of human history is the manufacture and education of human souls.\\" (Pg. 76)He admits, \\"I am unable to see how a man can find the hand of God in secular history, unless he has first found that he has an assurance of it in his personal experience... I cannot think that this can be true for the mere external observer, who puts on the thinking-cap of the ordinary historical student.\\" (Pg. 107) He summarizes in the final lecture, \\"I have attempted to show why ... the general course of history is so shaped that a Christian is in the right relation with it... [which] means that throughout the centuries it has been possible for the simplest Christians to be right in this matter, while clever doctrinaires were being misled...\\" (Pg. 130)Butterfield's books are among the most popular of modern Christian interpretations of history, and will even be of value to secular students of the philosophy of history."},{"Title":"Christianity and History","review":"Butterfield's amendatory poignant insight questions common perception toward the understanding of history. He argues that historical knowledge is skewed when it's done non-theologically, i.e., outside Christian worldview. History is, according to Butterfield, a fulfilling prophecy of God's sovereignty; Christianity is therefore an historical religion (3). Furthermore, Butterfield enumerates several misconceptions about study of history. For example, new evidence makes history seem evolving yet historical events remain true (14f); history is always biased so that only unbiased truth, i.e., Christianity, can reveal real event (17ff); even though history is a science sometimes it cannot be reconstructed scientifically, because God's authority lies beyond human logic so history must be understood holistically rather than through mere science (22f).Butterfield construes history as a \\"[dealing] with the drama of human life as the affair of individual personalities, possessing self-consciousness, intellect, and freedom (26). He warns to watch man's own self-deception considering himself as born civilized (31), and self-righteous (40ff). Thus Butterfield asserts throughout the book that where everything seems equivocal still two unchanging historical truth should be realized with certainty: sinfulness of mankind, everlasting love of God.Consequently, lofty ideas and dispositions have achieved far little than mankind ever self-credited. Illustrating his points through many well-known historical events he proves that the predicament of human condition never changes. But he refuses to call history cyclical, because the sovereignty of God makes it impossible to predict future. Thus the purpose of human life, according to this master historian, is to make life fruitful here and now, because only \\"now\\" alone is directly connected to eternity (66). Butterfield's profound admonition makes integration not only between theology and history, but also morality and history as well. Because for him, individual man's free choice for \\"now\\" makes a history that he never can fathom in his lifetime, but only will be translated through its future consequences (68ff).Butterfield's boldness, therefore, concludes that Christians become idolaters when they understand neither God's sovereignty nor their position in God-bestowed liberty: \\"Whether we are Christians or not, whether we believe in a Divine Providence or not, we are liable to serious technical errors if we do not regard ourselves as born into a providential order\\" (98). No man can make definitive progress; neither no wicked can crumble prehistory. As Butterfield shares his conviction no man can see the hand of God unless his assurance in God gives him personal experience (107). He seems to assert that history is a Christianity, and Christian experience reveals that everything works for his good purpose (Rom 8:28).Butterfield proves that history does not have to sacrifice its factual clarity due to Christian faith. In fact only the Christian faith can save historical truth from selfish human cupidity. Butterfield says in his conclusion, \\"belief in God gives us greater elasticity of mind, rescuing us from too great subservience to intermediate principles, whether these are related to nationality or ideology or science\\" (145). His finals words that \\"Hold to Christ, and for the rest be totally uncommitted\\" still resonates over sixty years."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis: New Directions in the Search for Answers","review":"Robert J. Williams has written a gem of a book in &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; which even I--a scientific lay person if ever there was one--could understand. Williams blends his talents as a writer with his training as a scientist to produce a compelling argument that Einstein's universally accepted &quot;welding&quot; of time and space needed to &quot;prove&quot; his theory of relativity was sophistry. Recent discoveries in astrophysics tend to bear him out. &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; is written in a simple, elegant style that almost everyone will find compelling.

Couldn't something creative be done with the backgrounds of each entry? I don't see how shrinking the photos to the size of a postage stamp will enhance the quality.

Last year's calendar didn't even include any images from any of the TEN feature films.I am proud to say that this year's calendar is a marked improvement over last year's! The dates are larger and in a bolder font. All five series are represented and all ten films are included as well. The pictures are indeed small compared to previous releases as mentioned by another reviewer, but the variety of images this year makes up for the lack of size.Highly recommended to any true Trek fan who understands it is a STAR TREK calendar...not a year-long publicity photo shoot for an inferior &quot;Enterprise&quot; series."},{"Title":"The Witch Has an Itch","review":"My son loves to read this book out loud to us.

The fact that the Scriptures reveal so little indicates that we don't need to know, but that reduces neither our curiosity nor the prolixity of Christian authors. Gilmore, although filling his study with intriguing chapter titles such as &quot;Humor in Heaven?&quot;, &quot;Memory in Heaven?&quot;, and &quot;Recognition in Heaven?&quot;, would really have better served us to have written a commentary on the Biblical book of Revelation. He draws heavily from that portion of Scripture for his theses; nonetheless he has a difficult time answering the questions which he poses in his chapter titles, since the answers just aren't there to the depth nor the extent that we would like to have. Gilmore's eschatology is amillennial, which will make his views acceptable to many in the Reformed camp. His writing style is not always easy to follow, and this was a book I had to put down and take up again many times before I finished it. Dr. Gilmore is a Baptist pastor in Cincinnati, a graduate of Reformed Episcopal Seminary, and the uncle of Jim Gilmore, whom many of us know. His credentials are good, but as far as probing heaven is concerned, I have long since decided to wait and experience it first hand. Whatever it will be like, I am sure that it is infinitely preferable to the alternative, and that those of us who trust Christ will go through eternity without ever having the thought that we missed out on anything by having done so."},{"Title":"Gut Busters: The 15-Minute-A-Day, 12-Week Plan","review":"My informal surveying of guys shows that they wouldn't buy such a book as this because all you need to do to get \\"flat abs\\" is to do more crunches or sit-ups.As I've written about in \\"Exercise & Health\\" and \\"Men's Workout\\" magazines many times, that is not the only solution. There are many guys who do serious crunches every day and don't lose their middle.To really get lean abs, you have to know a variety of facts, and Vedral has included all of them in this book without going on in useless detail. It's sort of a little book, which makes it easy to read and later refer to. Absolutely crucial information is here: why a low-fat diet will help, how the number of repetitions vs. the form you use affects your progress, and the many varieties of exercises you need to do. Most people don't know that simply doing basic crunches won't make your stomach lean.

As another reviewer noted there are factual mistakes. One thing that consistently seems to be a problem with American Protestants is their lack of understanding of the Catholic Church. The authors have a section on Roman Catholics and then include Ukrainian Catholics under Orthodox. Why cannot they just make a section on Catholics and include Roamn Catholic and the other Catholic churches. Eastern Catholic churches recognize the pope, Orthodox do not. They are Catholic, not Orthodox. Again they are not Ukrainian Catholics of the Byzantinr Rite. The Ukrainian Catholic Church is one of seven Catholic churches that use the Byzatine Rite, the same set of ceremonies used by the Greek Orthodox and the Russian Orthodox. With the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral here in Philadelphia and the church having been admisistered here when it was abolished in the Ukrain by the Soviets, it would seem important for a writer to correctly identify them. They represent the second largest church within the Catholic Church. This understanding would especially seem important as more and more Eastern Christians whether Catholic, Orthox, Pseudo Othodox or Independents settle in Philadelphia. If it says Catholic, it is not Orthodox unless the fuller term Othodox Catholic is used."},{"Title":"Historic Sacred Places of Philadelphia","review":"Mr. Moss seems to be an anorak, as this book seems to be poorly researched and contains many factual mistakes.

I only knew how the pieces moved before. This covers the relative value of the pieces, openings, mid game and end game plays. It's not an exercise book though. Plays are illustrated and briefly described, and there aren't chess problems. It's up to the reader to memorize them on his own if he desires. When uncluttered with teaching instruction, it's more readable for the casual player and works well as a reference afterward. If you're just curious about chess strategy, reading this straight through gives a feel for the play of the moves (really, it's that readable).One possible downside is that it uses the older descriptive notation, not the more common algebraic. Many beginners (including me) find descriptive notation easier, actually. Either way, the playing tactics are the same."},{"Title":"Chess in a nutshell","review":"4 stars for a beginner, not so many if you are more advanced. However, I read this when I was in college as I became more interested in chess and it served a useful purpose for me.First, it simply notes the \\"basic rules of chess,\\" such as the pieces and the board, rules of moving, captures, and so on. For a starter book, this serves well. Chapter 2 is how one records chess moves. I used to chart some chess matches, since it might get later at night and we would complete the game the next day; having a record of moved was most helpful!. The third chapter focuses on \\"winning methods,\\" basic checkmates, relative value of pieces, etc.For me, Chapter 4 was critical--openings. Pawn to King 4 (or, as noted, P-K4) was my norm, whether Black or White. Other rules here: develop pieces quickly; don't waste time; avoid self-limiting moves; don't neglect safety of the King (page 75). One way of accomplishing these goals is to understand basic openings. Some that I used when I was White--Evans Gambit, Giuoco Piano, and Ruy Lopez. When Black? I often used the safe and cautious Caro-Kann (as Reinfeld says, \\"safe, stodgy, and respectable. Play it against formidable opponents.\\"). Sometimes, I would use the Sicilian. Very occasionally, the Nimzoindian. . . .There are also chapters on middle game play and the endgame.All in all, this was a fine resource for me as I first started trying my hand at chess. . . ."},{"Title":"Chess in a nutshell","review":"This book is basically a second-stage book. While it covers the basics, it's not really aimed at people who have never played chess at all, but at those who understand the basics and want to take their chess play to the next level. It is, in my opinion, vastly better than most other \\"beyond basics\\" chess books, which essentially seem to take the tack of \\"here's 470 kabillion chess games to play through. Figure it out on your own.\\"No, this book explicitly explains the concepts of what you, the intermediate player, are looking for -- discovered checks, revealed checks, forked attacks, and so forth -- which are the next stage of chess play. Setting these up, or seeing them before they can come into use against you, is the meat of secondary level play. You won't be a master when you're done with this book, but you will be able to play a master and not look like a total loser at the game.It does this by showing you simple examples, and describing the concepts, rather than putting dozens of partial games up for you to glean the principle ideas from. As a result, it's good for those who might want to get better but have no interest in spending months of deliberate study because they plan to become a master at the game.

This selection happens via black holes, where universes are created with slightly different random new values for the parameters of the standard model in physics.There are no eternal laws, only worlds which are the result of random and statistical processes of self-organization.I agree, there are a lot of ifs in this book, with a crucial one on p. 93: 'If quantum effects prevent the formation of singularities ... then time does not end in the centre of black holes, but continues into some new region of space-time.'Smolin explains that behind the central principles of relativity and quantum mechanics lies the essential fact that 'All properties of things in the world are only aspects of relations among real things, so that they may be decribed without reference to any absolute background structures.' (p.259)For Smolin, the future of physics is to find a solution for the tension between the atomist description of elementary particles, and their relational use in the gauge principle. He believes that string theory is part of the solution.Smolin's point of view is partly shared by the late Nobel Prize winner Ilya Prigogine in his difficult book 'The End of Certainty'.Even if his theory is falsified, this book is a real bargain, because it contains magnificently clear (a real bonus) explanations of the 4 basic forces in physics, the gauge principle, symmetry breaking, quantum mechanics, gravity, the second law of thermodynamics, the theory of natural selection, Leibniz's philosophy, the reason why mathematical and logical truths may be eternal ... I could go on.Into the bargain, it contains a deadly attack on determinism and a very polite but definitive refutation of the anthropic principle.A great book by a true and free humanist."},{"Title":"The Life of the Cosmos","review":"Smolin attempts two things in this book: to put forth a novel idea of how the laws of nature have come to be as they are, and to develop for the non-expert reader the context of why such an explanation of the laws of nature is necessary. The novel idea, cosmological natural selection, which has been described in other reviews, is fascinating. Whether or not it is true, or how it could be proven either true or false, is deeply problematic. Regardless, Smolin has demonstrated that we can provide a consistent answer to the cosmological argument without resorting to theistic reasoning. And unlike the extreme reductionists, he accounts for the full intricacy of the physical, biological, and cultural world we live in. The second function of this book, providing a context for his theory, is an even more successful endeavor. The subject matter here is much the same as Paul Davies' &quot;The Mind of God,&quot; but Smolin's book is more comprehensive.

This is not because it is too technical, but more becaue of the verbose style of the author. The text is filled with tautologies and sentences that just don't make sense. One can get the gist of what Smolin is saying, but the repetition at times within the same paragraph was annoying enough to take the shine off the story. The book could be quite a bit shorter. The copious typos didn't help either.That said, there is plenty if interesting stuff to ponder here. Perhaps because Smolin is trying to appeal to a popular audience, I sometimes found his explanations lacking in depth - for example, the assertion that certain parameters that determine the composition of the universe and its hospitability to life are fine-tuned to an accuracy of one part in 10 to the 60th power. Not being a physicist or mathematician, I can only take what Mr Smolin says at face value. I'm also not sure about black holes being the generators of new universes - it strikes me as an idea that can never betested or proved. Perhaps the development of the grand theory that Mr Smolin ultimately hopes for will provide further support for his cosmological natural selection, through testing of new mathematical models. But I still feel that much of what he is saying will always remain beyond the scope of science, and to a large degree must be taken on faith. But I take my hat off to him for thinking so big."},{"Title":"The Life of the Cosmos","review":"A unified theory that would give us an objective and complete view for our world has always been the dream of physicists.Lee Smolin in his extraordinary book illustrates many significant views of the obstacles facing the unification of general relativity and quantum theory into one universal cosmological theory that could provide us, in principle, an objective and complete understanding for the universe as a whole.

Lee Smolin is a first-rate genius! And despite the fact that this book is over ten years old (granting that years in the science world are more akin to dog years) it has stood the test of time through its shear elegance. There are really more concepts in this book than a simple book review can do justice, but I wanted to point out with this review that what Smolin proposes in this book (cosmological natural selection) is THE most logical, graceful and sweeping \\"Theory of Everything\\" that I have ever come upon. Even Smolin's erstwhile nemesis Leonard Susskind had this to say about him: \\"I'm not sure why Smolin's idea didn't attract much attention. I actually think it deserved far more than it got.\\" Please be aware that Susskind is no fan of Lee Smolin; in fact, Smolin is heavily critical of string theory (see his 2007 bookThe Trouble With Physics: The Rise of String Theory, The Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next). I very much appreciate Smolin's insistence on falsifiability - I completely agree with him in his reasoning that any scientific proposal that seeks validity must be able to be proven empirically - otherwise, what is the point?As I stated above, there are many concepts that Smolin works through (there is essentially no math involved) in physics, philosophy and religion. The net effect is to build a very compelling argument that the entire Universe \\"may\\" be designed for the sole purpose of propagating itself (this is also called the fecund universe theory) - all through the power of natural selection - where Information is what is being reproduced. In essence, Planck units are the galactic equivalent to DNA (Genius!). A few key terms are emergence, self-organizing non-equilibrium systems, and critical systems. Throughout the book Smolin continuously doubts the Eternal-ness, Absolute-ness, or Foundational-ness of, well, of \`Everything'. Indeed, if I understand Smolin correctly, many of the things which we take for granted (space, time, mathematics, or what is generally meant by Platonic Forms) are mere illusions that are created through the process of cosmic natural selection and therefore have no meaning other than what exists in \\"this world\\" as well as what we humans ascribe to them. There is no need in talking about anything (such as a Divine Observer) that exists outside of time, or outside of this one reality because it isn't necessary, possible or falsifiable. It is a very bold conclusion which Smolin brings forth from his intellectual forebears - Leibniz, Einstein and Darwin!In conclusion, I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in philosophy, physics or biology. Furthermore, it is fairly easy to follow, Smolin does take for granted a basic knowledge of the history of science, but this is not essential to understanding his arguments. When you read this book, you might just find yourself believing, like I do, that Smolin's book is right on time."},{"Title":"The Life of the Cosmos","review":"I must not understand black holes. One of Smolin's most interesting conjectures in this book is that the Big Bang of our universe is just the rebound from the collapse of a black hole within some larger universe, and that within all black holes in our universe, the rebounds from the collapse of those black holes are themselves Big Bangs forming new universes in their own right. Thus we have universes within universes within universes, and the universe of universes always was and always will be, something like the Christian God.That in itself isn't such an original idea. After all, the dopers in the movie, Animal House, imagined a universe in the atoms of their fingernails, and universes within the...well, you get the idea. Smolin's innovation is to imagine that as the black hole collapses towards the Singularity, when the size of the collapsing matter reaches Planck dimensions (ten to the minus thirty-third centimeters), currently unknown quantum effects take over and the singularity never actually gets a chance to form. Instead, all the matter rebounds in a Big Bang forming another universe as explained above, but with this little wrinkle: the basic constants of nature (the masses of the elementary particles and the strengths of the basic forces) change ever so slightly. In this way, Smolin imagines a form of &quot;natural selection&quot; for the basic constants, in which universes that produce the maximum number of black holes are selected for (since they produce the greatest number of &quot;offspring&quot;). Hence the laws of nature evolve towards a universe like ours, which produces a lot of black holes. As a corollary, Smolin shows that when the basic constants are adjusted to maximize the number of black holes, the universes so produced contain the necessary complexity to produce biological life as a natural by-product. So we're not so special: we &quot;belong&quot; here due to the particular values of the fundamental constants chosen by a process of natural selection.Smolin was led to propose his theory of the evolution of the basic constants of nature because of the failure of physics (so far) to come up with a Grand Theory of Everything that predicts from basic principles the exact values of the basic constants. He spends some time analyzing the failure of string theory to do this, for example. Thus, Smolin's great innovation is to view the basic constants of nature as the result of statistical processes rather than through some supreme cosmic design.Smolin spends a lot of time answering objections to his theory, principally trying to show that if you change any of the basic constants of nature ever so slightly from what we observe in our universe, fewer black holes would be formed. This assumes that this evolution of the natural laws has been going on for unimaginable ages and our universe is highly evolved, highly refined, and highly tuned, as a tiger or a human being presumably is on the planet Earth after billions of years of biological evolution.Unfortunately Smolin never addresses the objections to his theory that most bothered ME. This must be because I have misunderstood all the popular books I've read on black holes (I'm not a physicist, just a dilettante), and maybe readers of this review can straighten me out. It's my understanding that because of time dilation caused by intense gravitational fields, from the standpoint outside of a black hole, the singularity will never actually form (except after an infinite &quot;number&quot; of years), and because of Hawking radiation, the black hole will evaporate completely before the matter within the black hole actually rebounds to form a new universe.Okay. So let's say I misunderstand that point about how black holes work and the singularity actually does form within the timeframe of our universe (would someone please explain this to me). Smolin's conjecture is that the basic constants of nature only change SLIGHTLY at the rebound. This means that protons and neutrons still have essentially the same mass as they did before the rebound, that the force of gravity has only changed slightly, etc. Well, we know from current Big Bang theory that the universe goes through an inflationary period in which the total mass of the universe increased by a factor of ten to the hundredth power. So how come when we observe a black hole from outside we don't see its mass increasing by a like amount? Presumably if this actually happened all of the galaxies near the black hole would be gradually sucked into it. So where is my thinking going wrong here? These objections are so obvious to me that my understanding of black holes must be fundamentally incorrect. Otherwise Smolin and all the other physicists that have thrown up objections to his theories would have dealt with these problems"},{"Title":"The Life of the Cosmos","review":"Lee Smolin's life of the cosmos is revolutionary. Before I read the book, I didn't particularly like the idea of relating cosmic evolution to biological evolution, but Lee Smolin makes some excellent points. Life may indeed be modeled after non-life. Compelling evidence is also presented regarding his black hole ideas, which is a great alternative to other theories in the field.The one downside to this book is the small print & verbose vocabulary of the author. At times, you almost need a dictionary by your side, & the average word must be eight letter long. However, if you make it through this revolutionary work, you'll never look at the universe or life the same way again. Overall this book is literally a beast to read, but in the end, it is well spent money & well spent time. Far too many scientists are scared to think on their own & hence there are too many books that sound exactly the same. This simply isn't one of them."},{"Title":"The Life of the Cosmos","review":"This is a beautiful book, to be read by everyone who is fascinated by the ongoing quest to unify cosmology and particle physics. The author has a cute idea - that the familiar multiple universes undergo a process of evolution and natural selection - but he goes much further, into the philosophical foundations of quantum theory and the basic notions of space and time. I particularly enjoyed (and found convincing) his claim that we are living in a period, analogous to the early years of this century, when the shared ideas that have been so productive, have become inadequate. A new paradigm is needed, according to Smolin, one that takes into account the self-organizing properties of the Universe, and the inter-relationships between all of its components. One doesn't have to agree with the author to appreciate the originality of his ideas, the clarity of his arguments (masterful explanation of black holes, for instance) and his candid description of his own struggle to break away from conventional thinking about fundamental physics issues. Smolin thinks big, but he is not afraid to admit that his theories are not fully worked out, and that many scientists object to his ideas (I, for one, could not follow his rejection of fixed external physical laws, when his theory of incrementally evolving Universes seems to require just that). But no matter - anyone who wants to appreciate (without math!) what is really happening on the frontiers of physics should read this book. One gripe: the book is set in a font so tiny that it's almost unreadable."},{"Title":"The Life of the Cosmos","review":"LIFE OF THE COSMOS brought it all together for me. The author has clearly not only reviewed most of the literature on many subjects; but, he has had time to think about it all and propose some novel ways to look at it. Though far from a Theory of Everything, he does manage to bridge life on Earth with, well, life of the cosmos. He does so by defining living systems as a self organized non-equilibrium system such that its processes are governed by a program which is stored symbolically and can reproduce itself, including the program. I still think about that years after reading the book. Highly recommended... - lc"},{"Title":"The Life of the Cosmos","review":"This is a wonderful book. Smolin proposes many original ideas and, while elaborating on them, clearly explains a wide variety of scientific concepts and their implications, including aspects of galactic evolution and structure, biology, particle physics and quantum mechanics. (I found his explanations clearer than those in Hyperspace by Michio Kaku. And, despite the diversity of subjects which Smolin addresses, he remains focussed throughout on his central ideas, thus distinguishing his book from the fascinating, but more diffuse, book about consciousness, The Emperor's New Mind by Roger Penrose, which covers a similarly broad range of topics.) Smolin's central ideas are: that our universe sprang from a black hole embedded in another universe; that universes whose physical constants permit the abundant creation of black holes are more likely to spawn other universes; and that the physical constants which characterize our universe therefore can be thought of as resulting from Darwinian competition. Smolin also points out that, wonderfully, these same physical constants yield the most interesting and complex worlds, filled with stars, galaxies, atoms, complex molecules, life and, best of all, seemingly endless novelty. Another bold idea (an elaboration on a theme by Leibniz) is that the world is relational (i.e., everything can be explained solely in terms of everything else) and therefore any attempt to &quot;step out&quot; and view the world from an absolute, objective, external perspective - and to derive natural laws based on that perspective - must fail. Equally thought provoking are Smolin's extensive discussions of life and living systems. His arguments suggest (but never expressly state) that life is more widespread than most people currently imagine. Although Smolin is a physicist, not a philosopher, his book raises many deep epistemological and metaphysical questions. Plus, to top it off, it's beautifully written - clear and straightforward from start to finish."},{"Title":"The Life of the Cosmos","review":"The author's hypothesis is that universes evolve by reproduction (via black holes) and natural selection (of fundamental physical constants).

His ideas have been very inspiring to me from the time I was a graduate student. Since then he was trying to lay down a framework where the physical law will arise dynamically together with the rest of the contents of the universe.The non expert reader will enjoy a lively written book describing amazing facts that we know about the universe and their philosopical implications that even today they are as awsome and exciting as during the time Lee was writing this book.

I feel so lucky."},{"Title":"The Life of the Cosmos","review":"Dr. Lee Smolin has done a great service to the cause of modern physics. He is one of those rare physicists to be met with who thinks, along with Ernest J. Sternglass, that philosophy of science is not irrelevant to the theory and practice of physics. He, along with Standard Model co-creator, Sheldon Glashaw has been insistent upon physics making contact with the empirical world, and this implies, as Glashaw relentlessly argues against string theory as a kind of pure mathematical abstraction which has no contact or provable contact with our visible sensed cosmos; in the book under review, Smolin begins to see that just as organic processes are subject to evolution, so, too, might our cosmos be so subject; consequently, Smolin reasons, that what may cause such iterations of cosmological selection is quantum Black holes; in this way of theorizing, the Black hole opens, beaneth its event horizon unto another world, and this world will have a (Born statitical?) liklihood of reproducing itself, if it has a high proportion of elements which create quantum comological Black holes; one can conceptualize this in the following way--imagine that Einstein's (1915/16) General theory of relativity, once a fundemental energy is put into the system, say that of a high intensity gamma ray photon, could provide a born-stochastic distribution of all worlds that can produce black holes; on Smolin's proposal, these worlds would be more likely to exist, because they, as it were, are gaurenteed probable offspring--more cosmological black holes, more life worlds. Einstein's theory, if thought through to its fundamental implications, implies the possibility of a distribution of all material and noetic worlds as the complete set of possible solutions to the equations of the theory, which Friedman, among others, was the first to supply. What interests me most about Smolin's prposal is that it may prove even more fruitful, if our sub-cosmos, if such we are in, was produced by the collapse of a quantum cosmological black hole; for then the stellar mechanics of black holes will be the quantum mechanics of cosmological creation. Smolin is careful not to oversell his theory in the abscence of more proof, but he is very attentive to what would constitute evidence for the theory or against it. It would remain to determine to what degree the model of cosmological natural selection is consistent with E. Sternglass' electron/positron model: For Dr. Sternglass has said that his model posits a rotating cosmos with areas of extreme Riemanian curvature, and that this is the description of a black hole--one essentially spun out of just two fundamental particles--the electron and the positron. I assert that Smolin, Sternglass, and I have produced a new understanding of what the big bang is, and thus have a chance of getting within hailing distance of the logico-emperical structure of space-time nd the fundamental parameters of the standard model; I assert, for example, that it is those suns that exceed the Chandraskar limit value which are the collapsing black holes which produce more or less stellar holes depending upon the mass or energy of the original sun; heavier suns, by implication will collapse and form more black holes because the initial mass or energy (they are equal according to Einstein's energy/mass relation)distorts space time so completely that it closes off regions of Einstein's fourfold. If Smolin and Sternglass prove to be right, there might be a Nobel prize in the offing: for surely if the Standard Model can be upgraded and now emperical parameters can be logically and emperically derived, our concept of naturewill have taken one giant, I am tempted to say quantum, leap. For these reasons, Smolin's books are a must read; if anyone is going to break ground in quantum gravity, my money (now in short supply) is on Lee Smolin.Dreams of a Final Theory: The Scientist's Search for the Ultimate Laws of NatureA Suggestion Concerning a Solution to the Riemann HypothesisBefore the Big Bang: The Origins of the Universe"},{"Title":"The Life of the Cosmos","review":"More importantly than any of the \\"natural selection through the reproduction of black holes\\", Smolin takes on the topic of why and how the forces of nature (eg. gravity) and the sizes of nature (eg. infinite space compared to the miniscule electron) are the way they we find them.

Of course, Mr. Smolin's book is more currant and updated; but much of the interest in the facts related to the formation of stars and galaxies and black holes is derived from the author's use of analagies and fascinating theories to give life to the universe. The march of a virus through large populations of people is compared to the movement of cold clouds around the galaxies to help explain the formation of stars from these cool clouds of dust and gas; and the analagy really helps enlighten the reader. For this reader, even the details of gauge fields and gravity were explained in a most interesting manner, which allowed this reader to better grasp and remember these facts.

My only problem with the book is a short passage in the chapter on philosophy and religion. Smolin takes great pains to show how the Platonic picture of an absolute reality has gotten in the way of our progress. Yet, near the end of the chapter he allows that there may be some challenging questions that leave room for &quot;mysticism.&quot; I view this as editor pressure to leave a small dash of hope for mystics.

Instead, we are smitten with a barrage of Nietszchean hammer-swinging and idol-smashing. Metaphysics?--Boom! Anthropic Principle?--Pow! Plato--Bash! The book begins well: a promise of parallel universes evolving within black-holes. But it soon degenerates into a half-baked Malthusian fantasy utterly lacking Darwinian analogues. We are to believe that universes, begot by black holes, through some inexplicable fashion reincarnate their fundamental parameters of nature at values near their parental values. So many baby universes so much like mother universes &amp; so capable of supporting sentient life-Voila! No wonder we live in the kind of universe we do. The concept is Darwinian in one sense: No mechanism of inheritance is ever proposed. Neither is any principle of selection. Just an over-populated Mathusian landscape supposedly preferable to the Anthropic Principle, itself merely the immature prelude to this wonderful idea. Fortunate us, we can now dispense with metaphysics and honor mysticism--whatever that's supposed to mean. Never mind that the mathematical interpretation of nature is metaphysics of the highest order. Never mind that Pythagoras (from whom dreaded Plato borrowed ideas such as the mathematical interpretation of Being &amp; Becoming) was a mystical geometer. Blackholes may indeed house other universes and with different fundamental constants of nature, not unlike different regions of the early universe prior to inflation. But ask yourself this: Could we, in principle, ever access these alternate black-hole universes to test anything at all?

It is as if Smolin wishes to create ideas out of thin air, instead of drawing on the work of the past. At best, such an approach is bad scholarship; at worst, I fear, it is a kind of arrogance unique to physicists, here operating once more to confuse popular culture, what I call WORLD-mongering, or the mistaken belief that only one class of intellectuals (physicists) can single-handedly explain it all."},{"Title":"The Life of the Cosmos","review":"I like very much this book, that is clearly written. Smolin offers a new step to update the &quot;status&quot; and the horizont of the theory and gives you new points of view for thinking in new ways and new hints for reflexion. Very good. For all people."},{"Title":"The Life of the Cosmos","review":"There is no question that this book is the product of an unbounded thinker of possibilities. Lee Smolin's opening description of the history and current state of theoretical physics is highly understandable and makes a more compelling (albeit unconscious) argument for Intelligent Design theory rather than his one of \\"Cosmic Natural Selection.\\" What is interesting is professor Smolin's rejection a priori of any answer lying outside the realm of human observation. He then summarily proposes to describe our universe as \\"naturally selected\\" to maximize the quantity of black holes; they of course being the \\"wombs\\" of new universes with their own black holes, etc. I have to ask, &quot;Why must they create universes; why not leprechauns or fairies, for both of which we have minimally far more observational testimony&quot;? To quote Davies &amp; Brown from their \\"Ghost in the Atom\\", the many-worlds interpretation \\"introduces a preposterous amount of \`excess metaphysical baggage' into our description of the physical world.\\" Rudolph Peierls, formerly at Oxford, dismisses such a theory with a simple question: \\"Since we have no means of seeing or ever communication with the other universes, why invent them?\\" It is easily more probable to believe that 10 space/time dimensions really do coexist than to buy into a theory composed of: an infinite number of ever expanding (non-colliding?) universes, created by some unknown mechanism, in some unknown space, for some unknown reason. Who says faith is outside the realm of science? If a new theory is truly needed now, this seems an unlikely candidate."},{"Title":"The Life of the Cosmos","review":"As I said this is NOT for physicists. And &quot;Cosmological Natural Selection&quot; is nothing but a junk. There is so much philosophy in this book.

It's convenient to have the readings broken down by date, and makes reading the Bible approachable. I had been working my way through the NIV version when I discovered that there was a Catholic version out. Since I really wanted the whole Bible, I gave away my NIV version in favor of this one. That turns out to have been a big mistake, because the &quot;Living Bible&quot; translation is horrendous! It's really not a translation at all, but a paraphrase, and an absurd one at that. Look at what they did to the first chapter of John: &quot;Before anything else existed, there was Christ, with God. He has always been alive and is himself God. He created everything there is - nothing exists that he didn't make.&quot;What happened to &quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&quot;?Swing and a miss, guys!"},{"Title":"Catholic One Year Bible","review":"OK, you want to read the Bible every day. You know you should (and if you're a Catholic, you really should, because we don't read it as much as we should!). But where to start? It's a big book, after all. This Bible starts at the beginning of the Old Testament, the beginning of the New Testament, the beginning of the Psalms, and the beginning of the Proverbs. You get the whole Bible in order, but you get a piece of the 4 parts mentioned above every day. So, you're not mired in some geneological book of the Old Testament, the way you would be if you tried to read the Bible from the first page on (the Old Testament tends to get a bit heavy sometimes!). It's a good translation -- not the best I've read (I'm pretty conservative), but very readable and not full of colloquialisms or modern slang to throw you off. It's also not as old-fashioned as the Duohey-Rheims Catholic Bible (the Catholic answer to the King James Bible), but it's also not indecipherable, the way D-R can sometimes get. I enjoy reading this Bible. It's the one I keep in my desk at work, and take on breaks."},{"Title":"Catholic One Year Bible","review":"I thoroughly enjoy my Catholic One Year Bible!

However, they are placed at the back of the book!And unfortunately, since the books are relatively short, chopping them up into 365 tiny fragments destroys any sense of continuity and meaning.This is truly a \\"back of the bus\\" treatment of the Catholic Bible. Many readers may not even realize that they have to go to a separate section (after the normal December 31st reading), and may miss the books altogether.Why this was done is an interesting question.A far better, and more honest Bible for Catholics who want to read Scripture in a simple, structured way is My Daily Catholic Bible. It has the Deutero-canonical books of the Old Testament integrated properly into the daily readings.I recommend My Daily Catholic Bible, rather than the One Year Bible, for any Catholic who actually wants to read the complete Catholic version."},{"Title":"Catholic One Year Bible","review":"I own numerous bibles and use them all.

I hope to read more books by this author, who, as a scholar of the period brings the breadth of his researches to immediacy in his writings. As Martines has steeped himself in the period, so his books breathe and encompass formal \\"religion\\" and charity, politics and political intrigues, virtue and corruption, economy (including Venice's trading and complicity in slavery) and the just plain everyday living that went on in the early 1500's. The epistolary form he uses in Loredana serves up a small taste of what he has been poring over in archives during his long, scholarly career. For those of us who thought we knew Venice from the slides shown in Art History 101, Loredana is a revelation.I didn't think the sex scenes were overdone, and they were neatly balanced with scenes of asceticism. The characters hardly knew what to think or feel, so hypocritical and stratified was their society. Loredana, especially, was well drawn, reminding of other bawdy women in literature like the Wife of Bath and Moll Flanders. I think I can say, though, that Venice is the biggest character in the book, and like all human characters, it is tortured and divided about its identity."},{"Title":"Loredana: A Venetian Tale","review":"Extremely well written novel. The reader lives the times and places of the novel, getting inside the minds of the two main characters, Loredana and Orso. The descriptions of their thoughts and feelings, specially Orso's are quite impressive. You feel so identified with them that their fate hurts. For a historian, you would expect the author to provide a vivid background for the novel, you can indeed live the life and times of Venice in in the early 16th century, but the depiction of the thoughts and feelings was quite inpressive. The description of the sexual encounters of Loredana is rather explicit, probably needed to make the reader understand her actions, but I believe that, while described with taste, they cheapen the novel. They are in brutal contrast with the high aims of Orso. But maybe such was life in Venice and she was a victim of those times.The plot is as described in the book presentation above, what it is not said is that it is a very tragic story, but one that is most likely realistic for the times. Venice rulers could be very ruthless, full of intrigue and protective of their interests. The novel describes very ably the repression and the struggle between the classes.Recommended for buffs of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Loredana: A Venetian Tale","review":"Lauro Martines is a socialistic historian. His works hold to the Marxist \\"class warfare\\" theory of history and Loredana is a variation on this theme. It features explicit sexual scenes, what Martines see's as the oppression of women and of the \\"proletariat\\" by evil, white, upper class, Venetian males. I'm not panning the book, if you are coming from this point of view or if you enjoy these themes, then this might be the book for you. However, I do think that buyers should be aware of this philosophical background before purchasing."},{"Title":"Love Crucified Arose: A Comprehensive Treasury of Choral Music, Music of Scripts and Service Music for the Easter Season","review":"I was searching for the title song, \\"Love Crucified Arose\\" and found this book arranged for choir.

An excellent book for reading and ongoing reference if you're serious about the commodities markets."},{"Title":"A Complete Guide To the Futures Markets: Fundamental Analysis, Technical Analysis, Trading, Spreads, and Options","review":"An old Chinese Proverb states that a mind all logic is like a knife all blade. (In other words, tough to grasp.) Schwager, an extremely intelligent and successful analyst, is something of a quant... the type of individual who enjoys crunching long series of numbers, sifting through data with a fine toothed comb, and finding hidden statistical correlations for their own sake. His writing style reflects this mindset.While informative overall, Schwager at times tackles subjects of mind-numbing complexity and strays into the realm of the pedantic. (His example of how to fundamentally analyze the hog market is such a case.) I was amazed at the level of esoterica delved into in certain places in this book. After reading this book early on (a trader interviewed in Market Wizards recommended it highly), I was worried that I might have to learn some high level calculus if I were going to be a successful trader. (Don't worry, that's not the case.)One of the things the successful trader has to do is learn to separate valuable information from noise, wheat from chaff. If you try to read every report and analyze every detail you come across, you will freeze like a deer in the headlights... or otherwise find yourself buried by an information avalanche.My overall impression is that Schwager approaches markets the way a mathematics professor would approach a particularly thorny problem: with logic, rigor and a visible lack of passion. His strengths are in crunching the numbers and laying out basic facts and theories with precision and clarity. His weakness, and thus the weakness of this book in my opinion, is in poorly communicating the psychological and emotional elements of trading.This is not to say the book has no value. It is packed with information, and also points out a number of the fallacies committed by traders (skilled and unskilled alike). It is a good reference book to have, something like an abridged encyclopedia of trading, one that can be referred to many times over to brush up on the finer points of a certain strategy or technical method.I recommend this book for those seeking quantitative knowledge of the futures markets and mathematical breakdowns of the strategies. But if you buy and read this book, be aware that not all traders are so statistical and professor-like in their analysis.Schwager humbly admits that he is not a good trader himself. I suspect this is because he tries to hide behind rigorous analysis rather than dealing with his emotions and psychology directly, and this book reflects some of that attempt. In conclusion I would say that this is an excellent reference guide, but cannot agree that it is \\"complete\\" because it glosses over the critical psychological and emotional elements."},{"Title":"A Complete Guide To the Futures Markets: Fundamental Analysis, Technical Analysis, Trading, Spreads, and Options","review":"Schwager is the starting point for any serious reading on futures and options trading. Disregard comments below on its being to quantitative. No, you don't need a Ph.D. in math nor high school calculus (there isn't a single integral or differential equation in the whole book). You should have a starting basis in statistics as well as some pre-existing intuition about markets.It is well-written and clear,and truly encyclopedic in scope : every conceivable options trade, with all permutations thereof, is discussed and dissected, even inadvisable ones (they too are informative). A classic book whose age (mine is copyright 1984!) testifies to its enduring worth.

The traget readers are traders who use lots of Mathematics and Statistics.The experience of Schwager helped me a lot. He said he was good in analysis but not trading. Many people, including me, thought Mathematics, Statistics and Economics were essential for good trading. So they went to college, studied hard, got a degree and hope they could make money in the market. This simply never happen! Otherwise everyone should got a PhD before trading. You still need to develop a method or system. But what is vital is to control your ego. Admit mistakes quickly.

I can't even say what caught my eye about it. After reading it, however, I heartily recommend the book.The story starts with an amnesiac detective in the mid-19th century in London. As he returns to duty, he needs to rediscover himself as much as he needs to solve the case that he is assigned. I particularly enjoyed the idea that Monk, the protagonist, didn't like his old self that much (even though I don't think amnesia would change a person's basic traits). In any case, the Crimean War background, along with fine writing, make this historical mystery stand out. I plan to read other Monk novels after giving myself a short break.I think this book will mainly appeal to two types of readers: first, hardcore mystery readers will enjoy the twists and turns of a traditional &quot;let's gather in the library so I can tell you who did it&quot; mystery; second, readers of historical fiction will enjoy, as I did, the gas-lit streets of London, the withdrawing rooms, and the spiritual depression of the British following the catastrophe that was the Crimean War.All in all, this is a quick read that combines an interesting plot with high quality writing."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"The mistake Perry made in her Pitt series was developing her characters too quickly--she has had to compensate by introducing a rather large cast of supporting characters. This, the first in her William Monk series, avoids that gaffe by inducing amnesia in her hero--he hardly knows who he is or what he's about. It may be preposterous, but it's also an enjoyable read and an outstanding mystery.The story has Monk attempting to learn the set of circumstances that resulted in his hospitalization and amnesia--he must face the horrifying possibility that he was involved in a vicious crime, and he knows too little of himself to trust that he was incapable of such a deed. He learns through the reactions of others that he was (is?) not a nice man, and the more he learns, the more he doubts himself. The fact that his past does not come flooding back to him after another bump on the head speaks well to Perry's prowess as a writer.Hester Latterly and Oliver Rathbone are the edgy counterparts to Monk's dark personality. Though never friends, these three circle each other with wary respect. Monk himself is an appealing character, the mystery is top-notch, and the Victorian setting is quintessential Perry--she has made it uniquely her own."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"William Monk awakens in a Victorian-era London hospital with amnesia. Over the course of this book, he returns to his job as a policeman, hoping that work will help him regain his memory as well as his detecting skills. What's fascinating is that not all he discovers about his life before the accident is flattering--including the fact that he may very well have been responsible for a serious crime. Over the course of Perry's new series--this book being the debut--Monk's past will at various times haunt, delight, and maybe even endanger him, and the people who come to be his allies don't always like him, but their loyalties to one another shine through. As with the Pitt mysteries, Anne Perry's trademark detail and eye-opening descriptions of what Victorian life was really like make this an entertaining way to read away a winter afternoon"},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"I have read 3 or 4 William Monk books, but didn't pay any attention to order. I have really enjoyed them, so I thought I would start at the first and read them all in order. Now I more clearly understand about Monk's amnesia. It was really fun learning about Monk's 1st meeting with Hester Latterly. Great ending, although I felt very sympathetic to the killer. I love Anne Perry's books. Next, I'll probably read the Thomas Pitt novels in order."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"In this book, William Monk wakes in a hospital in Victorian London with no memory of who he is or even what he looks like. This devastatingly frightening condition is no match for Monk though; his deep-seated instincts, which made him a formidable police detective (as he learns is his profession), lead him to slowly figure out, little by little, who he is and allow him solve a brutal murder.Anne Perry provides a good mystery with a twist. I really liked the way she provided insight into Monk's thought process, fear and confusion while trying to discover all he can about himself.I gave this book four stars instead of five only because I guessed ahead of time a significant plot point; however, this book is still a four star novel because I was surprised by the ending and was very impressed and fascinated by the way Perry introduces her characters, lets us get one impression of each, and then provides more in-depth information and personality development.This book will pull you right in!"},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"Even though the first few chapters seemed a bit slow for my taste, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The personal problem of William Monk is different from most main characters in other books. The reader is getting to know him as he, too, is getting to know himself. I was surprised at the end of chapter 10 when he remembered something about himself, and for those who have read this book will know why. John Evan and Hester Latterly are other characters I liked, and I'm glad to hear they are in the other books. I didn't care too much for Hester's &quot;flashbacks&quot; from the war, but then at the end I was thankful there was a reason for them. I will definitely read the next book, A Dangerous Mourning, despite some of the bad reviews written about it."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"Yes, it's that vital. I picture the Timothy Dalton circa BBC's \\"Jane Eyre\\" to be very similar to the wolfish, well-dressed, passionate William Monk. Once you get to know him (despite his memory loss) you'll care very much about his character in subsequent novels. He's definitely a unique character in mystery fiction. This novel features a decent mystery, but serves mostly to introduce us to a completely different set of characters, and indeed a different time period than the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt novels. You'll like Hester Latterly, who reminds me of Emma Thompson. She nursed the wounded in the horrific battlegrounds of the Crimea, and is full of righteous indignation about hospital reform. Oliver Rathbone is a surprisingly moral barrister who takes a shine to Hester immediately, unlike Monk who keeps trying to convince himself that she is NOT his type. (Methinks he doth protest too much...) Dive on in and get ready for a steady series of interesting mysteries and even better courtroom scenes. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"I went through the Pitt series first and picked up the Monk series with some trepidation...after twenty-odd books the Pitts were all beginning to look alike. I was pleasantly surprised by &quot;The Face of a Stranger&quot; and the Monk series remains one of my favorites.Actually, it *is* possible to incur brain injury erasing memory but not touching your skills. We learned in class here at university about that, as they involve two separate areas of the brain. There are folks that can't remember yesterday but can still beautifully play the piano, perform surgery, etc.True, some of Monk's amnesia is a bit selective, but this is a work of fiction and thus does entail inclusion of some possibly not-perfectly-realistic elements.Monk's a great character, if not one easy to like. Flawed and all-too-human, it's also fun to watch his development through later books, so don't give up on him after &quot;Face&quot;. Thomas Pitt was a *little* too perfect for my taste, so I rather like the darker character Monk presents. It's also a relief that Monk does not spontaneously recover his memory in a common author's cop-out. Also, Hester Latterly's the perfect foil for him, and their clashes are always amusing to read in each book, right from that first meeting in the countryside.The mystery itself is interesting, and I noted that Ms. Perry once said that she intended for this to be a one-time book and not a series, intending to have Monk be the killer. I'm very glad she decided not to abandon him, even if he needs a good reality check at times. Not the absolute best of the Monk series, but a spirited and promising beginning to a great series."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"Inspector Monk is one of the most riveting figures you will ever come across in Victorian mysteries. Initially, I was not sure that I would like this Anne Perry series because of the initial premise (Monk has had an accident and cannot remember his own identity or anything about his past life) nor was I sure I would like a series without Charlotte Ellison Pitt! I was drawn in immediately by Perry's amazing ability to explore the secrets that can reside within the most seemingly secure and blameless households.The Inspector Monk novels (of which this is the first) are darker and more gritty than the Pitt novels. There are few veils between the cruel and dangerous world of mid-century London and the reader, which gives the novels a faster pace and often more complicated plots. While some readers have taken issue with the amnesiatic Inspector Monk, I feel that his lack of awareness about his own past is a metaphor for the blindness his social betters are willing inflict upon themselves in order to keep up appearances. Monk's desire to KNOW, however, provides an interesting point of comparison with the people he must investigate who seem not to want to know anything at all that will make their lives unpleasant.I have spoken more about character than plot in this review, and that is largely because Anne Perry's mysteries seem to me to pivot on their protagonists's characters. The plot of this novel, and the mysteries at the center of it, do not disappoint any more than the characters. As Monk tries to untangle his own personal mysteries, he is expected to get to the bottom of a mystery that involves death, financial ruin, and the closely-guarded secrets of some very proper families."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"Amnesia has probably occured in fiction more often than in fact. But rarely has it been handled better than is in this fascinating mystery, The Face of a Stranger. Imagine waking up not knowing who you are. Imagine having to pretend you haven't lost your memory because acknowledging it would mean the end of your job and probable poverty. Perry explores this fascinating territory in the character of William Monk, working class Victorian detective.The characters are probably the strongest part of this novel. Monk is most interesting as snatches of his past are revealed to him -- not all of which are pleasant. Hester Latterly is introduced as the veteran of Crimean War nursing (think Florence Nightengale). Even the circle of friends and acquaintences of the victim span a variety of circumstances. The Crimean War also plays a significant role as England struggles to come to terms with its lost sons and prestige.The unraveling of the mystery works quite well with an appropriate number of informative red herrings.All things considered, a dandy read. The book is a bit on the dark and bleak side, but nothing so depressing that you wouldn't want it for a vacation read. I look forward to learning more about Monk in the next book in the series, A Dangerous Mourning."},{"Title":"The Face of a Stranger","review":"I'm not a fan of every Anne Perry series, and but these books featuring William Monk are chewy-chunky delicious. This is the first in the series. Set in mid-nineteenth century London and featuring a police detective who has lost his memory in an accident, they are studies of the inequities of the past and the horrors of Victorian England, wonderfully character-dense, and intricate mysteries. Almost all of them end with a dramatic trial with lots of intrigue and machinations. Therein lies a strength and something of a weakness, as the trials are enthralling, but sometimes (in some of the books) seem over-long to me.In this first book, fresh from the accident and memory loss, William Monk tries to cover up the fact that he doesn't know who he is or anything about his life. If he loses his job as police inspector, he could well end up in the poor house, a Victorian horror. So he tries to piece together who he is at the same time he tries to solve a murder. The more he finds out about the man he's been, the less he likes himself, and as he gets closer to the resolution of the mystery, he fears he himself may be the prime suspect."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],M={key:0},H={key:1};function E(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",W,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",H,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",M,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const L=d(B,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-b4039135"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/66.md","filePath":"quotesmag/66.md"}'),G={name:"quotesmag/66.md"},O=Object.assign(G,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(L)]))}});export{j as __pageData,O as default};
