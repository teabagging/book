The character development is such that you become immediately invested. Only the second book I've read that actually made me cry. The first was Bridges of Madison County. For a horror/sci-fi story...that IS something.It's a long book but I regretted finishing it because I was so caught up in it!King wrote this by hand while recovering from his accident and the depth of the novel must come from his experience. From what I have read, the movie can't capture that depth.I strongly recommend reading the novel before the movie...or if you've already seen the movie, still read the book...either way just read the book!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The new Stephen King novel has not only the horror, suspence and overall nailbiting one would expect from a typical King book, in addition to the above it also has humour. More than once at the beginning of this book I found myself chuckling out loud. As is King's style however, my chuckles turned to horror as the true nature of the humouress 'moments' were exposed.King captures us up into his 'Dreamcatcher' and leaves us with more than one sleepless night. A must read book. One that King fans surely should not miss!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"As a first time Stephen King reader, I bought this book mainly for two reasons: to see if the hype surrounding his books was justified and to finally be someone who could say &quot;the book was better than the movie&quot;. I'm happy to say that this huge page-turner achieved both purposes.King's tale about four childhood friends with an unusual connection is well written, suspenseful and often humorous. The narrative successfully skips between the men's childhood and their untimely fate, while throwing in enough pieces of the puzzle to keep the uncertain reader wanting more. The result is both a terrifying and heartwarming story, completely believable in the town that King has etched out.Perhaps the only slow parts of the novel, in my opinion, occur when the efforts of the military team used to combat the aliens is described. Amidst the long descriptions, two major characters still manage to shine - sadistic Colonel Kurtz (how's that for literary allusion?) and his once loyal Captain Underhill. Their roles in the novel lead to a climax that will keep you up at night, desperate to finish the book.Although this was my first Stephen King book, I'm almost certain that it will not be my last if all of his novels are as long, but fast-paced as \\"Dreamcatcher\\". Please do yourself a favor: skip the movie and read the book. I had a hard time justifying to friends that the book was so much better in comparison and that the entire ending of the movie was completely fabricated and meaningless. For roughly half the price of the movie ticket, I was more thoroughly entertained reading Stephen King's \\"Dreamcatcher\\"."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I'm a long time King fan. I've read most of his early stuff, but not much in the last few years. When Dreamcatcher was released and made into a movie, I thought I would give it a shot. IMHO, it's not the equal of King's earlier works. When I read a novel, I read for pleasure, so I read every word. At times I found myself scanning paragraphs and occasionally, entire pages, just to get through them. Overall, I enjoyed the story, but I can only recommend this book to hard core King fans."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Heeeyahh!!!! That's what i felt as I read this book. It's light. No great moral or message, but fun. And what's wrong with that? King has the ability in inject wicked emotion with abstact imagination and there are scenes in the Dreamcatcher that rank with his best: the escapade of the eggman, the bacon fest (ew!), and Jonesy's veiwing of Sympathy for the Grayboys; they reminded me of the Trash Can Man's trip to Vegas with the Kid--roaring with freaks and fun. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I say the preview for the movie last month and had to read the book. What a dissapointment. I was hoping for a good sci-fi book that at least explained something about the aliens in the book. King tunes out in the worst way in trying to explain where these creatures come from and why they come to earth. There are logical flaws so huge that really take away from the otherwise fine writing. You are left with an empty feeling at the end. Those who want to read the book for King's writing, go ahead, but those who like sci-fi, avoid like the plague."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book is not King at his absolute best like &quot;The Talisman&quot;, &quot;Carrie&quot;, &quot;Desperation&quot;. The plot is tightly woven as always, stays on the psychotic and narrow, like always, but there's something there that teases the reader. In this novel, King writes like a tired, exhausted writer, barely able to fashion the tip of his pencil into writing a word. Some of the passages seemed forced, like King was prying them out of his head with a dessert spoon! It just seemed remarkably unbelievable. This isn't new for King, but when a homicidal car started terrorizing people (&quot;Christine&quot;), I was a afraid of my Crown Vic's seatbelt, because he made me believe it. But with &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;, he failed."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"When I read Dreamcatcher, I was so excited to find that it was more in his old style, a style that made me begin reading his books so many years ago. It seemed that in a few previous books, King seemed to be losing what had always made his stories so enjoyable. I read this book as quickly as I did The Stand and It and will continue waiting patiently for more."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"King returns to familiar territory here, \\"Dead Zone\\" meets \\"Tommyknockers\\" meets \\"The Body.\\" Still, though it lacks the relentless pulp drive of Harry Shannon's \\"Night of the Beast\\" it's worth grabbing for entertainment. Curious to see what the film will be like? So am I. Great cast with Morgan Freeman et. al. and like \\"Green Mile\\" it will probably beat the book for a change, instead of the other way around."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King must have a fondness in his heart for boyhood friendships and mentally challenged individuals. It is nice to see one such challenged person in the pivitol role. For with out such a character like &quot;the Dudds&quot;, Dreamcatcher couldn't possibly exist.Stephen King takes his twist on the H.G. Wells classic and gives it new life. He makes an already creepy story a lot more scarier, using the old story line and adding his own brand of horror and prose. Although the idea for the book isn't original..this particular version is all King. It is the kind of book that you look back on after having finished it saying, &quot;Man, I'd like to read that again!&quot;I admitt, I did get lost in some parts of the book...some of it is rather confusing. But, like all his work..at points you can get rather lost, but eventually Mr. King will always point you in the right direction later on down the road. There are over-the-top characters, down-to-earth characters, and, of course, not-of-this world characters. Who is the bad guy? Who is the good guy? All of the characters are quite unique, but yet they are all interwoven into such a dynamic that they work together like a well oiled machine.There are parts of this book that are genuinely scary to the point of giving you nightmares. The visuals are extremely well laid out, it's like watching a movie at times rather than reading a book. I recommend this one to all fans of King and to all those who loved the original War Of The Worlds."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"It's regrettable the prissy conventionality of aging provincial college grad's cloak their animus at the indifference their met with in the arts as a book review. The more cosmopolitan readers of Mr. King may be excused a certain malice at seeing such preening intellectualism isolated and effectless."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"After 30 years of writing, I guess Stephen's ideas are gone? &quot;Hole in the Wall?&quot; What is this... Sound's like Stephen wants to write westerns now! For a fresh taste in modern horror, I would suggest the new author Mark Ventimiglia.Mark is possibly the BEST KEPT SECRET OF MODERN HORROR FICTION! His imagination is gripping and his imagery, vivid! There are many stories in his book (THE RESIDENCE) that defy reality! There is a tale of a ring that eats its owners fingers; a story about a house that is possessed by a spirit of cockroaches and it makes a father whig out and slaughter his family using only sandpaper and a wire brush, there is an awsome Lovecraftian type of tale that vividly shows an innsmouth transformation, and a story about a declawed housecat that extracts vengence on its owner for declawing her. There are many other stories here too, and some poetry, as well as cool art work. What this author was thinking when he wrote these pieces is anyones guess! FANTASTIC!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Predictable, boring, and above all STUPID. I love sci-fi horror even bad sci-fi horror. But let's get real. This is an unconvincing book that is a complete waste of time. The characters are predictable and stupid. After 15 minutes I found myself wanting to put the book down but had to read on (my bad). I found myself wondering who really wrote this? If it was King I was sure he must have alzheimers because he sure forgot how to write. The movie is even worse!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"He did it again, or should I say &quot;Duddits&quot; again. That book wasawesome--especially toward the end. In the end part, he wrangles with many philosophical concepts, and portrays the self-doubts that sometimes are the only source of weakness. He was spot-on about the nature of evil and its power over you. Evil has no power over truth, because evil is lesser than truth. Fear, the fist of the devil, only has an impact if you do not have an ocean of truth to draw on for strength. Lies get their power only where we have failed to move toward and find greater truths--half-truths are the worst lies becausethey feel right, and get access to your heart (I have said this long before ever reading Stephens FINE book).The great truths Stephen touches on in his books give them a timeless aspect that has a lot to do with their impact. If you have greater truth in your heart, only then can you be truly free--the evil that comes to enslave you with half-truths evaporates like a disintegrating vampire burning away in the quiet, powerful light of day. The sun leaves at night, but what we learn by day gives us fire and electricity in the darkest night. We must see that there is a greater truth we can learn which makes the sun within us, that center of meaning built by truth, as our eternal sun. There is the light that never goes out, and the sun itself pales in comparison like a picturepales in comparison to the real thing.The universe is a learning machine for us to come into being. It ismother and school. Those who are not motivated to learn itssecrets--the secrets of time space and matter and all of its symbolic meaning, will not be. When a half truth is cherished, evil finds a pumping heart to spread its destruction like cancer. When a man soars to that place in the universe of truth, the well of meaning and source of being, nothing is barred to him. He is a child of the universe, and the vast, complex universe is not an overwhelming thing. The universe was made for him, and is a part of his own dreams.The universe has that haunting familiarity of dreams which is beyond the specific things we see. Even the math and sciences of it, the history of it.The universe is coherent, and we discover that coherence in our language, history, art, math, astronomy, philosophy, and science. Evil is always a lesser thing. Evil and fear are the shell of our own egg which we make to test ourselves. I sometimes think we are born alone and want to feel what it is like to have fear, to grow, to face adversity. Challenges are opportunities for learning and growth. My fears, I have found, no matter how large or complex, never seem to stick. They come in, and I see that their only power was stolen from a higher place, a higher truth. God must have given me a special life and place to do this, maybe some mutation, I don't know. You and I are of the same universe, and this path is the one path of all life--toward truth.Stephen Kings books to me are great symbolic allegories--interwoven with all the battles and demons life itself faces in the struggle towards being born into truth out of the darkness--my old friend(from the book). Truth is the life force, darkness the labyrinth, the parts of truth found in the labyrinth light the way like the stars at night to a ships captain. Truth is a dangerous game, a real labyrinth like the one in that Marines commercial with the fire and traps and monsters. If you stop you die just as if you never even tried. To me, labyrinths seem all-or-nothing affairs. To have a chance, you need tolearn and move. Imagination is more important than knowledge, because only there will you find the infinite possibility, the things that spring into being because they are needed or beautiful (same thing really). There is where you forge the great living mobile thing that becomes truth in its highest form. That becomes real, becomes reality.Here's a free poem I just wrote:The symbols around me dance and sway, the engine of truth has come to play. The mountains tell stories for those that would hear, the eyes see the sounds that God painted here. I have sympathy for the devil that uncomplete thing, but I do not answer when it gives me a ring. My carpet is magic and woven from steel, there are no threads to pull to make it unreal. Darkness is not something I ever would see, I carry asea of light, my soul, me.But that is just words, don't get locked into the threads. The poetry of reality is where we really live and words can never truly see or capture the essence of that beautiful crystalline maelstrom of spacetime that has become our cathedral, our home... Symbols are not, and do not work exactly like, reality. They are our stairway to heaven, and their construction the acts of God. Meaning always comes from us. Words do not know anything. They are an echo of the unity that made them. Our hands do not know, but they do what we know. God is writing the poem of reality. Stephen King helps us all to see that.THAT is the purpose of life, and God certainly loves the flatteryStephen gives him in his works. The admiration of a father for his son, I'm sure. If you love something, you cannot hide that. It comes through. God called, and Stephen always picks up the phone... even when he is in great pain.Pain is truly nothing--the winds blowing through an old mansion whose windows long since broke. Echoes from our past of vestigal limbs and the cycles of the body. Like any symbol, bodily pain isinformation--powerfully compelling information. But compared toreality as it truly is, it is part of the hum of the city and nothing more. Spiritual pain is the only real pain, and it is caused by lies, doubts, guilts, and fears. Stephen King helps to lift us from this old house of pain back into the future of light, truth, and glory. A dream catcher is a great symbol, a divine symbol even. I always liked those. Those who do not grow will die, because growth is moving toward God, toward greater personal and universal insight. You reach a pointeventually where this all begins to gain a momentum of its own and comes regardless of obstacles. You become an engine of truth yourself.um, yes, I like his books. Especially this one."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I much anticipated this book but am disappointed. I hope that Stephen King hasn't lost his touch! I am a fan of his work and must say that &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is my least favorite. The story line had potential but it felt rushed and didn't concentrate on the entertaining aspect of this work. I found myself rushing through this book to go onto the next."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Unlike other fans I really liked Bag of Bones and Heart of Atlantis. King found a new way to tell his stories, a more personal and authentic way - and the language really worked like a fine clockwork from Switzerland. &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is a step back. In many respects it is an old fashioned book, with characters (like Kurtz) who would fit into a 70s film about civil war in Latin America but are not convincing in the year 2001 and reusing ideas he employed before. The people lose their teeth and are able to read others' minds as in &quot;Tommyknockers&quot;. Again we have a gang of children fighting against the bad boys who are still friends in middle age as in &quot;IT&quot;. But in the earlier books it worked; it was full of life, gripping and full of inspiration. Now I had the feeling that King had to finish a book without having any new ideas. I can't understand that people say he is back on his best form in this particular novel. The horror in the book doesn't work either; just some images of splattering bodies without the atmosphere which is so distinctive in his earlier work. In &quot;Pet Semetary, for example, one had the feeling how it must be if a loved one is stolen by a terrifying power. The same strong atmosphere is likewise present in the first chapter of &quot;IT&quot; and in the gruesome Marden House of &quot;Salems Lot&quot;. To sum up, the loss of amtmosphere, combined with the sometimes rather cheap characters and the lack of new ideas made it impossible for me to finish the book. I'm not an old fan, I'm a new one (and still I am), but I do think King should continue the path he chose in his most recent books and should not try to rewrite the old stories."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is the first book I have read of Stephen King.If it weren't a necessity for me to read this book for a class I don't imagine ever picking it up and reading it. Im not very fond of science Fiction, however it is still intresting. This book is based on 4 good friends who grew up to have special powers given in each of them. Later on they find out these powers were given for a reason. They go through a Journey in fighting the evil alien and cancerous infection that is being spread to the world. Do they all succeed or not? That is for me to know and you to read and find out."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book was a fine creation by one of the best writers I have experienced. It melds the fields of ... oops, I almost gave away much of the story line. What I can say is that the book is a vivid description of events just outside of plausibility yet within the realms of believability. King is the master at painting haunting images with his words and creativity."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am a Stephen King-a-holic. I buy everything as soon as it comes out... Even though there are few characters, I had trouble keeping up with them. Duddits speech patterns were annoying because I could never figure them out unless King translated. This is the only King book that I skipped over boring parts and had trouble reading to the end. I usually finish a good King book in a day or two but this took me a week because it wasn't good. I miss vintage King (The Stand, Salems Lot) those were good books. This one unfortunately, is not."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen king may have outlined the plot but it was not written totally by him. One of the \\"ghost writers\\" was English.I read the book but I am getting increasingly bored with the mass produced stuff. Tom Clancey is doing the same thing. Supervising, not WRITING!What does \\"fag\\" mean in Stephen King's own language?..Who in the US Army would say \\"fag\\" and why?plus there are gramatical errors that are indicative of a northern england person."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Too bad it's over 600. This book becomes the most monotonous of Stephen King's career. I have read all of his novels, and this is one of his worst. The only thing that saves it from being THEE is the first 200 pages, which are gory, over-the-top fun. The characters are developed fairly well in the first 200 pages, and then go no where. The character of Kurtz is the ultimate clich&eacute;, and having him sucking up a large part of the last 200 pages was a BIG mistake. The extended chase at the end is tedious, not at all frightening, and turns a novel that started out excellent into a near disaster."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dream Catcher is the first of Stephen King's novels that I've read, but I'm resolved to read more after this experience. The book absolutely grips the reader's attention and forces the reader to pay exclusive attention to what is going on. Never boring or excessive, every line is essential to the vivid picture King creates. Being an avid reader, I've read quite a number of books over the years, among many different genres, but never has a book scared me the way this one did. In many different parts of the story, I found my heart racing along with the characters. An excellent piece of work, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The book Dreamcatcher, by Stephen King, deals with the mind more than any physical trait. Even so, the plot jumps from place to place and left my head spinning. And man, some of the concepts that are stated in this book I have never heard of before. I couldn't really keep up with all of this and had trouble figuring out what was going on. Like the weasel like creature, I would have never thought of that in a million years. Stephen King has a great mind and putes it to use in this book."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I have just recently gottin into Stephen King books f*ck and me freddy if this isnt an amazing book. This book adds some horror, comedy, disgusting features, gruesome storie line, grotesque characters... but I wouldn't want it any other way.This book is about an alien invasion. It all starts when the life long friends go on the hunting trip they take every year to &quot;Hole In the Wall&quot;, their cabin. Many Years ago when they were kids they all met somebody. Not just any normal person. This person changed their lifes forever. I'm no gonna spoil it for ya so im not gonna say anything about him.Once they get to &quot;Hole In the Wall,&quot; characters being Henry, Pete, the Beav, and Jonesy, They start doin wat they came to do, huntin and drinkin beer all day. Henry and Pete go out to get beer why'll Jonsey and the Beav go huntin. Jonesy Ends up seein a great buck. Perfect shot. Finger on the trigger when he realizes he was mistaken for a man. Jonesey then takes the man, who has been wondering for three days, to &quot;Hole In the Wall&quot; Beav then gets home and the man they picked up starts creating monsterous farts. Let's leave it at that.Pete and Henry, on there way home from the store, fly off the edge of the road in their scout after seeing a woman in the road. Pete locks up his leg and makes it hard to walk. They start seeing lights in the sky that seem to dance around. Henry head back to &quot;Hole In the Wall&quot; while Pete stays behind, after making the long trip back to the scout to get beer. I'm not gonna spoil wat happens to Pete but Henry soon gets captured by Kurtz, an evil government official who is bent on killing all the innocent civilians carrying an alien infestation or byrus (fungus like stuff that starts appearing in open wounds.)Jonesy then gets taken over by the head alien Mr. Gray who is trying to get to the water supply to realease the infection destroying the world. Owen Underhill is a man that defies Kurtz and sets off with Henry to save the planet from Mr. Gray. Kurtz then chases after them.I hope I left you with so many cliff hangers that you will go out and by this amazing book. I'm sure youll love it and it will give you a long read. So go by it right now. Why you sittin here readin this? Go buy it. Stay fresh and peace out ya'll"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I listened the CD version of this book. There are 20 CDs read by DeMunn! This is the longest story I've ever heard. I went through most of them on the road between Kansas City and St Louis. Though the reader may have to go back and forth in time with the development of the story, it's still manageble and will feel relaxed if heard from DeMunn, one of King's best storytelling, 'an actor of great skill and subtlety who knows that less is more especially when it comes to this book's ample blood, horror and ferocious little aliens'."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book is at once scary,sad,disguisting and disturbing.A true King production.The only thig scary about the movie however is how awful it is."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"It has been a while since I read a book that I couldn't put down and Dreamcatcher certainly grabbed my attention.

Hmph.I give this book 4 stars, because it is--simply--a good read. However, it really fizzes out in the end.The style is brilliant, back and forth; just when you get into a particular event, and can't wait to turn the page, it ends, and a new event unfolds. Each chapter consistantly refer's to prior, current, and future happenings. This really shows his talent, and keeps the pages turning. Somehow he seems to lose this in the end, leading to a less than hoped for ending.A must read for all die-hard King fans, and a pretty good read for everyone else."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. This is my first Stephen King book and I was very impressed (after watching the movie The Stand, you would get worried to). I bought it over Spring Break and read it in less then 3 weeks, and that says a lot because I am an incredibly slow reader. Now, to the story. It starts out with about 30 pages of exposition, getting you to know and like the characters in the story--Pete, Henry, Beaver and Jonesy, all of which haver quite a few problems. The four of them get together every year to go hunting at Beaver's cabin. But then one day Jonesy gets hit by a car. Despite this, they go to the cabin anyways, just the four of them. Henry and Pete go to get food, and Jonesy and Beaver stay at the cabin. Due to his leg, Jonesy stays in a loft in a tree. He thinks he see's a dear and nearly shoots it when he realizes it is a person, then the story explodes. This is a must read that I recommend to anybody."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"As a constant reader of Mr.King,I was at first dissappointed at the news and rumors when the book first came out that he repeated himself.As a result, before reading Dreamcatcher,I read his a couple of previous novels and plus From a Buick 8.When I got The Dreamcatcher I was already more than 2 years late to read it.What a shame as a constant reader!The Dreamcatcer is one of his best work along with the It,The Shining and The Stand.It will suprise you at many ways and times thruought the book.His description of snowy and cold weather is perfect too.You will love it.I hope and pray he never quits to write."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am a dedicated Stephen King fan, and I will continue to read his works even after reading this lackluster, disappointment of a novel. Despite my love for King's work, I found this book to be a giant letdown. Just as everyone says about this book, it IS a lousy combination of many great King novels. It's X-Files meets It meets Tommyknockers, without any of the excitement. I had to give it 2 stars, because King writes well as usual, but the plot and the actual story stink. I found myself not caring if the characters lived or died, and instead, simply hoping that the book would end soon. Unless you're a dedicated fan, don't waste your time with this, the worst novel in the King catalog."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I enjoyed this book, maybe not his best, but good nontheless. I find a lot of his books are hard to get into, but after a while you find yourself into the story and enjoying every minute. He seems to take a while &quot;preparing&quot; the story.

This is one of those books where you really don't know if good or evil is going to win.I felt the characters were fun with all their vices and problems.One of the villians was a cliched evil man from every other cliched evil-man story, but most of the people were interesting, even when limited to a very short part of the story.The story does jump around a bit, but I never lost track of what was going on (I think that there were times were I was confused, but going straight ahead brought things back together for me.)The classic good vs. evil, with good as the underdog, has always captured me and this was one of those stories. The good people having only their wits and strong, special bond of friendship to use against the tremendously capable and equipped forces of evil.While not a deep story, it is a straightforward swashbuckler of sci-fi adventure involving the everyman hero.Bacon!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Anything the guy writes appeals to me but this one just didn't seem to hold together. A lot of good ideas but none explored or exploited the way it could have been. Really a mish-mash in which King, himself, doesn't seem to know where the story is headed or why.

MIGHT BE WORTH A FIVE STARS !..."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Four childhood friends must save the Earth from the deadly plague alien invaders plan to spread through our drinking water. Mr. King takes this premise and runs with it, giving us a novel that resembles some of his earlier work such as It and The Tommyknockers. At times this book is riveting, just as some of his very early stories like Salems Lot and The Dead Zone were. At times it is bloated and boring. The chase that dominates the middle of the book drags on and on and on. And the ending, at least for me, was not easily understandable. The way in which the alien was bested left me disappointed. I've felt for a while that many of King's later works really need a good editing. Read Salem's Lot for a good, tight, scary story.And yet, and yet.... No one can draw me into a story like Stephen King. Even with my complaints I'd rather read him than almost anyone else. And it was good to see him writing good old fashioned horror again, the kind that grabs you by the throat and makes you afraid to turn off the lights. Perhaps not as good as Salem's Lot (but then, what is?) but still a good read."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"different from any other king novels, a real &quot;page turner&quot;"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I have been a fan of Stephen King's works for over 20 years, and have read pretty much everything he's published. Most of his work is engrossing, fascinating, and hard to put down (most notably The Bachman Books, Cujo, Different Seasons, and Hearts in Atlantis). ~~ I was looking forward to checking out his latest effort and I was greatly disappointed. The novel drags on and on in a very disorganized and boring series of events. The best parts are the flashbacks to the group of 4 boys and their special friend Duddits as children. King writes convincingly and honestly about growing up as a boy in Maine in several of his books, and this one is refreshing and realistic in those episodes. ~~ The &quot;present day&quot; front story, full of strange alien fungus and wanna-be &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; style military escapades is just tired and sad. I had a tough time plodding through this book, when normally I literally can't put a King novel down. I hope this post-accident work is just a fluke and not indicative of a new direction for King."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Once again in Dreamcatcher King has delivered the literary equivalent of 5 pounds of horse manure in a ten pound bag. I used to love reading King but his last 5 books have proven to be a great disappointment. He ought to give some of his royalties from this book to the Estate of Richard Laymon from whom he \\"borrowed\\" the evil aliens from. Does King even have an editor thsese days?

This story combines King's fascination with disease and bodily functions (ala the &quot;shit-weasels&quot;),which will give anyone the creeps, with an alien visitor scenario similar to Tommyknockers. The tale takes a unique course with the inclusion of telepathic abilities shared between four friends and a fifth friend afflicted with Downs Syndrome (Duddits.) It is their unique abilities that allow them to prevent the assimilation of the alien creatures into the human population...with about 20 seconds to spare!One facet of the novel which King handles particularly well is the deep relationship between the male friends. Men are typically protrayed as unnurturing by the media, but King successfullly conveyed the love the four friends had for Duddits without going &quot;over the top.&quot;If you've read King in the past, you'll love Dreamcatcher as much as any other. If you haven't tried one of Stephen's books yet (is there anyone in this category?) then this is a great place to start!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Well, compared to other Stephen King books this is between his worsts. But compared to other books this is a fair read. It's a bit long, you have to read to much and it's not that good for a Stephen King book. Dreamcatcher is a good book but the main problem is that it was written by Stephen King, you know it from the beginning, so you hope for it to be great but no, it's not."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Don't waste your time or money on Dreamcatcher.

I was hoping for a story based around the lore of a Dreamcatcher. I finally 'folded' and ended up buying the book.It was worth the money."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am a HUGE Stephen King fan! And this book is in my opinion one of the best ever!

Everything about this novel is good but the alien was joke. Only the alien that all that why i give 4 star out of five."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The setup is by far the best part of this clumsy tale about friendship and aliens. I don't want to give away the plot, but I was hoping that the four (five) friends would stay together and their relationships would deepen. Instead, the story fragments and turns into a tangle of cliches.While King's trademark humor and descriptiveness are present (the reason it even gets 2 stars), and some of the characters are developed well (Jonesy, Henry, Duds), the whole thing reads like something you've read before, only flimsier, more rambling, and less compelling this time around.The Duddits character and the flashback scenes are worth saving. Too bad he couldn't have written a 400 page book and concentrated on that part, and left the little green men out of it."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I have been a fan of Stephen King for as long as I can remember and I eagerly bought this book the first day it was available. I rushed home, opened it up....and almost vomited all over this complete piece of offal. It seems that Mr. King believes that his past glory will make up for putting out one bad book after the other (see &quot;Bag of Bones&quot;, &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot; etc.). This is simply one of the worst books I have read by anyone in years. The plot, as such, concerns a group of men who constantly pat themselves on the back for being kind to a mentally-challenged boy in their youth. Not only are these one-demensional characters really proud of themselves, but their selfless act of kindness has somehow made them psychic! This ability comes in handy when faced with a race of aliens that are not only generic, but force the reader to encounter a lot of flatulence along this novel's bloated 600 page length. Convoluted and (even worse) DULL, &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is a book that deserves to be ignored by King fans and non-fans alike. There is still good horror fiction out there, but maybe King is not one of the masters anymore."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The book was brilliant. Not that I'd expect less from Mr. King. I couldn't put the book down. That was, until the end. I feel the end was a little lackluster. It had me feeling that I had missed something somewhere, but where I'm still unsure of. Still a must read."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Mr. King's \\"Dreamcatcher\\" starts off in dank, dark bar in New England whare Beaver is going throu a mid-life crisis. He goes on hunting trip with his buds Peat, Henry, and car acident vitim (art imitating life for mr. King) Jonesy. They find a man with an alien inside of him. (or s*** weasel as they are called in the book) Before long (achully is it preety long this book drags on like you would not believe) they are in a stuggle to save the planent from aliens that occupy one's body. This plot has never been used before has it? Don't get me wrong King is a great writer. His use of lanuge is only thing that made me continue to read this book. His charecters are very well-drawn aswell. You really get inside thier lives. There is some mysisism in here dealing with a down syndrome kid \\"seeing the line\\" and being able to see things others can't. His powers rub off on his friends. Peat has a great sense of direction, Henry can really real with his phsco patants. This book drags on and cantains alot of things and we don't need. What's up with the Rolling Stones song bit. The thing I really did not like about this peice of literature was that it skiped around. It was hard to follow. Not one of King's best. I have no desire to see the movie."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is typical King writing (and I am a fan) but it could have been told well in about 300 pages. The concept is interesting and the writing is good, but maybe I was just bored by the end. By the time it was over, I wasn't quite sure I really understood it. Of course, as long as he continues to write, I will continue to read his books."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is, hands down, Stephen King's worst work since &quot;The Dark Half&quot;. Formerly a diehard fan, I have now vowed to never again spend my time with a new novel by Stephen King.Although shorter than some of his most recent work, this book rambles from page one, going on tangents that make no sense and have no apparent destination. The characters are bland, except for Duddits who can be best described as sickly sweet and who utters not one understandable word through the entire book. Every line of his dialouge (Ay ooo-eevviie-ooo ood urn ook) is immediately repeated (so as to be translated) by another character.The author seems to have gotten bored with his premise two thirds of the way through the book. What starts out as an alien presence overtaking the (questionable) hero's body is suddenly revealed to be some kind of time-warp mind trick which proves the hero to be in control of the alien, rather than vice-versa. And how do the good guys escape and save the world? Not by a clever turn of plot or inguenuity on their (or the author's) part, let me assure you. It seems as if the writer has befuddled himself nearly as much as he bufuddles the readers and the good guys triumph by a conference call of minds and (from what I could tell) imagine the alien to death. All orchastrated by the ever sweet Duddits, (gag) whose dying words are &quot;I ove oo, Eenney&quot; (I love you, Henry.) Perhaps that line would be better untranslated.I'm sorry Steve. It's been a long and wonderful relationship but you've changed. I have to leave you now, and keep myself company with memories of the good times--those published prior to 1992."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I had to force myself to get halfway through. This book seemed to drag on forever and is more comical than anything else. I never bothered to finish it!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"...not Wyoming. That's just the start. That King, a former Colorado resident, could make such a blooper testifies to this book's sloppy construction. Other critiques here have mentioned that the book reads like a first draft. Indeed, the editor of this book should throw himself on his blue pencil.The book is also derivitave... with material lifted from everything short of the Manhattan telephone directory. A renegade colonel named Kurtz. An alien invader with an unusual life cycle and a disgusting habit of bursting out of people's bodies. Of course, King tries to make this literary pillaging okay by naming the alien fungus &quot;Ripley, after the woman in the movie &quot;Aliens&quot;&quot;), and explaining that the bad colonel borrowed his name from the villain in Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness.&quot; In addition, anyone who has read other King books will see plot lines, plot points, and plot tricks that he stole from himself.Finally, SK shows the usual disregard for the rules of the universe he has set up, bending and changing behaviors of people, places and things to suit the plot instead of serve it. This is nothing new to his work, though, so I suppose I shouldn't complain. I knew about that one going in...To the book's credit... I did read it all the way to the end, and King managed to get there without pulling a deus ex machina (like in &quot;The Stand&quot; and &quot;Needful Things&quot;). What he does instead is almost worse. (SPOILER ALERT) In the final pages, all of the violence and havoc of the preceeding pages are blamed on a kind of beast within, even absolving the alien invaders of responsibility. Perhaps he should have just had Jonsey wake up to find Henry in the shower and the events of the last 600 pages a dream. (END SPOILER)I'm glad that Mr. King survived his accident and that writing this book helped him recover. But this is one therapy session I wish I had sat out."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I really liked Bag of Bones, but I have found this book very boring. King's style of writing seems to favor the first person ie. Bag of Bones but this was not scary-only gross. This genre is everywhere-tv, movies, books so there is nothing new. The characters do go deep, which is great, but that can only take you so far. If you read alot it is worth a try but I can think of better ones."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I can't call this book a typical King's book. The book discription can mislid you to think there's a connection to &quot;It&quot; but it doesn't. the book is about dealing with the past and the present. the book is about a trip gone bad when everyting goes wrong. But in my opinion the book is about King's fighting his own demones. Like in every king's book you can find a character who resamble himself ,and here one of the characters had a resent accidant (like King) and by that his diffrent from everyone els on the planet (to know why you have to read the book , I hate spoilers). so if you want to read somthing more then the ordinary King's book. The reason i gave this just 4 star is that i hate aliens."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Talk about a waste of paper! Shoot, I've read books that left me wanting my money back, but this one left me wishing thay used the paper and ink to print coloring books!Set in the wood, a bunch of guys who once saved a handicapped person from eating a turd are menaced by aliens. Some fungus grows, and a evil/crazy army general runs around playing Rolling Stones tunes, and by the end you no longer care what the point was.I've seen the quality of Kings books as a downward slide after Salems' Lot, so guess this is sort of the literary version of &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; In other words, it's so bad, sovile, and so poorly written that people are going to line up to throw more money into King's pockets."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Robert A.

By page 62 I was hooked and by page 91 I was getting chills. This story is masterfully told in the style that only Mr. King can achieve and every bit as engrossing as the stand was. The story just gets better and better as it progresses and I was lothe to put it down. Welcome Back Mr. King, ONCE AGAIN, YOU HAVE ARRIVED!! Folks,Stephen King IS IN THE HOUSE!!!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I thought Dreamcatcher was great! I loved all the characters (even Mt. Gray). I really half expected the men in the yellow raincoats or Roland to come in at the end and was somewhat disappointed when they didn't. Stephen King is one of the most talented writers of all time as far as I'm concerned. I only wish I didn't have to wait so long between books!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"It's not an understatement to call mr King's new novel a comeback. Not only is it his first &quot;real&quot; novel since his accident in 1999, but it's also a step back to the horror filled landscape that made him so great and so famous. With over 600 pages the man has written his first horror novel since, well, i guess The Dark half from 1993. And it makes you think of classics as It, The Stand and, although not a classic but anyway, The Tommyknockers. But it also brings out Kings love for horror and sci-fi movies, here a mix of X-files, Close encounters of the third kind, The thing and to top it of- a bit of James Bond. A fast-paced action- adventure with car chases, explosions and bodies that explode, but as the book comes along it is clear that King has bigger ambitions and it is also clear that his near fatal accident lies very near, so does his now beaten addictproblems, both in his mind and in the actual story. What begins as a creepy horror/- sci-fi story soon slows down to be more of a psychological and therapeutic journey through shatterad and battered minds- and bodies.Being a huge King fan, still i might add, being 36 years old, i hade big expectations regarding this book and to large extents they were fullfilled. It is rich and complex and sometimes both suspenseful and scary, not to mention gory. But the problems i had with the book were two primary things, and at least one of them is a very large problem considering it is what you really what from a Stephen King novel- scariness, you want the man to scare the beejesus of out you, because you know he can and then some. Dreamcatcher is a lot, but scary like Pet semetary, The stand, Salem's Lot or Christine? To be short-no. And sometimes, as is the case with mr King from time to time, he is bit too detailed and long-winded, the childhood sequences are a bit too sentimental and some of the characters are not so engaging. As usual King uses the horror, in this case the aliens, or the byrus, as a symbol for larger things concerning life and death-matters. But this time the goosebumbs didn't show on me."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King's latest work is a tale of redemption that starts out with real promise and originality. The ending is what killed this story for me, and seems to reinforce a pattern over the author's last few novels. Not his best work."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"this book had an interesting plot, but it took way too long to get to the point. It would spend like fifty pages explaining boring and inconsequential events and details. Good plot, but 875 pageswas way too long. lots of love!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I enjoyed the parts of the book about the four friends and their strange powers, but once Kurtz and his crew came on board, it got hard to follow. It took a long time for the storylines to mesh. The dialogue is Big Steve at his best, but I think the Duddits stuff was a little overdone."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"There was a lot of talk after King's much publicized accident, that he wouldn't write again - that he was suffering from writer's block. While I reserve 5 stars for THE STAND and THE EYES OF THE DRAGON, this book comes pretty close. The author's genius still lies in his ability to bring characters to life within just a few sentences, making even the most minor of characters someone interesting."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I'll keep this short, no need for a plot summary, just knowthat this book is not worth your time! Luckily, I checked Dreamcatcherout from the library, so I didn't get taken .... I plodded along for300 pages before realizing I was wasting my time and giving up. I haveread every Stephen King book published, and this is his worstever. The writing style is crude and bitter, he must have been on alot of painkillers when he wrote this one. I'll never give up onStephen King, but do yourself a favor and skip Dreamcatcher! END"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I've been a Stephen King ever since I read &quot;Carrie&quot; in hardcover back in the '70s. All of his fiction has interested me, even those of his works that I found not up to what I expected from him. After his accident, I was worried that his writing would be affected, but &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; put those worries to rest. The book is enjoyable in the way only a King book can be: interesting, frightening, and a good peek into the human condition. How he can get inside the mind of aliens and madmen always amazes me! Of course, this book suffers from some of King's normal faults; it's overwritten, and a lot of it could have been edited out without damaging the story one bit. So what? It's not great literature, but it's entertaining, and that's what I want from Mr. King, to be entertained. He delivers that in a big way, and I look forward to many more years, and many more books, from him."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"King seems to have turned over a new leaf in his last few books, combining his usual thrills and chills with a new tenderness and humanity. His latest tale surrounds four friends with a special sort of psychic link. On one of their annual hunting trips they run afoul of a stranger, wandering lost in the woods. It soon becomes clear that an alien power is at work and soon the friends are forced to compete not only with these strange beings but also with a black ops military coverup, hell bent on sweeping the evidence under the rug, no matter the costs. Fans of King's work might be pleased to note that this book returns to the town of Derry and there is even a small, but cool tip of the hat to another of his works, It. The story does take a little while to coalesce, as it jumps from character to character, from the present to events in their past, but it is an inviggorating page turner. The characters are deep and rich and the plot is fast paced and interesting. The ending is a little weird, but still an acceptable conclusion to this tale. At times disgusting, horrifying, and touching, this work is much more mature than most of his previous stuff and does incorporate his feelings about his own accident. This is a must read for King fans and likely will be pleasurable to people who have never tried King before or have found something lacking in his previous works."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I'm not too excited about this, actually. I thought this one felt a lot in tone and mood as The Tommyknockers, easily the weakest King novel of them all. The punch isn't really packed here, I'd expected more. The first 250 pages were the hardest to get through.I wouldn't compare this to IT. In a sense of scope, it is, but on the whole... I dunno.That multi-angled thingee could have been done sharper. This is just too blunt."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"While I would not say this is the be all end all Stephen King book, I think traditional King fans will be pleased with this new offering. It is a throwback to It,and Tommyknockers and I enjoyed it much more than both of those. In a nutshell the story is about 5 friends, one having Downs Syndrome who is also a powerful Phychic, He in a way passes his gift along to his 4 friends who must use their skills to survive an alien invasion while hunting in the woods. It is very scary at times at really gross to (which is good to some people :)). In closing I will say you will never be able to sit on the toilet without thinking twice again."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I had almost given up on Stephen King. I haven't read any of his new stuff since Rose Madder and Insomnia. I felt he had veered way off into the land of touchy-feely feminism. When I read the description for Dreamcatcher, I immediately got the old feeling, a feeling that maybe this one was going to delve into true bone chilling horror. I certainly wasn't disappointed, either. This is the best Stephen King novel I've read in eons. It certainly harkens back to his groundbreaking work in such novels as It, The Tommyknockers, and even his masterpiece The Stand. I don't know where the magic went, but Stephen King found it and is back in true style. He'll make your spinal column vibrate like a weather vane struck by lightening with this gruesome tale.Since many may have not read this book yet, I'll coast quickly through the plot details. Four friends gather together for their annual hunting trip in the Maine woods, not far from their childhood home, Derry (home of Pennywise the clown from It). These four friends were brought together during their childhood by a boy with Down's syndrome. Something amazing happened that has linked them together ever since. When a stranger comes into their cabin and unleashes something truly horrible, the roller coaster ride begins. Apparently, some space aliens have crash landed in Maine, and all heck is breaking lose, with the locals and the military caught up in the hijinks.As usual, King dwells on childhood and it's innocence as a major theme of the book. The destruction of the Hole in the Wall is symbolic for the destruction of childhood innocence (you can never go home again). King also ties in other books to the story, such as It. I loved this, as It is one of my favorite books by Stephen King (is Pennywise actually still around?!!?!). We even have the office of the Tracker brothers playing a big role in this one. I actually expected Richie Tozier or another member of the Loser's Club to stick his head into the picture! And what else can you say about some of King's hilarious phrases? You get several in this book, such as \\"The claret is starting to flow\\"! Classic!It also wouldn't be a Stephen King book without the major sociopath/freak. We get one in the guise of Abraham Kurtz, the honcho in charge of cleaning up the mess that the aliens have started. Kurtz (gotta love that name! The horror, the horror!) is a serious nutcase, and every time King gives us an insight into him is just pure fun. The last part of the book is a gut wrenching car chase that leads up to an amazing end. It was really tough to put this book down. It is that good.I also have to comment on some of the gore in this book. I can't remember the last time I was so nauseated. King has really topped himself with some of the sick scenes in this novel. The s**t weasels are absolutely gross, and I still cringe when I think of the scenes with them doing their destructive work. There are also plenty of heads and other body parts either being blown up or shot off to keep any gorehound's attention. There are plenty of chills as well. The scenes with Beaver and Jonesy at the Hole in the Wall encountering the alien presence for the first time is downright scary. Anyone who loves horror/scares will not go wrong with this book.Also, King works in, through the character Jonesy, much of the agony he experienced when he was struck by a van while walking in Maine in 1999. This makes the book, in my opinion, much more of a personal work. I actually got a feel for how King must have felt as he went through the painful steps of rehab after his operations. Thank goodness King is still in this mortal coil doing what he does best! Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King is one of a kind, and this novel about an alien invasion is a true King horror story. I have all of King's novels, and have read most of them several times. Like all King fiction, this one held me spell-bound, reading when I should have been doing other things. The story is fabulous, the characters very well developed and lovable. But I probably won't read it a second time. It is too frightening, too gruesome, and too possible. And I live too far back in the woods. Alone. Is that light on the wall a reflection from the distant highway? Why are there so many deer in the yard? If you read this novel, you might be asking yourself the same questions. But don't bother with trying to hide. They can find you when they read your mind."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"As most Stephen King fans, I bought this book without following any suggestions,or reading any reviews---just because he is Stephen King. I began reading this book over 3 weeks ago, and I finally put it down yesterday because after 400 pages, I just didn't care to finish it.(I read the first 200 pages in a little over a day). Shame too, because &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; began as such a promising story,written by the man who I attribute many hours of captivating reading. Not this time. Don't bother!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Comparing this book solely with King's own works, I'd say this one rates about a C+. Not even close to the sweeping intensity of his most powerful books like &quot;The Stand&quot; or the heart-wrenching emotionality of &quot;Bag of Bones,&quot; &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is still a worthy read. While disjointed and unfocused at times, it is still stunningly paced as only King's works can be. Yes, it feels hurried and a bit self-indulgent, but even at his laziest Stephen King's raw talent gives this book enough to sustain it and make it better than 99.99% of what passes for horror or dark fantasy on the literary market."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Beav, Henry, Pete, and Jonesy, are friends since childhood, linked together by an experience that will haunt them forever.As adults, the friends get together in the woods of Derry (the setting of IT, and Insomnia) for some time to get away, but their retreat will be spoiled when they come in contact with a strange man...a man NOT of this world.To battle this extraterestrial being, the men must confront what happened to them in the past, if they are to win the war with the body snatchers.&quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is the first full-length novel since Stephen King's near-fatal accident, although being touted as a return to the early works of the &quot;horror&quot; master,it is NOT. The book takes MUCH too long to take off. The first 200 pages of &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; ramble on, leaving the reader to wonder &quot;what is going on&quot;, and while this confusing/surprise tactic may work in some horror novels, it doesn't here...by the time the pieces of the plot fall into place it's too late. Much of the novel dips back and forth between characters, resulting in much confusion of what is going on-flipping back in the book to find out certain things is necessary. And although some of the parts containing the aliens are very interesting, it isn't enough to carry 600 pages.Die-hard fans of Stephen King might like this, but any fan of horror will be greatly disappointed. Mr. King has been taking chances with the plots of his novels, and I will give him credit for that, but what could have been a great horror novel, is just a mediocre alien thriller.&quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is not as bad as some of his novels, but it is NOT nearly as good as his master works, such as &quot;Misery&quot;, &quot;Pet Semetary&quot;, and my personal favorite &quot;Desperation&quot;.Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am normally an avid Stephen King fan. I was terribly disappointed in this book. I had a hard time following the frequent jumps from point of view to point of view. Plus, I am not that big of a fan of the alien\\\\government conspiracy storyline. In my opinion, this was more cynical and more bitter than King's other works. He has written much better."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"And I have to say I was a little let down. \\"Dreamcatcher\\" comes charging out of the gates with a superb set-up, but then starts to drag and it seems King's editor went to sleep on him. In my opinion, this book could have been much better.The premise is not overly original, but will body-snatching aliens ever really get old? Of course not! Thankfully, King takes a few liberties with the formula, the main one being the mental powers that exist in the four friends via a special fifth. Frankly, I could have done without this aspect of the story, as it leads to some of the slower parts. Another departure from the norm that I did like was the nature of the invading aliens, although he didn't really give us much of a background. I enjoyed the very human struggle one of the alien beings faces, Mr. Gray, who must complete his objective despite the alien planning going all to hell. In Dreamcatcher, King switches the alien's role from butt-kicking, seemingly invincible invaders to one lone underdog clinging to his mission by the skin of teeth, all the while being hunted down by humans.Where King really hits a grand slam is the character of Mr. Gray, who is an alien presence in the mind of Jonesy, one of the four friends. But while he inhabits the body, the mind of Jonesy is still there, and causes Mr. Gray no end of trouble. The idea of an alien having to fight its own desires to become human is quite interesting, from his craving for bacon to his addiction to his newfound emotions. The interaction between Mr. Gray and Jonesy is the most entertaining stuff in the book, although even that tends to drag towards the end. I also liked Kurtz, the token military man who is just little crazy and causes no end of trouble for both the aliens and the heroes.While it isn't exactly what I'd call scary, I do recommend this book without much reservation. It doesn't exactly keep you guessing, but the suspense is there, and King shows us the old dog has some new tricks as he throws some nice twists into the old body snatcher formula. My biggest gripe is the length of the book, as it certainly hurts the sense of urgency. But, with the set-up and early chapters being as excellent as they are, you'll be hooked regardless."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"this book is definitely the best King book i have read so far. Right from the very beginning i could not put it down. There is so much graphic detail and action, how could you? all i have to say is, i cant wait until the movie comes out."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Mr. King obviously has a little anger to work out. In the first three chapters of the book, three of the four main characters are in major car acccidents, depressed, suicidal and just plain angry. While most people pay for therapy, Mr. King has obviously discovered a way to foment his anger about the universe and car accidents by writing about his own personal experiences, thinly veiled by the fiction the publisher prints.But the real problem with the book is not the story, the unfairness of the universe or aliens bopping into Maine. The problem of the book is simply that it is an ugly book. Characters in the book display no beauty, speak in an unending stream of four letter words and provide laughs through sophomoric stunts of farting and belching.I truly thought &quot;The Sixth Mile&quot; was one of the most uplifting pieces I have read. But obviously, &quot;Dreamcatcher has not caught the dreams of beauty and truth."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is an overall good book. Typical Stephen King. Although the plot is a little on the weak side, King's writing and storytelling is at it's best. There were almost 900 pages and there were very few places that dragged. Pretty impressive. Overall, in the better half of King books."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"For the first few pages I entertained the hope that SK might be back to something of his old form. However I soon noticed that no sooner had the story started to get interesting than King would switch away to another storyline, completely killing the suspense. The plot lacks originality and owes a great debt in particular to the Alien films. It is rambling and incoherent and I suspect that without the King name it would have never seen the light of day. He has managed the feat of writing a book which is way way too long yet failing to fill in many important details of the past which are hinted at all the way through the novel. The so-called plot twist at the end was just confusing and left me wondering why I bothered to finish the book."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I've only read two other Stephen King books, and this is my least favorite. I felt like King needed to make his book way too long, so he added needless characters, a confusing plot, and mainly, it's just tough to keep interested in the book for 900 pages.It does have some great numbers of suspense (usually when Mr. Gray was at the scene, like in the hospital), but other parts (mainly the military parts), were very boring. He uses some military phrases, and he's trying to impress us with his &quot;vast knowledge&quot; of ideas. If you're just looking for a quick read that you can understand easily, this is not it. You have to think about it (I still don't fully understand it). Also, it seemed like he wanted to tie up everything up in a neat little package by having the survivors talk about it. It didn't make me understand it much more."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Why always so long. Good story with excellent ideas and some very well written elements. But seriously rambling in places. King seems to believe the quality of his books is proportionate to the length. Disagree."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book is NOT one of S.K.'s best. He is still a master writer, however the flashbacks every five pages got a little annoying. As always the characters lept off the page, but the plot is left seriously wanting. Don't read this book unless you have major patience and time to kill."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Once the dreamcatcher caught my attention it didn't let me go. A little slow at first but as soon as McCarty appears it gears up to speed. Anyway I think it will be difficult to turn it into a good film as most of the plot goes on within the minds of the characters."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"More of a science fiction book rather than a thriller. The first half is great as he introduces the characters and their lifestyles and the ending is a real page turner too. But Stephen King (as we all know) goes into a 2 to 3 page tangent of totally unrelated memories or dreams or thoughts that have NOTHING to do with the story, or at least, never takes us FORWARD in the story. It was very hard to get through some parts of this, I'd suggest that if you get stuck (like I did many times) in one of his many &quot;tangents&quot;, just skim it quickly, until you find the real story again. You won't lose the storyline, don't worry."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"At some point in this long novel King describes the dreamcatcher as a collection of things past, present and future. A perfect description for this work that references the real and fictional from the real world, his past work, and the movies. The best of his work allows us to identify with a character or situation. Only in one aspect, the plight of an accident injured character do we really believe. Mr. King has returned to the long involved works that we have loved in the past, but this time the story feels too drawn out, the alien too gray, the characters cartoonish. Bring on the next one."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"After Bag of Bones and Hearts in Atlantis, I was hoping for a truly well written book. I know he is still capable as the Green Mile and Wizard and Glass have proven. So what is this? Not his worst book. Remember Tommyknockers or Needful Things? But certainly nowhere near his best work. There is some great dialogue and neat concepts in this book, but not enough to save it. Wait for the paperback edition and save some money if you really must read it. I will not buy another King book right after it has been released. I am that disappointed."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book is a cross between &quot;Tommyknockers&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot; (the movie with Sigourney Weaver). Though hard to follow at times, the reader MUST maintain focus on the novel in order not to lose the thread that weaves it all together. It is a hard novel to keep up with, yet an act of brilliance so glowing in insanity and typical Stephen King that you will love both it's simplicity and it's complexity. Yes, folks, the aliens have landed once again, and where else but in Maine? This time, though, the aliens have and can give telepathic powers, as well as lay eggs and reproduce. There's a little bit of Stephen King's accident there too, which plays well with a character he calls Jonesey, but &quot;Duddits&quot; is our main character, and Duddits is a local retard boy that four local boys become friends and bond with. Years go by, and passages of time as in every lifetime, yet somehow, the master artist once again weaves it all together with a &quot;dreamcatcher&quot;, and when the world goes crazy, as it always seems to do in Stephen King's books, the dreamcatcher may be the only way out. You will love this book, and you will add it to your vast Stephen King library. Just remember not to lose the thread."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King has proven to all his fans that nothing will stop him from churning out his masterpieces of literature.DREAMCATCHER, King's first full-length novel since his near-fatal car accident, confirms that he hasn't forgotten his roots of pure weirdness. His newfound loves of of the human mind and spirit also shine through.DREAMCATHER is the journey of four childhood friends on a hunting trip in the remote woods of Maine. The four men are suddenly plunged into a battle against a being from another world when a strange man stumbles into their camp. They find out that their only chance of survival lies in the secret past of their childhood.This novel has meaning beyond what it says on the pages. Like some of King's other works (\\"The Body\\" and HEARTS IN ATLANTIS) it beautifully describes the bonds of friendship and how a person will never have friends like the ones they had as a child.Each character is equipped with his own complex personality and individual history, which makes reading it fun and captivating.DREAMCATCHER is an enjoyable and heartwarming book for any avid King fan, though it of course isn't his best (that honor goes to something like IT or THE STAND). It can also be a great introduction to the extremely talented and celebrated author, my God amongst writers, Stephen King."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Well...I was delighted to see Stephen King return to his classic horror roots after some literary tangents that were great reads but not really \\"Stephen King\\" books, if you know what I mean. And I agree that this book is closer to the likes of \\"It\\" and \\"Tommyknockers\\", and I truly did enjoy it...(don't get me wrong...I've never read a King book that I didn't enjoy)...but compared to his other novels, this one was sort of sub-par. It was a lot like \\"The Tommyknockers\\", and I kept flashing back to the telepathy and loose teeth from that story. King does an pretty good job with character and dialogue in this novel, like he always does. He is a master at creating people that you like and can connect with, and his children characters are so engaging that I still consider the \\"Losers Club\\" from \\"It\\" to be my close, personal friends...but the characters in this story, aside from Duddits, just weren't that engaging. In the end, the novel turns into a long chase scene that takes 200 pages to end. If you are a Stephen King fan, you'll love this book and rank it somewhere in the middle of all the rest. If you've never tried Stephen King, don't start here...go buy \\"The Stand\\" or \\"Salem's Lot\\"...get hooked...then come back."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher is a classic King novel. It's &quot;The Stand&quot; meets &quot;It&quot; meets &quot;Tommyknockers&quot;. Its about four buddies, and how they grew up, about how they saved Duddits and thus defined who they are and its about their last trip camping. The book, like a lot of Stephen King novels, moves effortless back and forth between the present and the past, and one character to another. The five main characters (ok theres more), Peter, Beav, Henry, Jonesy and Duddits are all easily identifiable. We all have a part of each one, or know someone who is like them. You find yourself reading &quot;just one more page&quot; again and again, as you race to piece the puzzle together. Its classic King done to the backdrop of the 90s X-Files, Independence Day, Armageddon etc movies. As with all Kings novels, a lot is about him. In this book, obviously he went through a lot of pain and anger, and a lot is directed to the driver who hits Jonesy (any similarities to Kings accident hmmm?). The books pulsates with energy from a cold snowy environment. It moves from deciphering who all the characters are to a classic chase scene. The book has many characters besides the five main &quot;boys&quot; and they key again relates back to &quot;The X-Files&quot; - TRUST NO ONE"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I'm not going to go into a detailed plot description because 1. the editorial reviews, especially Booklist, do it quite well and 2. because the plotline is so convoluted it would take up most of the 1,000 word limit. As a rabid King reader for 20+ years, the first book I actually had trouble finishing was Gerald's Game. Unfortunately, after that, a few more came, and I was starting to worry King had finally burned himself out. Then the Green Mile restored my faith. Since then, enough titles that I've really enjoyed, such as Hearts in Atlantis, have been interspersed with the ones I read once and put away with the rest of my collection, gathering dust. One of those titles is Insomnia, and unfortunately for me, that's the King book Dreamcatcher reminded me of most strongly.I am sorry to say that Dreamcatcher falls into the &quot;never pick it up again&quot; category. I really didn't think it was going to. All the excerpts I read online were wonderful, and I was starting to get attached to some of the characters already and couldn't wait to read more about them. I was pretty sure this was going to be one of his better ones. I didn't have high expectations, but I did expect the rest of the novel to be somewhat as entertaining as the excerpts I read. At first everything was going great-I was getting into the plot, I couldn't wait to see what happened next, and hoping nothing bad happened to the characters I liked. There were a couple of points where I got a little confused, but no big deal. A couple of plot-lines that involved events in the character's past started, and I was interested to know what happened to the characters as kids. The narrative jumped around just a bit, but I knew it would be explained later. So far so good.Then I finished part 1 (about 150 pages in, I think). Part 2 started and it wasn't quite as enjoyable, but I gave it a chance. Fortunately other readers have commented that the narrative was confusing, so I don't feel so stupid, but I started having to page back and see if I'd missed something, or get the male characters straight. IT jumped around a lot too, and while I agree IT was uneven and bordering on sloppy in a few spots, it's one of my favorites. 3/4 of the way through, I wondered if he had to rush Dreamcatcher out because of a deadline, because it seemed like he was desperately slapping together the plotline as he went along. I know King has said in the past that as he was writing, he didn't know what was going to happen next, and the book almost wrote itself. I have no problem with this when the novel is well-written and I'm drawn into the characters-some of the books he's said this about were among my favorites. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to work so well this time.There were scenes in the character's past that seemed to play a big factor on the events that were eluded to, but on a couple, he never went back and fleshed it out. I also wondered if he'd handed in a rough draft, and since this was his first fiction since his accident, his editors didn't want to discourage him so they kept their usual feedback to themselves and figured it was better to put out the book, flaws and all, quickly and not give any suggestions to improve the book. I also get the sneaking suspicion someone in charge said, &quot;what the hell, it's Stephen King so it'll sell like crazy no matter what's between the covers&quot;. It just seemed to need polishing up, and I kept wondering if King just submitted the first draft the second after he finished it without even a re-read, and that's what was published.I liked the flashback scene to the first encounter with Duddits, the characters I did care about, and the you-know-what weasels. After I was halfway through, about the only thing that perked me up were the &quot;in-jokes&quot; about Derry that first time readers won't catch. The character of Duddits and his mother started out great, but I ended up feeling manipulated and feeling like Dean Koontz (who I also enjoy, but when I want to read Koontz I'll pick up one of his books) stepped in to write a section, and didn't try very hard. Another thing that bothered me was that there's a strong theme of childhood and memories of past, but the novel didn't flash back long enough for it to work, and it felt incomplete. Several times I found myself paging back, thinking I missed something. Nope. What seemed like recycled material from IT and Tommyknockers didn't help either. I have no problem with 'recycling' but only if it works.So, if I had to put every King novel I read in order of my favorite to least favorite, this wouldn't be at the very bottom (Insomnia would be there along with Rose Madder and Gerald's Game). I feel guilty not giving this more than 3 stars, but I know King can do so much better. If you're a hardcore King fan like me, obviously you'll pick it up like all his others if you haven't already. But I would advise not paying full price, and keeping your expectations low...unless you loved Insomnia, in which case you'll probably have more fun with this book than I did. I understand that there's bound to be some misfires with a writer as prolific as King, so I chalk Dreamcatcher up as one. Fortunately, I know there's gonna King books somewhere in the future that I love and become some of my favorites. This just isn't one of them."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"After King's accident two years ago, he vowed to never write again. Most people didn't take him seriously, but there was the chance that we had heard the last of him. Luckily, he is too dedicated to keep away. With &quot;On Writing&quot; King opened up his mind and heart to tell us how he writes and how he overcame the trauma of a near-death experience. Now with &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; King has jumped back into fiction in full force...well almost.&quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is clearly a transition work for King. He returns to everything that has worked for him in the past; eerie settings, Derry, Maine, childhood characters connected by traumatic shared experience, mysterious happenings and fast-paced narrative. His writing is as sharp as ever; clear characters, good dialogue, fast pace. He does a great job of pushing you to the next page, always holding out another carrot. The first 200 pages are extremely gripping.There isn't anything groundbreaking here though. King never really offers anything in the way of profound insight into the human psyche or social discourse. &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is no exception. He does touch on such things as suicide, telepathy, and the possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life. However, he probably spends less than 50 of the book's 620 pages actually examining these issues. I think the book would have been much more interesting at around 500-550 pages. There just wasn't enough material to go as long as it did.I look at this book as an investment in his future work. Writing a long novel after planning to not write again is a huge step. The book is pretty good, and hopefully King has convinced himself that he can continue writing. With what he has learned from his accident and his growing skill as a writer, his next work should be incredible. &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is worth the investment."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Review by Lynn Nicole LouisStephen King has always generated mixed reactions for me. I think his best form is the short--he's written some truly wonderful short stories and novellas. In my mind, his success with book length fiction has been somewhat spotty. Note that in this case I'm not defining success in terms of financial gain, but in how much I enjoyed the book.The Stand is one of my all time favorites. Sure, it has it's problems, but as far as end-of-the-world books goes, it's top notch. Other King works have been less successful for me, and some (such as The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon or Gerald's Game) were just downright bad.Still, I must be infected at some level with the King virus, because when a new book comes out, I dutiful wait for the paperback and then buy it.......Dreamcatcher tries to be a story about friendship and survival, but it's worth noting that one of the main characters is recovering from a serious automobile accident, as was King at the time he wrote this. King's anger about the event is easy to see; perhaps writing this book is one of his ways of coming to grips with what happened to him. But we all know that good truth doesn't necessarily make good fiction. King's... er, the character's complaints, moans and gripes wore thin after a while.Overall? My recommendation is to avoid this one unless you're a King fan. It's a long book, takes a big investment of time to read, and ultimately has a low return. There are a lot better alien invasion books out there.Lynn Nicole LouisRead the full review at www.SFReader.com"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I found that this book to be much like other books written by King, and it even mirrors King's apperance in the 80's film &quot;Creepshow&quot;, in the segment where King himself plays a character who is reduced to the &quot;Hemingway solution&quot; when a certain green growth overtakes his person and house like kudzu after a meteor falls. (Sound familiar?) Certain elements from &quot;Stand By Me&quot; (the four childhood pals), &quot;The Stand&quot; (telepathy and the end-game plot) and of course, &quot;TommyKnockers&quot; (aliens who make your teeth fall out) are also re-hashed in this novel. I feel that Robert McCammon's &quot;Stinger&quot; is a better novel depicting human-to-alien transformations."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I've read many of the other reviews and to sum it up: Mr. King, please stop writing about aliens. I've read all his books and most of his published short stories. There is no better author than Stephen King as far as I'm concerned. I'm a true fan. But there have only been two books of his I did not care for and it was this one and the dreadful TOMMYKNOCKERS. His characters are always so rich in background but DREAMCATCHER had me confused and bored. All I can say is that I am waiting impatiently for the follow-up to THE TALISMAN."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"It's a good read, and a decent story. It held my interest through the whole story. It contains the usual twists and character developement you expect from King, but it's not his best work. I'll put it like this: If King is your literature God, read the book. If books about UFO's are your thing, read this book. But if this is your first crack at reading King, I recommend one of his earlier works. That's not to say it isn't a good story. It's just not the same brilliance that produced the Dark Tower series, Misery, or The Stand. It's King, but low grade King. Sorry Buddy."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"In &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; King shows a mastery of the use of the vernacular that is the hallmark of his writing. Let us not be mistaken in that King has no intent on writing literature in his work, despite the surreptitious reference to &quot;A Clean Well Lighted Place&quot; while discussing the &quot;Hemingway Solution&quot; for self-termination. Nor is King's plot in this book original through the first 550 pages. And King makes no bones about it, he reveals outright through the dialogue of his characters that the plot is really just a basic science fiction movie, he most often compares it to &quot;The Invasion of the Body Snatchers.&quot;But, it is neither King's intent to write literature, nor to create a unique plot in this case, but rather, to get a message across to millions of people through a masterful use of common language. His construction is such that his pictures are crystal clear mental images. And, behind all that imagery, is King's message.That message is interwoven in the intricate explanation of the mental processes that King dissects within the book. In fact, I felt the book read a lot more like &quot;Insomnia&quot; than like &quot;Desparation&quot; or &quot;The Regulators.&quot; On a very basic level, King tries to express the idea of emotional telepathy and even some actual verbal and image telepathy. Except, as a vehicle to increase its reality to the reader, he uses the device of the foreign invader and its infection to increase telepathic levels to way beyond normal human conditions.In brief, most King fans will find the book enjoyable and rewarding. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of that genre, either by King or others."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"While I know it sounds trite, this novel was a bit like King getting back to his roots. Not just in theme, either, but in overall &quot;feel.&quot; I just couldn't help but think that King was having fun again; writing for the sheer joy of telling a good 'ol page turner. Not his most intellectual work, but surely one of his most enjoyable. Though the text comes in over 600 pages, I still found myself lost in the struggle of the wonderfully drawn characters, and page-flipping pace. An old fashioned sci-fi extravaganza, told a la King-style. In DREAMCATCHER, King once again creates memorable characters, and one of the most memorable is Duddits. Duddits was not only the glue that held the gang together, he also served to hold the book together as well. Familiar themes that include friendship, good vs evil, and an exploration into the human psyche make this one fun read. Throughout, King begs us to answer: who are the real monsters? Them or us? A must read for King fans and those new to the author."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Only Stephen King can turn a normal body function into something to be afraid of. That being said, I had a great time with his latest stab at horror involving four friends who go hunting every year, and have their plans disrupted by the crash of an alien space ship. After writing so many books it seems inevitable that he'd begin to repeat themes that have been addressed in earlier novels. The biggest is the idea of a group of childhood friends confronting or reliving their past in order to master the present. Much like &quot;It&quot;, but instead of Pennywise the Clown, there's now &quot;Mr Gray&quot;. Part of what makes his horrifying worlds so real is his constant use of pop culture references such as &quot;E.R.&quot;, &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, and &quot;Scooby Doo&quot;. He's also amazing at laying track; Unravelling just enough to make you keep turning the pages to find out what happens next. I didn't find it as scary as some of his other works, but I was hugely entertained. Fans won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"While Dreamcatcher itself is not confusing, I am nevertheless bewildered by what Mr.King may have been trying to achieve here.On the one hand this is the story of Jonesy, Pete, Duddits, Beaver and Henry. Five boys, now men, who were brought together after a degrading incident in which Duddits, who suffers from Down Syndrome, is ridiculed by a group of bullies. Regardless of whether or not you are a fan of horror stories, you can't help but get intrigued by these characters enough that you feel compelled to read on, just to see how their lives turn out.On the other hand is the story of: aliens who look humanoid, but are actually spore carriers which are intent on taking over the world, or not. A bunch of crazed military personnel who don't think twice about committing genocide on their own fellow citizens. A one-dimensional psychopath who is entrusted to obliterate an entire forest's animal and human population, but who is intent on revenge. And the internal fight by one of the main characters who by the end of the tale may have only been suffering from a delusional case of split personality disorder!If this had been written as two distinct novellas I would have devoured the first story, and fed the second on to one of the space weasels. As an interconnected novel it was a pure case of pleasure tempered by pain."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Being an avid Stephen King reader, I was somewhat disappointed with this one. Here are my gripes:- I found this book to be a rehash of &quot;It&quot;, &quot;Tomminockers&quot;, &quot;Regulators&quot;, and &quot;Insomnia&quot;. Yes, it is still the good ole Stephen King but the plot shows nothing new and it loses to the aforementioned novels since it lacks the sharpness of each of the above.- While reading, I had a rather strong feeling that the book is artificially bloated as if it tried to meet the publisher's expectations for the book size. The main part of the book ('the chase') in my opinion was 2-3 times longer than it could be without weakening the plot and the thrill.- On the opposite, the culmination is rather hasty. Also, I was quite disappointed with the Epilogue which tried to reconsider the facts from a different standpoint, which is usually a bad thing for the epilogue.To summarize, while this is still the good ole Stephen King and he is still capable of producing a good reading (it was a pretty good book to take on my vacation), there are some problems both with the plot and with the style. So far, my Stephen King collection still consists of only one book (&quot;It&quot;) and it doesn't look like it is going to change in the near future. So, if you want new Stephen King reading - get 'Dreamcatcher'. However, if you are interested in good reading - go for 'It' or better still read some works by H.P.Lovecraft."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I'm just glad Stephen King is still around to write stories after being so seriously injured when a car hit him. I am a dedicated SK fan and I enjoyed this book, but it isn't on my list of favorites. I thought the most interesting aspect of this story was how SK wove his own experience with a broken hip into the tale. I am one of those readers who prefer mental/emotional weirdness rather than physical weirdness. The \\"weasels\\", the aliens, and the red fungus didn't impress me, but I did like the characters and their ability to communicate telepathically. It is always King's style of writing that wins me over. Even if the premise or the plot line falls short, the words hold up and draw me irresistibly toward the end. As I said, I enjoyed this book but if you aren't a hardcore SK fan, this one probably isn't for you."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"What are you looking for in a book? Are you looking for a slicer and dicer? Are you looking to be scared out of your wits? Are you looking for suprises around every corner? Well, this isn't exactly that. But if you are looking for a little of all of these, and a save the world story mixed in, then this should be your next book. Stephen King's works always include a battle between Good and Evil, and sacrifices must be made for Good to win. Some of your favorite characters might not make it through the story, but that's how life works. You can't make an omlette without cracking a few eggs.This book tells the story of how divine providence puts four (or five, depending on how you see it) childhood buddies in the position of having to save the world from an alien disease. Fortunately they are armed with extrasensory perception.Possibly the most interesting part of the book is King's idea of what our visitors from outer space may actually be. Read the book.

There is alittle bit of a war story thrown in. And ESP as well. It really blends all these things together in a very interesting story. I thought the characters were great, especially Mr. Gray the alien. The book is scary, and keeps you guessing all along. I heard this is being made into a movie, and I will be there on opening day."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"\\"Dreamcatcher\\" is a tale that has many of the elements found in \\"Tommyknockers,\\" and \\"It,\\" (the four main characters are taken straight from \\"It,\\" in fact,) but it lacks the more fully-developed plot elements of those two stories, and often times seems to lose its own place. There are moments of sheer, inspired brilliance, but there are also long passages that are dull and seemingly pointless. The characters, though, are well-thought-out and vivid, and there is an especially compelling character by the name of Duddits, a Downs Syndrome boy whom the four main characters rescue in their early childhood, and who ends up rescuing them in many ways - sounds a bit trite, perhaps, but King really got this part of the story right.King moves us backward and forward in time, revealing bits of the characters' pasts, showing us the same experiences from different peoples' perspectives, and generally doing a good job of weaving together complex and seemingly unrelated strands of the story. The trouble is, something just doesn't work here. The ending isn't especially psychologically satisfying, as King tries to explain one of the book's many intriguing phenomenon, but fails to do so an in interesting, cohesive manner. He seems to struggle as he relates the significance of the dreamcatcher, as well; it's almost as if he's saying the same things over and over, just in a slightly different way, as if he couldn't quite nail it down. I understood what he meant, but he didn't ace the description and the conections as he usually does. In that process, he almost makes one of the main struggles seem superfluous, and this didn't sit well with me. ....The plot of \\"Dreamcatcher\\" is much like \\"X-Files\\" meets \\"Stand By Me;\\" aliens have invaded the Earth, and it's up to four unlikely heroes to save us all. While the aliens *look* exactly like what we might expect ... they are in actuality something entirely else - a kind of intelligent fungus that infect their hosts through a red, moss-like growth, which can then develop into a legless, weasel-like creature with nasty teeth and a horrible appetite. While infected with the fungus, or when near the aliens themselves, people develop a form of telepathy, which of course leads to many interesting scenarios and adds to the overall suspense and depth of the story. King does a good job of describing telepathic communication and its shortcuts, and also does well describing the void that one of the characters feels when the telepathy leaves him.Throughout the book, more and more of the boys' unusual childhood and their unique friendship with Duddits is revealed, we come to understand their lives intimately, and care greatly about what happens to them. Speaking of which, this is a very gruesome story, with graphic depictions of violence and pain, and in places I was fairly uncomfortable. ... The issue I had the most trouble with was the hapless border collie which becomes infected with the weasel creature, and goes through all of the associated suffering; as an animal lover, that was especially difficult to listen through. I believe King understood that dog people would have a lot of issues with this, so he mercifully allows the dog to become unconscious when his discomfort reaches levels that would have caused me to turn off the tape and never turn it back on again. But the gore and such don't wash out the story elements in the overall picture.The aliens are not the only enemy in this novel; King introduces us to the evil, sociopathic Col. Kurtz, ... who only looks out for himself, at the expense of any who get in his way. He is intelligent, but superficial and largely a caricature of a totally wigged-out, high-ranking military man who's lost his mind. As his Top Secret military operation involving the destruction of the aliens goes horribly awry, he slips farther and farther off the deep end, until he finally begins a quest for revenge that clearly demonstrates the level of his sociopathy.In between truly horrific moments, there are some snort-out-loud funny passages and dialogue, especially in the telepathic conversations between Jonesy and an alien learning about what it means to be ... human. Insane cravings for bacon, learning how to swear, and discovering emotions all provided moments of humor and interest.Jeffrey Demunn nails his narration - his voice has pleasant tones, and his inflection is almost always perfect for the scene at hand. He comes up with convincing voice characteristics for almost every character, and does a wonderful job with Mr. Gray, one of the aliens.Overall...I'm glad I \\"read\\" this book, but I find myself wishing that King had really aced the story, because it could have been great, and as it stands now, it's only \\"good.\\" The premise was interesting, and carried out well about two-thirds of the way, but that other third...it just left me a little disappointed."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"As Duddits might say, &quot;It's not that great&quot;.Good enough story, but after the big blow-up at Hole in the Wall, the book seems to get tortuously confused around who is in whose head and who is communicating with who vs. reminiscing about the past.The interplay beetween Henry and Owen was interesting and fortunately kept the back part of the book under control."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is just one more of Stephen King's recent ramblings. It probably has a good plot, but the constant use of \\"shock-words\\" and vulgarities detracts from a good story. It is way too wordy and could have been written as a novelette such as \\"Thinner\\". All indications are that this may be my last Stephen King purchase."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Not even close. A group of early middle agers from Derry, Maine who as a group once did something really great as kids are back together years later facing something horrible. The problem with this book is that it's far too long at just short of 900 pages to be just a Saturday monster movie in print. It also involves too few supporting characters for a story this long. It's far from unusual for King to do grossout, but when that's all there is to one of his books, it's usually a lot shorter. When he does it in epic format (&quot;It&quot;, &quot;The Stand&quot;), he does a &quot;Herman Wouk of horror&quot; number with a heavy-duty story and a whole lot of people involved--the horror aspect is just the nature of the dilemma his protagonists face, the same way Wouk's Henry family faced World War II (&quot;Winds Of War&quot;) and Ferber's Benedict family faced social changes in Texas (&quot;Giant&quot;). Another thing King should watch out for is overuse of school bully scenarios as subplots--in this case, Our Heroes' rescue of a retarded kid who was being picked on when they were kids. 25 or 30 years ago, society in general was a lot more sympathetic towards the weak than it is now. Despite the greater number of mechanisms in place to help the unfortunate, there tends to be a grassroots &quot;human garbage&quot; mentality towards individuals who don't fit in nowadays--sort of a social Darwinism that might have many readers wondering why King brings the juvenile human predator issue into so many of his books. Personally, I don't find it off-putting, but then again I used to be a liberal. And King needs to address a wider readership than us &quot;compassion fascists&quot; if he wants to remain popular."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King is one of my top five favorite contemporary writers (along with John Irving, Richard Russo, Neil Gaiman, and Bruce Alexander, in case you're interested.) However, Dreamcatcher is one of my least favorite Stephen King novels. There are traces of the things that have made me a devoted SK reader, but they are scarce. Perhaps the best part of the novel is the character Duddits and the role he plays. A major weakness is the impression that much of the novel seemed to be written with Hollywood in mind. And while we have all reluctantly learned to expect grossness in SK novels, Dreamcatcher carries it to new extremes, and seriously hindered my ability to enjoy the novel. Don't expect anything approaching the greatness of The Stand or It or The Dark Tower series."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King, the brilliant author of so many wonderful stories has so disappointed me with this book. Curiousity of how he will end the story kept me going, but the horrible toilet references and boring military ego chapters made me cheer when I gratefully reached the end!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"As many of the reviewers here, I also have read everything King has written. I have not enjoyed many of his later novels, most specifically &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, nearly as much as earlier works. However, this book takes me back to the spirit of his earlier works...excellent writing, a pace that won't allow you to put the book down, and weird characters that you like, even at their worst. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it's great having Mr. King back!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Breaking my rule of never writing for a book with more than twenty reviews in grand style...Dreamcatcher is a textbook example of a Stephen King novel. This is either a very good thing or a very bad thing, depending on your point of view. I take the middle, and say that, while the King formula is entertaining, it does not challenge the reader in the way a horror novel can and should.This story begins in the classic King fashion, with a great deal of time spent getting to know a bunch of alchoholic, middle aged white guys before something bizzare happens to them. This time its extraterrestrials, making this King's take on War of the Worlds.The story begins when Jonesy, a college professor, nearly shoots a man who has been impregnated by an alien weasal-thing. These weasals gestate in the carrier's intestines, eventually exiting from the rear. Be prepared for some lovely descriptions of the victim's backside after the weasals are done with them.Dreamcatcher has a decidedly New Age twist, using a character with Downe's Syndrome as the focal point for a psychic connection between the four main players. His name is Duddits, and his story is the truly sad part of the book.I thought the ending of this novel was a bit pedantic, but overall Dreamcatcher is a solid effort by King. He weaves events from his own life into the narrative, one suspects that some of the weirder bits were written while in a percoset haze.Dreamcatcher should be considred along with Needful Things, the Stand, and the Dark Half as King's best."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher. Stephen King. New York, NY: Pocket Books, 2001, 879 pages.In reading \\"Dreamcatcher\\", I was somewhat mesmerized. Stephen King did an excellent job of capturing you at the very beginning. I was literally doing nothing but reading for hours at a time. There are many things within this book that just capture my attention and wouldn't let go. The contents include the lifelong friendship of four men, the overcoming of all too well known bullies (aliens), and the ever popular but never tiring feared invasion of an unprepared world by that unknown life force. Also while reading I didn't really see any real purpose but to entertain an audience of people who enjoy reading about terrifying alien stories. I may not be into to whole alien invasion thing, but this book really got be hooked.This book was significant to Stephen King for many different reasons. The references made to pain that one of the main characters Gary Jones (Jonesy) feels is a symbolism of the pain being felt by Stephen King. For Stephen King makes a reference to this in his afterward. He wrote the book during his six and a half months of recovery. So as you can see this book as some sort of outside preference beside that of the author's pure imagination.This story focuses on four men, who 25 years after rescuing a mentally disabled boy from a bunch of bullies, encounter some bullies of they're own. They must face death and hardship, but in the end it will be more than worth what was sacrificed. They are thrust into a situation with creature from another world. Their only hope is locked deep within their past and their dreamcatcher. The boy they save will help them in more ways than one. He will be the one that keeps them together even when they begin to drift apart. \\"He's holding on for us, Jonesy, I told you. Holding us together\\"(pg. 830). They will remember one thing over the years, \\"That was our finest hour.\\"(Pg.187).Now it's time for me to really tell you all what I personally thought of the book. First I will start off with how well the book went about achieving its goal of entertaining the reader. I personally think it did an excellent job. It captured my attention at the very beginning and kept me interested the whole way through. Next is the possibilities suggested by this book. The whole invasion thing makes you wonder what would really happen if that occurred. The book gets you thinking about the planet we live on and the creatures lurking in the darkness of space. I haven't really read many other books on the subject of alien invasion, but of the ones I have read I would have to say that this is the best one by far. Stephen King puts a lot of description in his writing. You uses quite a bit of foreshadowing so you kind of get an idea of what's going to happen next, but you are still left surprised when something happens that you didn't expect.For my final take I would rate this book with an about an A. It did flow extremely well and gave you a vivid picture of what's happening, but some of the parts you read kind of make you think they were almost put in there for no particular reason at all. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good alien invasion mixed with a bit of struggle between lifelong friends. If you've seen the movie and liked it you will most definitely like the book. It's a bit long and drawn out, but a great read overall."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Jonesy, Beaver, Henry and Pete are four young friends who save a boy named Duddits, who has Down's Syndrome, from some older bullies. From that day on they become his protectors, much to the delight of the boy's parents.Somehow, from the day of the rescue, the five are bound together by a some kind of telepathy, which carries on into their adult lives. Then Jonesy has an accident and barely escapes with his life. The accident changes him. Beaver, Henry and Pete also undergo life-changing experiences. But, sadly, unknown to them, Duddits has developed a form of leukemia. He cries out to his friends, but his mental cries go unheard.For nearly sixty years aliens have been visiting Earth, but the United States government has been keeping a lid on it. Then our four friends go hunting when a spacecraft is shot down. The government puts the military in charge of the area.A hunter, with a strange fungal growth on his cheek and an even stranger growth in his belly, seeks help from the four friends as soldiers round up civilians in the area. Their god-fearing commander takes his crusade to a personal and terrifying level and, as a three-way battle ensues, it becomes obvious to the friends that only Duddits can save the world, but Duddits is dying.DREAMCATCHER is Stephen King at his absolute best. Reading this book was like it was all those years ago with I first read IT or the TOMMYKNOCKERS. I just can't give it any more praise than that. If you're a fan of Mr. King's, you know what I'm talking about. And if you're not a fan, you should be."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"In the past I was not a fan of Mr. King but in the past year that has began to change. If you have felt this way about him you might try revisiting him in this novel,you will be pleasently surprised. I liked this novel as it had good pace and was very readable (not as in some of his past works that were, to put it kindly, a little wordy.) Still sticking to the tried and true formula of good versus evil has served the author in good stead. I doubt that he would like the compliment but I think that Mr King is maturring nicely and becoming a really good author. Great book outstanding reading!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book was excellent, as soon a you open the book you're plunged into this riveting story. The story line goes: Four childhood friends reunite every year for a deer hunting trip. A stranger stumbles into their camp and something inside him eats it way out. Soon the creature begins spreading a virus that they call Byrus, or Ripley. Near by an alien force is taking over Jonsey, one of the four friends and uses his body to spread the Byrus. A downs syndrome child named Duddits is a childhood friend of the four boys. He helps them when they are on the run to get Mr. Gray before he contaminates New England with the Byrus.This was an extraordinary work of art that had me on the edge on my seat the whole way through, from start to finish, through all 870 pages. The story had quite a lot of gore in it in my opinion, but that didn't take away from that. I vastly recommend this book to any one who is just getting into Stephen King, or any other fan."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I suggest this book, it is simply another great stories from Stephen King, kind of diferent from his field, but still amazing.It is the story about a group of childhood friends that have some paranormal powers, and they got in the way of a kind of desease that it is cuase by Aliens. They gather their power to solve the mistery behind this invasion.In this book you will feel the love that this childhood friend have from each other, specially with Doddit."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Life imitates art. Or is it the otherway around? Stephen King, who is known for bringing to life vital and believable characters confronted with often horrific or supernatural experiences, is vitally present in this novel about an alien invasion on Earth.Stephen King wrote this book while recovering from a severe car accident that nearly cost him his life. His experience shows up in one of the principal characters in this story, who is nearly killed early on when struck by a car in much the same fashion King was hit.I mention this experience because King's writing is such a dynamic reflection of the real world, despite the situations his characters are almost always placed in. In this novel, King introduces us to four men, whose lives are brought together and forever changed by a single act of childhood heroism, a theme common in many of his works (Stand By Me, It). As adults, these same men travel to Northern Maine where they engage in a renewal of their friendship through acts of male bonding. It is on this trip that their lives are interrupted and changed forever by an otherworldly force that attacks each of them in a different way.I have to recommend this book, but not only for the story. Although King tells a good tale, it is his characters that make this story work. One of the central characters becomes (spoiler ahead) &quot;possessed&quot; by an alien bacteria, and is forced to carry out the actions of the invading alien army. What makes the story interesting is that much of the narrative takes place in the character's mind. We see the world through his thoughts, memories and shared experiences with the alien invader, and King paints a vivid set of images through the careful crafting of his words.For those of you who read this review, I hope that you will heed my advice here and invest the time in reading the book before viewing the movie. The movie, which is loosely based on this novel, detracts in a lot of ways from King's story in that it simplifies the characters to non-dimensional puppets in an alien invasion. The book is complex, cleverly written with plenty of humor and wit, and enough horror to keep the reader on the edge of his/her seat for many hours. This book is definitely one of the stronger efforts by King, and should be given the credit for which it is due.Definitely worth the time and money, and as with so many of King's works, better as the written word than a movie.Scott Kolecki"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"King's best? Perhaps, starts with four buddies on a hunting trip in the woods, when they meet an apparantly wounded stranger, or if not wounded something isn't right with him. Turns out his body was taken over by an alien &quot;Gray&quot;. This plot has been described as X-Filesque, and why not King did write an episode after all, and Carter and King while Carter was one of prime time tv ppl seemed to have an almost symbiotic relationship for awhile.Before I travel too far off on the tangent let me get back to my point. King's writing seems to get stronger and stronger. His storie's illuminate him as being an everyman, and who better to write about the &quot;everyman&quot;. The quartet in this tale's narrative travel's back and forth in chronology proving that even as he hits middle(late?) age King still can relate and tell the story of young people.Above all else this is the story of friendship, and hope in times of darkness, while some readers may not have found it particularly scary there were times even during my second reading when I felt definitely creeped out as only King can do.This book while exploring many elements that makes King such an incredible horror novelist may appeal to non-horror fans with strong stomachs though because of aforementioned theme, and King's classy writing style."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dont let the bad reviews stop you from reading this book. Its starts out as four friends from Derry (If you are a HUGE King fan, then you know this town pretty well and the things that haunt the people who live in Derry.) who befriend a down syndrome kid. So as the friends get older, and move on with their lives, they then go to a hunting lodge every year to go hunting in the Maine woods. Then one of the friends discover a man that has been wondering in the woods for at least the past couple of days, but then he talks about the strange lights in the shy. Then when he went to go use the bathroom, a alien being came out of his (...) and goes around killing the two friends.The two friends then escape only to find a UFO has crashed in the woods, and one survived. So then comes the military to the Maine woods to find and kill the alien that has crashed landed on earth, but one alien has SURVIVED!So the alien that Mr. King calls Mr.Gray then gets ahold of Jonesey and now it is the chase to find Jonesey who is heading to Derry. So now as this fungus is spreading around called Ripley, anyone that is infected with the disease is now being quaritined in this farmhouse by the military presence there.The novel is quite gripping and worth reading, but the ending is good nonetheless."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher was my first Stephen King novel. It was reccomended to me by a friend and I was very pleased with it. Why did I give it 4/5? It is confusing, childish at times, annoying, slow, and not very scary. Other than that it was a supremely satisfying book. An interesting par of the bok is that it is written in 3rd peron but changes the person to follow, so you can get many different points of view from a single scene. I liked it, but if you have never read a Stephen King book, try &quot;The Shining&quot;. It is classic King and genuinely scary."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The best summary for Dreamcatcher is that it ended up as typical Stephen King fare. For me, that is not a good thing. I have always felt that King writes novels by taking some fairly simple--perhaps weird, perhaps scary, but still relatively simple--ideas and milking them for all they are worth. I nearly always come away feeling cheated, that the time spent was not worth the final result. Dreamcatcher fits right into this theme.With Dreamcatcher, King takes the ever-ready body snatcher formula, mixes in some really crude and disgusting bodily functions (...from Alien, with a twist only a twelve-year-old boy would appreciate), pours on some completely undeveloped aliens and the generic military crazy guy, tries to spice it up with a poor pinch of biochemistry, and winds up with a labored and predictable car chase. It ends up being a mess. How bad can the book get? When King runs out of old ideas he can muck up, he comes up with stuff like: the human memory becomes, literally, a storage room full of filing cabinets.Still, Dreamcatcher has more than enough to get you going, and to not want to put it down for quite a while. King has some very good characterizations, and an interesting storyline, with a group of boys/men that are psychologically connected somehow. The story of these men as teenagers would make the book worth reading except for its excessive length.So a great start with some pretty bad plot devices through the middle, unfortunately running into a long, predictable chase scene at the end; King just peters out with hundreds of pages to go. Unless you are a Stephen King fan, I recommend picking up something more worth your time."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This was not one of King's best works. It bogged down in the middle, the chase scenes were too long. He could of trimmed a fifth of the book and it would of been better and more enjoyable. I know that not all his books are as good as his others and that's acceptable. I will look forward to the Black House coming in September."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I was a die-hard SK fan until about 4 books ago. He's lost his touch.

DREAMCATCHER is at once mesmerizing and terrifying, gentle and genuinely human.

Not new territory for King, yet it felt as though he was taking chances, both with the bones of the story and the language he uses. There is one military character who drove me nuts, and I agree with the reviewer who reminded us that King isn't Tom Clancy. But I'll bet this character was fun to write. My advice to other readers: Read this book on its own merits and try not to compare it too much with King's other novels. As irrisistible as that might be, considering where Dreamcatcher takes place . . . and what it's about . . ."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher is the best King in years! Here he takes us on a wild ride thru the New England woods during hunting season. Having read all of his published works, some of which were less than great, this book makes up for all of those. Kings ability to create characters and flesh them out, so that you can SEE them and KNOW them is unbelievable. Devoted King readers will see some familiar places and names and new King readers will be introduced to things that they will never forget. This book hooked me by about page 8. I plowed through it in 3 days and couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this one, dear readers, Stephen King is back!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I have been a fan of King's work for many years, and found this latest effort from him did not disappoint. I finished it yesterday, and it's still lingering in my head, as good writing often does. King has the rare ability to take a reader into the plot of his work so that we feel we are a part of the story, and the real world falls away around us as we read. This novel shows how King is maturing as a writer, while still providing fans with the things they love.It's the story of four boyhood friends, and a fifth friend who binds them together for life, and into death as well. King speaks so well to the masculine soul, it's always a bit of a guilty pleasure to see into the minds of the men he presents to us, as in many ways they are &quot;everyman&quot; with their typical male behavior. These four men begin their adventure with a hunting trip out in the woods of Maine, but a routine male bonding weekend it's not, once the spaceship full of an alien fungus known as the &quot;byrus&quot; crash lands into the woods. The plot, a bit meditative at first, ramps into full blown military response at this point, and all hell breaks loose in northern Maine. But through the twists and turns of fate and time, through the simple love of a boyhood friend, and the shining strength of the human spirit, the world is literally saved from a fate worse than death.It's a lovely story. King likes to make us think a bit now, as he's getting older and feeling his mortality a little. In the past he was content to have us react, now we need to think about why we are reacting, and how. And I like that a lot. Anyone who fluffs King off as not being a serious writer obviously hasn't read his work lately. All in all this is an excellent effort from one of my all-time favorite authors, and I recommend it highly. Don't hesitate, buy it!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I eagerly anticipated the new King book as I always do when one of his books comes out. Sadly, &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; was just not up to par.

I love his characters and I love the nightmares of humanity his books force you to embrace. But I will not be embracing anything but another book on my bookshelf from this novel. The only reason I rated this 3 stars was because Stephen King's name was on the front cover, and any book with that deserves at least 3. In my opinion, this book was ridiculous and left much to be desired. Like the other novel based in Derry after It, Insomnia, this novel was lacking in true plot and real, identifiable characters. Derry is a place of nightmares and in the middle of the night horror, and Dreamcatcher, which by the way, drew me in by the name of Derry, did not live up to the reputation. Perhaps it was because the little portion of the book actually in Derry had little to do with the wanting plot and outcome anyway. I feel that Stephen King used the name simply to draw devout readers into buying the novel, if the fact that it was his first novel after his accident alone did not give reason enough. Dreamcatcher killed off the more interesting characters within a few hundred pages, and left you with dry shells of characters past. The plot was confusing and lacked the spice of a true King thriller. I haven't been impressed with any of his more recent novels, and this one truly disgusted me with its lack of preparation and editing. The profanity and vulgarity which is usually amusing and helpful to his novels was downright pathetic as it was used everyother word in Dreamcatcher, and it hardly made up for his inattention to the more important matters which could have been focused into to create at least a decent novel. If King truly wants to recreate a Derry thriller, he needs to stop throwing out these wayward, ridiculous stories such as Insomnia and Dreamcatcher, which have the redeeming grace of mentioning happenings from It in each, and find a way to bring It back in some form. Even then, it would take a miracle to salvage the disappointment true King fans have felt during these dark times and immature stories we have been given."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I started this book with great anticipation, however I have found it difficult to finish the last third of this book. I think he could have written the same piece more effectively if 1/2 of it was taken out! It started out with a bag, but then somehow lost it's steam."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Every chapter was a new direction and totally unpredictable."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is the first Stephen King book I have read and I believe it was relly good. Although its over 600 pages, its not too drawn out. I felt it slowed down during the chase part of the novel, but i felt overall it kept you threw it. Since it was the first I have read I do not have any comparisons to his other works. One reviewer criticized the obsentities, theyre are a lot but I truly feel without these, (they were portrayed through the characters) the characters would have looked less real, and some of them were funny. I was expecting more of ghosts, scary, type horror, but this novel dealt with aliens. King made it seem true, most of the time, not fake and too unbelievable. Overall a very good book."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Yes. You've been here before.Read the Tommyknockers? If so, you've pretty much read Dreamcatcher. The story is essentially the same--aliens come and inhabit the bodies of humans, and find the humans tougher than they thought. In the end the aliens lose--but at just the last minute--the last second.The best part of this book is the characters' development and clarity. The plot is overused, and the suspense doesn't build to a sufficient crescendo. The characters, however, are deep and clear and true.Far from his best work, this book is also far from King's worst. If you're a sci-fi buff or a King enthusiast, give this book a try."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King did his best in the days of &quot;The Stand&quot; and &quot;It.&quot; Lately (the past couple of years or so) he's average, at best. Dreamcatcher was disappointing due to its tired &quot;flashbacks&quot; and lack of a moving plot. He's still a master of words and sentence structure, but he's lost his old &quot;exciting plot&quot; ability. AND, don't even watch any TV or movie programs in which he was a co-producer!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher is an average or slightly above average science fiction novel, but it doesn't even compare to Stephen King's classics. This is the story of four childhood friends who reunite for their annual hunting trip, and are confronted with an extraterrestrial nightmare. Their hunting spot is in the middle of an area that is infested with disgusting alien creatures that grow inside a person's stomach and then burrow out of their bowels when they are fully developed. The four friends must use psychic powers that they gained through their close relationship with a Down's-syndrome kid in order to fight off the invasion. The characters in this book are excellent, but the story could have been told in far less time. The book is almost 900 pages. Still, the length isn't the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that the story is far more disgusting than it is scary or even interesting. If you don't like hearing about bloody bowel movements, stay far away from this book. If that's not a problem for you, go ahead and give it a try."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"DREAMCATCHER caught me off guard. I truly expected it to be another fantasy/Drama like the last few stories SK has written, namely Hearts in Atlantis, Bag of Bones, and The Green Mile. Man was I in for a shock. After reading this book I was shocked to see how deep I had delved into the story and how truly intense and gory the entire thing was. DREAMCATCHER is a gruesome, gory, and all around violent book, but it is also a thoughtful book with a psychological battle to the death fit snuggly in the center of the whole Mele. Mr Gray is one of the most intriguing characters ever writen about, period, in my humble opinion (and Kurtz one of Kings most bland, but still memorable). The battle between Jonsey and Mr. Gray just seems to accelerate page after page, and when Mr. Gray kills people it is done in such sparse intervals and subtle timing that it only serves to enhance the overall violence shock factor. In addition to the great psychological theme, the book also shined in one other aspect; character development and interaction. By the end of the book I ended up loving Duddits, Henry, and even Beaver (you'll know why when you read the book), and the interactions between these characters make for some truly touching moments. The book is also rife with motifs that stick with you long after you have finished the book, and there are a few phrases that truly help humanize and personalize the story (No bounce, No play - Hello Darkness, my old friend). The one thing I actually didn't like about the book was it's title, I think the working title CANCER would have captured the overall feel and message of the story much better than DREAMCATCHER which seems too positive and only deals with some aspects of the entire book (for instance it doesn't truly reflect anything about the alien invasion premise) while leaving others untouched.Overall the book is excellent, one of Kings best (right up there with IT, The Shining, and Dolores Claiborne)and a definite \\"must read\\" for any supposed SK fan, or avid reader in general. If you want a suspensfully told tale with a mind-blowing, thought provoking plot, and lots of heart to boot, DREAMCATCHER is for you."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King visits more misery upon Derry, Maine, in his first full-length novel since Bag of Bones.Twenty-five years ago, four friends (Beaver, Henry, Pete and Jonesy) showed an uncanny heroism that made them a fifth friend for life in Duddits. He's a special boy who, unlike them, can't quite leave childhood behind.When the four men gather for their annual hunting trip in the Maine woods, a paralyzing blizzard descends and brings with it a menace never before seen on earth. A disoriented stranger stumbles upon their cabin, bearing a disturbing rash on his face and wild tales of lights in the sky. But before they can challenge this unknown evil, they must first escape the Army detail that has been sent to try to contain it, and then bring Duddits back into their circle.In a thrilling race against the storm and a ruthless alien force, all five of the friends must bond together once again to save Maine, and ultimately the world, from a final, unspeakable horror. The key lies somewhere in their shared pasts-and in the dreamcatcher.Dreamcatcher is a full-bodied story that will captivate fans and mesmerize anyone so far unfamiliar with the depth of Stephen King's dark imagination. King reminds us that we forge bonds in our friendships that go far beyond what we see, hear and feel. He asserts that we connect with each other in unimaginable ways that can't be easily explained; yet we secretly crave and might someday need those connections. Reminiscent of The Stand in its depth and scope, Dreamcatcher snares the reader and satisfies both the need and the craving-you'll find yourself inextricably bonded with the people and events to the very last word of this exciting book."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I read the book once and read it again.I think it's absolutly marvelous!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"First off, I will admit to being an unashamedly loyal Stephen King fan. In my humble opinon, even the most medicore of King still makes for entertaining and enjoyable reading. The best of King is downright awesome. That being said, I was amused by some of the negative reviews of this book. Some feel that only die-hard King fans would enjoy it. I strongly disagree. I am most definitely not a sci-fi fan, and began reading Dreamcatcher with that in mind. But this is so much more than your typical alien-invades-earth-tries-to-take-over genre. This story is, in fact, a complex and mind-bending hero's journey epic. Knowing that King wrote this book while recuperating from his almost fatal accident could explain the deeply probing questions raised in the story. King himself was probably asking himself the very same questions. What does it really mean to be human? Is our humanity a good thing or a burden we must carry? It's true that the story takes some getting used to. It jumps back and forth in time, moving from character to character. The reader needs to become familiar with each character and their role in the story. Four childhood friends, bound together by an act of courage as young boys, find themselves once again bound together as adults in the face of the potential end of life on earth as they knew it. In this book, King has created one of the most incredible and deep characters in recent literature - Douglas (aka Duddits) Clavel, a simple boy with Down's Syndrome, who becomes a pivotal presence, the glue that holds everything together. The story is, to be sure, so complex that at times the reader can become somewhat confused. But I found that, for the most part, that confusion did not detract from the story, and, even if some parts didn't make total sense, I simply moved on and was able to pick up keep going. All the characters, good and bad, are brilliantly developed. There is no doubt that this story is more cerebral than some of King's other novels, and for that reason, will not be for everyone. I started it with the assumption that it would probably not be one of my King favorites, but in the final analysis, I discovered that it was. I suspect that most readers will either love it or hate it. The reviews tend to uphold that theory. It was for me, a deeply satisfying experience."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"My review will probably echo ideas many people have given, but they are true: I thought the book was a little bit long and drawn out. The chase scene from Maine to the Quabbin was much too long! The overall premise of the book has potential, kind of an &quot;alien bodysnatcher&quot; theme, but I didn't find much to be excited about with the characters, or plot. At least as far as King's standards go. Were it another less prestigous author I might have given it more credit, but King's standards are way too high! Echoed too many plots/themes of past books like &quot;It,&quot; &quot;Tommyknockers,&quot; and &quot;The Stand&quot; for example. Better luck next time Mr. King !"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"For a man recovering from a horrible accident, this book was magnificant! I've read nearly everything SK has written, and this ranks right near the top. Finished it in 2 days. While it's not as gripping as the Talisman, it is definitely a page-turner and a must read for any true King fan."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The shame of Stephen King is that he is now a better writer than he was twenty years ago.His characters are much more fleshed out and have infinetely more depth.The problem is that he is flat out of ideas.He has become so predictable and repetitive and melodramatic it is disheartening.Maybe I've read one book too many of King.In fact I've read them all,and this one is down there with &quot;Christine&quot;,&quot;The Regulators&quot;,&quot;Desperation&quot; and &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot; as the worst and least inspired of his works.I guess King and his genre of writing wear thin once you've passed the age of 14 or so,because that is the last time his work gave me the goosebumps or made me think there was anything profound in his writing.He may be the bestselling writer on Earth,but it is certainly not on the merits of his literary prowess.He has become an institution and lifelong fans will buy anything he releases.I'm an old fan but the old King has become threadbare."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher is one of his recent books written right after the near-fatal accident where Steve King presented a very interesting concept on how our brain works. Good, if not for the appalling packaging. Snip: (...)"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I tried. I did. I read 150 pages of this book before growing bored and vaguely repulsed. If you enjoy numerous bloated, over-inflated descriptions of bodily functions (stinky burps and farts), you'll love this book. The characters were dull and poorly defined (I kept mixing them up), the pace was glacial, and the plot dull. And I generally love Stephen King. I think he wrote this as therapy, as one of the characters was recovering from a near-fatal car accident. But it wasn't very entertaining."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Maybe, if I'd not be a big Stephen King-fan, I'd say 'Dreamcatcher' is a average novel, good entertainment, whatever. But unfortunately I'm not and so I have the heavy task for the first time ever not praising a King-novel. And even this is an understatement. I can not only not praise it, I also have to say how bad it is. Having read every King-book I have to say, even if there were some not-so-good ones, there never was a bad one. Never.But there is 'Dreamcatcher' now (in german it's called for no real reason 'Duddits') and my disappointment about this book started after reading about 100 pages.The story: four since-childhood-friends are on their yearly hunting trip. There discover a confused hunter, who is sick. They find out the forest their in is contamined and the military is guarding it. So they have to look for help by their old, retarted friend, Duddits.If this sounds a bit confusing then because it is. These summary is only superficial. Let's see, we have four childhood friends who have to face they grew old, a retarted friend, telepathy, military, aliens, a lot of farting and even more clich&eacute;s. If this sounds too much for one book, then because it definitely is.King never really was the master of clich&eacute;s, but here he shows that he can put one after another. The retarted friend is the real genius, the military colonel is pure evil, the aliens are either flesheating aliens or mind-telepathists.The book in a whole is unbelievable from beginning to the end. It's also really annoying. How much do you want to read about people who fart more and more until they die very unpleasant? For me, one sentence was enough, but it lasted till the very end. The book is also unnecessary brutal and violent. It's not a somehow necessary violence as in earlier books, but seems just to be there for the effect.The evil General Kurtz (yes, Kurtz) only wants to kill, prays a lot and doesn't like sex. Duddits, the retarted, is funny and everyone just loves him and besides that he's brilliant. Government betrays us, aliens are evil as always and the past never lets you go.I rarely saw such unnecessary flashbacks. There are so many hints to the past that I really wondered: why? When the stories are told finally, you never know why they should be important.The book is a poor mixture of It, Tommyknockers, any Alien-monster-story, any Alien-mindpeople-story and Rain Man.It's hard to summarize the problem of the book. It's very confused and full of clich&eacute;s and sometimes boring. Even the usual references to other books seem faked.King writes in the end, that he wrote the book after his heavy accident. I have the poor hope, that this is not only the reason for the quality of this book, but maybe he'll write a better one now. His last good book was 'Hearts in Atlantis' and before that 'The Green Mile' (and of course the Dark Tower). But there also was the unecessary 'Tom Gordon', the flat 'Storm of the Century', the money-maker 'On Writing', the bad 'Insomnia'-copy 'Bag of Bones' and now 'Dreamcatcher. At first I thought I like his books less, because I grew older. But now I think it's him. It's really a pity."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book caught my attention the first 300 or so pages and then I was totally lost. What in the world! King was all over the place and there were so many characters that I couldnt keep up with them all! I am not real big on alien books but I thought that I could at least deal with it some but this was so stupid that I just quit reading it. I just wasted my reading time on this book.

The story just didn't seem to gel together and at the point I put it down a truly out-there thing had just happened in the story which I just couldn't buy into.I recently re-read Bag of Bones for the third time, also by Stephen King, and it was just light-years better than this book...don't waste your time with Dreamcatcher, read Bag of Bones instead!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I have read almost all of stephen kings books and of all that i have read this is by far the worst.

The story of the four friends was very interesting and started to develop but then it sort of got lost in details and cryptic telepathic descriptions.

Needless to say, this didn't work for long, and I eventually had to come to terms with reality: Dreamcatcher is not very good. What amazed me was that the prologue contains some of King's best writing (I can only assume that the prologue and the rest of the novel were written at separate times). My advice to you is this: read the prologue while enjoying a coffee at your nearest bookseller / cafe. Purchase something else, such as Hearts in Atlantis (which is, in my opinion, one of King's best!)"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This was a very enjoyable book.

His writing and plotting were in peak form. Unfortunately, &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; fails to keep the streak going. While it starts off fast and furious, it runs out of gas about halfway through. The plot threads seem to unravel at various times. Try as he might, King can't maintain the suspense. Part of the problem may be that he has returned to familiar territory with this novel, and many of his old tricks just don't trick anymore."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I looked forward to this book like crazy. It got off to a slow start then picked up and then it went right down hill again. I kept speed reading through some of the pages-something you should never do-but it was so bad.

I bought it as i have all of SK's books and will continue to buy them, sometimes he can suprise you. but let this one rot on the bookshelves. it will never go out of print, i mean Geralds Game is stll around (what a howler that one was).

The way he shows the action and envelopes you in the story is what makes him one of the great all-time authors of today.

A fear unknown to most, but known to only those who have read the book..the amazing book i must announce. This bad, evil ridance has been building up inside me. The stabbing knife is forcing this out and now it's here...your murder day. Dreamcatcher is beyond our minds. It is not what we see because only THEY see it. The line seperates us from them, as if they were aliens, but they are us...they are humane. As for those of you who have not read it, you will be shocked by it's meaning.... to be catched in it, to be grasped by it means your soul will be hung from the wire, as the words dreamcatcher run along the lines and strings.

Stephen King apparently wrote this while he was recovering from a car accident, and you can definitely tell from the 500 pages of incessant rambling that is a pathetic excuse for character development. The other 200 pages are actually used for good scary plot development, which is not much, but it prevented me from burning this damn thing. In this 700 page monster chalk full of gore and utterly repulsive images, I could sense a trace of good ideas smothered under meaningless words which is why i give this 2 stars instead of 1.

Also as usual there are more parentheses in this book (and aren't those annoying and mostly include things that could just be edited out without ever missing them?) than there are in any other ten books you'll pick up. If a paragraph (and there are pleny of paragraphs in a book, you dig?) is longer than five or six lines, it's a good bet there's a parenthesis in there.The last ten King books I've read with an almost overpowering urge to do so with a yellow marking pen and highlight what I would take out if I were King's editor. It's getting to be a real problem for me now. I'll read a page (35 lines or so) and think: I could cut out three of these lines and no one would miss them. Then, in this fantasy of mine, I'd flick through the pages of the book and see all that yellow flash by. I think I could have cut this 620 page book down to at least 550.

Stephen King is arguably the best fiction writer working today . . . as far as his writing skills are concerned, he's truly a master of the craft. So that is the reason, I surmise, that he's been able to get away with few novels (IT springs immediately to mind -- beginning is good, but ending is literally horrible) whose plots range from passable to downright ridiculous. And that is, I think, also why he has always been such a terific short story and novella writer; his collections Night Shift, Different Seasons, Skeleton Crew, and Nightmares and Dreamscapes probably belong to the best works of horror/mainstream fiction ever published. As to DREAMCATCHER now -- writing is as always superb, but the plot seemed a little too familiar. Not only has he written about alien invasions and &quot;troubled teenagers battling monster from outer space&quot; before, the whole structure of the book reminds me of at least several earlier Stephen King books. I wouldn't go so far as to calling him self-indulgent, but he should think of new subjects to write about if he is to remain the &quot;king of horror&quot; in the new millenium."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"First of all, most of the reviews containing 3 stars are by ... who have read Mr. King's newer material but have never bothered to pick up some of his older stuff. For those of us who have been following SK since way back, Dreamcatcher just reinforces our belief that he is the King. Tommyknockers anyone? That book terrified the hell out of me in my teens, as did many others, and Dreamcatcher has somehow magically transported me back in time to when literature made me nervous and had me making sure the door was locked. Maybe it's because I'm interested in the supernatural and maybe it's because I'm an open-minded person. Whatever the reason, I'm enjoying this book thoroughly and feel like I owe Stephen King a personal thanks for keeping me interested, and fullfilling my desire for more great literature.

Unfortunately for them, the forests surrounding the cabin have become home to aliens who invade humans' bodies and try to take them over. When a lost hunter comes to their door for assistance, the nightmare really begins. Now the foursome has to fight for their lives to defeat the aliens, costing some of them their lives.The remaining friends begin to realize there is some kind of connection between the aliens, themselves, and Duddits, a man with Downs Syndrome, who in some unknown way cemented the bond between the four. They now have to get to the bottom of plans of Mr. Gray, the alien who has taken over one of the four. Telepathic abilities aid in their quest, helping the reluctant heroes to find the key to the alien's destruction.As always, Stephen King gets to the depth of the story, twisting everything around so readers have no idea what is coming next. Dreamcatchers is more sci-fi psychological thriller than horror, but never fails to strike fear in to the hearts and heads of his readers. In addition to scaring fans senseless, he explores the deepest realms of the psyche, representing how there is no stronger weapon then one's own mind.Duddits is the most interesting of all the players, though for much of the book, he is only present through flashbacks and memories. Readers are drawn to this enigmatic person, wanting to know just what exactly is his connection, other than being the method through which \\"Beav,\\" Pete, Henry, and \\"Jonesy\\" reinforce their relationships, to the story, and why exactly his very name strikes fear in Mr. Gray."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King's Dreamcatcher is a novel about friendship, and survival.

To Beaver and Jonesy's surprise, they discover a weasel -like creature emerging from the back of the dead stranger.After much struggle, Jonesy manages to escape from the creature alive while Beaver is killed by it. Jonesy is then shocked to see another mysterious creature that identifies himself as Mr. Gray. At this point, Mr. Gray transforms himself into red dust which Jonesy inhales. By doing so, Mr. Gray is able to take control of Jonesy's body in which he is able to carry out his mission.Meanwhile, Commander Kurtz and his team are set up in the woods and have been destroying the unidentified creatures that have crashed on earth, unaware that one has survived.It is now up to Jonesy, Henry, and Pete to stop Mr. Gray from achieving his goal- destroying all of humanity. The friends discover that survival is hidden in their past and in the dreamcatcher, which has come to represent their bond of friendship.While I enjoyed this book very much, there were parts where it got confusing or when one event in the book carried on for too long. For example, the chase between Jonesy/ Mr. Gray, Henry, and Kurtz, lasted more than six chapters. Another example is when Henry tries to convince a military officer to kill Kurtz and stop Mr. Gray. Other than those parts, I enjoyed reading Dreamcatcher because of the suspense, the terror, and creative approach. Instead of a physical battle, it is a mental battle since the friends have ESP- Extra Sensory Perception- and are able to communicate with one another and the alien. This works to their advantage because they are able to go into their past and present together mentally in order to destroy Mr. Gray.My favourite part is the end, where Henry has to stop Mr. Gray. I would recommend this book to people ages 11 to adult who love having the hair on their back stand up."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Many think that King has lost the magnificance he once had, but i disagree; i think sometimes he writes good books, sometimes he writes bad. Even in the earlier stages there were rubbish stinkers such as \\"The Tommyknockers\\" and \\"Christine\\", and the novel written before this, \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\", was pretty dire. This is a book that will either make you hate King more or love him again.Its got all the King cliches: phsycic links between characters, extreeme horror and gore, a holster of characters ranging from handicapped heroes to insane villains, and so on. Whether you like it or not really depends on whether you can accept aliens bursting out of peoples arses, and if you mind reading what is essentially all of King's previous work thrown into a melting pot with 'thrill ride' written on the side of it.Despite its slightly juvenile concept and unorigonality, it has got some very well developed characters, some very thrilling chase sequences, a very clever and exciting finale and some moving moments. With all that in mind, i think it's certaintly worth the read. You will finish the book, put it down and let out a long sigh of relief, not because you want it to be over, but because it's so gripping and exciting. It's another case of pick up a King book, suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride. You may like it, you may not, it depends. There's only one way to find out."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher is the story of a group of 4 friends that come of age \\"twice\\" with the help of a special boy. The special friend they make gives them each an insight that gives them abilities to read minds, find lines for lost trails or items and a connection that holds them together through adulthood. This group of friends takes a hunting trip each fall and this year is no different, until everything that could go wrong goes very wrong in an inter-galactic sort of way. Their special friend Duddits has been waiting for this day his whole life, and the insight he has given them is their power to try and make the world right again.This is a journey that you will love to take and friends that you will love to meet!

Over 1000 is my Eldorado. Stephen King did write a very good story but the pace is veeery slow. I had to press myself on and, I have to admit, if the book wasn't from King I wouldn't have finished it. I presume Stephen King has grown too big in the market that anyone still has the courage to tell him to take some really boring parts out. The story is King-like. Interesting, bloody, a bit vulgar at times and surely another body-snatcher-approach as usual. I like the story very much but as I said, it could be compressed in half the size and twice the thrill."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"All of King's books have found a home in my personal library, but &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; has been collecting dust.

Maybe they're just not that likeable ,so we don't really care what happens to them. I was encouraged ,at one point in the book, when the action returns to good old DERRY ,and a sign is found ,stating &quot;Pennywise Lives&quot; and I hoped ,that one of King's finest villians ,would be resurected, but no way!

One thing I really liked about &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; was the ending. I have sometimes felt disappointed with Stephen's endings that often show the evil losing to the story's hero(es), but hinting that the evil has actually survived and moved on. Geez, my tongue itches."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I loved this book! I have been a Stephen King reader for years and years, and this one is in my top five!Why? Because I liked it! As always in King's novels, the characters are the story; the plot is merely in the background. These four (make that five!) have a bond so strong that they can take on creatures from another planet. Of course I can't say much about it without giving away the story but, trust me, it's a hunting trip (and the lovable and ultra special fifth person) that you'll never forget.OK. Yes. It didn't have the same depth as his other novels and it's not so much of a struggle between good and evil. It's an easy read, but some part do send a chill up yout spine.Trust me! It's worth it!K"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Having been an on and off Stephen King fan for many years, I picked this book up pretty quick. I had heard both good and bad comments about this one, so I wasn't sure what I was in for. I was so amazed by the first hundred pages. The way in which we are introduced to our main characters is brilliant. The flashbacks to childhood days in Derry are well timed and never grow repetitive.What will stick with my are the suttle and not so suttle references to Conrad's Heart of Darkness, as well as Apocalypse Now. Imagine Conrad's amazement at the story of the Congo River becoming Vietnam, and now the Maine wilderness.If you haven't read this yet, as Duddits would say, &quot;got some work to do now.&quot;"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is the first novel by Stephen King I have read and it was really great to read. I dealt with aliens, which I am assuming is a bit different from most of the author's previous novels. But the plot and subplots were really indepth and fascinating.

Overall, a really fun book to read."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am very fond of Stephen King novels. This particular novel is unbeatable, about 4 young boys who once stood together and saved a retarded boy. Now all 4 boys are adults, who get together once a year and go hunting. But this time is different.This time a man who is lost, disorientated and muttering about lights in the sky stumbles into their camp. Before long, these old friends will be plunged into the most remarkable time of their lives, and will be forced to fight a creature from another world. King's writing style is brilliant yet again, and I recommend this book for people over the age of 16."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"After reading over some of the reviews for this book, I noticed that everyone seems to be comparing it Tommyknockers. Dreamcatcher reminded me more of The X-Files. Ok X-Files fans lets see it this plot line sounds familiar. Aliens from space come to Earth to spread an intelligent virus so \\"it\\" can take over the planet. King did write an X-File story with Chris Carter a couple of years ago. Maybe Carters influence rubbed off a little more then he knew. But if you're going to borrow from your buddies at least do it with your own style, and that's what King has done. The book is written with Kings familiar characters, locations and dark since of humor. Thank you very much! This might not be one of his most thought provoking stories, like Apt Pupil or Hearts In Atlantis, but it's still a fun ride."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I had a hard time liking this book but I also had a hard time hating it. The book started with an interesting premise and then shifted to humdrum storytelling. Don't get me wrong there were several creative aspects, including an interesting pyschological battle. But there wasn't much else. The story seemed to stall and start towards the end, making it a tedious read. King's books are not racing thrillers but this book defied everything his books usually entail. I usually really enjoy the characters and can't wait for the conclusion but this time I might have cared less. In my opinion this book should have been shorter. A lot of complex situations interwoven can leave a reader feeling deeply satisfied when it is all over but this time it all lackd something. If you haven't read all of his other books read one you haven't already, they are better. If you must have it, check it out at the library or wait for paperback."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am an avid Stephan King fan and have read almost everything written by him and I thought this book was horrible. The initial story About the five friends is interesting but the description of the aliens being born out of people's butts is disgusting. I was so grossed out by the persistant description of flatulence accompanying the births too. This was also the most profane of his books with the F word on at least every page and the S word almost as much. It has too many unnecessary characters that are described in detail and then killed off 5 pages later. It was gory, gross, laden with profanity and mental plot lines that didn't make sense. Of course I did finish it being such a fan of his but I would not recommend anybody to waste their time reading this 600+ page book."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I have not read many Stephen King books and was leary of this one. I really enjoyed it. I was rivited from the start. This book grabs your attention and holds it. The surrounding drama is exciting but it is the underlying personal relationships that really make this book. I hope that no one trys to make a movie out of this book because there is no way to capture the thoughts and background in such a fantastic way. A job well done to Mr. King and I will venture into more of his books now."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"In the wake of Stephen King's near-fatal accident, he wondered whether he would be able to write again. He needn't have. DREAMCATCHER is as good as anything King has ever written -- maybe even better. I think those who are sniveling that this book isn't up to par aren't used to the depth of writing that this work reaches. Perhaps they are disappointed that the aliens didn't turn out to be green monsters with slime dripping from their mouths. King has created a much more insideous creature -- one that can invade the human mind, take control of the body and enslave the spirit. Much more than a &quot;monster book,&quot; DREAMCATCHER is about the nature of enduring friendship and the connections that bring people together. The character of Duddits is a wonderful metaphor for that. So if you're looking for a simple &quot;alien monster book,&quot; you will probably be as disappointed as those who have assigned one-star to DREAMCATCHER. But if you want something a little deeper and more meaningful, something to touch you on an emotional level (and still occasionally scare the hell out of you), you'll love this newest by the King."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I really enjoyed this alien invasion story. King weaves together many themes that he's previously used throughout his career, which can lead to some of the book feeling like a rehash of his earlier work, but I thought it works out overall. There are several tie-ins to his other books, especially IT. I'm thankful that I've recently read his earlier book so that it was fresh in my mind while reading this one."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"When the four guys come up and find the older kids abusing douglas it sounds like a subtil reference to the Dark Tower/Rose.Douglas is in a vacant lot and the description of this lot sounds so much like the vacant lot in NYC where Jake finds the rose. In both books the good guys want to protect the object in question. The Rose calms Jakes duality and allows him to regain sanity. Douglas has a similiar effect and serves the purpose of maintaning order in the Dreamcatcher world not unlike the rose and dark tower.Opinions?"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"DREAMCATCHER is King at his worst. The four childhood friends fighting against evil is hardly a new idea even within his own oeuvre and once again a saint like mentally disabled person shall lead them, giving King an opportunity to write some of his most inane dialogue ever. Aliens from outer space manifesting themselves as fungus or body snatchers or even intestinal parasites that will leave your body in the most graphic and disgusting manner imaginable just showcase the overall lack of originality found within the pages. Add in a single-mindedly obsessed army officer self named Kurtz if you can believe it, and you have the makings of a real disaster. Yet despite this King has a nasty way of making you want to keep reading. What could possibly happen next you wonder and even if you predicted the outcome, the man's talent for moving the reader through his novels is to be commended. Even when you get to the end and wonder, \\"Why'd I finish this thing?\\""},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"\\"This book was written with the world's finest word processor, a Waterman cartridge fountain pen. To write the first draft of such a long book by hand put me in touch with the language as I haven't been for years.\\"Almost 700 pages before I read those words, I noticed that Stephen King was very much in touch with the language. First I noticed his protagonists. Whoa. These are folks you can't stop reading about. So real. More real than people I know. Then, the language. Finally, well, it's about lights in the sky. It is DAMN hard to convince me to read another \\"ooh, bad aliens\\" story. King had no trouble whatsoever pulling me in, making me love living in his world, and refusing to let me go. Oh yeah, and these are probably the creepiest alien invaders he or anyone else has ever dreamed up. This is a seriously excellent book, somehow both keenly observant and seriously warped. Mr King, it is very good to have you back.By the way, I also have the DVD. I'll watch it soon. I can see so much potential to screw up the movie version that I simply had to read the book first."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King is a great storyteller, but Dreamcatcher is not one of his better efforts.This novel recycles many of King's elements--a character hit by a car (see King's own accident), a group of boyhood friends (see The Body, later made into the movie Stand by Me), a slow, goodhearted character with magical ability (see The Green Mile), and a group of characters who have a psychic connection (see The Stand or even the recent The Cell).The central premise of King's story is an alien invasion in the woods, and the subsequent attempts by the military to cover it up. King is a big fan of \\"The X-Files,\\" and you will notice some similarities. That's the main problem with this book--there is nothing fresh and original. You feel like you read it somewhere else before--in another King novel or an episode of \\"The X-Files.\\"Dreamcatcher, like all of King's works, is entertaining and a quick read--even if it is over 800 pages in paperback.This book was made into an even worse movie featuring Morgan Freeman and Jason Lee."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I have always been an huge S.K. fan. I was disappointed in this one, however. It starts out good, but towards the end it becomes long, drawn out and boring. I had to make myself finish it. The concept of the book is good, and had the latter part of the book flowed as easily as the first part, it would have been very good."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"It's true, after an absence from the wonderful world of horror, the King has returned. This novel has been promoted as King's return to his roots, it isn't. This is a brand new King. One who is every bit as capable of scaring you as the original but the writing is older, wiser, meaner. There are times in this novel when the writing reaches such an intensity that you can't tear yourself away from the book. The characters are incredibly well developed.They become part of your world as soon as you start reading and by the time you're done, it's as if you've known them your whole life. The friendship that Pete, Jonsey, Henry and Beaver share is the rare kind of friendship that only children can develop As they grow into adulthood, their bond is strengthened by the events they have conquered together. The character of Duddits is an almost angelic presence in all their lives, keeping them forever connected to a time when they did something good, a time when they were all beautiful. Each flashback to the boys' youth reveals more about the characters, as individuals and as a group. There is a strong undercurrent of emotion that runs through this novel.It is both heartbreaking and terrifying. It also strikes me as very personal since one of the main characters is recovering from a car accident in which he was struck down and suffered a broken hip. It's also a very psychological novel and a chunk of it takes place within the characters' minds.The dream sequences and telepathic interactions are fascinating. The main story is nicely summarized in the Amazon description above so I wont dwell on that. I must add however that the bad guy is very well written and an excellent character. General Kurtz is a diabolical Patton.He is evil, malicious and hides it all under the mask of duty. The climax is 200 pages of fever pitch, adrenaline pounding, excitement. Besides being emotional and psychological, at heart this novel is pure horror. There are good guys, bad guys, victims, survivors, aliens controlling people, aliens bursting out of people, a fungus that eats people and a saintly savior. And it's oh so good. What more could you ask for?"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Though at times the world seems more like a place filled with terrible marmalade, unselfish acts occur to remind everyone that good exists. Take the town of Derry where high school bullies regularly pick on Duddits, humiliating him in nasty ways like stripping him of his clothes and making him sit on or eat dog excrement. Four younger lads (Harry, Beaver, Jonesy, and Pete) rescue the Downs Syndrome boy from his tormentors and realize they like Duddits. For years afterward, the quintet formed a tight knight group to protect Duddits, who can telepathically communicate with them.When the awesome foursome grow up, they leave town and Duddits behind, but get together every year for hunting (minus Duddits). However, this time their get together is filled with danger as a spaceship containing unfriendly and dangerous passengers has landed. The government quarantines the area, planning to kill any living creature isolated in the infected zone. However one alien has snatched the body of Henry with plans to spread his fungi race around the globe.Stephen King provides his zillion fans with another exciting tale centering on hostile aliens threatening to take over the planet. DREAMCATCHER stars heroic people especially Duddits, who is willing to die to stop the destruction of humanity so that his friends can live. Mr. King has written an entertaining suspense thriller that shows he remains a force in fiction.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I bought \\"Dreamcatcher\\" because I loved \\"It,\\" and was looking forward to a similar horror story with the same characters. I am not a great Stephen King fan, but something about \`It\\" caught my fancy when I read it. It was some magical combination of the characters, a creepy plot and Mr. King's admittedly considerable writing skills.Had I not taken the time to read a few Amazon.com reviews of the book before it arrived, I might have been expecting an \\"It\\" clone and been as disappointed as some of the other reviewers. But forewarned is forearmed, and I was prepared for something new. I think sometimes as readers we become upset when a writer changes style, or kills off a favorite character. We forget that most authors need to be free to experiment and grow in new directions. I'm as guilty of this as the next reader.King commits both sins in \\"Dreamcatcher.\\" In short order, two of the four stars of \\"It\\" are written out of the plot. And, to top it off, \\"Dreamcatcher\\" isn't really a horror story. Maybe is a creepy science fiction story, possible a psychological thriller, and perhaps, something much, much more.To make matters even worse, much of the book takes place in the minds of Henry and Jonesy, the two survivors of the original gang of four. Actually, a great deal of this story of alien invasion, military insanity and a mad chase to save Boston takes place as real, and pretty horrific, action. But King's writing style defuses the horror and focuses instead on the weird mental and telepathic ballet that takes place between Henry, Jonesy, the alien trying to take over Jonesy's mind, and countless other characters that play out their roles inside the dreamcatcher. This does not make for easy reading.But what makes this story special isn't the alien weirdness or the telepathy. \\"Dreamcatcher\\" is really the story of Duddits, a childhood friend of the boys from \`It,\\" and the victim of Down's syndrome. Perhaps victim is the wrong word. I try my liberal best to be only moderately squeamish around the disadvantaged. I have heard and read that children affected by Down's often have extraordinary and wonderful personalities. But \\"Dreamcatcher\\" made this all real to me.In bits and scenes and memories, I saw Duddits from the viewpoint of the boys, his mother, and Duddits himself. I'm glad the telling was fragmentary, because I found myself, on several occasions, needing to stop reading and take a break to deal with emotions that I never expected a King novel to touch. I certainly will never again be able to hear the Scooby Doo song, Duddit's song, the same way. Unexpectedly, \\"Dreamcatcher\\" caught me up and opened a new line of thinking.More to the point, I have come to learn that the real tragedy of Down's syndrome might not be the affliction itself, but the fragility and short life span of those so afflicted. And that this might be our loss, as much as it is theirs. The real lesson of King's book is that handicapped also have a contribution, can make a difference, can even help save the world. \\"You were the lucky one, buddy,\\" Henry says to Duddits at the end, \\"You were always the lucky one, that's what I think.\\" To which Duddits, true to his nature, responds \\"I love you, Henry.\\"Thank you, Steven King."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The first Stephen King book I ever read was &quot;It&quot;. The book was among a pile of books brought into the office where I worked and they were all up for grabs. Not being a fan of horror movies, or horror books for that matter, I wondered why I even picked it up. I began reading &quot;It&quot; that night and was not only pleasantly surprised but I was hooked. People who haven't read any of King's books might not realize that he has a kind of dry, wry and somewhat warped sense of humor that makes me laugh out loud. The expressions that his characters use are clever and funny and have a way of letting the reader know more about the character who uses them. King always includes lyrics from some old rock and roll songs in his books. &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is no exception. The Rolling Stones song &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; has a part in the book and one of the main characters, Henry Devlin, has a fixation on the lyric, &quot;Hello darkness my old friend...&quot; from another oldie.&quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is the story of four childhood friends who grew up in Derry, Maine. Henry, Beaver, Jonesy and Pete. As teenagers the four boys happened upon Duddits, a Down syndrome boy, who is being cruelly taunted by a group of older boys. The four pals come to the rescue of Duddits chasing off the bullies in an amazing show of courage and toughness that surprises even them. They immediately like Duddits and the five become friends. After saving Duddits, who is a dreamcatcher, the four are telepathically linked.The four friends have continued to stay in touch and they get together yearly to go hunting and stay in Beaver's cabin, Hole in the Wall. Now in their late 30's each is going through life problems. Henry, a psychiatrist, is contemplating suicide (hello darkness my old friend); Beaver, who has always been the group's comedian and entertains with his colorful, creative and funny cursing, is having relationship problems; Pete is over the line into alcoholism; and Jonesy is recovering from hip surgery after being hit by a car. Through Jonesy Stephen King relates to the reader his painful real-life ordeal of being hit by a car and suffering through the recovery.It's on their hunting trip that they encounter the aliens through a man named McCarthy who Jonesy nearly shoots as a bear. McCarthy has been implanted with an alien creature that erupts from his body (I dare not tell from where) and attacks Beaver. Jonesy's mind is invaded by an alien he calls Mr. Gray and he builds himself a mental warehouse storeroom where he hides from the alien. Of course, Mr. Gray knows he's there but he can't get into the storeroom to completely take over Jonesy's mind.Everyone who is exposed to the aliens becomes telepathic and much of the dialog takes place through each characters mind. Since the four friends already experience telepathic communication the alien influence just boosts their powers and they communicate with each other through all their separate trials.&quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is a return of the Stephen King we've all become accustomed to reading. It has colorful and vulnerable characters, ferocious aliens, an insane military leader, the love and bonding of childhood friends, a race-to-the-finish story line and a satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am an avid King fan. I am sorry to say that after Carrie, Night Shift, The Stand, and seven others of his first releases I have been very disappointed. I have stuck with him because I think he tries to reach to new heights and I respect that in an author. Dreamcatcher finally goes back to the ease of writing that he once had. You get an in depth experience of what he went through after his accident. He also does not copy any storyline currently on the market. A book you will be fully immersed it."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"While not as well done as some of his shorter works, such as the novella Hearts in Atlantis (from the collection of the same name), the short story The Last Rung on the Ladder (from Night Shift), or as literary as Bag of Bones, Dreamcatcher is at least as good as most of his other books. Using the device of the crash of an alien ship, King sets up a story that is less about aliens than it is about just what it is that makes us human, how thin our veil of &quot;civilization&quot; really is, and whether we ever really know ourselves for what we are. But fear not, Uncle Steve still provides plenty of the kind of seemingly senseless brutality and gore most people read his novels for, and, miracle of miracles, he even managed to work in some comic moments that kept this work from simply being completely over-the-top grotesque. And, if nothing else, considering the cost of hardcovers these days, you're getting a deal just on a straight page count. As the title says, it's no Green mile, but i liked it."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"First let me say that I haven't finished this book yet, but I am more than 1/2 and I love it. The first full length novel King has produced since his horrific 1999 accident, it is reminscent of King novels written long ago. We first meet four men, who all grew up together in the town of Derry. These men did a brave thing when they were children and saved a mentally challenged boy from the older kids. They become fast friends with Duddits (Douglas) and include him into their circle. Flash forward to the present where the men are getting ready to go on their annual hunting trip. It is in the woods that things go dicey, starting with an unexpected guest to an all out military quarentine. I am pacing myself with this one trying to make it last.

I will admit I was a little concerned about the greater meaning of the book in the beginning, but as I began to delve deeper into the book I was painted a crystal clear picture of what the Dreamcatcher ultimately represents. I have read several Stephen King books and I like so many other fans have discovered that he can often times get off on tangents that can create a lull in the plot. However, this book starts out relatively slow and then takes off with supersonic speed and never slows down, no lulls whatsoever. I was actually kind of disappointed that the book had to end. What is the true meaning of this book? The answer to that question is obviously very subjective and I assume that would be just how Stephen King would like it to be. The question this book raises is this: Are we really in control of our lives, or are we controlled by a greater power? Who knows, we may never know, but I will say this, if you take the time to sit down and look at the things that have happened to you throughout your lifetime, whether good or bad, you will see that ironically most of these happenings have had a positive impact on your life. Buy it or borrow it from a friend, I guarantee you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Reading Stephen King is like waiting for the other shoe to drop. You turn the pages and you wait for the thud and when it comes you keep on turning those pages because you know this is no ordinary pair of shoes, this is a set of shoes for the multiped monster hiding under your bed, and you know another thud is coming, and another, and another.In Dreamcatcher, King introduces four boyhood friends who once defied the secret code of adolescence by performing a noble deed. Henry, Jonesy, the Beav, and Pete have kept in touch as the decades marched them toward their forties. Each November they meet at Hole in Wall, a deer camp that once belonged to the Beav's dad.In the year 2001--a jarring number that sounds too far in the future to be Now--they meet as usual, just four guys out for a good time in the woods with their hunting rifles and their beer and their haunted memories of a yellow line and their other friend, Duddits, a man trapped forever in childhood. This will be their last hunting trip, though, because the aliens have landed and they're wreaking unspeakable havoc in the Maine woods, where animals flee first from the strangeness that has crashed into their quiet world and then from the governmental agents of damage control.King weaves together past and present, childhood and adulthood, exploring the threads that bind us to our old friends, and our old selves, as he creates a world at once eerie and familiar, gross and engrossing, day bright and nightmare dark. The thuds just keep on coming..."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I snapped Dreamcatcher up the minute it it the shops because i, unlike most other king readers have not lost faith in him due to his lack of literary success recently. So when i saw Dreamcatcher i was ready to be enthralled. The book didn't dissapoint me but neither did it excite me in the ways that many of kings earlier works have done. Although the story is rather cliched in itself the twists that take part within the psychological element of the tale are riveting. Also the clear definition between good and evil is a refreshing change in a literary world where the new gfad seems to be to blend characters into a mix of both bad and good. The real gem of the story though is the depiction of the relationship between the boys and their disabled friend duddits. Although slightly naive when discussing their childhood; the love that the men share in their adulthood is truly heartbreaking to read. I am not being pretentious when i say that the book nearly made me cry in several places. In this story king has tried to recapture the golden youth that he found so well in IT. He has not managed to truly find the same quality that he did with that book partly because he tries to make the childhood seem TOO perfect, it is still a heartwarming try however. The book is a definite read if you are a king fan, however if you are not then i suggest that you begin with a simpler book such as geralds game or misery because the surrealism within this tale, as in the shining can be hard to grasp at times. The book is darker than a lot of kings work, perhapsh due to his accident which is obviously prevelant in the tale, but there are several undertones which break the grimness of the talke and truly do make you want to live your childhood to the fullest, or live it again. The book is a horror story but like it, the horror is only the part of the tale which surrounds the real story, that of a friendship. It is this friendship and the trials that the friends go through which really make the book stand out. I warn you though, if you read this book, proceed to reading IT. You will find that Dreamcather is merely a little brother to the larger work."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I love stephen king. i have always tended to become very involved in his stories, i.e. stay up until the wee hours of the morning just to finish one more page........ anyway, for a while there i was starting to notice a big change in his writing, the way he depicted his characters, etc. i was disappointed to say the least because that was what drew me to his books. But i have found with dreamcatcher, the same old king i used to know. Dreamcatcher reminded me a lot of IT. I enjoyed it and I am glad i bought it.

The book made no sense. I like X-Files and thought that aliens would a good topic. It turned out that all I read was that a bunch of drunks and suicidals were meeting to go hunting. I read about them yelling and thinking, &quot;f* this and f* that, and &quot;dickweed this.&quot; It just reminded me of a bunch of R-rated adolescent junk. Nothing intelligent seemed to come of the story line. I am ready to send the book back to the publisher and demand my money back.

Not to mention filled with his usual gore.And any Simon and Garfunkel fan can't ignore the allusions."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I've read everything this author has ever written at least twice and will probably read everything else that he puts out no matter what because I'm a fan and he's just that much better than your average bestselling author. Compared to his other novels, this one is fair, not too bad, not all that great. I thought it was a bit derivative and it reminded me of The Tommyknockers, which is one of my least favorite. However, the theme (alien invaders) did remind me of the &quot;old&quot; Stephen King (old = pre-Gerald's Game -- great book, but to me this is when he started to change his style from balls-out horror to the more mundane, everyday psychological horror. Not necessarily a bad change, but a change all the same). Anyway, I appreciated this book for what it was, which is well written, imaginative and done in his own inimitable King style. I was just a bit disappointed that we had already covered the same themes in other works, TommyKnockers for one and all the mid-life pensiveness and nostalgia that seems to define most his novels these days is present here as well. I liked this book okay, but I sure do pine for those unapologetic horror novels -- It, The Stand, Skeleton Crew, Pet Semetary..."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"One of the reviewers here confesses: Although he has some complaints, he admits that &quot;no one can draw me into a book better than King&quot;. What a wise and true statement! My first SK was Skeleton Crew and then many. There were times of immense joy with It or Pet Sematary or Wizard and Glass but also so-so times such as The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, Needful Things or Gerald's Game. Dreamcatcher seems to be among the immense joy group. But it does not matter. As that reviewer says, no one can make me plunge into a book better than SK irrespective of whether the story is so-so or not, horror or not, too wordy or concise. Hey it is the way the man tells anything, his way of humor, it is his voice I keep hearing in my mind when reading his books. So Dreamcatcher, which would be otherwise a total flop in any other writer's hand turns out to be one more gem taken out from the huge treasure called Stephen King, with all its flows, dragging moments; but the one telling the story is King and that is enough! And when I understand the source ofthis charm he has on me, I know that I have grown old"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"While I may be a teenager, I have read a great many books in my life so far, but this book ranks best. It is wonderfully put together and combines suspense, terror, melancholy, humor, and so so much more into it. It made me cry, laugh enormously, shiver, and think. I love this man's writing and this great book. I would recommend it to ANYONE if they didn't mind listening to a few swears."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"anytime someone gets deeply into any one given artist, be it a musician, actor, or author you start to pick up on simularities in their works. sometimes it get's trite like the artist doesn't have a strong point of view or it seems that their creative wells dry up. this isn't the case with King. As fans of his works we are all familiar with King's common themes. He loves to use telekenesis or physcic phenomenon, others realms or dimensions, and childhood friends and the loss of innocence, dark humor and great classic rock songs. Dreamcatcher is no exception and have we read books by King with these themes before? yes. King seems to live by the motto if it isn't fixed don't break it and stick with what you know best. King is definately mature enough in his career that he knows where his talents lie and uses them extremely well. Dreamcatcher may not be his best but it sure isn't bad by any standard. His prose is very kinetic and flowing with substance and although this book was over 600 pages, i read it in less than a week. i recently read updike's run rabbit run which clocks in at a mere 200+ pages it took me almost 3 months to read! It also has a lot of his male dark humor that makes me laugh out loud in public! You can never go wrong with a good buddy story and if gore's your thing there's plenty of it to nauseate even the most iron stomached readers. Just let me say I will never look at ferrets or weasel the same again! Dreamcatcher also has good villains like Kurtz ( with a definate nod to apocalypse now!) and the graymen. He also approaches the subject of alien life without dismissing the concept of god or spirituality that sometimes goes with that. It's also a good thing that King seems to crank out the product without sacrificing quality. No sooner than i finished Dreamcatcher than he a Peter Straub released the sequel to The Talisman. I admit that i haven't read the Talisman yet. It seems to be the handsdown fave of Kings fans and I can't wait to read it which i will very soon. Thank god for Stephen King. He's a constant joy for me and I hope he stays around for a long, long, time hereafter."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Yet another story of terror from one of the greatest writers of that genre, Stephen King once again pulls it off nicely. The story is fresh proof of the fact that he loves to write. You can sense his excitement as the story builds and witness his imagination flow wildly within the entwined happenings and memories of the four friends: as children in Derry, Maine, all the way up to their hunting escapades at 'The Hole In The Wall', where the chilling episode actually begins and the terror branches out and escalates.Watch out for Mr. Gray!-This thought mysteriously invades Jonesy's mind. That was just a premonition of events to come. For when the close knit group gets together for a little vacation of quiet solitude and hunting, Jonsey, Henry, Pete, and Beaver end up on a trip to end all trips. The hunters become the hunted. Mr. Gray will make you feel humble and frail as the 'byrum' fungus and alien weasels infest and grow; meanwhile, telepathy umbrellas the area leaving nothing out of terror's reach as devastation engrosses and closes in.It is a story of the love between friends, their growing process in life and maturity, intuition and endurance, tests of strength and fortitude-just to see it all draw attention to, and reach back at, the love of the fifth friend-the special friend-the one who understood most of all:'Duddits' holds the key.Although a bit drawn out in places, and hugely far-fetched, it was a different kind of alien invasion tale full of unrestrained and very imaginative situations, hysterical at times as well."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"4 childhood friends, Henry, Beaver, Jonesy and Pete, all have branched off and done many different things, from selling cars to going into psychiatry. One is even unsure if he wants to live anymore. BUt all their natural fears are put aside for an annual get together out in the MAine woods, at Hole in the Wall, a cabin they went to back when their fathers took them deer hunting.However, this year, will be different from any year before. Through the blowing snow, a stranger appears at their doorstep, in a rather strange sense. But worst of all, he's brought &quot;Something&quot; with him, and what it is will confuse some, but rally others. STranger still is the rapid migration of the animals in the area, and strange lights in the sky.As everything begins to unravel, these men now know that if they choose to live, it will not be by their wits alone. Their thoughts will take them back to the summer days, when they found a very &quot;special friend,&quot; and his gift to them that they have taken for granted, until now.Stephen King first intrigued me on an airflight when I bought &quot;Four Past Midnight&quot; at an airport bookstore. The stories kept me turning pages and I found myself caught up in many more of his works. &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is a story that has been compared to &quot;The Stand,&quot; which could be notable due to it's page length. The story starts out slow, then begins to build you up, then, drops you before building you up again. It's basically a rollercoaster ride, and the ending had me tense til the bitter end. The characters for some strange reason or other will seemingly blank out of reality and traverse through their minds to the past, such as when you daydream of your past. This can be both enjoyable and annoying. Also, just when you think you know what's going, it's all turned around for ya."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"It all started as a common reunion of old boyhood friends. Like every hunting season Henry, Pete, Jonesy and \`The Beav' reunite in their camp \\"Hole in the Wall\\", located somewhere deep in the dark woods of Maine. But this year is not like any other year. When a guy named McCarthy stumbles into their camp - after almost being shot by Jonsey, because at one point he looked more like a deer than a man - he brings an evil with him that is not from this world. This stranger keeps on mumbling about weird lights in the sky and when it becomes clear that there is more about him than that horrible smell, it is already too late: McCarthy is nothing but a human vessel for what is quickly known as a \\"sh*t-weasel\\".This book can be called for more than one reason: a strange book. First of all it breaks clearly with Stephen King's more recent works and returns to the good old classics like It, The Stand and The Tommyknockers. It is really refreshing to see that King can still compose intriguing and gripping characters and place them in a setting that is utterly estranging. It almost feels like King is revisiting some old pals, maybe having a family visit in good ol' Derry. Second reason is his almost parodical image of the old jack-in-a-box-alien. Now be honest: a \\"sh*t-weasel\\" being born out of an extremely flatulent human body is not really your common idea of an evil alien, is it? I guess not. And the final reason: the story itself. For me this is certainly the weakest point of the book. Although at the start it has quite some potential, it bleeds to death after the first half of the book. When the \`final chase' starts, you already know how the ending will turn out (call it the Koontz-feeling...). Don't expect any surprising turn. Just sit, relax and lets go with the flow. Not really what you expect from a \`thriller'. But, of course, most suspense novels don't count 620 pages.But all put together it is still quite an entertaining novel, although it is unlikely that you will remember the plot half a year after reading it. Unless you go and see the movie, that is. ;-)"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I loved the excellent plot, with an aura of mystery beyond what King usually shows.

The first 80 pages were by far the best of the book, the rest rambles and jumps from story to story. This is novel that doesn't know what it is or what it wants. It could have been a great horror novel. It could have been a great novel about friendship. It just never delivers on the promise of that first 80 pages."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"An alien invasion is always a great story when it is well written. This is well written. But calling the story just a alien invasion is not doing King justice. This is the story of four friends that manage to always get together for an annual hunting trip and what happens to them when they are contacted by the aliens. Dreamcatcher is as much a psychological drama as it is a scifi novel. The are many layers to this story: the friends, the army, and one of the aliens(Mr. Gray). How the aliens control their victims is not much fun when you think about it. There is a twist when one of the controlled victims also can fight back against the alien in his own mind. This story reminds the reader of War of the Worlds, except without the saucers. The ending also remind me of the War of the Worlds. This is a good read and it is fun."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"For once, I have to disagree with the glowing reviews that have been posted here. Dreamcatcher is a substantially subpar novel from the usually talented pen of Stephen King.Those of you who've read King now that his stories work so well because they combine believable human drama with horror. His characters are alive and real -- which makes the horror all the more powerful when it comes to the fore.In terms of the human drama, Dreamcatcher works very well. The four principles characters -- Jonesy, Pete, Beaver and Henry -- have been friends since childhood. During their childhood in Derry (familar to you readers of It), they saved a young boy with Down's Syndrom -- Duddits -- from the school bully. Since then, they have had a telephatic link among them through this boy -- their dreamcatcher.During their annual hunting trip, they are caught in the middle of an invasion by aliens that don't just seek to conquer the earth but to take over the very bodies of its inhabitants. The book tells the story of how they are entangled in this conflict while slowly revealing the details of their past.Like I said, the drama works well. The characters are solid and their reactions to the aliens, to their paranormal power are all believable and strong.But the horror falls flat on its face. It's a like an episode of the X-files gone wrong. It's a pity because King has some fascinating ideas -- particularly what it's like to be possessed by the alien and the nature of the alien itself. But I was never really scared.A useful comparison for this book is King's recent masterpiece &quot;From a Buick 8&quot; -- which concerns a similar subject. Buick was everything this novel wasn't -- chilling, fascinating, believable and touching. Buick 8's visceral horror had me turning the lights on and losing sleep. Dreamcatcher had me nodding off in impatience.The book has its enjoyable parts. The finale is very good -- although it is proceeded by a veeerrry slow midsection. And as I said, the human drama works well. But I would recommend many of King's other books before this one -- especially Buick 8."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Do not listen to anyone who rates this book a one-star, then recommends &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.

Do Not watch the movie first!What makes this book brilliant is King's ability to pull the story in different directions. For example, there are multiple bad guys who keep you guessing whether or not they have any relation. It's a fantastic concept and it works. The most unsuspecting characters become the most heroic, and seeminly minor characters end up playing key roles.You really don't know what will happen until the end!It's really a suspense novel, more than a horror novel. But there are enough horror elements to display King's magnificent imagination.Elements of the story may seemed borrowed, but it was a masterpiece nevertheless.

If you haven't liked King in the past, don't bother. Having written a series of novels I didn't much care for over the past decade (Insomnia, Rose Madder, Bag of Bones), King returns to prime form with Dreamcatcher. The story moves along as briskly as a 879 page book can, the characters are fully drawn and evoke our interest, the plot is tense, and the action thick. Also, I really liked the character of Duddits, a man with Down's Syndrome who was saved from bullies in his youth by the four main characters, Henry, Jonesy, Pete, and the Beaver. King really does an outstanding job of portraying Duddits; as someone with a brother who has Down's, I was nearly moved to tears a few times by the accuracy and humanity of King's portrait. Not to say that this was a tearfest; King's trademark horror skills are in full effect here, but the added human dimension in this story made it all the more compelling for me. At nearly 900 pages, it did tend to drag on at times, I admit, but overall, it was well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"In Dreamcatcher, SK used his old and trusty vehicle of a group of childhood friends having a pivotal event in the past which held the key to the future. It runs similar to IT, when this group of friends came together for their adult adventure.In this story the pivotal event was the group of 4 friends - Jonesy, Peter, Beaver &amp; Henry saving a helpless kid from school bullies. This kid turns out to be a telepath which transforms the lives of the group of 4. Straight on to the future, they face the horrors of Alien Invasion &amp; Abduction, Military covert action &amp; coverup.The prose is standard SK fare which means that the pace was tight, fast and exciting. Sk has a talent for making mundane childhood events extraordinary. It was very much hilarious in his description of stereotyping military competence at being incompetent.The narrative goes back and forth between the characters and timelines, converging into a climactic showdown and resolution. However, all the good effort was undone with SK trying to explain the psychological side of the story as a conclusion. I found this conclusion to be overly long winded and confusion, which detracted from the main story.Not on par with The Stand, IT and Tommyknockers."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Critics jokingly refer to King's \\"loggorhea\\", his ability to churn out several lengthy tomes of new material each year, but the underlying implication is that this is one of the signs of his greatness. Pardon me for dissenting, but when every other novel (and sometimes several in a row) are of as poor quality as \\"Dreamcatcher\\" maybe it's time to take a laxative and kick off the shoes for awhile.This book is cookie cutter King at his worst. Not only does he bite heavily from other writers and filmmakers, constantly quoting other superior works that deal with similar themes and plot elements, but he's guilty also of ripping off his own material. We have shipwrecked aliens that use mind manipulation techniques to control humans (Tommyknockers), recurring flashbacks to life altering events in the characters' childhood (It), an intellectual infant who turns out to hold the key to everything (too many books to count)... the list goes on. Unfortunately so does the book. I suppose it's King's matter-of-fact storytelling that makes some fans feel every word that spills out of his typewriter is priceless, but it's rather obvious to the more objective reader that very little he's churned out in the past 10-15 years (at least) couldn't use some judicious editing. Most of the back story in \\"Dreamcatcher\\" is mildly diverting but not at all necessary. Not to mention it smacks of that old \\"Moby Dick\\" ploy of heightening the suspense by tossing in chapters unrelated to the current narrative at key moments. Problem is, Melville employed this technique with expertise and finesse, rarely overstaying his welcome, whereas you get the impression with \\"Dreamcatcher\\" that King just doesn't have much of a plot to work with and is padding out the opening segments with excess exposition in a vain attempt to achieve some sort of balance with the later parts of the book. This \\"balancing\\" means the novel takes over 300 pages to really get going.I hate to even expand too much farther on my thoughts here, since most people reading this review will probably be diehard Stephen King fans and the ensuing carpal tunnel syndrome will be all for naught, but when that \\"4 out of 162 people found this review helpful\\" eventually appears above the byline I want to make sure I've earned the right to protest (after all, rating a review is not supposed to be whether you agree with the writer's assessment, but rather how well they've elucidated their opinion and given someone who hasn't read the book an idea of what they might expect).So what else do we have here? First of all, as others have already mentioned, King's penchant for namechecking pop culture icons and including snatches of classic rock tunes in his work used to be cute and quirky, but after thirty years of publishing it's now only indicative of his inability to get up off his laurels and try something fresh.Furthermore, though King has long been known for his realistic portrayals of children (particularly teenagers), he also has a tendency to take advantage of their youthful uncertainty to make them do things that would seem plausible to an adult. In \\"Dreamcatcher\\", the pivotal event in the lead characters' life comes when, as 8th graders, they come across some high school bullies tormenting a mentally disabled kid and intervene. That in and of itself is not all that unbelievable, but the fact that they befriend this kid (Duddits for those keeping score) for life seems like an act of charity unbefitting these capricious youths. I say this because, frankly, Duddits as written is not all that endearing a character. I'm sure his enthusiasm and baby talk were meant to be cute, but instead he comes off as a complete caricature that is bordering on offensive in and of itself. The bottom line is he's portrayed as a challenged individual that would be more likely to be tolerated for his inadequacies than embraced as a joy to be around. Furthermore, I'm getting a little sick of these \\"innocence as salvation\\" motifs in King's work, but if it had to continue here he could have at least fleshed out the whole telepathy aspect a bit more, maybe explore the possibility that Duddits' mental deficiency is tied in with his telepathic abilities, etc. And speaking of fleshing out character arcs, one character's drinking problem is mentioned repeatedly but only serves to force him into making one dumb decision that helps to drive the plot forward (deus ex machina, anyone?). Another character's accident the previous year is introduced as a psychically tramautic event but only gives King an excuse to introduce the element of intrusive thoughts before the aliens swoop in and give them something of their own to think about.I could go on but I'm held to 1000 words and I've gotta be getting close. Hopefully I've managed to convey the depth of inadequacies in this book without beating anyone over the head, but the various levels of failings in \\"Dreamcatcher\\" do warrant more than a brief \\"thumbs up/down\\" synopsis, especially in light of King's reputation and prior body of work. I'm sure he'll bounce back (and forth), but in the meantime he might consider the idea that not everything he sits down to write needs to see the light of day. There's another book entitled \\"The Lost Writings of Stephen King\\" that I was perusing recently, and I noticed that the lion's share of unpublished fiction was either written in his younger, pre-published days or in those first 5-10 years of semi-stardom, when his work was judged strictly by it's quality and not just because it had King's name on the cover."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King has a proven track record as one of the world's most popular fiction writers; unfortunately he is also one of the most self-indulgent. His books are gigantic sprawling blobs, rather like the rapacious alien fungus set to devour the world in Dreamcatcher. Sometimes he can't even contain himself within even a trilogy--the Dark Tower series advanced its plot not at all in his fourth installment. In his continuing battles with the publishing world, his fans often come out the losers. It is they who ended up paying three times as much for the six installment version of The Green Mile than if King had originally released it as a traditional novel; and anyone who had faith in King and bought the internet version of The Plant simply got ripped off, as he never finished it.Dreamcatcher continues along this self-indulgent path. Although there's a good story under all the fatty layers of excessive prose, it is a story King's fans have read before--sort of Stand By Me meets The Tommyknockers. King's style is full of self-reference--I counted at least four completely irrelevant references to other King books. He loves to bury the reader in detail; at its best this technique brings the characters to life, but too often simply distracts from the storyline. Although no one could truthfully say that his books are predictable, King is so fond of foreshadowing that we know well in advance what is coming. He also uses a changing point of view that allows him to move the story around from the original four characters to a situation completely unknown to them about one-third of the way through the book--a lurch I found quite awkward. I wonder how different, how much more compact and perhaps more compelling the book might have been if it had been told only from the viewpoint of the four friends, without ever introducing the one-dimensional, almost cartoonish villain Kurtz. (Given that some of those original characters die early on, it might have been quite a challenge!)But King fans are all familiar with these foibles, and they seem to forgive him all. He knows how to reward his readers with little pats on the back for keeping up with him--the self-references are surely there for his die-hard fans as much as for himself, and asides like &quot;Gray&quot; and &quot;Gary&quot; being anagrams, or Kurtz as a pseudonym from Apocalypse Now and The Heart of Darkness make the astute reader feel just a little bit special.In his afterward, King talks about the book as a vehicle for his pain; it seems to me that there is quite a bit of anger there too, and even contempt. The presence of these emotions, though, gives the book some strength that puts it above much of his other writing. Still, I have to hope that his pain will burn away some of the excessive gigantism; I far prefer the leaner, more intimate King of works like Misery and Thinner."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I've been reading horror/fantasy since i learned how to read, and i recognize the goodness when i see it. Suffice to say today is Monday, i bought the book on saturday and i finished it just in time to get to work this morning. My hours are shot, but god, i'll never think of bowel movements the same way again. Yes its cartoonish at times (Kurtz is a hilariously freaky character), yes some of the characters arent realised as fully as they should have been, but as far as pacing and storytelling goes, this is easily one of King's finest displays of the art. From the point McCarthy steps out of the woods the story is intense and in your face on all its separate fronts and subplots, and it doesnt let up until the climax. Where King has veered between telling too much and telling too little in the past, for Dreamcatcher he's found the balance and the prose never reaches the point of tedium or sloppiness. I havent had this smooth a reading experience in years. Highly recommended for all fans of alien horror and psychological drama, though King's ruthlessness might be tough for some to swallow. He builds sympathetic characters and slaughters them in downright obscene ways within pages. For me however, this is part of what keeps King's horror fiction fresh and surprising. Two thumbs up, way up!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I've always been intrigued by the work of Stephen King, and I have to admit that I've never actually read one of his books up until this point. Aside from the practically non-stop cursing in this book, it was an enjoyable read for me. Would it make me want to read another of King's books? Yes.The Stephen King that I imagine in his works, came to me at the beginning of the novel where the four friends are either at Hole in the Wall, or in the Scout. What I wasn't expecting from this book was the military aspect of it. What frustrated me most about the book was the constant jumping around of characters, as well as the somewhat confusing idea of the dreamcatcher (as an ornament) in relation to the story. Maybe it's just me. I felt myself sighing at points where I had to read through Kurtz dialogue. Kurtz, in my opinion, is just a useless afterthought thrown into the story. But hey, I'm not a bestselling author, so don't take my word for it.Now you're probably wondering why, after all this complaining, I gave the book a 4 star rating. Aside from the boring parts (far between), this book really shines. The characters, along with having their own inner problems, are faced with an even bigger problem, and they don't even know about it until they are stuck right in the middle of it all. Fear of the unknown is experienced by all within this book. Whether it be telepathy, aliens, the monster in the toilet bowl, or fear of one's own mind, that is what drives this book. And there is just something really creepy about a woman sitting in the middle of a isolated road, while in a blizzard, and not moving even after a near-hit with an oncoming car.Plain and simple, Dreamcatcher will catch you and make you want to keep reading right to the end."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is the first Stephen King book I have read in twelve years, after my elitist English professors convinced me to leave such commoner's books aside for fine literature. Having read It, The Stand and all his short story collections, I was really amazed at how blatantly King raided his past work to create this &quot;new&quot; book. The concepts of alien life traveling like a disease and transforming its victims was already done well in Tommyknockers; this plus the return to Derry, the use of a mute/retard/&quot;special&quot; to unite some boys together -- even a corpse the boys all see that binds them together -- all reused clearly and without shame from previous works. Perhaps King intends this as a nod and a wink to his long-time fans, but in this context it just seems tired and a bit shameless for a man who gets $40 million advances.Overall the writing was choppy and the editing downright poor; I found several obvious grammatical and punctuation errors and as many word substitution problems (&quot;spellcheck errors&quot;). The multiple-voices style of writing is perhaps King's most modern effort, but it still feels clumsy and dated in his hands, like a grad student's first try at the technique.And once again, women get the shaft in a major way in this book; all he can do is portray them as sideline characters or odd freaks of nature. At least they didn't have to sleep with everyone else, like in IT. Overall I would recommend this book only for a long airplane flight or car ride, because if you put it down you won't be motivated to pick it back up again."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"As someone who loves Stephen King and reads practically everything he writes I have to tell everyone that this ISN'T his best work but then I haven't read anything that would rank as his best for years. So I have to say that this book is exceptional and even with it's rather large size is well worth the ride. If the first few chapters don't thrill you keep reading it DOES get better. Can't wait for his next book...."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Fans of Stephen King's earlier work seem to be very happy with DREAMCATCHER, which bears a lot of resemblance to his earlier work. As a King fan for years, I really looked forward to this novel, but upon completion, I found that it was not as good as his past work, and it truly pales in light of his most recent, excellent works like BAG OF BONES and THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON. Many King fans enjoy his writing because of the wonderful character development; we feel like we KNOW these characters by the time the last hundred pages arrive. DREAMCATCHER, unfortunately, seems to be lacking that character development - one never gets to know the characters outside of the present and the past circumstances which affect the present in some way, shape or form.As a cohesive element, Duddits Cavell is not nearly as believable as the pariah status of the Loser's Club (IT) or the Little Bald Doctors (INSOMNIA), King's previous (and excellent) novels about Derry. In addition, the human antagonists (namely Kurtz and the soldiers following his lead) seem formulaic and predictable. The story might have been better served had they left the tale far earlier.I did enjoy several elements of the story. Beaver Clarendon was a very interesting character, especially his interesting and very amusing talent for obscenity. The relationship formed between Mr. Gray, the alien, and Jonesy, his human host, was very interesting and deserved more illumination. The idea that human emotion could be intoxicating for those who have never experienced it was a new one for me, and King as usual explores the possibilities in a very unique and enlightening fashion. There are also moments of heart-rending sweetness between the four heroes and Duddits, their friend; the fact that it seems ALMOST too good to be true but isn't is a reflection of King's ability to give us very human characters.What works in DREAMCATCHER is what is on the page, for the most part; the villian Kurtz could be left without a huge sense of loss. What might have drastically improved this novel is what King has often done in the past - showing how the actions of the central characters affect the peripheral characters, and giving us more background information to make the central characters more alive, more interesting, more human. Stephen King's latest is a very, very good book, but it is not as good as I was hoping it would be."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I grew up on \\"The Stand\\", \\"Cujo\\" and \\"Salem's Lot\\", but it's probably been well over a decade since I read a book by Stephen King. How great it was to reconnect with this old friend! King is so prolific and so populist that his work is easily dismissed by serious critics, and that's a shame. \\"Dreamcatcher\\" is a perfect example of his brilliance at work. The central concept - bodysnatching aliens - is an old one, but King gives it new life. As always, his plot is imaginative, compelling, and just the right amount of horrifying. His core characters are similar to the \\"everyman\\" lead in most of his novels, but more layered and finely nuanced. There are characters within characters, literally and figuratively. The story is beautifully paced, and King masterfully weaves the different plotlines together - much like a dreamcatcher. Even things that would normally turn me off a book are surprisingly well done. While I generally consider scatological stories juvenille and a [poor] attempt to shock, it actually makes reasonable scientific sense in the context of this plot, unpleasant as it is.An interesting little side note - the action in this book takes place in the November after the 2000 election, i.e. November 2001. At the time King wrote the book, the presidency was still undecided. As part of the story, the new president must speak to the nation and soothe everyone's fears about the threat presented by the alien invaders. The speech leans heavily on the patriotic and is considered to be the new president's finest hour and erases the scandal of the election. Eerie."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I'm a pretty dedicated fan of Stephen King, and even though I don't expect to like ALL his books as much as I liked The Stand or It, I do expect some originality which is totally missing from this book. Axtualy, this book is so bad that I couldn't make myself read any more than the first 150 pages or so! I only managed to read that far because I kept thinking that it just HAD to get better...The book tells of four friends who had once saved a Downs Syndrome boy in Derry, and as a result became telepathic. These concepts are already unoriginal: the Stand had a charming but powerful retarded boy (Tom Cullen), and the dreams of Mother Abagail / the Dark Man that were equivalent to telepathy, while It had a bunch of Derry kids with special powers 'save the day'.An alien spaceship roams near their hunting cabin having already abducted a few humans (and planted a weasel like embryos in them), and spread some nasty orange grass / fungus everywhere. Now this is your basic X - Files alien stuff, and also reminds me of 'true stories' of people who claim to have been abducted in the past. Of course the group's special 'powers' (or rather the 2 friends who hadn't been horribly killed in the first 50 pages) help them save the world and overcome a government cover up of this stuff (X - Files basics again). I peeped in the last pages of this book, and it seems they eventually got their way, and got out alive...The book seems to promise a lot: the friends are originally from Derry, which supplied great plots in the past (It and Insomnia). It deals with the values of friendship and kindness towards weaker people in our society, which have their own special powers (The Stand, It). It also deals with spaceship and aliens, which is a subject that fascinates many people and is a great way to introduce horror into a story (like the lost spaceship in The Tommyknockers). All the books mentioned in this paragraph deal with these subjects a lot better than the Dream Catcher, and these are books I definitelly reccomend to people interested in reading stuff that made Stephen King what he is.It's pretty well known that Stephen King wrote this book while recovering from a pretty bad accident, and he mentioned in the preface for this book that a lot of his physical pain and discomfort went into this story. Writing might be a great way to deal with this pain, but maybe a non - horror book (such as Hearts in Atlantis) would have been a better scope for such a battle..."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I was really pleased when I started reading Dreamcatcher- Stephen King has returned back with a gory, creepy, sickening, novel. I loved it! I admit that I loved Bag of Bones, Hearts in Atlantis, and Green Mile. But these books were a more &quot;grown-up&quot; romantic Stephen King... Dreamcatcher gets back to the creepy King of old. (Think Carrie, Salem's Lot, and IT with a touch of Tommyknockers.)I won't repeat some of the other reviewers comments. I do kind of agree that the ending was a bit disappointing, and parts of the novel were just to weird to fully understand. (I didn't get most of the psychic &quot;vision&quot; scenes between the characters and the bad creatures.)On the plus side, you get some wonderful characters, especially the goverment/army characters. I'd love to see a book about them!The plot is an original, unique take on the old &quot;bad aliens invade earth&quot; idea... very ingenious. I'd love a sequal written from their point of view.If you're a King fan, you'll like it. Non-King fans might be suprized."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I've read a lot of Stephen King books from the Dark Tower series to Hearts in Atlantis and this newest work is one of his best. King's mastery of description and imagery make the 620 pages go by with ease. Personally, I didn't think King would wander into the realm of alien abductions and whatnot, but he does a better job than anyone else. I found myself looking over my shoulder more than once while reading this book. However, don't take my word for it...read it and experience it for yourself."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dream Catcher starts out in the classic King style, exploring characters in the way his fans have come to love. Their lives intertwine, flashbacks give us insight into their pasts together, intersperced with the creepy beginnings of an alien invasion. The classic King style of good vs evil, the one character who leads the way, comes through here. Unfortunately, there was no explanation of the aliens, something I've come to depend on in his books (opening the door, as he's put it before), as is usual in the better King novels. This plot line just didn't blend in with the rest of the story.The last part of the book, unfortunately, starts to fall apart. I started skimming some of the scenes as i lost interest in the rambling action. The end of the book makes almost no sense, very disappointing to a loyal King fan. I'll always read his new books, and after the last three duds, was really looking forward to this new effort. I was disappointed in the ending chapters, but still recommend reading."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I have been a huge Stephen King fan since I picked up a paperback version of Carrie around 1978. I own a copy of all the fiction he has written (most in hardback purchased the day it went on sale) - and some of the non-fiction. I have often said that I would like reading King even if he wrote the text on a cereal box. So this ain't yer typical King-bashing that has so annoyed me in the past when it came from others. Yes I know he was in a bad accident and it wasn't clear if he was ever going to write again, and if he did, there was speculation that he wouldn't be the same and so on.So now there's this new book (that I advance-ordered from Amazon). Let's see... Haven't I seen the telepathic aliens theme explored before? Oh that's right - &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot;. And isn't there something familiar about a tight-knit band of friends who shared an intense experience when children that shaped and influenced their adult lives and who must band together to stave off a really nasty alien? Oh yeah - &quot;It&quot;.But it's not only that. I don't particularly mind plot recycling. King is a master plotter and as I said earlier, in my opinion a truly great writer. But all great fiction, particularly science fiction (and that's what this is) depends on versimilitude and at least some shred of scientific accuracy for its integrity and believability. And here that's a problem, because the whole shebang depends on an alien symbiote being able to infect humans. Sheesh, most terrestrial pathogens are so host-specific that they can't even be spread from one species to another, even though all share a common genetic origiin. Ever heard of a cat catching measles from its owner?So &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; was pretty much a disappointment, at least for me. I guess it might be OK for hard core Stephen King fans, (and I am still one and will still rush out and buy the next one as soon as it's available), but if you haven't read anything by King yet, my advice is don't start with this one. It might prevent you from discovering some of the many truly wonderful works by this talented author (e.g., The Stand, The Talisman, The Shining)."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"King weaves the lives of four boyhood friends in flashback and present day, and how their friendship with Duddits, a Downs Syndrome boy, affected their lives. Beaver, Pete, Jonesy, and Henry spend one week a year hunting in Beaver's family cabin. They come to the aid of a lost hunter not realizing they have just invited something horrific into their lives. The friends are unaware that a UFO has crashed not far from the cabin. They are also unaware that the hunter has been infected with a fungus which sometimes uses its human host to grow a weasel-like creature. The infected humans also acquire telepathic abilities.The aliens are your typical gray boys with almond-shaped black eyes and asexual bodies. Our military has rounded up the infected residents, and destroyed the ship and survivors, except one. &quot;Mr. Gray&quot; has taken over Jonesy's body. The plot becomes a little muddy in a few areas. The four friends have always been telepathic, something they acquired or learned from hanging around Duddits although I'm not quite sure what is meant when the boys say they &quot;see the line.&quot; And they mention several times that they are caught in the dreamcatcher which made me think the entire book was about someone's dream and that person will wake up and none of it happened. But that's not the case. I don't pay too much attention to confusing parts of these types of books because it really is up to each person's interpretation. What King does best with this book and some of his earlier ones is get you wrapped up in &quot;the chase.&quot; Good vs evil, evil on an apocalyptic mission to destroy earth/mankind/fill in the blank. He did it in THE STAND where everyone converged on Las Vegas. And also THE SHINING with the father possessed by the demon and the son having a telepathic race with the demon while the black hotel work who befriended him races to his aid. And in DREAMCATCHER, Mr. Gray has one final attempt to destroy humans while the friends race with Duddits (whose telepathy is the strongest and can aid in communicating with Jonesy) to stop Mr. Gray. Although Mr. Gray has taken over Jonesy's physical body, Jonesy's mind/conscience is trapped in a mental &quot;office.&quot; If he walks out, he dies. If he stays inside, Mr. Gray doesn't have complete control. Sound complicated? In a way, yes. But don't let that stop you. A lot of the apocalyptic, SciFi, horror books leave much of the interpretation to your imagination. I'm still trying to understand 2001-A Space Odyssey!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I have almost lost faith in the &quot;big&quot; novelists. Writers like Grisham seem to churn out one bad book after another without ever losing their popularity. However, one popular writer who has stayed fairly solid is Steven King. Not everything he has writen in the last five years has been top notch, but I have at least felt I got my money's worth from his books. Dreamcatcher is no exception. A solid horror title mixed in with a great backstory of the 4 men involved. It is loaded with the suspence, horror, and offbeat humor King seems to have a knack for. This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"First off, I want to say....WOW!!! What a fantastic book!! Mr. King tried something new (I won't say what it is, you'll have to read it to find out) and it worked. Let's face it, King is such a wonderful writer, he could write the phone book and it will sell.The plot is pretty basic...at first. Some life long friends have a yearly ritual. They go hunting in the woods. Well this year, something goes wrong, horrible wrong that will change the life of humanity forever. If you want to find out what happened....then read the book.The characterization that King gives his char is just incerdible. You can't help to care about each one. Persoanlly, my favorite is Beaver. He's soooooo funny. You can't just help but to love him. One char was in a car accident. To read what the char went through, you can't help but to think that King was telling what he went through. It really gave me chills reading that part. I also liked the char of Duddits. He has a special relationship with the characters in this book. I also liked what motivated the char to do what they did.What I also liked is that you can't tell who the good guys are. Just b/c they say their good, doesn't make it so.I was suprised to see that this book is getting such a low ratings from people. King tries something different in his writing style, and it works. But to each their own. I loved this bookOnce you start to read Dreamcatcher, you won't be able to put it down. I highly suggest this book.The race for humanity is on. Who will win....buy this book and find out. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I really, truly wanted to love this book. I have been reading Stephen King since the late '70s and always look forward to anything new by him. I could only get through 300 pages before I just had to give up. I reached the point where there were three Jonesys and then I realised it was time to throw in the towel. King is best when he does straight horror and Sci-fi is not my favourite genre, but this book was kind of muddled and kept jumping all over the place. I think that this story would have benefited by being 200 pages less and not delving so deeply into the whole psychological thing. Anyway, I will continue reading Mr. King's books, but just can't really recommend this one."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book really stunk. It almost seems like he forgot to send the manuscript to the editor. Surely the editor wouldn't have let him ramble on and on about snow, and trees, and oh-my-god the smell and sound of the bodily functions of these &quot;people&quot;. I vowed that I would never again rush to the store to buy one of his books because they have been so diappointing, but I did this time because it was tauted as &quot;a return to horror&quot;. I now once again vow to NEVER rush out to buy his books. The used bookstore will have plenty of his stinkers for 50 cents in the future."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"See storyline summary above.When I started reading this novel I thought I was in for a treat. It started out with all the classic Stephen King elements. As I progressed with the novel I began to change my mind. For one thing I think it was to long. Normally, as with classic King, the longer the better, but this story seemed to drag a bit at times. At times it also becomese a little confusing as to the perspective of the narrative. Such as when, where and who this perspective is coming from. An enjoyable novel overall for the true Stephen King fan and it's better than a couple of his previous novels, but it just isn't comparable to 'The Stand' or 'It'.Recommended for Stephen King fans."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I have been reading Stephen King books since discovering &quot;The Stand&quot; at the age of 14. (over 20 years now) But this is the first one that I would even consider returning. I kept thinking that it would get better and it never did. While there were some good parts, there were certainly not enough. I just hope that this was a result of too much time since the last book and the ol' writing skills were a little rusty. I look forwarded to the next one. Everyone deserves a second chance."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Is it a rehash? Yes. Is it good? Yes. To create write this book use the following formula:1 part Stand1 part It2 parts Tommyknockers1 part The Body (Stand by Me)Dash of the Dark TowerCombine ingredients. Mix well.

With some much interspec, there is no worry that this one will be a movie/mini-series."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"With 292 customer reviews already listed for this book- I thought- should I bother? But I really have to put in my two cents. I began to like Stephen King again with Hearts in Atlantis and The Green Mile. Gone was the Gore of Cujo and The Tommyknockers. And along comes Dreamcatchers. The gore is back. But somehow after a reprieve from King's more graphic novels, this one works. It's truly gross (yet, thank goodness, humorous). I found myself making weird grunting and groaning sounds on the couch next to my spouse as we read at night- truly overwhelmed with the slimy, bloody, gruesome details King offers. Ya just gotta wonder how someone's mind can make up stuff like this...Stephen may be normal in some respects but when it comes to his imagination, well...something's just plain nuts about someone who can envision this! Anyway, it's a great summer horror book. Lots of action and great character development. Just don't read it at night unless you're a really sound sleeper. And warn anyone around you that you may subject them to sudden outbursts of loud yelps of disbelief and nausea. Have fun and stay out of the woods!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"No-it was not particularly scary. No-it didn't keep me up at night. Yes-it was riveting and interesting. The friendship of all of these 5 men was beautifully written and the characters were memorable. I really enjoyed this. I also enjoyed that fact that King didn't go off on any tangents in this book as he seems to do in some of his others. Very good tale."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"King's new novel 'Dreamcatcher' leaves no doubt that even following his accident, there is plenty of writing left in him! Dreamcatcher is an original work that brings us back to Maine and Derry once again... But this time, for an alien invasion.The book revolves around 4 friends, linked in many different ways to a mentally handicapped boy who they saved from a group of bullies when they were younger. A bond is formed, changing these 5 friends forever. It is this bond that helps the 5 friends, now grown, in their darkest hour.This is a very good book! It is a bit long for the material contained within (King definitly could have cut down on the length of some of his chapters), but in all I would have to say it was a good read."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I'm a huge Stephen King fan, and was anxious to read his first novel written after his accident. I can say that although it was not my favorite, it was very, very good.Some of the critics have slammed King's &quot;diarrhea of the typewriter&quot; in this book. It was a little long, and dragged in the middle quite a bit, but still was not predictable, and I was quite satisfied by the ending.My husband and I listened to this book at the same time. He became a little more frustrated than I did with the psychological drama in the middle of the book, and was anxious for the action to start up again. I found the &quot;mental&quot; struggles more interesting, and wasn't as bored by the middle of the book.Jeffrey Demunn is absolutely superb! His Maine accent is perfect for the story, and his characterizations were flawless.King has definitely not lost his touch. Dreamcatcher is a must-read for Stephen King fans."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King's new novel is amazing. if you haven't read it, you should. This novel is going back almost to the way that his older novels were written. This novel is less of an emotion games novel as his other recent novels have been (although they were good, this true horror format is better). This novel has places where you will be frightened out of your mind, and parts where you will not be able to control your laughter, even some of the both occur at once. I guarrentee any true Stephen King fan will enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The more time that passes since reading this book, the more disappointed I am. Although a fast and compelling read, I can't shake the feeling that all I've done is read the outline of a much better book.Readers will naturally draw comparisons to &quot;IT&quot; because of the life long friendship, anchored by a life changing experience in adolescence, of the four main characters. But what King did with such skill and beauty in &quot;IT&quot;, drawing us into the make up of the individuals as well as the group dynamic, he merely pays lip service to in &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;. King sets us up with the key elements, but fails to deliver. We get only one course of the meal King has taught us to expect.This book made me want to re-read &quot;IT&quot;, which I am currently doing with great pleasure."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"There are over 100 reviews already here, so I won't go over the same old stuff. Every true King fan might want to ponder this idea for a moment - doesn't it seem as if King has lost touch with &quot;real people&quot; as his fame has grown? His early books were great, but as he has grown older and richer, his fame may be causing him to lose touch with reality as the rest of us &quot;worker bees&quot; see it, and his writing has suffered from it. He's tucked away in a mansion in a small town in Maine, with not much exposure to the outside world. Also, Stephen knows, and so do we, that anything he writes will become a bestseller. So he doesn't have to really worry about pleasing the reader anymore - he knows it will sell a trillion copies and he'll get even richer. I will continue to read his books, but I'll get them from the library - I'm not paying a cent for these crummy stories anymore."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"DREMACATCHER---2 STARSI couldn't wait to read this one.

I'll not bore you with a synopsis; you can find that by scrolling up.The biggest problem to me in this story, and the one that cripples the narrative impact significantly, is King's treatment of the secret military unit assigned to deal with the invaders. These aspects of the book fell victim to either King's lazy or incomplete research, as well as some rather sloppy editing. The Black Ops CO is blatantly cartoonish, and Chinooks are big, slow transport helicopters, not attack helicopters. Whatever they might be flying, when on an attack mission, pilots don't have the Rolling Stones or any other music blaring from their headsets--how the hell are they supposed to coordinate a precision attack with the radio blasting? Moreover, helicopters are not flown with a \\"yoke,\\" only airplanes are.Some might accuse me of being nit-picky, but details do matter, especially in a work of this scale.Overall a decent story, but King certainly needed a little reigning-in on this one, and his editor needs to brush up the credentials."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"After I saw the movie (with its numerous plot holes) I decided that, no matter what, I absolutely had to read the original book.To my surprise the movie really did follow the book quite well, with the exception of some directorial license to make it more 'Hollywood-friendly.' However, I wish that I would have read the book first. Although I will not say it's the best thing I've ever read, I found I blew through it in two days (at 600+ pages!)-- quite a gripping storyline. After all, isn't that what Stephen King does best? Create intense, interesting stories that *move*.If you have seen the movie and want to know why you should read the book, I will say that the book A) explains more about the aliens/virus; B) Mr. Gray is soooo much better in the book!; C)The novel's ending is radically different from either ending that was in the movie, as is the character of Duddits.So read it already! It's cheap and it's entertaining!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am a BIG SK fan, I've been reading his books since high-school and I have really praised him when they were great (The Stand, IT) and I've really panned him when they were downright dumb and ununderstandable ( The Tommyknockers).

The characters are great, the story is fun and exciting and as always with SK the monsters are of the alien AND human kind.

It was probably the best book I ever read, and I have read a lot of terrific books. Dreamcatcher kept me guessing and exited throughout the entire book, and there were no boring parts. This book is filled with lots of action and tons of crazy events. The basic plot of the book is this: Four friends, Jonsey, Henry, Pete, and The Beav, save an innocent retarded boy from older bullies back when they were kids. They grew close to the boy, who called himself Dudditz, and were linked to each other in a strange way. They could hear each others thoughts and dreams. Each year, the original four friends go hunting up in the Jefferson Track in Maine. But this year their trip wasn't going to be fun. Aliens land there and bring with them an infectious red-colored birus that spreads quickly among people and animals. When the infection reaches a person's intestines, it grows a living, snakelike, beast that rips its way out of your body. The military comes and quarentines the area, holds the infected people in captivity, and slaughters the aliens and infected animals. They killed all the aliens except for one. This one alien, Mr. Grey, happened to find Jonsey and took over his body and had access to his brain. He plans to infect a dog so that is grows a snakelike thing, or birum, in it's stomach and then dump the dog into the area's main water source. This would eventually contaminate every human being on the earth and kill off all mankind. It's up to Henry, Dudditz, and Jonsey to save the world. Can they do it?"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Upon realizing that Stephen King has decided (allegedly) to stop writing books, the first thing I did was to cancel my membership in his book club. I have all of his books in hardcover now anyway - so is there really any point in staying a member?The next thing I did was to look at my bookshelf to determine whether I still have any of his books in the \\"unread\\" category. I realized that Dreamcatcher was one of those books so I picked it up and was soon sucked in.The beginning of the book tells the story of four guys who have known each other since they were kids. Although it is not clear why (and never really becomes that clear), they each have some sort of telepathy which allows them to communicate with each other, find lost things, etc. We also learn about how, as children, they saved some retarded kid, Duddits, from getting beaten up by some older boys.Like most of King's more recent stories, the book starts off on a high note as the four men have a run-in with aliens while on their yearly hunting trip. Then we are introduced to the team of individuals assigned to stop the alien threat, and things slowly start downhill... Thus, the book goes from an A to a C+.The following chapters involve the story of alien gray people and alien worms that eat people and the alien(s)' efforts to infect the world. Of course, telepathy plays a role and for some reason, Duddits is instrumental in keeping the peace. It is not clear how the symbiotic relationship between alien gray people and alien worms makes a difference. It is a heck of a coincidence that the telepathic guy happens to be around to serve as a viable host for alien life. Heck, there a lot of things that are not clear but I don't want to give away the story so my summary ends here.That being said, based on what I know about King's personality, I am 100% positive that he reads these reviews posted about him. How about finishing up The Plant? One of your best books in recent years and it remains incomplete. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING.As for The Dreamcatcher, I consider it average . . . yet entertaining. Worth reading at least."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen KIng is a master writer. Reading his books, however, may be an exausting experience, since he frequently writes a lot, I mean a lot, of unecessary pages. BUt, most of the times, he does it showing that he's really a gifted writer.But in DREAMCATCHER things somehow go wrong. It's a hard book to read, even if the chemistry among the four old friends from Derry, more Duddits, was something very enjoyable to follow. But he kept developing unecessary histories to the plot. Case in point: the Russian woman who throwed herself into the water depository. Useless, simply useless stuff to the main plot.This is one King book trhat I kept struggling to reach the end."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I liked it because the plot was really entertaining for an ardent science fiction reader like me.In their childhood, Jonesy, Henry, Pete and Beaver rescued retarded Duddits from bully boys, and they are good friends since then. Toward their adulthood, they got separated again, and original four boys made it a habit to hunt together annually at Hole in the Wall.At Hole in the Wall, they encountered a disaster to meet Aliens from space! For reasons unknown, their UFO made a crash-landing in the winter woods. UFO and their crews are relentlessly devastated by the primitive firearms of human military forces. All the problems were cleared away, so it seemed. In reality Aliens were executing more devastating plan and no one realized it except Jonesy!Jonesy's mind was assaulted by the last surviving Alien named Mr. Gray. Blocked by Jonesy's exceptional mind power, Mr. Gray could not conquer Jonesy's mind. Jonesy barricaded himself in the backyard of his mind. Henry somehow knew his friend Jonesy was living in his head in spite of bodily control of Mr. Gray. He chases Jonesy to save the world with the help of retarded Duddits, the Dreamcatcher.Real battle was fought within the virtual world of the past. Their childhood experience decided the outcome of the battle. Really weird development of the battle was confusing, but it succeeded in attracting readers to the final stage of the fate of mankind!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"ultimately the story is about four friends from derry, maine all coping with growing up. there are a host of subplots including alien invasion and the extraordinary bond the four friends have with one down syndrome kid named douglas cavell (I DUDDITS)the writing i think is top notch and the character development and interplay is excellent. the story is an interesting one. four friends who meet and save douglas cavell, a down sydrome kid, from the humiliation at the hands of a bully. from that moment on life is diferent for the kids. they can \\"read\\" each others thoughts. as they get older and life becomes more complicated they all battle their own demons.then during a weekend trip to their old favorite place \\"the hole in the wall\\" intervenes fate via an alien infested older man named mccarthy. the strory from here gets very interesting. i liked it alot but felt that it dragged on a but far and too long in spots. the movie is good and i enjoyed reading the book a second time to see what the movie skipped over. there was a lot of details, as always with movies, that were left out. the comradarie around the friends and the relationships between all the friends and the aliens and our hero were top notch. i felt such a warmth and drawn into the circle with these men. the problem i had with this book is that there was so much going on and so many details and subplots that my mind became tired from reading after a short while. there was so much going on and so many subplots that the main story seemed to drag."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Four lifelong friends at their annual hunting trip in the deep woods of Maine. Middle aged, each is suffering some sort of difficulty. Mid-life crisis? I don't like the term, but I think that's what King was after here. Introduce an alien-possessed guy and you have all the elements of a classic King novel.The concept of friendship is not a new one for King, he must have had great friends as a kid to be able to capture the essence of friendship that lasts a lifetime. But these 4 have a special bond, forged during their years of friendship with Duddits, their childhood friend with Down's Syndrome. They are telepathic with one another.While there are plenty of people around in this isolated hunting territory, these 4 friends are best equipped to deal with the alien beings. The alien &quot;capture&quot; consists primarily of mind invasion, making this novel one more of psycho-thriller than bone-chiller.So, what's wrong with this book? It's length? Hardly new for King. The flatulence? I fail to see how this is worse than boogers, amputations, melting skin, and other highlights of King thrillers. C'mon you guys, lighten up!Stacked against other King novels, this was not my favorite. While it had all the elements of classic King, it moved a bit too slowly for me at times. In spite of the advance billing regarding the &quot;brave thing&quot; these men did as boys, it's significance isn't made clear until late in the book. The relationship with Duddits, while charming, also isn't clarified until late going. I spent a lot of time wondering how the dreamcatcher was involved in this whole thing.But in the end, this novel is worthy of at least 3 stars. Take away all of his other books and examine it on it's own merits. The characters are believable, the friendship is sincere, their frailties and problems make them sympathetic. The storyline is creepy, you fear for these guys (although as much from the armed forces as the forces of evil), and there are several surprises. One thing King does better than most writers is develop several characters and story lines at once which merge together late in the book. This does not work if only one of them is interesting. It works for King and the complexity of it all exercises my brain enough to make it enjoyable.I don't like it when I suspect a book is written with the movie already in mind. While it wasn't as in-your-face as other books I've read, I had to wonder if he was thinking about it while writing this.All that being said, I still recommend this book. There's a lot to like. High expectations of anything King can make us critical. But on it's own, this is a good read."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book is more sci-fi than horror, I think. There's a touch of King-esque gore, but this novel couldn't give a six-year-old a nightmare. The fearsome aspects were mostly psychological. Being locked inside your mind by an alien is scary enough, but it's a different kind of fright from his other work.Instead of King's trademark chill, the reader is treated to little green (okay, gray) men, telepathy, spaceships, secret military operations, and a weird space disease which causes rancid flatulence. This is the stuff of science fiction! It's a distinct departure from his famous writing style, but a good read overall.Hold on! A good read... But not for Stephen King!After all these years, we've come to expect a great deal from King. This could be unfair. Everyone has flubs. Maybe even King can be granted a pardon. The readers who are really disappointed with this book are the ones who know King's work. Newcomers to King just see it as a book (and a pretty good one) and hold no preconceived expectations (&quot;ooh, Stephen King wrote it and it'll scare my pants off&quot;).There's a decent plot here, and strong characters. I think some of the characters could have been developed a bit more to enrich the story before King butchered them (there was some familiar King bloodshed in this scene), but that's just me. I loved their interaction in the flashbacks. The touching shared childhood of the five main characters makes the reader lament their unfortunate present circumstances.The aspect of this book that kept me reading was the ingenious way King kept revealing tidbits. One of many examples: Josie is mentioned several chapters before he told her story. The reader wonders, &quot;Who's Josie? What's the deal here?&quot; and stays with the book. He does this in many instances. Maybe used this method in hopes that at least some of the readers would actually finish the book. It got really slow.If you're thinking of reading this one, go ahead but make sure you've got a back-up book. It's fine, but try another King first."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Here it is. The book that's a step down from reality, a moment away from the truth, the feeling of happiness and joy is not here, fear takes its place. A fear unknown to most, but known to only those who have read the book..the amazing book i must announce. This bad, evil ridance has been building up inside me. The stabbing knife is forcing this out and now it's here...your murder day. Dreamcatcher is beyond our minds. It is not what we see because only THEY see it. The line seperates us from them, as if they were aliens, but they are us...they are humane. As for those of you who have not read it, you will be shocked by it's meaning.... to be catched in it, to be grasped by it means your soul will be hung from the wire, as the words dreamcatcher run along the lines and strings.

People keep telling me that I should read King's older stuff because his recent material just doesn't measure up. I am told this is a throwback to the old stuff. Well, I have enjoyed everything since 1990...but if this is the &quot;good stuff&quot;, I'll stick to the &quot;bad&quot;."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Just a very short review but I thought I had to do it.

So far I'm not on the edge of my seat."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"My god this book was terrifying. It's The Shining meets The Stand. That Mr. Gray character freaked me out.

It's not the best King has written, certainly (that distinction goes to *Wizard and Glass,* in my opinion), but *Dreamcatcher* certainly grabs you and holds your imagination. King has a knack for creating characters that become your friends, and this book's characters are no exception. Buy the book--it's worth the money."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"A cast of diverse characters plus a potential Armageddon. Sound like The Stand?Get set to be disappointed. Dreamcatcher follows suit with today's popular adventure story formula: Flawed but brave hero(ine/s) up against evil must overcome physical and mental pain in order to save the entire human race. And maybe eat some bacon on the way.What I want in a book is a new idea, or flawless execution of a timeless idea. This book provides neither. Average suspense, average surprise, average conflict. And I feel that King tries to manipulate empathy from his readers by giving the protagonists mental and physical ailments.There is a wonderful layering of &quot;bad guys,&quot; each with their own malevolent agenda. It is impossible to rank one over the rest, for each villan ranges in motivation, insanity, depth, and intensity. The bad part is that the &quot;good guys&quot; are hard to rank too, so it reads somewhat impassively as a result.But, I have been a die-hard Stephen King fan for 15 years, and I relate to his writing style and voice as if he were an erratic but well-meaning pen pal. Pick it up for some cheap thrills--it is a quick read, and there are a half-dozen glorious little images and asides."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book is great.

While out in the woods on one of their annual hunting trips, they become enmeshed in a military operation, commanded by a psycho named Kurtz, to cordon off the site of a flying saucer crash and annihilate every living thing - human, animal or alien - in the quarantine zone. As the plot evolves, another character, Duddits, moves to center stage. Duddits is a middle-aged man whom our four heroes had befriended during their common adolescence after rescuing him from a gang of bullies. Besides being afflicted with Down's Syndrome, Duddits is a remarkable telepath.My principal grumble with this book is that I expended too much time and attention on its 616 hard-backed pages for the degree of satisfaction I got for the effort. Roughly one-third of the book involves a vehicle pursuit - bad guys chase good guys chasing a good/bad guy - along the New England interstates. King uses this as an occasion for character and plot development. I just got fidgety. And while the author took the opportunity to demonstrate political correctness by making a mentally handicapped individual a hero, I never really warmed to the Duddits character. Also, since telepathy is at the core of the storyline, much of the \\"action\\" takes place in the players' minds, and I too often found it inadequately connected to the rest of the yarn.The author does manage to create some chilling situations, e.g. the fate of the hapless McCarthy, the lost hunter who stumbles into our heroes' hunting cabin. In the true King tradition, his brand of horror is sometimes understated. I like that.\\"Inside his lower intestine, in that rich dump of discarded food and worn-out dead cells, something for the first time opened its black eyes.\\" Oh-oh, it doesn't sound like something Maalox will fix.Die-hard King fans will perhaps rate this book much higher than I have. The fact remains, however, that I got to the point of wanting to finish DREAMCATCHER not because I anticipated a great ending, but because I just wanted to move on to the next tome on my shelf."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I've been a King fan for years (through all the ups &amp; downs)and although I found the book quite entertaining,(once you get started you just HAVE to know what comes next)I felt extremely let down at the end.All the build up &amp; momemtum,only to be told at the end,no big deal,the Aliens are'nt really dangerous &amp; would have died on their own!?!?! definitely a let down.

But before I get to my issues with it I want to say that Dreamcatcher has a lot of things going for it. The characters are interesting, the plot moves at its own steady rate, and I really liked how the military was involved.However, Dreamcatcher is a unnecessarily lengthy book, and even though it develops its characters that doesn't justify the books length. In all honestly I got sick of it around the 400 page mark and literally skipped 200 pages, and I didn't really miss a single thing. (And I don't typically skip pages in books, I read Under the Dome without skipping a single page)Aside from the books length though I don't really have too many qualms with Dreamcatcher, and its not one of his worst books or anything its just not as good as his others.

Many of the themes and ideas are old ones resprayed as new. Missing teeth smack of The Tommyknockers, and the &quot;Big childhood secret revisited in later life&quot; is hardly a diversion for him. Kurtz may be a name that King admits his military pantomime villain borrowed from Apocalypse Now, but that doesn't change the fact that it is a silly, infantile choice.Having said all that, it's still light years better than most sci-fi horror you'll pick up in the bargain bin of your local bookstore. It's certainly very funny (I laughed out loud at least three times) and the end is fast, violent and philosophical.It's not in the same league as The Shining, Firestarter and some of his other seminal stuff, but then they were a pretty high bar to have to clear every time.Maybe he's getting old, and losing it.I sincerely hope not."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I haven't read too many of his books yet (Sa.

Dreamcatcher and the first story of Hearts of Atlantis left me wanting to read more. This story was written by him while he was recovering from his injuries and it seems like he put ALL that recovery time into it. It is an excellent story and I especially like the parts when the character's are living through the tunnels of their minds especially the &quot;main conflicting mind battles&quot; of the main character. It really gets you thinking about how your mind works. It took me a while to buy this book because I associated it right away with some of the weirder science fiction type stories out there but it's not like that at all.

The novel might have been redeemed if it had focused more on the relationship of &quot;Duddits&quot; &amp; his four friends in their early years but that is only skimmed over in the briefest of flashbacks &amp; I never felt that I understood what created such a life-long bond between the five men.I would have liked to know more about the bully that they murdered in their dreams too. I think that would have been scary in that subtle way that characterizes King's finest writing. Once the aliens enter the picture the plot seemed needlessly complicated, especially parts involving Jonesy's body being taken over by the Gray Man. I found myself skimming over most of those scenes. I don't think, as some other reviewers have suggested, that Stephen King has &quot;lost it&quot;, but for me at least, I hope he finds inspiration for his next novel a little closer to home."},{"Title":"Ghost stories","review":"The Hardy Boys are so cool. The Hardy Boy's Ghost Stories is the best out of whole collection. The book gave me a hell of a scare.In my opinion The Walking Scarecrow is one of the best and most scariest stories ever written . I urge all readers to buy this book as it is so excellent. I think Franklin Dixion has out done himself with this marvellous novel."},{"Title":"Ghost stories","review":"This book has the best spine tingling stories ghost stories ever; I was sort of scared to go back to sleep after I finished a story. I recomend this book to anyone looking for a scream of a good time and a good scare!"},{"Title":"Mio, My Son","review":"I am a Child Development Teacher and in the past 6 years have worked with children ages 0 - 17 years. I am a very big fan of childrens literature and have read most of the popular stories including the Harry Potter series, Holes (before there was ever a movie) and such. When I was raving about Harry Potter my boyfriend insisted that the best children's fantasy book ever is Mio, My Son. He is Swedish and has only been in the U.S. for the past 7 years. I looked high and low for this book two years ago and finally had it transfered to my local library so I could read it.It is amazing. I really did love the story with the fantasy and the father / son connection. We are expecting our first baby this fall and I am so happy to see that this book is in reprint. I will definitely be purchasing a copy to put aside for our little one to read when he/she is older."},{"Title":"Mio, My Son","review":"Mio My Son, or Mio Min Mio as I like to call it, is one of the most beautiful books Astrid Lindgren has written. Although this new edition is somewhat confusing to me how they have changed the name of the main character from one Swedish name into another. The original name of Mio is Bo Willhelm Olsson and yet here they chose to name him Karl Anders Nilsson. And his aunt's name is really Edla - not Hulda, and his uncle's name is Sixten - not Olaf. Regardless it's one of the greatest stories ever told, a story filled with love, friendship, loyalty and bravery!"},{"Title":"Mio, My Son","review":"From E.A. Solinas' review: \\"It's never really dark or genuinely thrilling...\\"Absolutely no offense intended, but try saying that if you're an 8-year-old girl who loves horses and fairy tales! This book has haunted me for years. I checked it out time and time again from my school library, and tried to find it as an adult, but I couldn't remember the title, the main character's name OR the author. All I remembered was ...\\"a horse called Miramis\\"... but that was somehow enough to track it down on a lost books site.I remember the story as being mystical and full of entrancing descriptions. The story of a journey to destiny is timeless, and really captured me back then. I'm just thrilled to have found it again, and can't wait to get another copy."},{"Title":"Mio, My Son","review":"I am so happy to find this book in English so that I can share it to my little American friends. In Germany, where I was born in 1983, Astrid Lindgren is a 'must-have' in every children's bookshelf. I grew up with beautiful characters like Mio and Madita, Michel and Ronja. I think the other reviews speak for themselves, I just wanted to add one more thing from self experience:I think these bed-time fitted books (chapter length chosen for a 15 to 30 min reading session) are what made me dream as fantastic as I still do.Astrid Lindgren knew the secret of how to catch on to children's interest, and how to pack messages of value in understandable words for them..."},{"Title":"Mio, My Son","review":"A wonderful story about a boy and his father and their adventures in farawayland.

Also highly recommended by Astrid Lindgren is The Brothers Lionheart."},{"Title":"Mio, My Son","review":"Mio and the kind lady who gives him the magical apple; his escape from his unloving home; evil Sir Kato; the blue and red cloaks; the wonderful pancakes--all of this lives for me still. Beautiful Miramani, Mio's horse, runs beside me as I drive at twilight sometimes, and I long to share all this--and the pure joy of Mio's reunion with his father, the King--with my own son. Can you hear all of us, older children but still enchanted, asking you to let the magic touch another generation of our own children? Be noble, publishers, and we will be very grateful to you."},{"Title":"Mio, My Son","review":"I grew up with Astrid Lindgren and this book has made the most impact out of all her books.

I highly recommend it to anyone who dreams of living in a fantasty world of their own."},{"Title":"Mio, My Son","review":"Our whole family held their breath as this book was read aloud, and I could easily picture reading it in my classroom. Astrid Lindgren used such beautiful language and timeless symbols that Mio touches our deepest heart and highest aspirations, and will touch children (and adults)at all stages of development. Along with Lindgren's The Brothers Lionheart, these books are a must for family and classroom libraries, and are well worth searching for used copies if they remain out of print."},{"Title":"Mio, My Son","review":"First published in Swedish in 1954, Mio, My Son by Astrid Lindgren is a classic children's fantasy novel presenting the saga of Karl Anders Nilsson, a young boy who travels with the help of a genie to Farawayland where he meets his father the King, who loves him as his cold foster parents in Stockholm never did. It is in that very special kingdom that Karl first learns of a prophecy, and determines to pursue his duty to venture into the darkness of Outer Land and do battle with the vicious Sir Kato. A sweeping tale of adventure which has been translated into English by Jill Morgan and enhanced with illustrations by Hon Wikland, Mio, My Son is an enthusiastically recommended addition to any school or community library fantasy/fairytale collection for young readers."},{"Title":"Mio, My Son","review":"I read this book as a kid in Russia, where it was published as &quot;Mio, my Mio!&quot;.

It was read to me in third grade, and I still remember the wonderful story. I would love a copy of it, to be able to read to my children. The publisher should again make it available."},{"Title":"Mio, My Son","review":"As a boy I had studiously avoided Lindgren's more famous creation Pippi Longstocking, partly because it was about a GIRL (\\"The horror! The horror!\\"), but also because it struck me at the time as just too silly. \\"Mio, My Son\\" is neither, but I had never heard of it before stumbling upon it in the list of chapter books reprinted by Purple House Press, which specializes in reprinting OOP children's classics. Since they had started by reprinting no less than FIVE of my favorite books from my childhood, all long out of print until they came along, I was inclined to trust their judgment sight unseen. \\"Mio, My Son\\" at least, did not disappoint.Perhaps because it began as a short story of Andy and the genie, which Lindgren later expanded into the current novel, \\"Mio, My Son\\" starts rather slowly. I know that I began to wonder when \\"something\\" was going to \\"happen\\" after Mio arrived in Farawayland, but be patient. Lindgren is slowly drawing you into her world, making you care for characters that shortly will be plunged into terrible danger in the rousing climax. The charming illustrations by Ilon Wikland nicely complement the story. After this I am looking forward to reading PHP's other Astrid Lindgren titleThe Brothers Lionheartwith greater interest.Note: The publisher claims the reading level as 6-12; IMHO it's better classified towards the younger end of that scale, ESPECIALLY for boys. The Purple House reprint ofMio, My Sonis worth picking up even if you own an older edition because of the smooth new English translation by Jill Morgan (the publisher herself?)."},{"Title":"Mio, My Son","review":"This story has all the enchantment and adventure that young children love.

The author makes some fascinating connections between the ancient tradition of the epic journey with the more recent American tradition of the \\"Wild West\\". The reader is shown how themes of journey and exploration, and the archetypal characters associated with these themes, have continued from ancient times to the modern era. Johnson-Smith utilizes case studies of several key science fiction series including \\"Babylon 5\\", \\"StarGate SG-1\\"; \\"Space: Above and Beyond\\", and others to reveal common narrative patterns and visual styles. These case studies explore diverse themes including politics, ideology, race and ethnicity, gender difference, militarism, and the use of science fiction narratives as allegories of present-day social and political issues. American Science Fiction TV will prove of immense interest to students of American Popular Culture, the history of American television programming, and fans of fantasy and science-fiction."},{"Title":"American Science Fiction TV: Star Trek, Stargate, and Beyond","review":"Johnson-Smith, a lecturer in film and TV at an English university, reaches the conclusion that unlike earlier periods of science fiction, \\"modern American sf fiction is neither utopian or dystopian...it enforces a critique of the Western mythos whilst renegotiating its finer aspects.\\" This Western mythos centers on the desire for exploration. This desire was seen as far back as the Gilgamesh myth of the ancient Babylonians; and it emerged in American culture especially in Westward expansion and the related romance of the West. It entails a sense of wonder and the hope of encounter with the Sublime--elements undeniably evident in modern TV sci-fi, which are a major reason for their appeal. But imparting this sense of wonder and picturing the Sublime became possible only when TV technology improved from its first days. Only in recent years has TV arrived in an \\"era where far-seeing 'tele-vision' can finally live up to its name\\" by making use of \\"brilliant colors and dynamic motion\\" to enhance sf narratives. Today's TV science-fiction shows, notably \\"Star-Trek,\\" are contrasted with earlier ones such as \\"Twilight Zone\\" creating an atmosphere mainly by suggestion, leaving much to the viewer's imagination. The author identifies a new era in science-fiction TV and analyzes the bases of its themes and popular appeal."},{"Title":"Ha-Siddur Hashalem Daily Prayer Book","review":"To this day, even though new prayer books have appeared since it was first published, the Birnbaum prayer book is the finest English prayer book available. There are several reasons why I prefer it:(1) The nice, traditional block Hebrew letters. I find them easier to read than the modern ones such as the Koren Bible or Artscroll Prayer book letters.(2) The uniform type size.(3) The plain page layout without annoying shaded boxes and other divisions. I find this much more pleasant and relaxing to look at, rather than a \\"busy\\" page which tends to distract the reader. This also reduces the number of times one has to turn the page during a particular section of the prayer service.(4) The translation. In order to appreciate it I strongly recommend reading his introduction. He makes it clear that he is NOT aiming for a literal translation which can be very confusing, particularly for the more poetic sections, but a modern English translation that conveys the actual meaning of the prayer. Birnbaum also makes clear that he wants to avoid the seemingly \\"exalted\\" but archaic English of the King James Bible which left its imprint on Jewish translations into English, but which is frequently alien to the modern English speaker.Thus, as I said, the translation is much more modern, with the exception of references to G-d, where he does retain the more \\"exalted\\" forms, such as with the blessings whose form is \\"Blessed are thou\\" instead of \\"you\\".It has been pointed out that the more recent Artscroll Siddur gives more instructions for beginners on how to conduct the prayers, but for someone who is somewhat familiar with this, the superior translation of Birnbaum makes this one more useful."},{"Title":"Ha-Siddur Hashalem Daily Prayer Book","review":"It is true as a previous reviewer has written that today we have more fully annotated Siddurim than the Birnbaum work. But the Birnbaum was the main Siddur in its time. And as such it contributed to the Tefillah of thousands of Jews. How is it possible to have anything but the highest praise for the Jew who in a time when Torah knowledge was not that great in America, did so much to give other Jews a good Siddur to pray with?"},{"Title":"Ha-Siddur Hashalem Daily Prayer Book","review":"The title here might not tell you what this is. This is the 786-page plue Siddur with the blue cover and English translation, and no changes in the size of the hebrew type. It was originally copyrighted in 1949 by the now defunct Hebrew Publishing Company, which produced the vast majority of Hebrew books found in American Orthodox (and Conservative) Jewish synagogues till the early 1980s. If you go and check an old American Siddur or Chumash pubished between about 1930 and 1980 even one you think is very different, quite often you will find it was published by the Hebrew Publishing CompanyPhillip Birnbaum prepared many books and several Siddurim. The commmentary is brief, occasiobnal, and basic. What he writes may not be all that great - he did not know that much with all his intentions.Most standard weekly and daily prayers are in her with English translation. If you want a translation of Tefillat Haderech (Prayer for a Safe Journey) you can get it here.This Siddur even includes the rarely found Megillas Chasmonoam (Maccabee scroll) on page 713. This was read in Italianmn synagigues during the Middle Ages and is part of the liturgy of the yemeite Jews. It was an attempt to wroite something like the scroll of Esther and has got all kinds of glaring mistakes like having Matisyahu die after Judah the Maccabee and Judah the Maccabee die very early. It is a reconstruction. It should not be confused with the apocryphal books of Maccabees which were preserved only in Greek or other Christian Bibles, although maybe by now some old Dead Sea scrolls or Cairo genizah manuscripts have been found I'm not sure."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"I have followed the story of Mr. Jett since it first broke. I am generally intrigued by Blacks who work on Wall Street, and when I first heard this story I was amazed that Blacks could do so well there.Initially I felt that Jett got the shaft, and became the scapegoat for his corporate mongers. After reading the book I feel a bit different. It is evidenced by this book that Jett is an intelligent and perceptive man. Yet he reminds me of those who are too intelligent, and too perceptive for their own good. He seems to have lived in a world in which he was compelled to prove others wrong, even when there was only an inkling that he might be right. He seems to have lived in a world in which if the computer says it's so, then it must be so. As if to say, hey it's not my fault you can't design a system that stops me from showing enormous profits.Upon deeper review of this book I find that because of his intelligence, confidence, and arrogance, that Mr. Jett comes across as no more than a glorified SMART-ASS. And nobody likes a smart-ass. If not for the alleged ineptitude of his superiors, Mr. Jett would probably be in jail.At the same time I salute Mr. Jett for various reasons. 1. He's the only person in corporate America to at least attempt to challenge the mythical God status of Jack Welch. 2. He never laid down for those who sought to stereotype and demean him on the basis of his race. 3. He gave us insight into the most intersting person in the whole saga, his father. 4. He showed himself to be neither too right nor too wrong in the scandal.And I too feel it was a miscarriage of justice to accquit him of fraud and find him guilty of records and books violations. I admire Mr. Jett, I frown upon Mr. Jett all at the same time.But in the end no one likes a smart-ass!"},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"After reading this book, I can tell that Mr. Jett is dying to tell his side of the story because nobody seems to care about it. Readers will quickly notice that Mr. Jett writes this book because he wants to gain some support from people outside Wall Street.This book also shows that Mr. Jett is too powerless to defend his reputation against a powerful company like GE which partially controls the world of journalism. Furthermore, it seems that the author is trying to raise some money to pay for his attorney's fees. Thus, in my opinion, this book is rather biased in its address.Not only does this book talk about how the financial world works, it also addresses serious issues behind corporate walls. This book should be read to understand how corporate politics work. This book can help powerless people defend themselves from cruel corporate politics.Overall, this book is fairly enjoyable and should be easily understood by general readers, despite the fact that the complex bond trading strategy that Mr. Jett explains in the book is very hard to understand."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"As one of the 6,000 people who lost their job thanks to this man I had to waste the money to read his side. I was one of many people who were working around the clock for forty five days unraveling what he did. It made everyone sick when we were told how much he actually lost. He has failed to give the entire story and left out many, many key facts. I'm so sorry I gave him my money to read this piece of garbage.

He is conceited &amp; greedy, but I think he is honest, intelligent and hardworking. Jett was truly a victim."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"This story reveals the ugly side of human nature and racism at the highest levels of finance on Wall Street.

In this book, we got to hear more about this mysterious &quot;power wielding&quot; Black man. From the time the scandal took place. I thirst for a closer, more intimate knowledge of what really (opinionated) happened.This book was enlightening; however, more technical specific than the general reading population needed for it to be. The use of big words provided the adequate reader with an exercise in vocabulary, which is always very useful."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"Although Mr Jett is clearly beyond arrogant and out of touch with the real issues relative to race relations in America, he simply played the hand he was dealt to his best advantage and it's insane to believe that anyone else in his situation wouldn't have done likewise. He made the mistake of placing his trust in those who held no regard for him or his best interest. It's a must read for every African-American active in corporate America."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"I am the spouse of an ex-Kidder employee who was deeply involved in figuring out what Jett did and how he did it. He is guilty as can be, he put everyone at Kidder through pure hell, and he has gone virtually unpunished. If you must read this book, get it from the library--don't donate money to him. He already has much more than he deserves."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"yeah the struggle continues, victory is certain.. it's not quite surprising that even though this guy went to some of the best schools, he still has to face the same circumstances the average black man on the street faces... it's obvious from Jett's account that a lot of racial prejudice still exists in this country."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"As a African-American I found this book to be very informative. It helped cultivate my knowledge of blacks in corporate America. Moreover, Jett is a great writer, I've also learned many new vocabulary in this book.This book also teach you to trust no one."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"When I first read the book, I was sympathetic to Mr. Jett because many times blacks must walk into corporate America with \\"double consciousness\\"----knowledge that you have to be twice as good to land and maintain your image in corporate America. Yet, Mr. Jett should have seen the cycle of set-ups. When one of the fund managers asked him \\"How many blonde women have you f-c-k-ed?\\" It should have been obvious that they were in a competition and that there was a type of non-Oedipal \\"penis-envy\\" occurring. However, Mr. Jett proceeded to acknowledge this question, answer it, and state that he had \\"done\\" more than his colleague. Knowing the history of lynching, Mr. Jett should have known that this was a booby trap. Yet, he didn't deserve the set-up. I read this book because during the time of its publication, I worked in corporate America and I needed coaxing. I was the highest producer on my unit. Yet, no one seemed to appreciate it and I felt unwanted, and often, downright ignored. I since quit and started my own business and selling real estate. The book provided catharsism because it helped me see that racism was not personal; it was racial. I am glad that Mr. Jett had a chance to exonerate himself."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"As a former Kidder Peabody employee on the government desk, I am thoroughly nauseated with this delusional account of events. The fantasy element expressed throughout this fairy tale makes me think it would have been more appropriatley titled, &quot;Joe Jett in Wonderland&quot;. His completely fraudulent actions not only displaced thousands of hardworking and honest Kidder employees, but also further damaged the reputation of Wall Street. Lastly, his making this a racial issue is disgusting, and hopefully he will also be excommunicated from the African American community as well as that of Wall Street."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"Joseph Jett is an appalling African-American. He basically denied his race, as black as he was, for the purpose of becoming regarded as a 'good ole boy' on Wall Street. He never dated black women; he never supported the black interns and students; he helped to demean women in general. I'm a Black woman, and I don't like him. He screamed discrimination when he couldn't date white women. I wouldn't want any of my sisters, black or white, to have lunch with him, let alone date him. He was his own undoing. I know that there's discrimination everywhere in this world, but since he is an uptight, arrogant, unnecessarily rude person, he deserved to be brought down a peg or two. He didn't even consider going to a Black firm, until everyone on White Wall Street rejected him. He only associated with his own people, when he had no choice. He never considered Black counsel. He never mentioned church. Even though his trades were walking the fine line of being legitimate, he was clearly out of line. He made his bed, associating with unscrupulous businessmen,in the first place. A good upbringing should have taught him that ambition isn't a sin, but greed is. I think that he got off too easily."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"It's been a long time since Joe Jett was in the news, despite his hefty PR Agency bills, but I just couldn't resist making a couple of comments.I was flying home yesterday on a AerLingus flight from Dublin and by chance flipped to one of the in-flight channels that was showing the 1999 BBC \\"documentary\\" Blood on the Carpet. I had never seen this \\"documentary,\\" before and was surprised to see iit aired so many years after the actual events took place. II worked with Joe at CSFB in the mid 1980's. I was amazed to how the BBC was capable of painting Joe as the good guy-- as someone who's been falsely accused, and used as a scapegoat. Joe was fired from CSFB for a reason. He was probably one of the most unethical (and ineffective) people I have ever worked with in my 22 years on Wall Street. He was deceitful on more than one occasion in an effort to improve his position within the firm. I've never seen anything like it since. But that's not why he was fired. He was fired because he produced very little that was considered to be value added, socially as well as economically.I'll never forget the day in the early 1990's when an old CSFB colleague called me and mentioned that Joe was now considered to be a big shot on Kidder's government trading desk. I was dumbfounded, commenting on how this couldn't possibly be the same Joe that I knew. It wasn't long after this call that Joe's Kidder career came to an end.What strikes me most about the BBC's \\"documentary\\" is the lack of research that was done prior to it's production. Not one former colleague was interviewed other than the Kidder or GE bosses that were involved in the legal proceedings. Joe demonstrated a pattern of deceit during his career, and any investigative reporter (or employer for that matter!) worth his/her salt would have looked into why he was fired from 2 firms in a relatively short period of time.However, Kidder is not without blame. Joe's boss and the firm allowed the fraud to occur by not being more careful about how strips and Treasury bond profits/losses were accounted for. Unfortunately, Kidder (apparently) wasn't thinking enough about how a rogue trader might use the system for personal gain.Finally, it's worth mentioning the outcome of Joe's appeal to the SEC's ruling. Joe filed an appeal on 8/11/1998. On March 5th, 2004, the SEC ruled that Joe was indeed required to disgorge $8.21mm in unearned income, and also had to pay the $200,000 in civil penalties. Joe was also barred from working in any registered securities business for life. (Hedge Funds are unregulated)Why do I feel compelled to write about Joe and the series \\"Blood on the Carpet?\\" For several reasons I suppose. Joe, in my humble opinion, is a fraud. And yet, the BBC (and by Joe's own accounts in his many books) has him portrayed as the good guy being attacked by big corporate America and subject to overt racism. What a great story for the media, it's got all the right stuff. Color, money, sex, bla, bla, bla. What a bunch of B.S.What have I learned from this experience? Several things, but number one is to be very careful about who you hire. Kidder blew it by hiring this guy. All they needed to do was to dig a little into Joe's past, and they could have saved themselves alot of grief. This is particularially true in the financial services industry. It only takes one rouge trader or crook to take the whole place down. There have been multiple examples; Barings, Kidder, immediately come to my mind."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"Joseph Jett and Sabra Chartrand write an amusing book with a well ordered presentation of the facts.There are times I think Joseph had enough hubris for all Egypt. He must have been a thorn to several of the people he worked with. Given his intelligence one would think he has more insight into what happened than he has shared with the reader but the book is an excellant defense against his accusers and give a clear view of one slice of Wall Street.I'm suggesting the book to several librarians."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"I had the pleasure of interviewing Mr. Jett recently and was shocked to learn that as a result of a threatened libel suit from Mr. Ed Cerullo (Jett's manager at Kidder) that the Hearst Corporation ordered an end to all publicity efforts for this book. The Hearst Corp. is apparently the owner of the book's stated publisher William Morrow Inc.It is a pity that a publisher refuses to support what in my opinion is a long overdue accounting of Kidder, Wall Street, and the complex issues of race relations in our society.According to Jett, Hearst Corp on receiving the threat of the libel action from Cerullo (who now claims that some of his best friends are black and who seeks damages in the multimillions in order to donate the money to unnamed minority charities) immediately ordered Jett's publicists who were fielding offers left and right for interviews to break off contact with Jett and are seeking settlement terms with Cerullo while leaving Jett out to dry.Hey Hearst! Wake up! Since when did a publisher back down from a threatened lawsuit.Is there no free press in this country anymore? I thought that one of the most fascinating themes in this book was the failure of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal to report on Jett's trial after condemning the guy in repeated editorials. With Hearst that aspect of the story is being replayed yet again.Good luck and God be with you, Mr. Jett"},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"The book was excellent!! A must reading. When Black Men raise their male children and instill in them strength, courage and self esteem, the results produce Men who can overcome and win. The playing field is never level, no matter what you choose to believe. Unless you have a pitbull mentality (not everyone wants to fight) you don't stand a chance for very long in corporate america. If you stay it will make you crazy and you loose something from your soul. Mr. Jett lacked balanced in his life and he paid. I believe he was/is inocent, but what a price to pay. If you don't own your own, you are always a slave. What about the fixation on Mr. Jett's sexual life? Is that what it all boils down to sex and power among men? What do White men really fear, a gang banger or a Brooks Brothers Suit?"},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"I found this book to be excellent - a most realistic account of the political gamesplaying and cutthroat nature of many firms (law, consulting, financial services, etc) It should be required reading for anyone(no matter their ethnicity)who plays in these arenas. Most will recognize what is described. At the very least, it illustrates the necessity of documenting EVERYTHING for your own records, lest some serious finger-pointing should occur at a later time. Not the most stress-free way to live, but necessary!Having worked for one of GE's components, I understood completely both the pressure and mania preceding delivering financial numbers to the parent company. I also understood how significant it is that GE's &quot;smoking gun&quot; computer system was so conveniently &quot;destroyed&quot;. I can assure you it would not have been if its existence was favorable to Kidder Peabody/GE.Mr. Jett does a great job of creating a very readable account. What could have been rather dry and confusing detail is laid out with thorough logic. The pace is swift and absorbing - I certainly could not put it down until the last page. I found myself eager to know what has come of the appeals of the SEC ruling.Speaking of which...seems odd that both the Justice Department and the National Assoc of Securities Dealers panel(the people who also did this for a living and understood Jett's trading strategy)exonerated him while the SEC judge (who was not finance-savvy and was working her first case) said he was innocent of securities fraud but had the intent, was abiding by the firm's own bookkeeping rules yet had bookeeping errors?! A lot of inconcistencies in her ruling it seemed to me - if she agreed that his bookkeeping was in compliance with the firm's rules, how could they be errors? She should then have found all KP traders in violation as well.A great read, don't let any lack of familiarity with trading/financial jargon confuse you or divert you from the ultimate conclusion."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"I am a black independent &quot;Wall Street&quot; trader and I find the story compelling and what I would expect of any black working for a major wall street investment firm. Sure it's ok to make some money(peanuts)comparitively to what the firm earns, but to consolidate power! You must be kidding.Let's be real. Can we truly see a black individual leading any of the major wall street firms, based on hard work and merit. Goldie, Merrill, or JP Morgan just to name a few. Can't be, for if it were so there should be one by now. Oh I forgot, there are no black traders competent enough.Americans need to wake up and stop being so naive. My clearing firm has a risk manager that understand my trades, how can $30 billion be moved by a single individual and no one notice. We are not talking about some corner store banker, but a bank once owned by General Electric.I feel for any person that thinks he deserved what he experienced compared to the fines of his colleagues.

But on reading this book my mind has been changed. Here's a guy who despite what I feel are legitimate grievances on racial discrimination never played the race card a la Johnnie Cochran and even fired a lawyer who tried to make his race an issue. That is integrity enough for me.His father reminded me of my own father an Italian immigrant who insisted that we better ourselves and there's an old saying that the fruit does not fall far from the tree.As a current day trader and former Wall Street trader, I found Jett's descriptions of his trading to be legitimate strategies. I was not surprised that no legal entity found his trades illegal. Clearly there was severe balance sheet manipulation occuring but his managers denials of directing him are just obvious attemts to CYA. Even if Jett had no integrity, the taped conversations of his managers puts the question of Jett's innocence beyond doubt.Finally this is an extremely well written book, concise, incredibly frank. The guy does not try to portray himself as a do-gooder which he clearly isn't. But he certainly is convincing in showing that he is an innocent man."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"The book was very loathsome to me as an African-American woman. It appears an immoral man who happened to have brown skin went to work for an immoral company.Kidder Peabody's management and staff, embodied in the villainous Ed Cerullo, thought being white and working on Wall Street was the great divider between themselves and everyone who wasn't one of them. On the other hand, Joseph Jett thought that making money at their game was the great equalizer.Wake up Mr. Jett. You belittled yourself and disgraced African-Americans by playing their game.If Mr. Jett had any concept of evil (e.g. racism, sexism, deception, etc.)he would have left them to their own vices when all that incorrigible behavior first began. I hope we, African-Americans and white people, are reminded by this book to stand up for our principles and leave the people like those who worked at Kidder Peabody (including Mr. Jett) to devour each other in their insatiable greed, arrogance and racism.Finally, this book has a caution for the rest of us. Don't invest one dollar in a company that doesn't operate in a manner which you respect."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"Joseph Jett owes his readers a detailed explanation concerning his highly controversial trading strategies. I do not feel comfortable that Jett has yet to do this. It is not how I perceive an innocent man would respond to baseless charges. After all, this is the crux of his predicament. I readily admit that my lack of knowledge might limit my own personal understanding of these allegedly highly complicated strategies. Nonetheless, If Jett wants the general public to conclude that he was wrongly charged with moral failings instead of incompetence--then he must allow an opportunity for those wise of enough to grasp these intricacies to freely judge his decisions.Jett was guilty of at least being way over his head. The best case that can be made for him is that both he and his superiors lied to themselves about the actual results of his trades. Everybody preferred to believe that like the alchemists of the middle ages, Jett could make gold out of nothing. Was Jett treated somewhat unfairly? I think that many of Jett's bosses should have shared in the blame, but instead conveniently set him up to take the fall all by himself. Jett's blackness might have been a double edge sword---it forced him to endure inadvertent, if not deliberate, racist attitudes--and may also have deflected a serious look at his trades until it was too late! Jett can say all he wants, but his employers obviously relished displaying a black man to the world as one of their top traders."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"Having been exposed to racism on wall street, I know first hand how dificult and hard it is to put words in a book to describe the feeling, pain and frustration of being of color on White Wall Street.

We were so impressed by this young man that we invited him to attend our synagogue. We both thought that this is a man who should be the next Jesse Jackson. After reading his story, I am even more impressed. The book is very fast paced, impossible to put down. It revealed a side of African-American prejudices of which I was completely unaware. I found myself caught up in the mystery of who was race-baiting Mr. Jett and was amazed to read the trial testimony of the race-baiter. The story certainly made the cutthroat world of Wall Street come to life but this is really more of a human interest story than a business book. Which was good as I am financially illiterate. In the end, I say a prayer for Mr. Jett and hope that things go his way so that he regains his name as he clearly had so much to offer his people."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"Black and White on Wall Street is a persuasive account of a scandalous event.

I picked it up because the story of Joseph Jett seemed intriguing, but sadly, the book ends up being dragged down by the fact that Jett is a very unlikeable person, the way he tells the story makes it obvious that he is lying about what actually happened, and in the end the book doesn't say much more about Wall Street than we already know.Jett was fingered as the guilty party in a bond trading scandal at the firm of Kidder Peabody and black-listed from Wall Street. This book is Jett's attempt at his side of the story in an effort to prove his innocence. The main problem for me in reading this book is that Jett comes across as a real jerk, and as a result, I really didn't empathize with his position and I really didn't care about what happened to him -- my feeling was &quot;This greedy arrogant jerkwad got what he deserved.&quot;Secondly, the parts of the book detailing what supposedly happened at Kidder Peabody just don't seem realistic. I've worked in the securities industry, so I have something to guage Jett's story by, and it just doesn't come across as 100% accurate. I think the real truth is somewhere in the middle of what Kidder Peabody said, and what Jett said.The early chapters of the book, where Jett describes his upbringing and life before Wall Street, were the best ones, because you get to understand the forces that drive him and the barriers he had to overcome. The book rapidly degenerates after the early chapters and I found it quite boring. If you haven't read any books about Wall Street or the real world of finance, then you might find this interesting. If you have, you won't miss anything by skipping Jett's tale."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"In summary, I think it's clear Joe Jett was falsely accused of conducting trades without his bosses' knowledge. I don't even think his race was the primary factor in his being selected as the scapegoat; that can be left to those with more direct insight.What I do think this book presents is a Black man who went into one of the most racist, sexist, selfish cultures in corporate America and came out (temporarily) on top. I must applaud Mr. Jett for this accomplishment.On the flip side, I think Jett is a cautionary example of Blacks' need for a strong sense of self and spirituality when dealing with the immense pressures of corporate America. In addition to racism, I related to Jett's early ostracism from Blacks who felt he was too &quot;nerdy&quot; or &quot;bookish&quot; to be &quot;down&quot;, and we've all suffered romantic rejection at some point. It seems, however, that these experiences led Jett to reject both his Christian religion and his racial identity, leaving him without any moral/spiritual anchors to help him maneuver the shark-infested waters at Kidder. Perhaps if he'd had a woman of substance (preferably Black- but at least someone who wasn't picked up at a club by his &quot;Harvard&quot; name-dropping) by his side, and some sort of spiritual center, he'd have walked off the Kidder scene before things got out of control, or demanded that some of the accounting games be stopped."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"Yes, he is telling the truth. Yes, racism is alive and well in corporate America. I can relate and so can many intelligent, driven African Americans in corporate America. I see a lot of negative comments (mostly from New York, go figure.) I notice most are about the man and not about the book. I suggest you read the book. It's wonderful!!!!! He admits he's not a saint. Are any of us? Sainthood is not a requirement to equality and is NO excuse for racism! And that's what this story and the negative comments on this page reveal. RACISM! Congrats Mr. Jett! You've fought a good fight. You may have lost a few battles along the way, but you've definately won the war!"},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"The book is typical SOP (standard operating procedure) at GE where big soft egos are easily crushed. It certainly is not unique to just American-blacks as I was one of many that faced phantom policies (situational ethics) within GE control. (I have yet to meet an African-American in my 60 years). I am a American native, an unproven minority within GE.Control of creative entreprenuers such as Joe Jett is a fear management obtains with their belief to be at risk if not suppressed. Wimps/nerds that tend to raise above the status quo become a critical issue and are due their &quot;time in the barrel&quot; under relentless management focus, and is not usually a racial problem. Business focus on Team building to maintain equilibrium for such misfits is the tatic used by weak management. Joe resisted the mold being created for him through their traditions and personal guidance. His personal goals and risk taking was beyond their precepts.Resolutions using computer programmers is a risky venture since their insight was subject to several of their bosses redirection fixes. Joe's experience in the &quot;snake pit&quot; adds to the understanding of tunning the software for the desired results, but failed to hit the constant moving targets, the insight Joe had and provided upfront. Their &quot;TEAM&quot; lacked candor within Kidder, Peabody and GE Corp which eventually set all of them up to fail while attempting to protect &quot;their turf.&quot; Even rats leave a sinking ship, and Joe forsaw the need to seek new employment. (I was told to leave GE, without any cause being presented).The book came up to my expectations with the exception to his/their racial issues. Joe was in a &quot;poker game&quot; where the stakes became out of control by the decision makers. The wining hand wasn't at Kidder, Peabody and their belief that computers can solve such complex issues."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"Mr. Jett, while not being the most likeable person, gets it right about corporate America and its relationship with Black America. He comes off a little arrogant and I think is a little out of touch with the issues of race in America. In a perfect world we should only be judged by our smarts and talents, but that just does not happen. However, I have experienced many of the things Mr. Jett writes about in his book. The corporate in-fighting, racism, and arrogance of surperiors makes it twice as hard for talented black americans to make it in the corporate world. The book itself was very captivating and easy to read. Mr. Jett is not completely innocent here. His greatest crime was collaborating with his surperiors and expecting them to stand by him. It is a valuable lesson for any worker to learn."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"Jett makes a clear case on how big business fashions the truth through their control of the media.

I believe that he thought he had a winning trading strategy, and he held his cards close to his chest. Mr. Jett way over traded his portfolio limits, and of course his system was flawed. In the end Mr. Jett distroyed Kidder Peabody. Through out the book Mr. Jett talks about sex, race, and white women; but this is all meant to be a smoke screen of the facts."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"This well written book should be on the required read list of every African American beginning in grade school thru college and beyond. I pray that Mr. Jett's reputation is restored but I am not optimistic considering the unfavorable media treatment he received when the story broke and almost non-coverage upon acquittal. This book's account of Wall Street behavior is consistent with other reads and should be made into a movie with Eddie Murphy protraying Mr. Jett in his first dramatic role. Hurray for an honest and courageous judge who is truly interested in truth and justice. I also find it revealing that although Mr. Jett was acquitted, he is still referred to as a criminal in some comments."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"One thing the book does is expose the &quot;greed is good&quot;, &quot;money is holier than character&quot;, &quot;by any means necessary&quot;, culture that is rampant on Wall Street.

I have experienced some of that."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"Exceptionally triumphant for Mr Jett, his book is fantastic. Shunning affirmative action programs at school and work, disdain for government assistance programs why? Because each of us has to make it on our own without crutches, thats why. Mr Jett is to be highly commended for his achievements academically and in the tough white culture business world. He is a success, the bigots are apparently still there on Wall Street, even so, Mr Jett succeeded in a manner each of us can learn from. Also eye opening is a view into the cheap, immature sexual hang-ups of typical polished Wall Street types who abuse women and offer low brow jokes about them to disguise their immaturity and infatuation with themselves. Of course they're afraid of smart, beautiful women, they crow together in bars to smirk their fantasies out to each other, all the while fearing for their jobs and wives at homes who no doubt rule the roost. Hooray for Mr Jett, much success and luck to him in his long life."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"If you have any doubts about purchasing this book, first read some of the 49 reviews (thus far). Immediately, you'll notice a trend. Overwhelmingly, readers are convinced of Joseph Jett's account of the facts. On the other end of the spectrum, you'll read a few accounts of individuals who claim to have worked with Mr. Jett or have somehow come to the conclusion that Mr. Jett is lying. I put my faith in most people's ability to discern the truth by using a modicum of critical thinking. I actually laughed out loud when I read comments by those who stated, &quot;I am the wife of an ex-Kidder employee&quot; or &quot;I worked at Kidder and lost my job.&quot; Their comments make no mention of the legalities of the case or ridiculous control GE had over the media and the legal system. If the &quot;superiors&quot; at Kidder had &quot;no clue&quot; (according to their inept recollection), why would a wife or ex-employee know whether or not Joseph Jett had &quot;taken down&quot; Kidder Peabody? Executives at Kidder said they had no idea what was going on, I doubt a lower-level employee or wife (who no doubt was biased about her husband's loss of a job) would have ingenious insight.This book was absolutely fascinating!!! After reading this book, I gave it (or recommended it) to my brother, mother, father, sisters, husband, brother-in-laws and countless friends who all came to the same conclusion, &quot;innocent,&quot; without any prompting by me.BY FAR, THIS WAS THE BEST BOOK I READ ALL YEAR!!!(which says a lot--our family reads tons). The technical aspects of the book require more dedicated attention as you read, however, even if you have troubles with this section, it's clear that Joseph Jett was wrongfully accused of single-handedly taking down Kidder Peabody. The reader does not (and probably should not) come to this conclusion based on one account of a Wall Street employee, but on the countless other books and accounts with similar tones--BIG MONEY (I.E. GE C0RPORATION) PRECLUDE THE FAIR OUTCOME OF ALMOST ANY TRAIL. Why are we shocked at the outcome?I was extremely saddened at the end of the book. It it disturbing that both the Justice Department and the National Association of Securities Dealers exonerated him of any wrong-doing, while the SEC judge (who does not have a finance understanding and was working her first case) said he was innocent of securities fraud but had the intent to fraud the company, although Jett was abiding by the firm's own bookkeeping rules. There were just too many inconcistencies in her ruling.By the way, our family consists of Latino, White, and African Americans members, all of whom have B.A.'s, Master's, MBA's, and PhD's. All reached the same conclusion--Joseph Jett is innocent.In the end, this book not only does an excellent job of portraying Jett's case, but it also re-awakens our consciousness about the unfair control that weathly corporations have in America which, in the end, dictate what happens in our court-rooms, what we see on television and what we read in the papers. This is why reading a variety of perspectives is so critical--don't rely on TV to give you the truth!!"},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"I'm an I-banker and former CPA. I read this book and still can't tell who's right. More than likely as with most arguments, the truth is somewhere in the middle.Jett builds a great case of his bosses setting him up but when someone works this hard at it, I become very suspicious. He does have some very creditable points that his bosses knew or should have known what his accounting practices were. Employee of the year to criminal? Where was internal audit?Basically, this book allows you to hear one side of the story for you to draw your opinions from. I'm not sure what is correct but I enjoyed the read and see one more time the &quot;ego filled&quot; life of Wall Streeters."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"As a member of the Kidder,Peabody Diaspora I received a special case of whiplash from being yanked back to the time and events that Joe Jett describes in his book. It might take one or two more books on this subject by other authors, but eventually everyone will realize that, because the securities industry is essentially a cartel, it is able to tolerate incredibly mediocre people in senior management positions... people like Mel Mullin, Ed Cerullo and Mike Carpenter, or the general counsel of Morgan Stanley. For the dumb cartel members there is very little upside in pursuing excellence. The smart ones, however, need the dumb ones in order to fill out the ranks and help maintain the status quo. I think one reason why Jack Welch disliked Kidder so much is that he had very little personal respect for its managers.Most readers will probably be convinced that Jett's management new about his trading activity, and that the firm's accusations were an attempt to save Carpenter's and also Jack Welch's reputation. (By the way, the whole Jett episode has echoes of GE's industrial diamond price-fixing scandal which preceded it.)If these men's credibility couldn't be maintained, then that of the cartel as a whole (and thus the credibility of the regulators) was at stake.I think the real phantom trade was the cost of Ed Cerullo's deferred compensation, along with Joe Jett's career and that of several others in exchange for the status quo."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"Mr. Jett sets himself up as the fall guy for Kidder's inept management. While that's a nice scenerio, it's simply not the case here. The truth is, Jett did take credit for $350 million in paper profits that didn't exist, and pocketed over $8 million in commissions and bonuses he knew he didn't earn. In reality he lost money trading Fed Bonds from 1993-1994. He made fictitious Profit &amp; Loss gains (P&amp;Ls) by moving up the settlement date 90 days plus. When Kidder, Peabody finally found this out, they had to re-adjust their books and take a $350 million loss. It ruined the firm. Yes, Virginia, he really did bring down Kidder, Peabody."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"The reader learns next to nothing about bond trading or Wall Street. Jett feels that his trading activity was real and profitable, but declines to give the reader the nuts and bolts of his strategy because it is too technical and difficult for us. Of course, this does little to counter the argument of Jett's attackers that there was nothing to Jett's trades and strategy and that his profits where nonexistent and simply accounting tricks to obtain bonuses from his employer. (See http://www.sec.gov/enforce/alj/id127cff.htm for the SEC decision.)Jett was not a particularly nice guy to work for since he viewed work as a strictly impersonal war. Thus, it's hard to commiserate with his protestations that others in this &quot;war&quot; were &quot;unfair&quot; to him.Jett describes many situations that did call for positive ethical actions by him. Mr. A hires Jett to investigate Mr. C and liquidate some assets. Jett meets with Mr. C who tells him that he isn't going to investigate or liquidate anything, but Jett can come and work for C at a higher rate of pay. Jett didn't blink in changing sides. Jett is hired as a Vice President (thus owing a fiduciary duty to the company), but never reports to the Board of Directors or the CEO various irregularities of those around him.In the end, I don't know what this books tells you. Jett had many commendable personal qualities and was may well have been subjected to terrible racism and corporate world mendacity. But Jett doesn't present any clear proof that his trades were anything more than accounting entries that foolish and greedy people used to give themselves bonuses. Jett may or may not have done right, but he doesn't give us the info to decide."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"As a person close to much of that described in the book, I can say that Joe Jett is completely deluded. Additionally, it stuns me that such a poorly written fantasy has been promoted heavily let alone published at all. Were it not for the comic value that exists for me as someone who knows much of the reality re. all of this, I would not have graced this piece of trash with more than a very few moments of my time."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"I knew Joe Jett while I was working on Kidder's mortgage-backed security trading desk. Joe alleges that white Kidder higher ups were jealous because he lived well, had a white girl friend, was paid a lot of money, and was aggressive in his trading methods. His allegation of racism is the biggest load of crap. I am a minority and on my desk there were 6 other minorities (including several Indians) and we were all vice presidents or senior vice presidents. Our group was extremely profitable and we all made a lot of money but we nevered felt like 2nd class citizens and no one &quot;went after us&quot; because we were minorities or Indians.Additionally there was a mixed race couple working at Kidder (woman is white and man is black) who had a relationship and later got married but mothing ever happened to them and they made a lot of money. Joe of course doesn't want to reveal any of this because it would fly in the face of his allegations and then he would have to explain himself vis a vis the trades he made."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"I had forgotten about the Kidder Peabody debacle until I saw Jett recently on C-SPAN. He is quite a speaker. I found his comments on business, corporate politics, and the failings of the black church to be dead on. Jett realized that power and politics matter more than race and it is very refreshing that someone has the courage to admit it.I bought the book the following day and read it straight through. I manage a racially diverse professional workforce and have dealt with complaints of perceived discrimination for the last two years. After reading Jett's book I was able to have a heart to heart with a black direct report. He had not read the book so I lent him my copy. Somethings were simple: I no longer ask him or any minority to high-five me in greeting and he no longer says that being tardy is a black thing that I just don't understand. Otherthings will take longer. But the book was a real eyeopener for me and I believe 40% of my workforce has now read it.I have sent it to my son, a business major at Duke and told him to bring it to the attention of his professors and classmates."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"The book reads like a fictional tale full of intrigue and suspense. Jett tries very hard to convince the reader that KP knew of his trading practice. He takes pot shots at those investigating as not knowing nothing about trading or the stock market in general. The reality is that Jett had only been in the business, himself, a few years. He talks of a boss being overly concerned with his 'affairs', but never did he indicate to this boss that he felt harrassed (as many of us would). He cites where he did not know he had an outstanding bill from Harvard--(I don't know of anyone who would forget they owe a bill that is keeping them from receiving a hard earned MBA) In a nutshell, Jett seemed talented, but does not have a grip on reality. I think he feels he's so smart that his lies are enough to keep the average person off his tracks. His entire defense has been &quot;others knew&quot; It's almost as if he is really saying 'I did wrong but because management did not catch it, I should not be punished ' Although Jett never stipulated this, but I think Jett's biggest challenge was being an unattractive male. His so called 'discipline' mentallity was really a front to his cosmetic insecurities. The book was a good read but was more of a one-man editorial on the 'world according to Jett'. I would have preferred a more objective translation of the facts. His book typifies how Jett treats people in general--stupid humans who need help interpreting the world-- Most folks are not stupid, Jett, perhaps this ordeal will help reshape how you deal with people! Not that it's important, but I'm a black male."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"UGH !

Your base salary has a maximum value (for Managing Directors at the time it was probably 150K to 250K)His much-hyped 8 million dollar bonus...was COMPLETELY discretionary! They could have paid him ANYTHING and he had absolutely no recourse except to quit.So....why would Kidder pay him ALL that money ONLY to take it back? Because they were all racists?????? Why go through all that trouble!Joe Jett had access to the head of Fixed Income 24/7....he was always in his office, no one treated him disrespectfully (he had the audacity to claim the Admin staff dissed him?????)Folks...if the writing weren't so long-winded, pretentious and over-baked the book would make a great fiction thriller."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"The book, from a general perspective, is interesting reading, as I feel about most biographies. I'm glad I got a chance to really know Joseph Jett from Joseph Jett's perspective. I don't believe he was entirely innocent as he neatly proclaims. For Wall Street to put this all on him, is almost saying that blacks are a lot smarter than they ever gave them credit for being. I guess many compliments are based on convenience... Like most other readers, I think Jett is arrogant, self-serving, and even pitiful. He makes it clear that he has a problem with being black. Honestly, I think his problem initially stemmed from the rejection he received from the black girl as a young boy (the &quot;ditch digging&quot; story). He'd like to blame his insecurities and personal anti-affirmative action stance on his father. The truth is, his father married a black woman who went to an HBCU. Jett seriously misinterpreted his father's leadership. He consistently denied himself the wholesomeness that connecting with one's race can offer. As such, when he needed the connection, it wasn't there for him.

I recognized Joseph Jett from his appearance on Sixty Minutes, which I thought was a compelling profile segment, and so I decided to give the book a read. Interestingly, at the end of his Sixty Minutes interview, I found myself sorta rooting for this &quot;bad&quot; guy. However, after reading the book, I do not know what to make of this character named, Joseph Jett.The first part of the book is compelling; it traces his family's Black heritage, discusses his upbringing, shares the parental (namely his father's) philosophies that shaped Jett's mind-set, and describes the disturbing way Jett was treated by his classmates and peers growing up.What makes Joseph Jett a tragic figure is the skewed way he disassociated himself with anything that was related to people of color. A big mistake! Instead of making him appear weak or handicapped from a professional point of view, he would have been building a network of there-when-I-need-you folks, namely his own people: African-Americans--Black people. So, when Jett's world came tumbling down, he would have had some much needed support. Face it: Just look at some other &quot;notable&quot; Blacks who have at one time in their rise to fortune or fame (whatever your flavor) have distanced themselves from the circle and had to come running back.This book well documents Jeff's questionably behaviour and judgement, and further emphasizes what happens when you &quot;ruthlessly&quot; and &quot;recklessly&quot; pursue making money.--Kimberly Stansell, author Bootstrapper's Success Secrets: 151 Tactics for Building Your Business on a Shoestring Budget (Career Press)"},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"When first picking up the book, I did not know quite what to expect. I knew Joseph Jett was a black man accused of fraud on Wall Street and that of course he would protest his innocence.But Mr. Jett does more than that. He tells you his story from his very beginnings so that you can try to understand his mind-set and what motivates and drives him. As a black man you might automatically think that from beginning to end Mr. Jett would throw epithets at the white race and tell how blacks are constantly being mistreated by society as a whole.Although he does acknowledge the racism which is rampant in our society and on Wall Street specifically, he does not, however, discuss his mistreatment necessarily as a &quot;black&quot; man. He tells the story of a MAN who was wronged who happens to be black. He tells the story of a man caught up in the internal politics and power struggle at Kidder Peabody.It must be understood though that the way certain people treated him at Kidder was because of his race. Mr. Jett is a black man who is ascerbic, assertive, confident and at times arrogant. Qualities I might add which if found in a white man would be considered assetts and not liabilities, especially in the high pressure, high stress world of international finance and Wall Street.On a whole I would say that this is one of the best books i've read over the summer. If you enjoy this book,I also suggest reading Roberts v. Texaco."},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","review":"Joe Jett's mother was my 8th grade science teacher at Empire Jr. High in Cleveland, Ohio in 1963. She was strict, no-nonsense, a dedicated educator. His father sounds like many other African-American fathers of that era. That &quot;neighborhood&quot; and school where she taught produced a current member of Congress, Vice President at General Motors, Sr. V.P. of Commercial lending at a Cleveland bank, several doctors and lawyers and the current Mayor of Cleveland, all of whom happen to be African-American. These are people committed to their community and race. People that had the desire to achieve and maintain their integrity. Unfortunately Joe did not understand his father's counsel nor did he have his mother's commitment. He was selfish, self-centered, ashamed of his dark skin and full of self loathing. He had the ability and his intellect was never the issue in question. He just wanted to assimilate and he was not welcome. Joe did not break any legal statute. As he indicates, he was following &quot;SOP&quot;, fortunately the dance stopped and he had to pay! I say fortunately because maybe he will do something that will allow him to share his vast talents for the betterment of others and at least make his parents proud of his work! As Joe found out, money cannot buy a good name or admission into another race! NOTE: We also had a few neighborhood people that got killed, hooked on drugs and a few went to jail.

Particularly, he describes the situation of Catholics and their hope for equal footing with the ruling Protestants. The politics, religious issues, the society are well portrayed.

It's my favorite book to date and Checkmate really ended the trilogy on a good note. It was great, though i suggest to not read this one first and really start with the first one (Noughts and Crosses). I do think the whole trilogy really goes deep and the whole series makes an amazing gift for a teen (not for younger children). Also, Checkmate makes you read at the tip of your page and always looking for an answer (which you do find by the way, this is not a loose-end book). Again, I loved it...i loved the whole series!"},{"Title":"Checkmate","review":"This was a beautiful end to the timeless trilogy and has probably even beaten its predecessor, Noughts & Crosses. Even without the tragic hanging scene, it made me cry the most.Checkmate tells the story of Carrie Rose and her childhood in dramatic flashbacks, about how had to fight the prejucides of being a 'halfer'. In these memories, Jude is back and is being haunted by the loss of his dead brother, but he neglects the power of love and lures his niece into his deadly trap. Meanwhile, back in the present, Sephy and Carrie are having problems of their own and struggle to have a strong, familial relationship so she does everything she can not to lose her.Throughout the book, I still felt that something was 'missing' and the absence of Callum really depressed me! I read the novel (I should say 'epic tome' - it's that brilliant) from start to finish in one whole day, and well after midnight I was still thoroughly compelled.Of course, you've probably got the jist of this review and realise that I would seriously recommend this book to you. If you've read the last two books (Noughts & Crosses and Knife Edge) and loved them, you'll love this book. Just make sure you have a year's supply of Kleenex ready for a tearfully thought-provoking read!"},{"Title":"Checkmate","review":"My order came super quickly, was exactly what I needed and was in fabulous condition. Would definitely use this seller again! Two thumbs waaaay up :)"},{"Title":"Checkmate","review":"This is the third book in the brilliant Noughts & Crosses series. It follows Callie Rose, the daughter of Sephy and Callum, as she grows up and discovers her disturbing past. She meets her Uncle Jude, who is still consumed with rage and wants to use her for his own revenge. We meet Sephy again, but this time she's older and some what damaged by her past and finds it difficult to love again. We follow her through the different relationships with love interests and with Callie and find the answers to the cliffhanger of Knife Edge.The same format is used with characters alternating with each chapter and, as with the books preceding this one, the story sweeps you along and it's difficult not to get caught up in the lives of Sephy, Callie and the rest of the family. It reveals the difficultly growing up as a mixed race child and how prejudice from both sides leaves Callie with a feeling of not belonging anywhere. As Callie grows up and finds out that the ones closest to her have been lying she grows bitter and decides to follow Jude in his vendetta, even though her heart really isn't in it. This section of the story reaches a dramatic climax and the end for some of the characters.This is a cleverly crafted novel, and although it does not have the same impact as Noughts and Crosses, it's still a very tense and dramatic story that grips you and keeps you reading. The ending of the book is bittersweet.Verdict:Originally the final installment of a trilogy, Checkmate answers some of the questions that hovered after reading Knife Edge. The letter from Callum is explained in more detail and the relationships between the characters come to a satisfying conclusion. However, this novel didn't remain as the ending for this series and earlier this month a fourth book was released. I'm reluctant to read Double Cross as Checkmate was a perfect end to a thought-provoking and emotionally charged series which I thought was absolutely superb and cannot recommend enough. I'm not sure where Double Cross will take me, but I will find out as it's next on my list to read."},{"Title":"Checkmate","review":"Of all the books I have read Noughts and crosses was one of the most gripping aside from the fact that the third hasn't been released yet.

These stories are wonderful. My twin boys grand boys will love these stories. I plan to buy more from this author."},{"Title":"The Legend of Old Befana","review":"We've already read The Legend of Old Befana by Tomie DePaola several times in our home. In Italian folklore, La Befana is an old woman (in some regions, a friendly \\"witch\\") who visits children on the night before Epiphany, leaving candy and/or small gifts. Befana represents all people who are seeking Jesus.The stories about La Befana vary greatly from region to region, but Tomie DePaola's version comes closest to the one I learned as a child.La Befana is a poor, old woman who is a bit of a hermit and always, always sweeping her house. As the Three Kings make their way to Bethlehem, they pass through her village. She is invited to join them, to make the journey to see the Christ Child, but she refuses. She is too busy; she needs to sweep. She soon regrets her decision and changes her mind. She stays up all night baking. She gathers these homemade cookies and cakes as gifts, and brings along her broom so she can sweep for the new mother. However, she learns she is too late; the Kings' procession has already moved on. She tried her best to catch up, but never did. It is said that even today, she is still searching for the baby Jesus. Each Epiphany Eve she sets off on her journey, leaving gifts to all children along her way, in the hopes that one of them will be the Christ Child.My 3-year-old is enthralled with DePaola's book, as am I. The illustrations are soft on the eyes, but full of color and interest. The text is easy to understand without being dumbed down. The story is worded beautifully, making it just as wonderful a experience for the adult reading the story aloud as it is for the child listening. One can practically hear the procession of the Three Kings approaching her town, the bells tinkling through a light wind. Readers are quickly pulled in to Befana's world; her tendency to be a bit misanthropic and always too busy to put her household duties aside (can't many of us relate?); her realization that she'd made a poor decision; her regret; her determination and perseverance when she changes her mind; her kindness while preparing gifts for the baby; her thoughtfulness in remembering the needs of a new mother.This is a lovely story, albeit somewhat bittersweet, filled with hope and symbolism. There aren't many English-language books telling Befana's story, but thankfully, DePaola's The Legend of Old Befana is a treasure.For a special treat to go along with the story:[...]Try this recipe for traditional Epiphany cookies, befanini (La Befana's Stars).

Thanks for the opportunity for my review.Janice Payne"},{"Title":"The Legend of Old Befana","review":"My husband is Italian, so Befana (who brings gifts to Italian children on Epiphany) is as much a part of our Christmas traditions as Santa Claus. To be honest, I prefer the story of Befana and find it a lot closer to the spirit of Christmas.Befana is a somewhat grumpy and fussy old woman. One day Three Kings show up at her door, following a star, and looking for a miraculous baby. They urge Befana to come with them, but Befana is so busy with her household tasks she thinks she doesn't have time.Little by little though, the idea of a baby who &quot;comes for the poor&quot; (like her) and yet attracts kings as well begins to move her and she decides to follow. She gathers up some goodies she has just baked and a few toys to bring as gifts for the new baby. But she has waited too long, and although she keeps following the star, she never finds the infant.The lovely aspect of this story is that she begins leaving her gifts for other children, because she recognizes in them the spirit of that miraculous child that the Three Kings sought. I love the idea that children receive presents at Christmas because Jesus' spirit is in them.This is an essential book for Italian-American families. I think it would also be a good book for teachers or parents of somewhat older children (past Santa Claus believing age) who are interested in Christmas traditions of different cultures. In Russia, the story of Babushka is very similar to the story of Befana (and there are several good picture books about her). And in Mexico, the Three Kings themselves bring presents (and Tomie dePaola has done a wonderful book about the story of the Three Kings that makes a perfect companion to this one).Overall, a terrific Christmas book."},{"Title":"The Legend of Old Befana","review":"Tomie DePaola evoked memories of my childhood Christmas' in both visual and verbal splendor. I was taken back to my childhood and the story told to my sisters and myself about the Befana. Not only is this book written at a level that all children can understand and appreciate but it also keeps an adults interest. It beautifully illustrates another legend which inspires the wonderful message of the giving time we call Christmas. This has been accomplished noteably by Mr. DePaola's illustrations that although simple are rich in colour and meaning. As a person of Italian heritage I was elated to see such a wonderful legend captured in print in such a obviously well researched manner. The subtle yet awe inspiring symbolism contained in the book make it a pleasure for adults yet the simpleness and vibrant colours make it equally riveting for children. I would label this book a &quot;must have&quot; for all parents but especially those of Italian descent wanting to share some Italian culture with their children."},{"Title":"The Legend of Old Befana","review":"I wish there were more books about La Befana in the US; thankfully, even if this is the only one you have ~ it is a WONDERFUL book telling the Italian legend of Befana. In many ways, the story of Befana reminds me of the biblical story of Mary and Martha (Lazarus' sisters). While a guest in thier home, Mary chose to spend time with Jesus while Martha is too busy with her household chores. In The Legend Of Old Befana we meet an old woman who is constantly sweeping. When the procession of kings pass through her town and tell her of the birth of the Child King she decides to follow. She bakes all day in order to have a gift to bring for the Child. She also plans to sweep knowing that the Child's mother will be tired.However, rather than set off to find the baby Jesus, she tarries in order to sweep. Her decision to delay in favor of sweeping costs her a glimpse of the Child King. To this day, she searches for the Child, visiting children while they sleep, leaving them gifts from her basket.I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to share this celebrated Italian legend! Another EXCELLENT resource is Ken Lonnquist's CD titled Old Befana:Old Befana. You can also download the entire album in MP3 format which is cheaper and faster. It has the story of La Befana and songs."},{"Title":"The Legend of Old Befana","review":"I used this book while studying Christmas Around the World, more specifically, Italy.

This one tells the story with charm and the illustrations are wonderful."},{"Title":"The Legend of Old Befana","review":"Written 30 years ago, this Christmas legend presents the story of an old grandma who meticulously takes care of her home and surroundings, as if that was all life had to offer her. Living in a small village in Italy, she kept to herself and seemed unfriendly. The children called her cranky; they remarked that she was always sweeping, starting with her house, her front step, the walkway to the street, and down to the road. Those who passed her house would notice sounds of a woman singing lullabies, and they would sense a delicious smell of freshly baked things, like bread and cookies, and cakes. Every day, the routine was the same, ending up with locking the door and shuttering the windows, climbing into bed, blowing out the lamp and falling asleep.One night, she awakened to a bright light, right in the middle of the night. When she went to look out the window, she saw a brilliant star growing before her eyes. She mumbled, \\"How will I ever get my sleep when the dark has turned into day?\\" Without sleep, she remained in bed; the next morning, she was up, sweeping, just as she always had done. Now, as she swept the path down to the road, she heard bells ringing, birds singing, and she saw a glorious procession of animals and people walking down the road. Three men wearing crowns were dressed in beautiful robes, and when they approached her asking for the way to Bethlehem, she said she never heard of it. They told her they were searching for the Child. She told them that there were many children [in town], and she continued sweeping.They told her this Child is a King, and would be guided by a bright star. All she could say was that that star kept her up all night, and that she had to get back to her work. When they invited her to come with them, she kept on sweeping for a while, and then went back into the house and began baking, and thinking about what had happened. Later that night, she filled the basket with cakes and cookies and candles she had made, adding a few hot coals to keep the cookies warm. As she began to leave, she decided to take along her broom so she could sweep the room clean for the Baby's mother. She got side-tracked with that old broom, and put aside her basket, and began her usual routine of sweeping her house, and the path to the road.By the time she was finished, the procession that was to take her with was gone, and the sky was filled with light; the angels were singing, that \\"The new King is born. Tonight is the Night of Miracles.\\" All of a sudden, as she started running, asking the angels for help in finding the New Born King, she was lifted into the sky, carrying her basket and her broom. Now, she was running in the sky, on this night of Miracles. Well, she never did catch up with the kings and the procession, and she never found the Child in Bethlehem. It is said, that every January 6th, she runs across the sky, visiting all the children while they sleep, leaving them gifts from her basket, and, yes, sweeping their rooms, clean. She says that she never knows which child might be the Baby King of Bethlehem.As you read this legend, what do you learn from Befana's obsession with her work; she didn't see or notice what was right there before her very eyes. Yet, even though she missed seeing the Baby, she spent the rest of her life looking for Him. Be aware of surprises from God, wherever and whenever He gives them to you. Maybe someone will walk into your life as a gift from God. Be watchful; expect surprises. Don't wait to put down your broom or whatever else is keeping you busy."},{"Title":"Low Fog in Eden","review":"&quot;Low Fog In Eden&quot;is packed with raw emotional power....emotionally grippimg novel about paradise lost and paradise ever so painfully found....the saddest love story in a long while.."},{"Title":"Low Fog in Eden","review":"&quot;Low Fog In Eden&quot;does for Bodega Bay, California what John Steinbeck's writing did for Monterey.A stunning love story powerfully written."},{"Title":"Low Fog in Eden","review":"&quot;A bit Hemingwayesque and Michner but all Guthertzand a damn fine book&quot; THIS WAS WRITTEN BY P J CORKERY IN THE SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER.&quot;LOW FOG IN EDEN&quot; HAS ALSO BEEN GIVEN FIVE STARS BY SEVERAL BOOK CLUBS&gt;"},{"Title":"Low Fog in Eden","review":"A powerfully moving love story.

The story was told by Philip, whose older cousin, named Ambrose, married an attractive long-lost cousin, Rachel. Brought up only by male adults, Philip didn't have a clue about society with women, except for a female best friend whom he considered as a sister. When the blow of Ambrose death came, all Philip ever wanted was to get revenge on 'my cousin Rachel'. But instead of doing that, upon their first meeting, he became tranced and passionately in love with her, reliving the tragedy.This novel is a mix between mistery novel, dark gothic and gender war, which were woven with clear description and provoking dialogs. It opened with a first question: What made a man kill his wife?. All questions after that will lead to that first, with a clue you can find in the last sentence of the first chapter. Full with paradox and irony but not too fullblown. Each character was well drawn: background, personality, way of life (vivid description of Cornwell), and mystery. No villain was proven. It left the answer to each reader."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"First and foremost, the haunting mystery and suspense of this novel grabs readers from the start. \\"My Cousin Rachel\\" is a well plotted story with its main theme focused on a beautiful worldly woman and a conservative young man, your narrator, inexperienced in the many ways of women. It is a love story, but with the love comes the dissection of thoughts that give the story it's alternating moods of hot and cold. As a reader you find yourself wondering about and attempting to forecast the outcome, only to have your theory sprout limbs and offer multiple possibilities. You'll enjoy watching the novel grow.I believe what is so amazing about this novel is how it triggers reader's thoughts of trust in relationships, both past and present. The power of a woman's charm over an unsuspecting man, as well as a man's need to claim ownership over a woman he desires is laid out to perfection. As with all new relationships, communication, or lack thereof, drives Rachel and Philip's relationship forward, backward and sideways. Being inside the head of each as they try figuring out and understanding the other is a treat.I took away one star, maybe unjustly, simply because as a man I still cannot fully say I understood Cousin Rachel's Venetian ways. If narration had alternated more into her thoughts and words, my Martian intellect might better understand her actions. But then it wouldn't be such a wonderful mystery would it Venus? Classic Literature!Quote from My Cousin Rachel:I thought about it for a moment. Then I let it all come with a rush of words. Why hold back anything to rot?"},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"My Cousin Rachel has some admirable qualities. It is very well performed by Jonathan Pryce and I'm not sure it would have held my attention the way Rebecca did in print. Like all of Miss du Maurier's books, it has a very ambiguous ending and I had to listen to it 4 times to understand it. But that's OK.If you are looking for some light, gothic entertainment, this is a good book for that. But if you are looking for something deep, I would suggest not choosing this book. I also do not think it would make a good discussion book for a book club (something I know a lot about having been in at least one over the last 12 years).I would seek out this reader again, and I am sure that I have not read my final du Maurier. I do love books that take place in Cornwall where the weather is as much of a character as anything or anyone else.Which should I read next? Frenchman's Creek or Jamaica Inn?"},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"A hotel built in 1926 in rainy Seattle - where the TV had nothing to offer and I had left my computer at home--was a fitting place to read this book. It pleasantly occupied me for a couple of days, and then I finished it and had to find something else to read, which turned out to be \\"No Country for Old Men\\" by Cormac McCarthy. What a transition -- pre-Victorian era romance followed by nonstop, almost senseless killing.Not that both authors aren't very good writers, because they are. But they say that one key to good story telling is to create characters that the reader cares about, and in \\"No Country\\" the central positive character is killed off, while the totally unsympathetic, inscrutable killer is allowed to live. That's the kind of paperback that, except for the last page, you want to throw away as soon as you're finished. However, I'll hold onto my 1952 edition of \\"Rachel\\" (for which I paid 23 cents in 1991 and just read 20 years later), even though I'll never read it again, unlike \\"The House on the Strand\\" which I've read multiple times.Daphne Du Maurier liked to tell stories from a man's point of view, and her women characters were often not very sympathetic. Rachel is such a person, and yet you want her and the 24-year-old Philip to become lovers and marry and be happy, but that's not how it works out, or we wouldn't have much of a story.One of the entertaining things about \\"My Cousin Rachel\\" is that it's centered around a young man who, as a member of the property-owning upper class, lives a life radically different from our own. There is little pressure on him to do anything, and so he spends his days gardening, riding horseback about his lands, visiting with the poorer farmers who rent from him, etc. At home in his huge house, everything is done for him, including bringing hot water for his bath and lighting the fire. Such people live in an archaic but sort of charming world. In the late afternoon they retire to their rooms to rest and then dress every evening for dinner, which includes the attentive company of servants, if no one else, but usually also involves friends or acquaintances with whom they drink, tell stories, etc. It's a rough life. Of course, you wouldn't want to get sick in such a day and age, which Philip does, but fortunately he survives to live out his life as a gentleman of leisure, which as he sees it involves \\"farming the land well, looking after the people\\" and remaining \\"honored and respected\\", although (curiously) not necessarily happy."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"Daphne du Maurier is growing on me. While quite not as good as Rebecca, My Cousin Rachel is as suspenseful and well plotted.The book is written from the 1st person POV of Philip Ashley. Philip is a 25-year old heir to his beloved older cousin Ambrose, who for years have been substituting Philip's dead parents. Unexpectedly, on one of his doctor-advised trips to Italy, 43-year old Ambrose marries his (and Philip's) distant cousin Rachel. Soon after the wedding Philip starts receiving alarming letters from his cousin - Ambrose accuses his wife of slowly killing him. Philip doesn't know what to make of these letters - are these allegations true or they are delusions produced by Ambrose's tumor-affected brain? The young man rushes to Italy to check for himself, only to find his cousin dead and buried and Rachel gone. Soon after Philip's return to England, Rachel shows up for a visit and she is not quite what the young heir expected her to be. Is she a cold-blooded murderer or simply a victim of a series of very unfortunate events?My Cousin Rachel is a very well written, tightly plotted mystery. Du Maurier skillfully builds suspense throughout the novel, throwing in a good amount of love, obsession, jealousy, passion, and deceit. While I am not sure Philip's male voice is completely believable (at times he sounds a tad feminine), his changing affections towards Rachel are. Rachel's subtle play at getting young and naive Philip to become enchanted with her without him even realizing it is masterfully done. Oh, this woman knows how to flirt and entice! An ambiguous ending is a plus too.I am definitely up for some more du Maurier."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"I loved 'Rebecca' but often do I feel bad for Daphne DuMaurier, for it seems that 'Rebecca' is credited as her only worth while effort at writing, but latley here I have found as I read more of her novels and short stories, that Ms. DuMaurier has emerged as my own very favorite writer. Her tales, although vastly different from one another, I find are not usually what I relate to at all, but her characters and their behaviors and attitudes. And, after reading a substantial amount of DuMauriers work, I think I would say 'My Cousin Rachel' takes the cake for her best.'Rebecca' may be well known for it's ever famous opening line, 'Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again...' but 'My Cousin Rachel' seems to adapt not only a similair opening feel, but a better one. From the first page DuMaurier is refrencing death and the way it is written is beautiful. Her main character is highly likeable and there are many twists and turns throughout the book. I found that I could not put it down. I also found DuMaurier is quite excellent as usual in writing about the human relationship between men and women. Rachel is a complex character who always remains mysterious but I too could not help falling in love with her. There are so many beautiful one liners and moments that remind me so much of 'Rebecca' only as I mentioned, 'My Cousin Rachel' is better. I also found it very powerful, especially the ending.All in all, a brilliant and haunting work. Hands down the best work from my favorite author."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"This is the second novel I've read by Daphne Du Maurier. I read 'Rebecca' earlier this year and I thoroughly enjoyed both books. There is a quality about these two stories that is hard to describe. DuMaurier is able to create a nearly timeless feel to her stories and both gave me the feeling of distant familiarity. I wondered if I had seen the movies so long ago that I couldn't remember anything at all specific, but yet had a vague sense of what would happen.The story is about Philip and Ambrose Ashley, confirmed and dedicated to bachelorhood. They are cousins, Ambrose is Philip's guardian and the only parent Philip can remember. They share a tender admiration and devotion to one another that is rare among men.Due to his health, Ambrose is required to winter abroad in a warmer climate. Philip is rather surprised when he learns that Ambrose has married a distant cousin of theirs who lives in Florence. He grows concerned when he receives a letter from Ambrose begging Philip to come to Italy because he fears his new bride maybe his undoing.Philip rushes to Florence but sadly is too late, his cousin Ambrose is dead and his new bride is gone. Philip is convinced that she is the person responsible for Ambrose's death. When he meets Ambrose's wife weeks later he slowly sets aside his convictions and gradually falls deeply in love with her. As his passion grows stronger he makes impulsive decisions that will change the course of events and the way he feels about his cousin Rachel.There is a balance and symmetry within this story that makes it that much more interesting. We learn how Ambrose was affected by his first and only love relationship, how his personality changed because of his feeling for his wife and then we see the same emotions and changes in Philip.While the reader learns nearly all of the story from the book jacketit is still none the less a taut and engaging story that has you wondering and changing your opinion several times before the book is done.Daphne Du Maurier has the ability to make words flow over you like water in a stream, she is so smooth, her work is pure pleasure to read with never a word out of place. Here's an example; 'The moon, so nearly full, hovered with swollen cheek above the bay and wore about his face the look of a wizard man who shared my secret.'I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"Orphaned at 18 months, Philip Ashley is taken in and raised by his cousin, the consummate bachelor, Ambrose. Their relationship is a close one as they share not only looks, but emotions and mannerisms as well.Ambrose travels to Italy one summer, leaving Philip to watch over the house. Letter writing is how they keep in touch and it's the information written within these letters that carries the story. Ambrose writes to tell Philip that he has met his cousin Rachel, soon followed by another letter stating that they are now married and not long after that the letters become mysterious and full of paranoia - Ambrose has been suffering an unknown illness and seems to think his new wife is trying to poison him. Philip decides to go to Ambrose in Italy and find out for himself what is really going on. But when he gets there he finds that Ambrose has been dead for two weeks and cousin Rachel had already fled the villa. Convinced that Rachel killed Ambrose and makes a promise to himself to make her pay.Back in England, Rachel shows up at Philip's manor unexpectedly. His mind is already made up to hate her, however when they meet his image of her is thrown right out the door. She's charming and dainty and sweet - she bewitches Philip from the start. She can't possibly have had anything to do with Ambrose's death. Or can she?My Cousin Rachel explores the complicated mind of a woman and the men who try to decipher it. Du Maurier's writing flows very well and the pace is fluid throughout. The gothic atmosphere combined with the mystery of who Rachel really is, kept this reader enthralled and turning the pages quickly.Thanks to Sourcebooks for giving me the opportunity to read such a wonderful novel!"},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"This tragic historical romance is set in England during, I think, the mid-1800s. The excellent world-building and use of symbolism created a brooding, mysterious atmosphere. The characters were realistic and sympathetic. The pacing was a bit slow compared to modern novels, but I didn't find the novel dull.The author very effectively uses characters' body language to convey the truth of what's happening even when the viewpoint character, Phillip, incorrectly understands what's going on. I continued reading the story because I wanted to see what happened to cunning Rachel and naive Phillip through all the misunderstandings and manipulations.The only \\"problem\\" I had was that the first chapter doesn't make much sense until you've read the entire book. It's more of an epilogue than a first chapter.There was a minor amount of swearing and cursing. There was some very non-explicit sex (in fact, it's only hinted at).

A cryptic note arrives from Ambrose hinting at being poisoned and Phillip heads to Florence to find Ambrose dead of a brain tumor (so the doctors say.....) and Rachel disappeared, with Rainaldi her close friend and \\"financial advisor\\" handling her affairs.Phillip heads home and as rightful heir takes over running the family estate, but constantly broods on his hatred of Rachel and builds an image of her that is completely different when he comes face to face with her.

I find Du Maurier wonderful, if inconsistent, alternately delivering atmosphere, thrills, and unusually gripping late-night storytelling. This novel promises all of the above, but ultimately delivers an unsatisfying ending that leaves the reader feeling the story was somehow derailed at its high point. If the benefit of a melodramatic period piece is an un-put-downable book, My Cousin Rachel doesn't make the grade.

The story is not about pirates, smugglers or wildly romantic adventures. It is a real life love drama, in which an inexperienced young man falls in love with a woman of the world. A possible crime plays an important role, but the real story is about the feelings of Rachel and Philip for each other. For me, the most dramatic person is Rachel, whose character and way of life don't fit into the dreams of Ambrose and Philip. Not until the last page it becomes clear what kind of a woman Rachel really is, at least for me. (For some readers the questions remain.) At the end there are no winners, no bad guys, only victims. Even after I finished reading the book it kept me under its spell for days. I think this is because Rachel and Philip are so like real people, because Rachel remains a fascinating woman who I would like to have met in real life. For me it belongs to the top of my favorite novels. If I could take five books with me to a deserted island where I had to spend the rest of my life, this one would be one of them."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"This emotional noval should most definitely be put in the catagory of one the greatest novels of all time.

The time in which My Cousin Rachel is set is not specified; but based on historical detaisl mentioned in the book, I think I can safely say that it takes place in the 1840s.The story is centered around three characters: Phillip, the 24-year-old narrator; his cousin Ambrose, who is twenty years older than Phillip; and his wife, Rachel. When Ambrose goes to Italy, he meets his cousin Rachel, who had previously been married to an Italian comte. Bewitched, Ambrose marries her. But a year after his marriage, he begins sending Phillip odd letters. When Phillip arrives in Florence to see his cousin, he finds out that he has died of brain fever- and his wife, Rachel, has fled.Phillip immediately resolves not to like Rachel. But when she arrives at their estate in Cornwall, he immediately becomes smitten with her. What is it about Rachel Ashley that makes her so alluring? This is one of the true mysteries of this haunting book. Even though people keep telling him that there is something wrong, Phillip chooses not to believe them--until it is almost too late. Is she a shameless gold digger? Or just a sad and destitute widow?The story of Rachel and Phillip is a frightening one, and it kept me on the edge of my seat. The primary female character in this book is very much like Rebecca, in DuMaurier's most famous book; you don't exactly know what her motives are. This kept me turning pages until the very end."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"This book is great. I just happened upon the film version of this book a couple months ago and liked it enough to give the book a try. It was my first Du Maurier and I loved it. Since then I have read Rebecca, Jamaica Inn, and Frenchman's Creek.My Cousin Rachel is definitely the best of the bunch, with Rebecca at second. THe other two are very enjoyable but a little far-fetched.Before I read this book I had no idea what Du Maurier was like, I just assumed she was some trashy twentieth century writer like Agatha Christie (sorry AC fans). I would put \\"Rachel\\" on par with Thomas Hardy's work- its that good. It could be called a gothic novel, though it is more modern in approach. Overall somewhat similar to Jane Eyre or Tess of the D'Urbervilles.This book is a bit slower than her other works, but much more believable, in depth, and serious. It is a frustrating mystery at the end, was Rachel good or bad? I like to tell myself that Du Maurier herself never decided, never \\"knew\\", and that is why it is so ambiguous."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"Philip Ashley lost his parents from an early age, but his cousin Ambrose was always there for him. Ambrose, not much older than Philip, took care of his young cousin, and growing up hadn't been so difficult. They look alike, share the same views towards women and society in general. Actually, they are both recluses, preferring spending their idle times at their estate. But then Ambrose travels to Italy, where he meets and marries a woman named Rachel in Florence. After a series of bizarre letters from Ambrose, Philip decides to travel to Florence, where he discovers that his cousin is dead. Infuriated, Philip vows to hunt Rachel down and make her pay. To his luck, she arrives in England. Rachel is a mysterious creature. At first, Philip is somewhat bewildered. Who is this woman? Is the demure, small creature the monster he had pictured? Then the unthinkable happens -- he falls in love with Rachel. But the question remains, who is Rachel? What happened to Ambrose, and was she responsible? Philip is similar to Ambrose in more ways than one, and he will soon find out just what transpired in Italy...My Cousin Rachel is filled with gothic suspense that, like Rebecca and Jamaica Inn, makes you want to turn the pages. Daphne Du Maurier had a gifted way of adding mystique and intrigue in the characters more than with the story or gothic elements themselves. She really had a way of making the characters -- especially the creepy ones -- come alive with her unique language. This is the first novel of hers that I read that is told from a male character's point of view, and I was enthralled with the story. Like Rebecca, I was able to picture everything in my head as though it were a horror film, more entertaining and far more intelligent than a film, in fact. A book critic describes My Cousin Rachel as \\"bewitching and beguiling,\\" and that, in a nutshell, describes the title character to a tee. I couldn't make her out. Is she manipulative and cunning, or caring and self-sacrificing? Du Maurier creates quite an intriguing tale of obsession that I couldn't put down. You won't want to put it down either."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"The word Interesting covers a lot of ground. It can mean Unique or Fascinating, and it is a polite way to say you think something is ugly or stupid.I'm not sure completely which definition of Interesting I would use in relation to this book, because it was really weird, and yet it was a good story as well. I think it's one I would need to read several times to really figure out.For someone who is new to Daphne du Maurier, I recommend Rebecca, The House on the Strand, and The King's General. Save this one for when you know you like her strangeness enough to appreciate it regardless of how it is presented."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"Like everyone else in the world and her brother, I was instantly captivated by Daphne Du Maurier's 'My Cousin Rachel' (published in July of 1951) from the first time I read it as a teenager. Since then I have read and re-read this marvelous book several more times, and I think I have finally managed to put my finger on the hook which was from the very start it securely implanted in my cheek.From the opening chapters an image of Rachel emerged in my imagination as a Franco Zeferrelli heroine - a delicate combined portrait of Madame Bovary and Jane Eyre in looks, but painted in the fine Italian chiaroscuro worthy of Da Vinci.In my imagination a streak of light catches Rachel's very soign&egrave;e, very tightly combed and knotted dark hair, and shows off to its best advantage her beautifully shaped head. I see the simple and exceedingly elegant cut of her black dress, and her dark, suggestive beauty offset by her pale and sensitive hands, and the creamy flesh of her slender neck emerging above the tall stiff collar. I see the dark and fading browns and greens of a renaissance landscape with plane trees and cypresses in the background... I see some of Robert Browning's 'My Last Duchess' in her as well... I hear a Donizetti aria or two - 'Regnava Nel Silenzio' and 'Una Furtiva Lagrima', because of course such passion as she may inspire inevitably compels the headlong rushing in of fools, as well as its predictable aftermath.But above and beyond all of that, the most insistent, most confusing, and most disorienting sound I hear is Phillip's voice:It is a voice that comes out of his mouth without ever being his. I now know that this is because it is in fact a woman's voice. - or more accurately, the voice of a castrato taken over by a women, - perhaps like that of Pauline Viardot's Orpheus singing 'J'ai Perdu Mon Eurydice' in a mist of grief and passion.As a writer, Daphne du Maurier is a superb ventriloquist, and her throwing of Phillip's voice quite tricked my cognitive ear, though my intuitive ear was not so easily persuaded. It took me all these many disquieting years to discover that no man could ever speak of a woman in the way Phillip speaks of Rachel, but only a woman who finds her own sex a source of confounding fascination, which is to say, a lesbian.When I construe Phillip as a young dyke, 'his' voice, a breaking mezzo/contralto, fits exactly.The richness of this book is that it is teeming with the unseen ghosts of literary and cultural symbols - the ghosts of the Bronts (during whose lifetimes the novel is set), the noble and tormented ghost of Radclyffe Hall's Stephen, the ghost of Lucrezia Borgia with the whiff of poison clinging to her reputed ring, and perhaps even the tantalising ghost of the Mona Lisa's enigmatic smile - the smile which intimates there is something behind it that we could never see. The atmosphere is filled with the anxious echoes of a past that is persistently insinuating itself into the present.The chord Du Maurier strikes is rich in resonance and harmonics. It goes on echoing and reverberating, because throughout its long vibration, which in this novel is the tension of a prolonged falling in love, the sound of voice and the image of the speaker appear not to be the same.Phillip,the first person protagonist, seems completely unable to hear his own voice. Nor does he seem able to grasp the implications of his emotions or his actions. He consistently and unswervingly evinces the bafflement of a young girl who falls in love with another young girl, or a woman, without ever having the slightest inkling that despite everything they are led to believe about what they should expect to encounter within the strictly heterosexual constraints of conventional romances of the common and garden sort, girls do in fact fall hopelessly and irrevocably in love with women.Rachel captivates Phillip from the start, and the secret of her power over him rests in no small part on his utter lack of preparedness for such an encounter. Long before he meets her he has created an unattractive image of her which he is determined to dislike. He is certain that he will be impervious to her. He has no idea that she is the kind of woman who captivates without effort, and with an inescapable finality. Nor does he know he is exactly the kind of person who always falls fatally in love.When Rachel creates an exotic garden paradise in which she and Eve and the Serpent are one, and we readers are uneasily aware that Phillip, a young girl in boy's clothing, could never be her match. Ambrose, Phillip's older cousin who was Rachel's husband, like the ghost in Hamlet's , did not survive his marriage, and has died under mysterious circumstances.Even though deceased Ambrose and androgynous Phillip are central characters, besides a butler, a guardian, a dog, and a dead man, there is not one convincing living and breathing male in this story. Even Rainaldi, Rachel's sinister Italian friend and lawyer, with his slight build and waspish manner seems more like a peevish spinster than a real man.Rachel is the dark lady of Phillip's sonnets, but she is also the Muse - the Goddess - and as such we know that with her mysterious beauty, her 'otherness', elusiveness and unattainability she can never be cast as a wife. Doom hangs over us all from the start.I know that reading this book as a young girl, I sensed all of this without ever being able to know or grasp any of it. Like Phillip, without noticing what was happening to me, I too had fallen in love with Rachel right away. Even the very seeds she saved - or hid in her darkly ambiguously sinister manner- had a name suggestive of delicate blossoms and warm lips - Laburnum....Daphne admitted that her inspiration for Rachel was Ellen Doubleday the wife of her American publisher. We shall never know whether or not this particular passion was fulfilled, as was her affair with the famous actress Gertrude Lawrence.I am now unable to escape the realisation that the ghost in this book was Du Maurier herself , with her impeccable persona of a very proper and very married English lady who nonetheless possessed the incongruous, undeniable, spot -on, pitch-perfect modulation of a lesbian sensibility."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"Daphne du Maurier is known for her ability to blend all of the elements of a good gothic story together to create something new and her own. She accomplishes this immensely in Rebecca, which is probably her most popular work. In My Cousin Rachel, she returns to this style of writing a blend of romance, gothic horror and good mystery. The book centers around young Philip Ashley, who loses his parents young. He is raised by his cousin Ambrose whom he idolizes, when Ambrose goes to Italy in hopes that he will find better weather to cure his aches and pains he meets a distant cousin of the Ashley family, Rachel. They fall in love and get married rather hurriedly to the astonishment of Philip. When Philip receives a haunting letter from Ambrose he heads immediately for Italy only to discover his cousin died suddenly. Philip's jealously of his cousin Rachel turns to rage, suspicion and when he finally meets her to love. Eventually his suspicions of Rachel turn again for Philip to fear. I especially enjoyed how Daphne du Maurier choses to tell this story from Philip's perspective, I thought it was an interesting way to make a common gothic story different and exciting. If you are looking for a mix of romance, mystery and horror this book is well worth the read."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"My Cousin Rachel is my third book by Daphne du Maurier, and re-confirms to me once again why she is regarded as one of the great writers of the 20th century. Du Maurier's style is full of imagery, even symbolism, and yet nothing is superfluous; each scene, each passage makes a clear and definite contribution to the whole. My Cousin Rachel, even more than her previous two works, reads like a longer version of a short story in its sparseness and foreshadowing.Daphne du Maurier subtly adjusts her style to fit the time period in which her books are set, and this was most evident to me in My Cousin Rachel. Set in 19th century Cornwall (with a brief passage in Italy), the dialogue, especially, felt more restrained and formal than in her other works, which contributes to the Victorian setting and feel of the novel.I won't recap the plot, as countless other reviewers have already done that and this is not a book report, after all. I will only comment on the book's famously ambiguous ending which leaves many readers wondering \\"did she, or didn't she?\\" For me, there really wasn't much if any ambiguity at all. Although she didn't absolutely state what Rachel had or hadn't done, du Maurier left plenty of clues along the way to make it pretty clear. Although she did throw in a few contradictory tidbits they never raise any serious doubt, at least not to my mind, but they do make the book significantly more interesting.Although My Cousin Rachel is as skillfully written as Rebecca (which is one of my all-time favorites) I think there are a couple of important reasons why it has never achieved quite the level of popularity that Rebecca has. One, is that My Cousin Rachel lacks the twists and plot surprises of Rebecca. When reading Rebecca for the first time you really have no idea where the story is going to take you; with My Cousin Rachel it is much more straightforward and predictable. Du Maurier even weaves in subtle clues along the way that are almost like signposts of the road ahead (for example, the recurrence of laburnum trees).But perhaps the more significant reason why My Cousin Rachel is less popular than Rebecca is its less-likable narrator. In Rebecca the narrator (the young and never-named second Mrs. De Winter) is an innocent bystander for the most part, who engages our sympathy from the first page and holds it all the way until the end; in fact, by the end we admire her even more than we did in the beginning. With My Cousin Rachel it is just the opposite. In the beginning the narrator Phillip Ashley engages our sympathy with his naivete, his innocence, his inexperience, and his unswerving love and loyalty for the cousin who raised him, Ambrose. However, this changes abruptly upon his first sight of Rachel; not only does he fall in love with her, but he begins to act like a complete fool, disregarding the good advice of everyone who loves and cares about him, and even discounting the letters and notes left behind by Ambrose. At the end Phillip does come to his senses but never reclaims our sympathy; rather, the reader almost recoils from what he becomes, as symbolized by Louise who asks him near the end, \\"What have you done?!\\"My Cousin Rachel showcases du Maurier's amazing skill at showing the reader the whole picture by using the most subtle of language (for example, Phillip's abrupt switch mid-way in the book from referring to her constantly as \\"my cousin Rachel\\" to simply \\"Rachel\\"). That she is able to reveal Phillip's foolishness and pig-headedness, and even allows us to see him through other people's eyes, in spite of the fact that he himself is telling the story, is evidence of her superb talent as a writer.My Cousin Rachel will definitely be a future re-read and is a solid five stars; how could anything by du Maurier be any less?"},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"I read this book as a sort of appetizer before reading Rebecca for an online bookclub. While it isn't quite up that standard, it does not disappoint.The story is told by Philip Ashley, the orphaned cousin of wealthy British landowner Ambrose Ashley, who for health reasons goes to Italy during the long winter months and there meets and marries his cousin, Rachel Sangaletti. She, a widow whose husband died in a duel and left great debts, shares Ambrose's love of plants and gardening. Ambrose never returns to England after their marriage, telling Philip that his health is not good and won't permit him to travel home. The last two letters he receives convince Philip that his cousin is in grave danger, and he travels to Florence to try to help him. When he arrives, there is no sign of Rachel, only a servant at the villa who tells Philip that Ambrose has died. The entire Ashley estate is left to Philip, since Ambrose did not rewrite his will to include his new wife. The circumstances of his death are somewhat questionable, and Philip is determined that Rachel will have no part of the Ashley wealth...until he meets her.If you are a fan of the Bront sisters, I believe that you will enjoy this one, as it has a sort of Jane Eyre-ish feel to it...not in the story but in the mood. Ms. du Maurier's skill as a writer is excellent, even in telling the story in a man's voice. Maybe it was because I had read Rebecca that I was better able to anticipate where the story was going, but this one did not seem to me as quite as mysterious as the more famous novel. I read one review that said this one was more suited to be a novella, and I would tend to agree with that. It could have been shorter and not lost much at all. If anyone were thinking about reading these two stories, I would suggest reading My Cousin Rachel first. It is not quite as good as Rebecca but most definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"A real page turner. I had read the book long time ago and had completely forgotten. I am glad I read it again. Actually I listened to the audio version. I enjoyed every minute of it. I drove aimlessly to finish the last 100 pages.It is a confession of sorts by Philip, the protagonist, who falls in love with his cousin Rachel, who was married to his mentor, benefactor and father figure, Ambrose. After Ambrose marries Rachel, a widow, who grew up in Italy, he is sadly disillusioned by her behavior and imagines she was after his money and was poisoning him. Rachel had a close friend Renaldi, who Ambrose suspects was in cohorts with Rachel, in destroying him. He writes to Philip to visit him in Florence and save him. But Philip is too late. By the time he arrives in Florence, Ambrose is dead and his cousin Rachel had left town. Philip vows revenge and goes back to England.In one of the most dramatic turn of events, Rachel woos him with her charm, grace, patronizing, and by just being herself. Philip falls in love with her and bequeaths the entire estate and jewelry, which was his to keep, according to Ambrose will, when he reached 25. On his 25th birthday, delirious, he proposes to Rachel. who was 10 years his senior. Rachel just laughs thinking it is all in good humor.When confronted by his persistent proposals, Rachel rebuffs Philip and to compound insult to injury, Renaldi shows up at the estate. Philip is outraged and imagines Rachel is up to her old tricks and he was going to be the next victim like Ambrose.What will Philip do? Is Rachel a cold blooded calculating murderer?This book reminded me of \\"Of Human Bondage\\", another classic by Somerset Maugham. But this Philip is not feckless.A must read."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"It is my favorite author, thank you for that wonderful book. I love the stories Daphne Du Maurier had written. It's very emotional and inspirational reading. I love to read it and re-read it more times."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"I could not put this book down. From the beginning to the end you can not guess the outcome. Do not skip a page which I am sure you will not. Very good."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"Why, why, why did I wait so long to read this book??? My Cousin Rachel blew me out of the water in its' greatness and left me wondering why I hadn't read it sooner! It is the story of Phillip Ashley and how his entire world changes when Rachel comes into his life. Rachel is the widow of his beloved Uncle Ambrose who is recently deceased. Everything Phillip has ever known changes when his cousin Rachel arrives.....and his life will never be the same.This is basically going to be a gush fest so be prepared. I adored this book. Just adored it! The atmosphere and underlying tension in this book was just amazing. It had me well and truly hooked as I was reading. My Cousin Rachel has this creepy feeling to it where you know something bad is going to happen and all you can do is wait for it. This feeling made the atmosphere of the book so creepy and intense. I just couldn't put the book down! (And I'll admit to peeking at the ending when I was almost finished because I couldn't take it any longer. I had to know. And it still didn't take away from my enjoyment of the novel.) Rachel and Phillip are on this destructive path together that neither of them realizes, and all the reader can do is wait for it to happen. Even then knowing that there couldn't possibly be a happy ending to the story, I was blown away by the ending. It left me thinking, and I had to go back and reread the first chapter again. And then the ending again. And I was still left wanting to discuss this one with someone. It was just that good!I don't think I need to even summarize my feelings on this one. I LOVED it, plain and simple! I would reread it again without a second thought and want a copy of it for my own shelves. Just thinking about it now makes me want to read it again so what can I do but recommend it to all of you! Highly recommended!!!Bottom Line: An amazing read.....nothing more to say other than that!Disclosure: I checked this one out from my local library but you can bet I will be purchasing my own copy!"},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"This mystery novel's dramatic tension stems from the fact that the reader is never quite sure if the eponymous character is a scheming villain or simply an emotionally fragile woman who follows her impulses. Du Maurier's portrait of Rachel is richly drawn, and the romance that develops between Rachel and her younger cousin Philip, the story's narrator, is complex and convincing.Twenty-four-year-old Philip has good reason to believe that Cousin Rachel, whom he is meeting for the first time, is not the person she is purporting to be. However, she is a beautiful woman (although he doesn't realize it at first) and he is not insensible to her charms. He ends up falling head-over-heels in love with her despite his misgivings. He then alternates between: a) suspecting his cousin of terrible crimes, including the murder of Philip's cousin, Ambrose, Rachel's former husband and the man who had been a father figure to Philip; and b) devising explanations for her behavior that would exonerate her from blame. In a similar fashion, the reader vacillates back and forth, one minute thinking, \\"She's trouble! Run while you can, Philip!\\", the next minute sympathizing with Rachel and thinking, \\"I'm sure she means well.\\" Du Maurier demonstrates great skill as a writer in maintaining this sense of uncertainty throughout the novel. The ending is surprising.Most of the action takes place on a sprawling estate along the coast of Cornwall, and although Du Maurier never actually specifies a time period the novel appears to be set in the late 19th century. \\"My Cousin Rachel\\" was published in 1951, but is written in a slow moving, character-driven Victorian Gothic style that heightens the sense of mystery, unease, romance, and excitement."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"I read Daphne Du Maurier's book \\"Rebecca\\" and fell in love with it. I decided to buy another one of her books and read online that \\"My Cousin Rachel\\" had a similar feel as \\"Rebecca\\" so I decided this was the one to buy. I didn't think it would live up to Rebecca, but I was mistaken. It has the same dark, mysterious atmosphere to it, the same kind of wonderfully developed characters and a great storyline that captivated me from beginning to end. Just like Rebecca, this book was not predictable to me and left me thinking for days after finishing it. I didn't want to put it down and was sad when it was over. \\"My Cousin Rachel\\" and \\"Rebecca\\" are now my two favorite fiction books."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"When I read Rebecca last year, it instantly became one of my favorite novels. The second Du Maurier book I read was Jamaica Inn. While it was a well-written novel with plenty of mystery to go around, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed when compared to Rebecca.My Cousin Rachel should be the second Daphne Du Maurier novel you read if you loved Rebecca. It is a psychological mystery reminiscent of something written by John Fowles. In this novel, Ambrose Ashley is advised to go to Italy for the sake of his health. His cousin Philip, who he raised as his own son, is distressed to see him go, but soon begins enjoying being master of the estate.Things change when Philip learns that Ambrose has married an Italian countess. Before Ambrose and his bride return to England, Philip receives a few cryptic messages from Ambrose suggesting that Rachel is attempting to harm him. Philip departs for Italy immediately, but upon his arrival learns that his cousin has died and his widow vanished.The fun begins when Rachel turns up in England and seeks an audience with Philip. Before Rachel's arrival, Philip creates a sundry of images in his head of this woman who possibly killed his cousin. First he imagines her as an old invalid, then she is a silly young girl. When Rachel arrives in England, Philip is so enraged by the images he has conjured up in his imagination, he refuses to even see her.At the request of his god father, Philip agrees to meet with Rachel at the Ashley estate. He is surprised to see that the real Rachel Ashley resembles none of the faces he had imagined for her. Every suspicion he had of her begins to vanish as Rachel casts her spell on Philip and the readers. Just when the evidence begins to pile up against her it is easily explained away. The question is, did she murder her husband? If I had to pick a favorite between My Cousin Rachel and Rebecca, I don't think I could. Both novels are two of the best I have ever read."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"I loved this book. I loved Rebecca and this is right up there with that great classic. The tone of this book is a bit different, but still very mysterious. The book was written in 1951, but the story is timeless.

The only reason my rating is just shy of the five star mark is that it is dark and can leave the reader with a heavy and unsatisfied feeling. I'd still say its worth the time, but just be warned.

I chose to come to the conclusion that she was good. Other readers may have reached a different conclusion. My Cousin Rachel is an outstanding piece of literary achievement!

Not any more, though....\\"I'm a mystery writer, and Daphne du Maurier was one of my earliest inspirations. REBECCA is her masterpiece, followed by two other novels, THE SCAPEGOAT and this 1951 bestseller. The opening sentences of MY COUSIN RACHEL (above) are second only to the immortal opening line of REBECCA.In 1840s Cornwall, young Philip Ashley inherits the fortune of the cousin who raised him, who has recently married abroad (Italy) and died under mysterious circumstances. Philip's pleasant life is disrupted by the sudden arrival of his cousin's beautiful widow, Rachel. Initially planning to send her on her way with a generous pension, he soon finds himself falling in love with her--even as he begins to suspect that she murdered his cousin and may be planning the same fate for him.Rarely have I read a novel in which the tension and suspense arise almost exclusively from character. Who is this woman? What is she doing? How is the young hero going to respond to her? These questions have haunted readers since the book first appeared, and they will continue to do so for a long time to come. Reading the book again after all these years, I was amazed by du Maurier's plotting, her use of language, and the way she can create an atmosphere of foreboding that is almost palpable. Writers can learn a lot from this master, and RACHEL is a must for anyone who loves the very best in suspense.PS: The 1952 film version, with Olivia de Havilland and an incredibly young Richard Burton in the leads, is also excellent."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"This book (and the 1952 film, with Olivia de Havilland and Richard Burton) have haunted me since I first read the book over 20 years ago. It's a mesmerizing and artful tour de force, building high atmosphere, suspense and intrigue - and using relentless ambiguity. Du Maurier (12 or 13 years after &quot;Rebecca&quot; - and in my opinion the added maturity shows in more complex characters, circumstances and moral nuances) masterfully spins her tale, weaving in vivid images of a warm and fertile Italy contrasted against those of a cool green England with an economy of description. A naive young man (Philip) in his early twenties, raised by and adoring of his bachelor uncle (Ambrose), is plunged into suspicion on news that his beloved uncle has suddenly and mysteriously died abroad soon after marrying a previously unknown cousin (you guessed it - Rachel) in Florence. Ghastly fantasies mount as Philip awaits Rachel's arrival in England. But she turns out to be a worldly woman of unanticipated charms, who turns young Philip's head entirely. Is she a villainous murderess? Or merely a world-wise woman torn by affection for a dashing much younger man, bearing a marked resemblance to her husband of so few months? Delicious issues are raised, including what are the moral constraints of a woman in a world which allows her few ways to financial freedom. Does the fact that a woman understands finance necessarily mean that she doesn't love a rich husband? Is an Italian woman with a mastery of healing herbs necessarily a poisoner? Can a world-wise woman who has long since lost her innocence nonetheless be captivated by the dewy youthfulness of a young man? And, as with all du Maurier, all of the events occur in lush and beautifully described surrounding events and places. I'm a big reader, and this is one of my big favorites!"},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"My Cousin Rachel is by Daphne du Maurier (288 pgs) and was written in 1951. There is something about the way du Maurier writes that makes it hard to put one of her books down. And this is no exception. From the opening sentence, I was utterly and completely enthralled!!The story is told by Philip Ashley, a young orphan who was taken in to raise by his cousin Ambrose, a young man not much more than a boy himself. And it was just the two of them for many years. No women around at all....not even on the staff. There was never a need, when the men could get along so well without them! When Ambrose's health starts to falter a bit, he is pushed to spend the cold, damp winters in a warmer climate. Imagine Philip's surprise when, one winter, Ambrose writes that he has married a woman from Florence! Her name was Rachel, a widow that was struggling to survive the debt her first husband had left. Not only was Philip surprised, he was jealous. Ambrose had always been his and his alone. He never had to share him with anyone.When Ambrose decides to stay in Florence to help settle some estate problems for Rachel, Philip is upset. And when Ambrose's correspondence starts falling behind, he even starts to get worried. About this time a letter arrives for Philip that is shaky and completely unlike Ambrose. Philip quickly decides to make the trip to Florence. Ambrose complains of being sick and is having doubts about Rachel, his torment. But when Philip arrives at the villa in Italy, Ambrose has already passed away, and Rachel has left the country. With revenge on his mind, Philip goes back to England to find he will inherit the entire Ashley estate on his twenty-fifth birthday, which is only 6 months away. No provisions at all have been made for Rachel, Ambrose's widow. This is just how Philip would have it, until the day that his cousin, Rachel arrives in England. She is not at all the type of woman he expected.The thing about this book is that once you read it, you will have more questions than when you started!! Is Rachel the sweet, innocent angel she seems to be? Flirty, but naive? Or is she a calculating, evil temptress, who only uses men for her personal gain? And what about Philip? Is he driven mad by jealousy and obsession? Or is there something else at work? The ending is anything but straightforward, and the reader is left to his own to answer these questions. The mystery surrounding Rachel unravels slowly, but in such a way as to keep you on the edge of your seat. I actually liked this book far more than I did Rebecca, du Maurier's more popular work. Excellent, Gothic read for a stormy and dark night!!"},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"My Cousin Rachel is one of my favorite books of all time. As I dived into its pages, I found myself being led through the emotions of the narrator. Daphne du Maurier wrote the book in such a way that every new emotion is perfectly believable--the narrator's reaction is real and understandable. I eagerly read on, wishing to know the truth behind the mystery surrounding the widow Rachel. Finally, I got to the end. It forced me to think and speculate. I had to draw my own conclusion from the facts--which, I think, is what partly made the book so unforgettable.If you want mystery, an interesting plot, content for not only eating but digesting, or just plain enjoyment, you'll like this book."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"After seeing the movie (which is, for some reason, not available on video last time I checked) and reading the book, I recently listened to an excellent audiobook version of My Cousin Rachel, narrated by Jonathan Pryce. I actually like this story even more than Du Maurier's better known Rebecca. The novel is told from the standpoint of Philip, a self-centered and inexperienced man of twenty-four. It is a challenge to have a story told by a very flawed narrator, but it makes things more interesting if it's done well, as it is here. Philip was raised by his older cousin Ambrose, who dies shortly after marrying the mysterious Rachel. Rachel comes to the estate, which is soon to be in Philip's possession. He initially blames Rachel for Ambrose's death, but almost immediately falls under her spell. He is soon helplessly in love with her. The rest of the novel is a psychological mystery --is Rachel kind and generous or ruthless and conniving, as Philip first suspected? The genius of My Cousin Rachel is in its two primary characters, Rachel and Philip. The first is the archetypal mysterious, beatiful woman who may be either good or evil. Philip is also a complex and interesting character. Just as the reader becomes exasperated at his naivete and immaturity, we are shown that he is also capable of great love and devotion. His faults, we understand, are due to his background. My Cousin Rachel has a classically English gothic atmosphere (the setting is Cornwall), a la the Bronte novels. It is at once a mystery, a romance and a fascinating psychological study."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"Before reading this book, you must clear your mind of preceptions inferred by critics insisting that Du Maurier is a writer of romance. First and foremost, Du Maurier writes about murderers. Like Patricia Highsmith, she masterfully allows you to see through their eyes and feel all that they feel regarding the misdeed they contemplate or have already committed. As in most of her male-narrated fictions, you will find yourself so enthralled by the circumstances observed and described that you inadvertantly cheer for and empathize with a protagonist as immoral as Highsmith's Tom Ripley is ammoral.Philip Ashley is such a creation. Here, you must depart from Richard Burton's 1953 movie version of this character---in the film of the same name, we watch a young and beautiful Burton pout and snarl rather than see the events through his eyes. In the novel, Philip is the product of a woman-free household. He is young, sheltered and almost churlish from his lack of society. Living on a large Cornish estate with his older cousin Ambrose, Philip is groomed in tradition--he will run the Ashley estate and become a magistrate like his cousin before him; he has no need for women fussing about him. In short, he has learned Ambrose's lessons quite well. Imagine his surprise when Ambrose departs for Italy and months later writes back to inform Philip and the staff at the estate that he has taken a wife--a half-Italian distant cousin, Rachel Sangiletti. Compound this surprise with letters received from Ambrose describing a deteriorating health punctuated with headaches, violent outbursts and an apprehensive distrust of his wife's frivilousness with regard to money. When Ambrose suddenly dies, Philip finds himself in a frenzy of his own; his target, the unsuspecting Rachel, newly-arrived in Cornwall with Ambrose's possessions. Prepared to hate her, Philip encounters a woman far different from what he expected. Like his mentor, Ambrose, Philip falls in love with her and similarly follows the road that Ambrose traveled where his misogynic training is turned on its ear. Only when Philip's rosy picture of Rachel is tested by actions Philip doesn't quite understand, does his world cloud with Ambrose's ingrained suspicions.This novel truely unlocks the door to Philip's mind and emotions. We see only through Philip's point of view; Rachel, although the book is named after her, is a secondary figure--a shadow not quite comprehended by our hero.This book is definitely recommended to all those who have enjoyed 'Rebecca'--I imagined Rachel to be like Rebecca, knowingly or unknowingly inciting their rather solitary men to committing acts of extreme violence. The wicked question Du Maurier leaves floating around in the reader's mind is this: Are Rebecca and Rachel evil women who justifiably are killed--- or ---are they just women who serve no other good function but to die?"},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"This book is about obsession, and how it can blur the line between reason and madness. I will forever wonder about the innocence or guilt of Rachel; she is a complicated enigma that will surely cause readers to reflect about her character, long after they have finished the book. At worst, she is a deceitful, conniving vixen who uses her charms for personal gain; at best, she is an endearing flirt who is too naive to understand the power of her charms on a young, inexperienced young man like Phillip. Because Phillip is the narrator, all of his motivations, vulnerabilities, fears, doubts and insecurities are fully explored, which makes for a fascinating mind journey. He seems to have as many flaws as his cousin Rachel does, and yet her innermost thoughts and feelings remain just out of reach. The four stars are because I felt the set-up for the ending was too convenient and too contrived. This complicated character study deserved more than its easy, predictable finish."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"DuMaurier's book, \\"Rebecca\\", is a must read. However, DuMaurier deserves be known for more than this one book alone. \\"My Cousin Rachel\\" is about a young man in England who cares for the uncle who has raised him. However, his uncle departs on a vacation to Italy and falls in love with and marries \\"Rachel.\\" Without giving too much away, let it be said that our young gentleman has his concerns in regard to his uncle and this Rachel. But once he meets Rachel, he falls under her spell, as well.It's a very fun book to do for a book club because you will have friends who believe Rachel's story and those who do not. It's also enjoyable to ask whether this story could be modernized and still ring true.DuMaurier is an excellent storyteller. She utilizes very few characters and as a reader, you feel as though you are observing all which is taking place in the story. She's always excellent at making the setting become a real part of the story.Again, even though this book does not equal \\"Rebecca\\" by any stretch of the imagination, it deserves to be read and will be remembered."},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"An astonishing look into the mind of a reckless young man driven close to madness by jealousy and suspicion. Going even deeper than &quot;Rebecca&quot;, this book explores the confusing shadow-play of modern romance and its darker side: obsession. The ending is perfect, leaving just the right questions posed and unanswered. I've read this book three times, and I'll surely read it again. Btw, the BBC did the perfect serialization of this book in the 1980s, with Geraldine Chaplin in the title role. How come this isn't available on video?"},{"Title":"My Cousin Rachel (International Collectors Library)","review":"My cousin Rachel is a brilliant read! Du Maurier is able to weave a tale with subtle plot twists that leaves the reader to wonder if Rachel was truly good or evil. The foreshadowing is thoughtful and goes nearly undetected. This is the hallmark of an excellent writer!The style of writing in My Cousin Rachel is fluid and descriptive. In short, it is beautifully written. Although written many years ago, Du Murier's tale here is timeless. One is transported into the emotions and thoughts of the characters. Everyone can identify with the vivid depictions of loyalties, affections and doubts that plague as all in our own minds.This is my favourite book by Du Maurier and believe me it does not disappoint."},{"Title":"John Keble, (Leaders of religion)","review":"One of the great mysteries and oversights of history is why an adequate modern biography of John Keble remains unwritten. It seems a tragedy to me (since I studied Keble for 3 years for my Ph.D. in Religious Studies) that the best biography of Keble is still the first one, written in 1869 by J.T. Coleridge, 3 years after Keble's death. The most recent biography of Keble is Georgina Battiscombe's \\"John Keble: A Study in Limitations\\" (1963). But what kind of biographer subtitles the biography of her subject: \\"A Study in Limitations\\"?! That all men have limitations is self-evident. The irony is that the nearly unanimous consensus of Keble's peers and contemporaries was that he was a modern-day saint. It is astounding that the most recent biography of a man of Keble's stature is now almost 50 years old. What's even more baffling and disappointing is that no one has bothered to edit Keble's letters.Lock's biography was originally printed in 1893 and was the second biography of Keble to be published. It's a shorter work than Coleridge's (238 pages in the original edition compared to Coleridge's 568) and therefore less thorough. On the other hand, as the warden of Keble College, Lock had access to much of Keble's unpublished correspondence and was able to speak with personal friends of Keble. His work is therefore original, even though it's not as close to the source as Coleridge's.While Lock's biography is not as complete as Coleridge's, his is still a good and useful biography of Keble. Lock frames Keble's life in terms of the major events of his life (whereas Coleridge offers a more continuous and undifferentiated biography). These key events include:\\"Preparation for the Work of Life\\", 1792-1832\\"The Professor of Poetry\\"\\"The Christian Year\\"\\"The Struggle, 1833-1841\\"\\"The Struggle, 1841-1845\\"\\"Lyra Innocentium\\"\\"Recovery\\", 1846-1860\\"The End\\", 1860-1866\\"The Preacher\\"\\"The Spiritual Adviser\\"\\"Characteristics and Influence\\"Lock clearly defines his topics concerning Keble's life, and his organization makes his biography a good one for getting an overall feel for the life and ministry of Keble. He is especially helpful in clearly presenting Keble's loving and remarkable ministry as a priest, spiritual advisor, and pastor. He also pays special attention to Keble's greatest legacy, his 1827 volume of poetry titled \\"The Christian Year,\\" which had an incredible influence on the Church of England in the 19th century. One of Lock's appendices lists the poems of \\"The Christian Year\\" and the dates of their composition, which is especially helpful to students of \\"The Christian Year.\\"Overall, Lock's is a good biography of a major and compelling 19th century figure, and I'm grateful that it has now been republished."},{"Title":"How to Feed Friends and Influence People: The Carnegie Deli...A Giant Sandwich, a Little Deli, a Huge Success","review":"I love living in Asheville . . . however that said, I must admitto the fact that I miss having any great Jewish delicatessensin the location.So when a friend gave me a copy of HOW TO FEEDFRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE by Milton Parker andAllyn Freeman, I was in seventh heaven because it's the storyof New York's famous Carnegie Deli . . . reading it wasalmost but not quite as good as devouring a corned beef sandwich.I got a kick out of reading how this particular Deli managed to growfrom a nondescript hole in the wall to the establishment of choicefor presidents, celebrities,at least one sultan and millions of otherhungry diners from around the world . . .it has done so by followinga set of sound business practices without spending any moneyon advertising or promotions . . . instead, word-of-mouthhas always been the key to its success:* The decision to add two extra inches to the pastrami, corned beefand tongue sandwiches represented Parker's smart way of thinkingthat when people from Pasadena, or from Jacksonville, or from wherever,returned home after a visit to the Carnegie Deli, they would recountthe eating of the humongous sandwich. The diners would retell of theirordering and fun dining adventure. Yesterday's Carnegie Deli dinerswould advertise the restaurant to tomorrow's New York City visitors--atno expense to the Carnegie Deli.I particularly got a kick out of reading about the visits of suchcomics as Henny Youngman:* Youngman asked the couple, \\"Would you like to see a photographof my pride and joy?\\" When the Siegels nodded yes, Youngmanhanded them a picture of Pride furniture polish and Joy dishwashingliquid. Another time, Youngman said to Jane, \\"You're a pretty lady.I'm going to give you a diam-ond pin.\\" He handed her a dime on a pin!And I enjoyed the accounts of actual customers, one of whom wasthe writer Michael Kramer:* Kramer was sent to Israel to do a story and the group decided to sendhim a Carnegie Deli salami to keep his spirits up. When Kramer wentto the post office in Tel Aviv to pick up this treat, he discoveredan empty brown wrapper and no salami.

It is a beautifully written autobiographical work that one presumes was based on an extensive diary.In short, this book is like reading primary historial sources based on the first two decades of what was then a quite ordinary life. Hal Porter starts with his earliest memories, about his parents at their house in inner suburban Melbourne - including watching life in the street from his cast iron balcony. Then the family packs up and moves to Bairnsdale in country Victoria. His vivid account of how to adapt to a new life and people around him is very enjoyable reading.After his schooling he goes back to the city as a teacher. He is socially active and provides us with more detailed descriptions of life in Melbourne. Even the menus of exclusive restaurants are reported - for example, at The Latin, he eats tomato soup, lamb and apricot pie.This book will not appeal to everyone. It will appeal most to Australians and some may have to persist at first to get used to the richness of the expression.I would rate it as one the most engaging books I have read."},{"Title":"The Watcher on the Cast Iron Balcony (Uqp Paperbacks)","review":"I had to read this book in my Final Year at High School and I didn't like it one bit. Now it is 25 years later and I re read it and found I didn't like it anymore the second time around.

I am very interested in the Punic Wars between Rome and Carthage and Polybius is the main historian of these events. The Roman Livy also wrote about this period, but he was a Johnny-come-lately and never had the chance to interview participants in these events like Polybius did. Polybius also accompanied the Roman army during the Third and final Punic War in 146 B.C. and witnessed the destruction of Carthage and the enslavement of its population.I also have the Sather lecture volume by Walbank about Polybius.The Walbank three volumes arrived ahead of the projected date of delivery in even better condition than the vendor said.

The truth - evident from the first pages - is that it's a book about much more than fires and firefighting. For in addition to telling the fascinating story of the FDNY's evolution from colonial times to the present, Golway relates many more -- the stories of New York City's growth and development, of technological change (both architectural and firefighting), of municipal politics, of labor disputes, of struggles by women and minorities for equal opportunity. Ultimately, it's a book about the stories of generations of firefighters and their day to day struggle, often overlooked before 9/11, to put their lives on the line in protecting the lives and property of the city's residents. Best of all, the book is beautifully written, reflecting the author's emotional attachment to his subject (he's the son of a firefighter), as well as experience as a journalist.

The initial chapters deal with first-order, second-order systems analysis with opportunities to explore futher the case studies considered. The frequency domain and transient response analysis chapters also do a good job in explaining the somewhat difficult topics. The different types of control are then dealt with the next few chapters. There is continuity across the chapters in terms of the application of the ideas to the same case studies -- furnace and column -- thus allowing a person better relate to and compare/contrast the different control techniques. The &quot;Things to Think About&quot; section in each chapter sets the background for the particular topic being dealt with &quot;Procedure&quot; detailing the steps need to be executed to understand the ideas. For the MATLAB/SIMULINK non-savvy there is an introduction section to describe the relevant features to used in the book. Overall a comprehendable and decent exposure to the diverse field of Process Control through hands-on experience."},{"Title":"Process Control Modules: A Software Laboratory for Control Design","review":"This book id Very Good for use Matlab in practical exercises for process control with BASIC cases but excelent problems that aproximate to real industry."},{"Title":"Process Control Modules: A Software Laboratory for Control Design","review":"I work as an Instrumentation, Automation, Process Safety and Control Engineer for the Oil and Gas Industry.If your work is related to Process Control, and you want to gain experience with Matlab and Simulink, this is good way.

He arrives to learn that Jennie was killed to keep her from talking about the swindle which Epson did to her. The killer Epson hired was named Caviness.Preacher (Art) sets out to find Epson, who has moved to Philadelphia where he has an excellent position with a much-larger bank than had employed him in St. Louis. On the way, he stops at his family's farm, to learn his father has a mortgage which must be paid very soon and there is no money to pay it. We learn Art's last name is Coopersmith.He pays the mortgage, in the process teaching the banker and his thugs a harsh lesson, and tells his father that the farm should go to his brother, Morgan, who stayed home and worked hard while Art \\"went to see the Creature\\". He tells his father that he believes he did see it, and that he is happy with his life out West.Tracking down Epson and Coopersmith in Philadelphia, Art kills Caviness after the criminal kills Epson.A very-engrossing tale, and almost every page has excitement and intrigue."},{"Title":"The First Mountain Man: Preacher's Justice","review":"The books of Preacher and his pals and their way of life isalways interesting and the folks of questionable charactermakes for a good read.

I have been an Ali fan since I was 12, and I have never seen these pictures before! Ali was 19, and made up a story about how he worked out in a swimming pool, so that the photographer would take underwater photos. They are incredible. So is the fact that, even though he had already won a gold medal, he wasn't allowed to try on clothes in a Miami department store because he was black.There are pictures of him running 5 miles to the gym in his dress pants and work boots, because he didn't have gym clothes! I can't stop looking at these pictures, and I can't believe how brave he was and how hard he had to work."},{"Title":"Muhammad Ali: The Birth of a Legend, Miami, 1961-1964","review":"This is a book that's hard to put down. Just when you've thought you had read all you can read about Ali, a book like this comes along. The pictures make you feel as if as though you were there yourself. This was one of the best gifts I've ever received. I plan to pass this treasure on to many for Christmas."},{"Title":"Muhammad Ali: The Birth of a Legend, Miami, 1961-1964","review":"I received this book as a gift and I find myself going back to it over and over. Like going back to a museum time and again to look at a favorite work of art. The photographs of Clay/Ali are so personal and so beautiful. Odd as it sounds, I feel grateful that Mr. Schulke has shared these photographs with me, with everyone lucky enough to discover them. I came to Amazon just now to order this book for a friend and found myself moved to write these few words. There's something about the book and about the story of Clay/Ali that wants to be shared."},{"Title":"Muhammad Ali: The Birth of a Legend, Miami, 1961-1964","review":"This is an amazing photography book by the renowned civil-rights photographer, Flip Schulke. It is a must-have for any fan of boxing and/or especially Muhammad Ali. As the text states, only five of the 85 photos included here have ever been seen before! I am a huge Ali fan and I have never seen pictures of him when he was so young and in such intimate, ordinary settings. Half of the pictures were taken the year after he won the 1960 gold medal and had begun to train with Angelo Dundee. He was just 19 years old! The other half were taken 4 years later before, during, and after he won his first heavyweight title fight against Sonny Liston. The book is gorgeously designed, and the text is fascinating--especially the informal narrative text sections that are the actual words and thoughts of Mr. Schulke during the time he was taking these pictures and getting to know this not-yet-world-famous fighter. I love this book and plan to give copies to several of my friends for Christmas."},{"Title":"Muhammad Ali: The Birth of a Legend, Miami, 1961-1964","review":"I saw the book on display in a Barnes and Noble I had to have it!

Before, I only admired Ali from a distance; now I feel like I can respect him up close. These photos give you such a wonderful image of his self-respect, which is incredibly sexy and just plain cool. Such self-confidence shines through beautifully in the photos, especially the underwater ones (the accompanying stories are enlightening as well). He makes you want to take up boxing (which I plan to!) and redirect your whole attitude: We're all winners! I'm getting this for my little brother--and keeping my own copy! Happy reading..."},{"Title":"Muhammad Ali: The Birth of a Legend, Miami, 1961-1964","review":"If you are a fan of Muhammad Ali or sports photography, you'll find this book a joy to read. The book focuses on Flip Schulke's black and white photographs of Ali that were taken on a few occasions from the early to mid-1960s. Flip's comments about the photos and Ali provide rare glimpses into Ali's early penchant for showmanship and the racial prejudice that affected his views. If you admire Ali for his impact in the boxing, social and political arenas, this book will bring tremendous joy to your heart."},{"Title":"Muhammad Ali: The Birth of a Legend, Miami, 1961-1964","review":"LOVE Muhammad Ali - always have - didn't know alot about the young 19 year old Cassius Clay.

Flip Schulke's photos demonstrate the artistry of both the subject and the chronicler. There are unforgettable underwater images of the young fighter in training, as well as poignant candid shots that aptly demonstrate Ali's humanity. Matt Schudel's accompanying text manages the difficult job of enhancing these superb photos without being distracting or superfluous. The many anecdotes from associates of Ali, as well as the chronology of Ali's career, all serve to beautifully and literately complement the photographs. This is a gorgeous book, appropriate not just for boxing or sports fans, but for all fans of cultural history, photography, writing, and art. A beautifully executed work, and a fitting tribute to one of the century's greatest heros."},{"Title":"Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing among Five Traditions","review":"This book contains five clear qualitative research. We can follow the process of the five methods as the quantative method."},{"Title":"Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing among Five Traditions","review":"Creswell manages to clearly explain differences and similarities of the five methods. Vocabulary, glossaries, examples and illustrations make each of the methodologies come alive to the reader. It is excellent as a review for someone who is writing their thesis, or for a new graduate student to grasp an understanding of qualitative methods. Creswell includes complete articles that illustrate the principles behind each of the methods. This is a \\"how to\\" and \\"what\\" book. It does not go into the philosophy behind each of the methods or the history of their development. For that perspective, try Denzin and Lincoln's Handbook of Qualitative Research. But when you are clearly defining a research project, it isn't philosophy that helps you! This book is a definite must for anyone interested in understanding or critiquing qualitative methods, or writing a qualitative proposal. Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing among Five Traditions","review":"This book really helped me write my master's thesis. For anyone who may be doing graduate study in the social sciences and is interested in qualitative research, this is a GREAT place to start.My friend suggested this book to me when my thesis adviser told me to get a book on qualitative research as I was trying to design my study of a newspaper and its relationships with strategic publics. In this book Creswell clearly and logically lays out five different qualitative research traditions (1. a biographical life history; 2. a phenomenology; 3. a grounded theory study; 4, an ethnography; and 5. a case study). Creswell guides researchers on the rationale for each method, the design, and corresponding data collection, analysis and narrative report, while giving ample references for further reading in one's chosen tradition. Particularly helpful are the appendices that include example studies of each methodology.I needed other sources to supplement what I learned here, but this book really gave me an excellent foundation with which to proceed. I recommend it to anyone who is trying to design a qualitative study and isn't sure where to start."},{"Title":"Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing among Five Traditions","review":"This is one of John Creswell's best books by far. I purchased it in paperback and actually had it spiral bound by a local print shop because I used it so much. I can't go on enough of how helpful this book was with one of my doctoral courses. I am glad our professor choose this text because when we went through various pieces of the five qualitative designs it gave great examples, detailed lists for guidance, and a great glossary. The studies in the text were very helpful as well. I recommend every masters and doctoral student to add it to their bookshelf, I guarantee you will use it a lot. It is invaluable!!!"},{"Title":"Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing among Five Traditions","review":"Creswell's book effectively covers basic theoretical and practical issues regarding biographies, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, and case studies. I studied this book as a graduate student and now use parts of it in my research methods class. He avoids much of the qualitative jargon that so many other qualitative writers can't seem to avoid, thus making this book accessible to students who are not familiar with qualitative approaches. I especially like the convenient tables that summarize key points and the real-life articles in the appendix, one for each approach.There is plenty of information about qualitative research that is not included in the book. For instance, having personally spent a great deal of time reading and applying phenomenology, I can honestly say that there is much more to this technique (theoretically and practically) than what is discussed in the book. For this reason I do not believe that people can conduct expert qualitative research after reading just Creswell - I am sure that he would agree. Other resources are needed. But everyone has to begin somewhere, and Creswell's book is an excellent start.I would like to see an expanded version of this book; one that discusses each qualitative tradition in greater detail.DaveAfter reading some of the example articles at the back of the book I am of the opinion that these articles are the weak spot for this book. In particular, the ethnography article is a very long and old paper (circa 1972?) about school principals that is more a case study than an ethnography. I think that Creswell could have selected a more recent paper that was a true ethnographic study. Also, the Grounded Theory paper on sexual victimization seems too depressing. The Phenomenological paper on the nurse-patient caring relationship is pretty good, however."},{"Title":"Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing among Five Traditions","review":"this book provides clear, concrete examples of five &quot;traditions&quot; or types of qualitative research.

She is raising twin teenaged daughters alone, but with the help of her very cooperative ex-husband. Jane has worked as an architect for a New York City firm for 18 years, where she designs mostly everything except what she wants to design: homes.Suddenly her work life changes in a way she might have chosen had she had the energy and gumption to do so. Off on her own, Jane is hired to design a house, but her client seems to have romance in mind as well. She has little interest - her life just has not included thoughts of having a man in it.Then Jane decides to contact her first love, Jack Cashin, the man who inspired her to become an architect, and whom she has not seen for 30 years. An e-mail correspondence ensues and Jane's life changes even more.The book has no \\"pat\\" ending but leaves the reader hopeful....and wondering. Fields conveys a good, positive message about taking charge of one's life and making the most of opportunities that arise.A delight to read."},{"Title":"The Middle Ages","review":"This is the third book I've read by this author and I'm happy to say that she has written another heartfelt read. She gets right to the bottom of what goes on in the minds of the overpopulated baby boomer generation so I'm guessing she's part of that census.Fields takes us on another trip to Brooklyn, New York -- a Brooklyn so beautiful with renovated brownstones and beautiful gardens. So what if it's not always that way; either is life.If you're looking for something charming that will give you a lift, then try The Middle Ages."},{"Title":"The Middle Ages","review":"If you liked Crossing Brooklyn Ferry and Lily Beach you will also like Jennie Fields' latest. It is so well written, as are all of her books, with excellent character development. You can almost become as one with the protagonist, Jane Larsen, feeling her experiences as your own. She is a fortiesh woman, with twin teen age daughters, facing life as an architect in her brave new world, alone. Torn between an old love and a new, she experiences the swings of emotions many of us have often felt. The use of emails between Jane and her old love, Jack, is cleverly incorporated into the plot, leaving you wondering where this all will lead. The story moves smoothly along, and although the ending is not decisive, you know that ultimately things will work out as you had hoped all along. This is a wonderful read and I always look forward to a new Jennie Fields book."},{"Title":"The Middle Ages","review":"Jennie Fields, author of the wonderful &quot;Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,&quot; has scored again with her touching novel, &quot;The Middle Ages.&quot; Jane Larson is a forty-six year old architect, living in New York City with her rambunctious fifteen-year old twin daughters. She is a divorced single mom who is bored with her routine job, which consists mostly of designing banks and assisted living facilities. She longs to go out on her own and create beautiful houses, but she lacks the courage to try something new after eighteen years with the same firm.Although she is still attractive, Jane is no longer the lithe beauty that she was in her twenties. She huffs and puffs going up staircases, and the days when she attracted wolf whistles are a distant memory. She dates infrequently and has little expectation of meeting a wonderful man at her age.Jane's life is shaken up when her job situation suddenly changes drastically. Her personal life also takes an interesting turn, when she decides to e-mail her old college flame, Jack, supposedly to catch up on old times. Suddenly, the old feelings are rekindled, even though Jack is living far away, in Nashville, Tennessee.With gentle humor and compassion that is rare in novels these days, Fields explores the territory of the &quot;middle ages,&quot; which is often marked by fear, insecurity, loss and pain. Jack and Jane have both been battered by life. Are they ready to plunge into a risky relationship that could potentially bring them more heartache? Should middle-aged people have the confidence to try new things when the very thought of change is so terrifying? Fields's straightforward style is heartfelt and honest, and she writes as if she understands the territory of middle age very well from personal experience. A few overly sentimental touches here and there do little to detract from this warm novel about real people hoping for a second chance at happiness."},{"Title":"The Middle Ages","review":"This wonderful novel speaks to the life of baby boomer women like me. More than any other book I've read this year. Or any year. This book understands what it's like to be in your forties, female, and longing for more. The characters are real, the voice is witty and charming. (I want this woman as my friend.) And the story is uplifting and a real page-turner. I would recommend this book to women of any age. It's an absolute joy to read. I hope word of mouth lets more people know about this very special author!"},{"Title":"The Middle Ages","review":"I accidentally discovered Jennie Fields a few years ago when I came upon her book, Crossing Brooklyn Ferry. While I'm a sucker for any book that has a New York reference in its title, I bought it but never expected it to be as good as it was. When I sought out her other book, Lily Beach, I found out that Fields was the real thing as this book was just as good, if not better than Crossing. That was five years ago. I have patiently waited for this author to pen her next tome and was delighted when I finally saw that her latest, THE MIDDLE AGES, was scheduled to be published in July. I'm not sure if I like the title because it reminds me of a history book but the cover illustrates what every Baby Boomer has come to realize and that is that \\"Life is not a bowl of cherries.\\"Fields is already well-known for putting the reader right smack dab in her hometown of Park Slope, Brooklyn, where beautifully renovated brownstones line the streets. Many of my high school friends lived in Park Slope and their parents are still kicking themselves for not hanging on to these now pricey brownstones. Her hallmark character is always a female and always one who is happy with her momentary single existence -- until she meets a possible Mr. Right and realizes that her single and sometimes lonely life is for the birds. In this case we meet Jane Larsen, who has worked at the same architectural firm for the past eighteen years. She is a single mother of teenage twin girls so job security is important to her. In her most private moments, however, she wishes she could just ditch the job and do something she really loves -- like designing homes. A twist of fate will make this possibility a reality if she wants to take a chance.I'm noticing lately that many authors are relying on the wonders of the computer and emails to tell their story. Fields utilizes this device when she has Jane tracking down an old college friend and lover, Jack Cashin. I don't really like this style of writing and feel it's sometimes a cop-out but Fields makes it work.THE MIDDLE AGES is full of thoughts and commentaries we all experience when we near the upcoming 50's. I can't help but feel that much of this book might be semi-autobiographical as the author is so right on target with the main character's feelings. If I had to compare Fields to another author of today, it would probably be Elizabeth Berg. The main difference is that you have to wait so long for another Fields' book to be published while Berg seems to knock them out with great speed.In closing I'd say that the beginning of the book was great but fizzled out a little for me towards the end. I think I was annoyed with Jane's email correspondent Jack and all the \\"baggage\\" he was carrying. I'm not sure if that was necessary to the story but you can be the judge of that. I'm just hoping I don't have to wait another five years for another book by this very talented author."},{"Title":"The Middle Ages","review":"While browsing at the library, I came across this book on a display cart. Thumbed through and tried it. I Really enjoyed it. The character was so likable. I love the way Jennie fields writes. And being \\"middle aged'' myself, I really related to many of the characters feelings. I am looking forward to trying her other novels."},{"Title":"The Middle Ages","review":"It is often fun to read and book and try to figure out how the author came up with the title. In the case of The Middle Ages by Jennie Fields, this is a most appropriate title since it describes the main character's place in life.Jane Larsen is in her middle ages or as we say middle aged. She is divorced from her husband who she remains on good terms with and is the mother of two teenage twin girls going through their own turbulent years. She is also an architect frustrated with her job. As Jane describes herself she is a dumpy woman surrounded by young and beautiful woman. And added to all of her insecure feelings is the thought that despite fix ups for dinner parties and blind date drinks, she may never meet another man who will mean something to her during her middle ages.Then just as Jane thinks life is running at a dull speed, she is fired from her boring job. Now she can finally do what she always wanted, build homes for clients. And then Jane becomes very bold and decides to look up her college boyfriend Jack Craskin using the Internet. After all of these years Jane suddenly wants to know how his life turned out. And we as readers are along for the ride as we watch the perils and joys of being in one's middle ages.This is a fast paced book which asks and then answers the questions, \\"What if I had married my old sweetheart, or at the very least, \\"Is love really lovelier the second time around.\\" With a quick wit and good sense of humor, Ms. Fields does a fine job of presenting he characters. At times she is reminiscent of Jeanne Ray, author of Step - Ball Change and Susan Isaacs, author of Lily White. She is also wonderful at describing the tree lined brownstone streets of Brooklyn and the hectic working pace of Manhattan. I did enjoy this book and look forward to reading more books by Jennie Fields in the future."},{"Title":"The Middle Ages","review":"What caught my eye about this book, more than the fact that the character is 'middle age', is that she rekindles her long-past romance with her college sweetheart. In this age of computers, I think this is a fantasy many people may hold. And although the on-line romance worked pretty well, the reality of the meeting and ending, although happy, showed that it isn't always easy.I thought Jennie Fields did an excellent job of hinting at all the complicated relationships 1 person has in real life without ever getting too far away from the plot. The main character Jane Larsen does have extended family and this has affected who she is today. She does have an ex-husband who is very much present in her life. She lives with her teenage twin daughters and it is easy to imagine how much her life revolves around them. But we are introduced to these people peripherally, they never take over the story from the fact that Jane Larsen has lost her long held job, has a conflicting love interest in a man she hates being attracted to because she really just wants the job of designing his house, and her rekindling romance via email with Jack. When it rains it pours."},{"Title":"The Middle Ages","review":"The Middle Ages is a light, easy read about middle-aged Jane Larsen who has all but given up on love. Divorced from a man who cheated on her throughout their marriage, Jane isn't looking for a new love, but rather focusing her attention on her career and twin daughters. Caught up in the mundainess of her job designing chain banks at work, Jane dreams of her ideal job, designing homes for people.Set in New York, Jane's love of architecture comes through in loving detail, as she notices the things about homes and buildings that only a true architect would. When she least expects it, Jane finds herself actually contemplating 2 different relationships. The question is, will Jane make the right choice, and will she let her fears subside in order to give love a chance?The Middle Ages is a well written, easy read."},{"Title":"The Middle Ages","review":"I loved this book - it's SO nice to have a great women's fiction choice where the main character is over 35 and not 26 and dying to get married- -and really is starting over, has real problems, hang ups,etc. Great read. well written too~"},{"Title":"The Middle Ages","review":"Overall I liked this novel, and what it represents to women 'of a certain age' as the phrase goes. Second chances, trusting in yourself despite the odds and what experience has taught. Sometimes it ran a little sappy for my taste, though, especially in the e-mails between Jane and Jack. A quick but decent read."},{"Title":"Tom Edison finds out;: A really truly story","review":"Great vintage series, set in the 1940's and earlier about famous American figures as children, and includes how they began their careers at a young age. There are many stories about young Tom Edison here, including that he tried to make electricity by rubbing 2 cats together. Hysterical, energetic cartoon/illustations on every page make this series really collectible.Hardbacks, about 40 pp, with a cloth binding.

This little Bible is wonderfully convenient to tuck away in my briefcase, coat pocket or glove compartment. I just had to buy more than one. It is zippered, so the pages don't get damaged with constant handling. It is a complete Bible (GREAT!). I have often opted to carry only a New Testament for convenience, because I certainly couldn't find a whole Bible so small; but now, I have.

They don't overwhelm the beginner (for whom the book was written) with the painstaking details of the proof. They don't describe the construction of a formal language or discuss recursive functions.

The book will be especially useful for readers whose interests lie primarily in mathematics or logic, but who do not have very much prior knowledge of this important proof. Readers with broader interests, who would like to explore the larger implications of the proof for science or philosophy, may be disappointed that the book ends where it does. Godel's Incompleteness Theorem is cited by many scholars who question some of the fundamental assumptions of science. Just to give one example, it figures prominently in Robert Rosen's argument that a computing machine is an inadequate model for an organism. It is relevant to the question of whether everything that nature does can be understood as a computation, as Wolfram and many others have maintained. This book would have been more exciting if it had delved into a few of these discussions. Instead the authors wrap it up quickly with a brief \\"concluding reflections\\" chapter, as if they had a deadline to meet or a severe space limitation to conform to. That may leave some readers understanding the logic of the proof, but saying \\"so what?\\""},{"Title":"Godel's proof,","review":"There is no question in my mind that the most misunderstood mathematical theorems of all time are Godel's incompleteness theorems. In essence, they state that no system powerful enough to do basic arithmetic is complete. Meaning that there will always be statements that are true in the system but that can never be proven in that system. These results have been seized upon by people with many different agendas and used to argue conclusions as significant as the existence of God and that human intelligence is not simply the outward manifestation of neurotransmitters flowing from place to place. While this is all somewhat amusing, it is also disquieting, as the theorems cannot be used to conclusively justify such significant claims.This book is one of the very first books where an attempt is made to explain Godel's theorems to the mathematical laity. In that sense, it is a success; the appropriate background is effectively put forward before the theorem and proof are explained. There is little in the way of formal mathematics and the bulk of the terminology is non-technical. If the people who use Godel's results to justify their extravagant claims were to read this book with an open mind, they would recognize the absurdity of their positions."},{"Title":"Godel's proof,","review":"This is a fantastic book that makes the important discoveries of Godel accessible to all interested readers.

It took some work to get through it, but that was more related to the complexity of the proof, than the explanation or writing."},{"Title":"Godel's proof,","review":"First of all, I confess that this review is based on the Korean translation of this book. (If this were for my own research, I would rather read it in English, but I am using this book as a textbook for my undergraduate students here in Korea.) But I don't think that this fact makes any important difference here.The highlight of the first half is clearly Hilbert's formalist program for the foundation of mathematics. The author(s) provide(s) a precise, but very accessible discussion of why Hilbert needed to prove the consistency of various axiomatic systems (including those of non-standard geometries), how he proved it, and in what sense this proof was limited. This part of the book is excellent in both rigor and clarity. But this is perhaps due to the inherent nature of Hilbert's program itself; for, isn't it just obvious that, for example, if Riemann geometry can be reinterpreted as a theory about a bent plane embedded in the Euclidean space, the former should be consistent as long as the latter is?The later half of the book is also not bad at all, but I feel like the book could've been more rigorous without sacrificing readability. For example, the author(s) do(es) not discuss the difference between Godel's theorem and its somewhat semantic cousin. In my opinion, this is a significant omission, because the readers are bound to be confused between them. (For a useful discussion about the distinction, see Pollock's Technical Methods in Philosophy, which is available for free. Just google it.) Plus, the book could use the liar paradox as the starting point, not Richard's paradox. Clearly, the liar paradox produce a contradiction regardless of the proof-theoretical power of the given formal system, and so one may (mistakenly) think that the source of inconsistency is not the assumed provability of the Godel sentence but the semantic flaw of the system itself. So it is crucial to emphasize the purely syntactic character of G's proof, which, in my opinion, can be done better with the liar paradox.By and large, this book explains exactly what Godel proves and why it is so important. Highly recommendable."},{"Title":"Godel's proof,","review":"Edited by the author of GEB - the very book that determeined his life work!

I think you needed more content to the review and less ebullience. So here it is... In the interim, I have read other treatments of G&ouml;del's proof (including the Dover book of G&ouml;del's article itself also with an introduction, Beyond Numeracy, The Advent of the Algorithm [ref below], and several others). What stands out in THIS book, though, is the extreme thoroughness of explaining to you the context in which G&ouml;del was working at the time. This book is unique in its dedication to getting you to a concrete understanding of -- and appreciation for -- the background and context. In fact making sure you get the context appreciation takes up about 2/3rd's of the book! Of course the book is thorough on the Proof itself too. Is that part easy? No, it's still not. But you won't be left at all vague on what the proof is like. The only other book that is as good on the CONTEXT of G&ouml;del's proof is The Advent of the Algorithm. The Advent of the Algorithm is also excellent on how others took, and \\"ran-with\\", G&ouml;del's results. As for which edition of this book (G&ouml;del's Proof) to get, the new addition has Hofstaddter's introduction. That intro adds value for sentimentality (if you should so find his story about his reading the book and his subsequent friendship with Nagel) and Hofstadter's own ebullience, but the book is virtually identical otherwise with its 1959 edition. It would be perfectly good -- you'll miss nothing -- if you bought a cheap 1959 edition.

It reads easily - until it doesn't. It's very, very helpful to feel comfortable with \\"~p v q\\" to understand the ingenious proof based on numbers, but the first 45 pages plus introduction are understandable to just about everyone.The text may be too short to give non-fanatics much insight into what the fuss is about anyway. The book's summary is a mere four pages.Let me add this. Immanuel Kant was important back in the late 1700's. Really important. He showed how mental math had real meaning in the material world and that logic has remained fixed for millennia. Kant's statements marked the end of classicism. In the 1800's, Gauss, Riemann and others showed how math does not AUTOMATICALLY (a priori) describe the real world (synthetic), and Boole developed symbolic logic (extreme a priori), that seemed to subsume math until the Godel showed that this was a sterile end also. In short, math became extremely separated from reality and Godel then detached it from being a \\"simple\\" mental construction.The question remains what does math and other mental systems have to do with the real world. People interpret the proof differently. This book only slightly helps resolve that problem. The early twentieth century gave three big ideas that may be very limited or very pervasive in reality. It's not really clear:* Relativity Theory (Einstein)* Indeterminacy Principle (Heisenberg)* Incompleteness Theorem (Godel)To get into a modern proof, that is nothing like the simple stuff taught in high school, read this book.

But we have moved on and there have been a number of clearlysuperior popularizations on this fascinating subject.

What most surprised me was that what we were proving was really strong and it was not really difficult. I enjoyed the reading and the understanding of the books until i found a statement in that the authors wrote that it is not true for me. This sentence is on the chapter 7.b. called &quot; The Arithmetization of Meta-Mathematics &quot;. Before that sentence the authours explain how is done the mapping of propositions to numbers called Godel's Numbering. After the explanation the book shows the folowing example :Let P1 be the axiom ' ( p v p ) =&gt; p ' whose godel number is A. and let P2 be the proposition ' ( p v p ) ' whose godel number is B. Now the authors assert the folowing meta-mathematical statement :&quot; The formula P2 is an initial part of P2. &quot;After that thay ask to which arithmetical formula in the formal system does this statement correspond. Then it appears the sentence which I believe it is incorrect :It is evident that the smaller formula (P2) can be an initial part of the larger formula (P1) if, and only if, the (godel) number B is a factor of the (godel) number A .It is clear that if a formula B is an initial part of another formula A then the godel number of B is a factor of the godel number of A. But it is not so easy to see that the only way that a godel number B is a factor of another(A) is just because the formula of B is an initial part of the formula of A.For example consider the proposition ' ( p = p ) =&gt; p ' whose godel number is: 2( 8 )*3( 11( 2 ) )*5( 5 )*7( 11 ( 2 ) )* 11( 9 ) * 13( 3 ) * 17 ( 11( 2 ) ) let it call it N. (The parenthesis indicates the power of the previous number) The proposition ' ( p v p ) ' has the godel number : 2( 8 )*3( 11( 2 ) )*5( 2 )*7( 11 ( 2 ) )* 11( 9 ) let it call it M.As one can see M is a factor of N because N = M * k where k = 5(3) * 13( 3 ) * 17 ( 11( 2 ) ) But the formula ' ( p v p ) ' is clearly not an initial part of the formula ' ( p = p ) =&gt; p ' This is an example that shows that even though one godel number is a factor of another, that does not always means that one formula is an initial part of the other. I would be pleased if any one can tell me something about this, or the book. I am really disappointed with the book, because I could not from the argument from now on because of that sentence.

Somehow it is always thought that although profound mistakes were made in the past, the contemporary establishment has things straightened out. My contention is that what is called Goedel's proof is a fundamental embarrassment in the history of logic and mathematics.There are many particulars in this book that I can criticize which extend beyond Goedel. There is the formalization of deductive systems tracing back to Hilbert. It consists in using symbols without meaning, which are afterward \\"interpreted\\" according to subject matter. The like happened most prominently in non-Euclidean geometry, when terms like \\"straight line\\" and \\"plane\\" were reinterpreted to designate certain curved lines and surfaces, to then demonstrate that some Euclidean theorems do not hold. The problem is that this commits the basic fallacy of equivocation. By redefining words, the statements containing them no longer apply to the original meanings. Likewise, meaningless symbols in formal systems can be defined in conflicting ways. Presently this concerns the use of \\"Goedel numbers\\" for such symbols.\\"Goedel's proof\\" is about a sentence which may be phrased as\\"THIS STATEMENT IS UNPROVABLE (IN THE SYSTEM)\\".The sentence has been recast into logical symbols, and it is these symbols, individually or combined, that are given \\"Goedel numbers\\". The argument then is that whatever is determined about the sentence applies to the numbers, viz. to mathematics. The equivocation should be obvious, but alas it isn't. The thinking is explained away by examples like the use of algebra in geometry. But these concern actual mathematical content. The sentence now at issue has no such content, the numbering merely designating the linguistic constituents.Now to the sentence itself. As indicated there inside parentheses, the sentence is said unprovable in whatever deductive system is used, but Goedel is held to have proved it via \\"meta-mathematical\\" means outside the system. This contention I see as an excuse, avoiding contradiction. For, whatever the logic in the proof, it can be made part of the system. To exclude valid logical procedures from deductive systems unjustifiably cripples the systems, and to do so only serves the purpose of claiming an impossibility by not utilizing available tools.This means that the alleged unprovability in logic, let alone mathematics, of statements otherwise decided true is false, and the statements can thus easily be shown to harbor contradictions and accordingly constitute paradoxes, rather than be part of an assumed consistent system. Regarding the above capitalized sentence, the argument advanced can be put as follows.If the statement were provable then its negation,\\"THE STATEMENT IS PROVABLE\\",would also be provable, since that is what the provability would mean, and if this negation were provable then the original statement would also be provable, since the negation says so (p.99 in the book, in different words).Then it is argued (p.100) that since \\"if a formula and its...negation can both be derived in some formal calculus [deductive system], then the calculus is not consistent\\", it follows that if it is consistent, \\"neither the formula...nor its negation can be demonstrable\\".(This is said to make the formula \\"undecidable\\", which interestingly supposes the system consistent, in saying, p.101, \\"that an undecidable formula can be constructed within [it]\\". Here we see another pitfall of \\"formal\\", i.e. meaningless, systems. It is somehow thought that if they comply with grammatical rules, there is no problem. But grammatical sentences can in meaning be contradictory.)It is further argued (pp.101-2) that one of the above capitalized statements must be true, and since the initial one was found \\"undecidable\\", namely to have \\"no proof inside [the system]\\", it is the true one, by asserting that unprovability.It is finally reemphasized that this was not deduced \\"from the axioms and rules of a formal system, but by a meta-mathematical argument.\\"But those axioms and rules, unlike contended, easily accommodate the logic, which is quite common. That neither of the above capitalized sentences is provable because it implies the other follows by the \\"law of contradiction\\"; that one of them must presumably be true follows by the \\"law of excluded middle\\"; and that it is the initial sentence which is true, since just found unprovable, can be said to follow by the \\"law of identity\\". Thus the unprovable sentence is contradictorily proved via the well-known \\"laws of thought\\".As indicated, the sentence is correspondingly internally contradictory and can be added to other paradoxes, rather than be proclaimed true and unprovable."},{"Title":"Godel's proof,","review":"As the reviewer below, I too am a medical student/mathematican.

Be forewarned it will only be comprehensible to logicians and gifted medical students like me."},{"Title":"Godel's proof,","review":"This is a remarkable book. It examines in considerable detail Godel's proof, a mathematical demonstration noted for its difficulty in its novel logical arguments. The chapter topics - the systematic codification of formal logic, an example of a successful absolute proof of consistency, the arithmetization of meta-mathematics - appear almost unapproachable. And yet, Ernest Nagel and James R. Newman have created a delightful exposition of Godel's proof. I actually read this book in one sitting that took me late into the night. I simply didn't want to stop; it is really a good little book.Godel's proof is not easy to follow, nor easy to grasp the full implications of its conclusions. Many mathematical texts, overviews, and historical summaries avoid directly discussing Godel's proof as these quotes indicate: &quot;Godel's proof is even more abstruse than the beliefs it calls into question.&quot; &quot;The details of Godel's proofs in his epoch-making paper are too difficult to follow without considerable mathematical training. &quot;These theorems of Godel are too difficult to consider in their technical details here.&quot; Such is the common reference to Kurt Godel's milestone work in logic and mathematics.In their short book (118 pages) Nagel and Newman present the basic structure of Godel's proof and the core of his conclusions in a way that is intelligible to the persistent layman. This is not an easy book, but it is not overly difficult either. It does require concentration and a willingness to reread some sections, especially the second half.&quot;Godel's Proof&quot; begins with an explanation of the consistency problem: how can we be assured that an axiomatic system is both complete and consistent? The next chapter reviews relevant mathematical topics, modern formal logic, and places Godel's work in a meaningful historical context. Following chapters explain Hilbert's approach to the consistency problem - the formalization of a deductive system, the meaning of model-based consistency versus absolute consistency, and gives an example of a successful absolute proof of consistency.The plot now begins to twist and turn. We learn about the Richardian Paradox, an unusual mapping that proves to be logically flawed, but nonetheless provided Godel with a key to mapping meta-mathematics to an axiomatic deductive system. (I forgot to explain meta-mathematics; you will need to read the story.) And then we learn about Godel numbering, a mind boggling way to transform mathematical statements into arithmetic quantities. This novel approach leads to conclusions that shake the foundations of axiomatic logic!The authors carefully explore and explain Godel's conclusions. For the first time I began to comprehend Godel's fundamental contribution to mathematics and logic. I am almost ready to turn to Godel's original work (in translation), his 1931 paper titled &quot;On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems&quot;. But first, I want to read this little book, this little gem, a few more times."},{"Title":"Godel's proof,","review":"I read Godel's paper in grad school. I wish I had read this first, because it lays out the structure of the argument clearly. N&amp;N are particularly good on clarifying what Godel did and did not prove. This is important because of all the loose mystical obfuscation out there about this theorem.N&amp;N clearly explain what formal &quot;games with marks&quot; methods are, and why mathematicians resort to them. They then walk through what Godel proved, with a bit on how he proved it. The basic idea of his (blitheringly complex) mapping is explained quite well indeed.Suitable for mathematicians, or philosophy students tired of mystical speculations. Also goo for anyone with an interest in computability theory or any formal logic. And read it before you read Godel's paper!"},{"Title":"Godel's proof,","review":"Simply magnificent. This book meets and exceeds the description on its back cover -- offering &quot;any educated person with a taste for logic and philosophy the chance to satisfy his intellectual curiosity about a previously inaccessible subject.&quot; This book gives anyone with the interest and the motivation a solid, if not complete, understanding of the ideas underlying the proof. While it's true that someone very unfamiliar with mathematics (or, more importantly, with logic and mathematical thinking) would not get as much out of the book, it does a very good job of walking the reader through G&ouml;del's complex but breathtakingly elegant reasoning. I wholeheartedly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Godel's proof,","review":"Any mathematician or philosopher who has an interest in the foundations of mathematics should be familiar with Godel's work.A mathematician reading GP may long for a more rigorous accounting of Godel's proof but GP is still an excellent exegesis because of how nicely it paints Godel's theorem in broad strokes. A more technical account can be found in Smullyan's book on Godel's Theorem, which is published by Oxford.Lazy philosophers and laypeople will appreciate this book and should definitely purchase and read it before delving into a more complicated account of Godel's incompleteness theorems.In sum, this book is clearly written and probably the most elementary introduction to Godel's theorems out there.As for those of you reading this review and wondering just what's important about Godel's theorem, here are some of its highlights:1) Godel's work shows us that there are definite limits to formal systems. Just because we can formulate a statement within a formal system doesn't mean we can derive it or make sense of it without ascending to a metalevel. (Just a note: Godel's famous statement which roughly translates as &quot;I am not provable&quot; is comprehensible only from the metalevel. It corresponds to a statement that can be formed in the calculus but not derived in it, if we assume the calculus to be correct.)2) Godel's famous sentence represents an instance of something referring to itself indirectly.3) Godel's method of approaching the problem is novel in that he found a way for sentences to talk about themselves within a formal system.4) His proof shows to be incorrect the belief that if we just state mathematical problems clearly enough we will find a solution.Godel's theory is somewhat esoteric; there just aren't that many math and philosophy majors out there and there are even fewer people who have a relatively solid grasp of the proof, even at a macro level. If you want to learn about one of the most interesting and impressive intellectual achievements of the 20th century, I highly recommend you get this book."},{"Title":"Godel's proof,","review":"I had read \\"On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems\\" By the mathermatician himself and then found Ernest Nagel's \\"Godel's Proof\\" nearly by accident. The titles of the work are examples of the main diffeernce of the two: the latter is far more simple and comprehensible. Diving right into Goedels work with a some decent understanding of mathematics and a thourough reading of \\"Principia Mathematica\\" by Russel and Whitehead, I thought I would be able to handle it. I was able to comprehend Goedel but found it gave me a headache to read more than a few pages at a time. Getting through after far too many hours and little true understanding. It seemed that while I could grasp the concepts I wasnt so clear on the subtlties of Goedel's theorem. I was more than happy to read Nagel's Work which is very approachable and exemplifies the important points that the average person might breeze through in Goedel's work. This being said the work of Nagel should be considered an introduction to Goedel's work and both have their place as excellent works.I would recommend that everyone who is interested in the philosophical and mathematical implications of the incompleteness theorem read this work and keep it on hand as they attempt Goedel. I find that people seem to get the basic idea of incompleteness but overextend or misunderstand its reach in life and in meaning. The theorem itself is among the most interesting mathematics and it is a philosophically profound idea that people at large dont grasp since the system of mathematics appears to work well in nearly all situations. This book will be enjoyable and easy to understand even if you dont have a degree in mathematics so long as you tkae it slow but understnading of the Principia and mathematical philosophy is key to getting the most out of this.Ted Murena"},{"Title":"Godel's proof,","review":"It gives me the same feeling after reading &quot;Brief History of Time&quot;. They both explain some very fundamental thing in Science in layman's term. But the difference from &quot;Brief History of Time&quot; is that I can fully understand what the authors are trying to convey.The footnotes are very helpful in clarifing the terms and concepts used in the main body. I would suggest you not to skip those valuable footnotes.The whole book is not hard to understand, although you may have trouble reading Section 7: Godel's Proofs. But just go slowly (don't pause in the middle, otherwise you may forget what a particular symbol means) and everything is fine. This Section is the most exciting part of the whole book.As a Math Grad, this book makes clear to me some concepts that I was not so sure before. One of these corrected concepts is: Godel only ruled out the possibility of getting a proof of consistency within arithmetic. So there is still a hope (though quite unlikely) of finding the proof not representable in arithmetic. See the last section of the book for details."},{"Title":"Godel's proof,","review":"This is an excellent summary of Godel's main ideas. If you want to understand Godel's proof in less than 100 pages, look no further."},{"Title":"Godel's proof,","review":"This is an excellent book. No nonsense, no cute metaphors (except one involving supermarkets. But one is excusable!) Douglas Hofstadter's &quot;G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach&quot;, though entertaining, tended to rely on obscure (and interminable) form-content interplay to illustrate its points. &quot;G&ouml;del's Proof&quot; sticks to the facts and gets you there in a few hours."},{"Title":"Godel's proof,","review":"In 100 lucid and highly readable pages, presents the most important ideas of modern logic: axiomatisation (Euclid), formalization (Hilbert), metamathematical argumentation, consistency, completeness, etc., leading up to Godel's incompleteness result. Elementary from a technical point of view, but technical people should read it to get perspective. Non-technical people will appreciate its workmanlike, substantive exposition, in contrast to the mysticism, obfuscation, and cuteness of a &quot;Godel, Escher, Bach&quot;. It is old (1958) and very incomplete (no set theory, no computability, no non-standard analysis, ...), but still essential reading.(I wrote this review in 1998, but Amazon doesn't know I'm the same person as macrakis@alum.mit.edu.)"},{"Title":"Godel's proof,","review":"Early in the second decade of the twentieth century, Bertrand Russell and Alfred Whitehead published their monumental work \\"Principia Mathematica\\". In it, they claimed to have laid out the mathematical foundations on top of which the demonstration of all true propositions could be constructed.However, Kurt G&ouml;del's milestone publication of 1931 exposed fundamental limitations of any axiomatic system of the kind presented in \\"Principia Mathematica\\". In essence, he proved that if any such axiomatic system is consistent (i.e., does not contain a contradiction) then there will necessarily exist undecidable propositions (i.e., propositions that can not be demonstrated) that are nevertheless true. The original presentation of G&ouml;del's result is so abstract that it is accessible to only a few specialists within the field of number theory. However, the implications of this result are so far reaching that it has become necessary over the years to make G&ouml;del's ideas accessible to the wider scientific community.In this book, Nagel and Newman provide an excellent presentation of G&ouml;del's proof. By stripping away some of the rigor of the original paper, they are able to walk the reader through all of G&ouml;del's chain of thought in an easily understandable way. The book starts by paving the way with a few preparatory chapters that introduce the concept of consistency of an axiomatic system, establish the difference between mathematical and meta-mathematical statements, and show how to map every symbol, statement and proof in the axiomatic system on to a subset of the natural numbers. By the time you reach the crucial chapter that contains G&ouml;del's proof itself all ideas are so clear that you'll be able to follow every argument swiftly.The foreword by Douglas Hofstadter puts the text of this book into the context of twenty-first century thinking and points out some important philosophical consequences of G&ouml;del's proof."},{"Title":"Bombshell Boobies","review":"Black and white adult graphic novel. Collection of 9 stories.The book has some rather weak chapters and some that are quite good.The first story involves a woman that is almost raped and runs to a male friend's apartment. He likes the disarrayed look and takes advantage of her.The next three stories involve brothers and their girlfriends (connected stories). The first two involve the younger brother catching sight of his brother and girlfriend going at it, and later being seduced by his brother's girlfriend. The third story involves the older brother \\"forcing\\" his brother and his girlfriend to perform in front of him.The next story involves \\"The Secret Love Room.\\" At school a boy and girl learn that both get excited when in close proximity to the opposite sex in an enclosed (or locked) room, including elevators.The next story involves a boyfriend and girlfriend buying clothes. The woman never wears skirts, and the man wants to see her in a mini-skirt. She tries one on in a fitting room with the man in the room. They both get turned on and she instigates action right there.The next two stores are interrelated and involve a newly married teacher. The first story involves some students that visit the teacher's apartment and attack the wife. The second story is a continuation of the first.The last story is titled \\"Private Lessons.\\" A girl works as a tutor, a \\"Private Teacher,\\" and is turned on by one of her students.Somewhat hindered by being black & white, and has some censoring.Women are well-endowed (as are most of the men). Overall, good set of stories, and well-drawn. While the women on the back and front cover are in chains, no bondage occurs in this book."},{"Title":"Bombshell Boobies","review":"Extremely funny. Great artwork. The Pheromones on the Street Corner shorts are great. Recommended for any one who likes a good laugh while reading hentai."},{"Title":"Bombshell Boobies","review":"Okay, I thought this was going to be pretty artwork (books like that exist - though rarely - like Manara's Gullivera). Instead, it's a pretty hum-drum sex book using too many close ups and unimaginatively drawn characters (who are techincally drawn okay but look dull) and quiet gross \\"flying fluids\\" exageration. The stories are the same-ole repressed male fantasy stories you can hear anywhere - although not as original (forbidden fruit gets stale) as some grass-roots stories. Boring. If not stupid. Erotic only to the lame. I own quiet a bit of plain-jane non-erotic mainstream manga and I can only say that there are far better artists with talent both in drawing and layout out there.

There is no mention of a story that could be interpreted as his 'fall from heaven story' in his youth (see my review of \\"in \\"Werner Erhard The Transformation of a Man\\"). At 25 Ken contacted polio & was on wheelchairs from then on & he was able to accept it as a great gift and it disappeared on p.25. In 1970, he met an incarnation of the 3rd Patriarch of Zen on p.86:\\"When thought is in bondage the truth is hidden,for everything is murky and unclearand the burdensome practice of judgingbrings annoyance and weariness....What benefit can be derivedfrom distinctions and separations?...To set up what you likeagainst what you dislikeis the disease of the mind....When the mind exists undisturbed in the Way,nothing in the world can offend,and when a thing can no longer offend,it ceases to exist in the old way.\\"Plus with the 3 Noble Truths of Buddha, he found after 50 year the foundation of a science of happiness on p.90 & turned over his very successful real-estate business to an employee.The GENIUS of Ken can be seen in his invention of \\"TURNOVER\\" bed on pp.20-21 that \\"I devised a bed that would turn me from my back to my stomach or sit me up when I pushed a switch...it could turn two people as easily as one...I was later issued a US patent on it...I wanted to donate the patent to the Veteran Administration, hoping that many hospitalized people could once again live at home with their families...VA official...later sent me a polite letter saying that the VA 'did not buy turnover beds.' I wonder if the Wright brothers were ever sent a letter from the War Department saying it did not buy airplanes! So far as I know. I'm the only handicapped person who has enjoyed this wonderful bed. The patent has expired - and I'd still like to see this invention used to help people.\\"SUPERMAN the actor, please take note, 'turnover bed' is a simpler cause than 'embryonic stem cell research'. because the former doesn't have any side-effect, while the later at the current level of human spiritual development will be a biological atom bomb. Plus anyone like my bed-ridden 80 year-old mom could make good use of a 'turnover bed' and hospitals too.In the Bahamas, Ken experienced enlightenment pp.117-118: \\"As I watched the sun setting into the water. I moved into experiencing my loneliness as caused by my demands - no thoughts of 'wouldn't it be wonderful if I had a partner.' Life was enough. I was enough!\\" for 45 minutes & then he completed his MASTERPIECE \\"The 12 Pathways to Unconditional Love and Happiness\\" & his \\"Handbook to Higher Consciousness\\".In ch. 16 Ken wrote \\"I had learned that the Greek word 'agape' refers to UNCONDITIONAL LOVE...As I become more aware, I found that unconditional love is a central theme in all major religions of humankind. In the Christian Bible. Paul wrote a letter to adherents in Corinth that very clearly defined UNCONDITIONAL LOVE:'Love is very patient and kind, never jealous or envious, never boastful or proud, never haughty or selfish or rude. LOVE DOES NOT DEMAND ITS OWN WAY. It is not irritable or touchy. It does not hold grudges and will hardly even notice when others do it wrong.' \\"In a photo on p.218 with Penny, there in the background is \\"YOUR DEMANDS CREATE YOUR UNHAPPINESS\\" or to put it another way 'the conditions you create or impose generate all your fears and worries'. This is why love unlike fear is unconditional.The seed of what happened later with Penny was already planted on p.151 subtitled \\"Deeper Levels of Honesty\\": \\"My new game was to be totally honest so a woman could perceive what she liked about me and what she didn't like...It was okay for a woman to see me unclothed with no element of glamour. I liked that.\\" Next page was subtitled \\"Criteria for Marriage\\" which in essence is a 'game' or 'demand' or 'condition' on Ken's part.What happened with Penny's part can be glimpsed on p.167 \\"One of the few areas in which I consciously used Living Love methods was in Penny's refusal to share adult films with me. She did not like movies that showed frequent sexual activities. I occasionally enjoyed sensitive sexual movies that were being made for couples to enjoy themselves.\\"In spite of the above Ken still decided to have a marriage ceremony with Penny as his third wife on 9/2/1984. Ken ended his autobiography, written in 1989, with subtitles \\"Loving More - Demanding Less\\" \\"We're Nothing Special\\" \\"Life is My Teacher\\" & \\"The World Is My Mirror\\". Great EPITATH if any.As in \\"Werner Erhard The Transformation of a Man: The Founding of EST\\" biography, written in 1978, there is a common mystery for these 2 delightfully enlightened human beings.Both had a good relationship with their then current spouse in their respective intimate story. Werner with his second bigamous Ellen & Ken with his third wife Penny. Something happened & both of their relationships turned very sour & both ended in a (fiery) divorce?As far I can tell in \\"60 Minutes and the Assassination of Werner Erhard\\", written in 1992, Ellen hates Werner to the point of wanting to destroy his relationships with his kids! Penny even accused Ken of brainwashing her, according to Ken's matchmaker to his 4th young wife before Ken passed away in Dec. 1995. On the inner back flap of his last book \\"Your road map to Lifelong Happiness\\" Ken has a new young wife named Lydia.I'm very happy that Ken met Lydia in the Philippines next and 'had a turbulent but entertaining relationship' and wrote his last book on UNCONDITIONAL LOVE till - THE END."},{"Title":"Tunable Laser Optics","review":"Tunable Laser Optics is a fairly comprehensive review that can be used as the main textbook for an advanced undergraduate optics course for physics or engineers students. It introduces essential basic tools for understanding the laser physics with a succinct but complete description of the theory of lasers. The optics part of the book is organized in a new way following the 6 principal processes occurring with light: interference, diffraction, refraction, reflection, dispersion, and polarization. This structure of the optics section helps to avoid redundancies often found in standard textbooks. The Dirac notation and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle are used to explain properties of light. This gives a solid mathematical and physical background to solve the optics problems arising in the design and construction of tunable laser optical systems and other optical instrumentation. The book uses the matrix method for the description of propagation of light in systems with lenses, diffraction gratings, and prisms. In summary, Tunable Laser Optics introduces the &quot;warfare&quot; that a student, or an experimentalist, needs to understand for the successful design and construction of tunable lasers and optical devices."},{"Title":"Tunable Laser Optics","review":"The author is the leading world's expert in the field of Tunable Laser Design. Tunable Laser Optics is the first clear and concise presentation of the state of the art for tunable laser. The field is clearly presented and provides a powerful insight into the physics of tunable laser systems. The use of Dirac's notation for the calcualtion of the interference and diffraction efects of the tuning elements proves an elegant and powerful techique for designing tunable laser systems. The complete coverage of the technical area and the easy readable writing style of the author will ensure that Tunable Laser Optics will be a classic reference that will be enjoyed by both students and researchers. I give Tunable Laser Optics my strongest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Twelve-Month Mistress (Harlequin Presents)","review":"The Twelve Month Mistress is an incredible love story.......passionate, sensual, and emotional, one I couldn't put down. It is one of Kate's finest! Her characters come to life in a way not to be missed. It will touch the heart of every woman who reads this truly amazing story of Joaquin and Cassie. I can't wait for the next book in the trilogy, Ramon's story.Joaquin Alcolar is the oldest and only legitimate son of Juan Alcolar, a Spanish aristocrat. He has spent most of his life mistrusting relationships destroyed by his father's unfaithfulness. Joaquin is a \\"Lone Wolf\\". . Being in charge of his vineyard business has taught him how to wear a mask, not allowing him to show his true emotions Love is not in his vocabulary and he's never kept a mistress for more than a year.Cassie is his current mistress and deeply loves Joaquin. However, she is afraid she will be sent packing and questions whether to stay or leave. She is quoted saying \\"is it worth staying in a situation that is just not making you happy?\\" She has a \\"hungry need for this man\\" and is vulnerable where he is concerned. Cassie loves and adores him and is putty in his hands. She has trouble being honest with Joaquin about her feelings and what she wants from the relationship. She's fearful of being cast out and rejected.So when the end of the year approaches, she decides to leave, to keep hold of her pride.Upon Cassie's leaving, Joaquin has an accident and Cassie is forced to return home to take care of him. From there, one complication after another and she is now back where she started, more confused and emotional..Throughout the book, both characters explore their feelings concerning their relationship. Joaquin doesn't understand not always being in control, not knowing where he is headed nor why he feels so different about Cassie over his past mistresses. His emotions are out of control where she is concerned. He feels she is \\"his woman\\", what he owns he controls. He runs his life with discipline and nothing happens without his approval.

I didn't hate this book, but frankly, I really didn't like it, either. In a word, it was boring. The couple was already together and the major conflict was that the characters had major communication problems. The reason I bought the book was because the amnesia part of the book sounded interesting (not that I haven't seen that plot device before), but it didn't actually happen until about half-way through. Honestly, the plot just wasn't that original, and the characters weren't loveable enough to save it.

One of the latest reprinted novels is &quot;Power of Three,&quot; a unique story about three very unusual siblings, and the Moor that is under attack.The leader of the mound of Garholt has three children. Eldest Ayna has the Sight, and youngest Ceri has the Gift of Finding AND the Gift of Thought. The middle child, Gair, considers himself extremely ordinary, and tries to become wise and skilled to make up for his lack of extraordinary gifts. Gair isn't as ordinary as he had thought, but his secret talents lie hidden until a disaster falls.Long ago, their uncle Orban killed a Dorig (a water-dwelling reptilian creature) for its golden collar, and the Dorig's brother laid a curse on everyone. Now the Dorig invade the mound when the chief is out on a hunt and the three kids manage to escape, taking refuge with the Giants (who are apparently ordinary human beings). They learn that they're running out of time -- the Moor will soon be turned into a lake, driving out the Giants and killing the Moung People and Dorig, unless they find a way to stop it.&quot;Power of Three&quot; is in some ways a much darker book than many of Jones' others. There are more complex issues about morality and ethics. Not to mention the enviroment, and the question of what makes a person special. (Even before Gair's gift surfaces, he's considered special for his hunger for knowledge) There's murder, trickery, there are battles (not magical ones either), hostage situations and curses that affect entire populations.Jones gives the Mound People a semi-Celtic flair; the story about how the kids' dad had to win their mom is reminiscent of old Irish legends. The shapeshifting, water-dwelling Dorig are suitably mysterious and alien. Jones fills her story with atmospheric wildlands, cozy British houses and plenty of vivid descriptions.Gair is clearly the center of this book. He's a likable kid, quiet when his rotten cousin isn't taunting him, and more thoughtful than his siblings. Ayna and Ceri are also well-done. The biggest problem is probably Gerald and Brenda. While Jones does a passable job with these two, it takes awhile to warm up to them because we don't get a lot of insight into their thoughts.&quot;Power of Three&quot; is a fast-paced, well-written fantasy adventure, full of strange and mysterious creatures (and a few who are all too familiar). Like just about all of Jones' works, a treat."},{"Title":"Power of Three","review":"I'd be willing to bet that most Diana Wynne Jones fans may have missed this book because on first glance it doesn't seem as exciting as some others of hers. What a mistake, since Diana really shows her craft as a writer in this book. She shows she can do a different kind of book and pull it off as well as any of her more fun, or humorously fanciful books.In many of Diana's books, she works by creating a difficult situation and then piling unexpected situations, images and twists on top. Usually, you wonder \\"what more could possibly go wrong\\" and then something else does--to humorous effect. By the end, you find you've come out the other side and chaos has somehow turned into order--much like a Shakespearean comedy such as \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" or \\"Comedy of Errors.\\"If most of Diana's books are comedies, Power of Three is more like a tragedy. From the moment at the first of the book when an innocent Dorig (sort of a water sprite) is killed, a curse is laid, and revenge is sworn, you know that \\"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.\\"Diana uses intricate plotting to move the story towards the expected climax. Even with happy events, the reader knows that something else lurks behind. The plot works in a unified way to forward the story towards its climax. Each event is exactly right for propelling the story towards its end.The book deals nicely with issues of trust between people, understanding between parent and child, and the effect a small minority can have for good or evil.This is a darker book than many by this author (though it works out nicely in the end), so you may want to try something else if you're looking mostly for free-spirited fun. It's moodier, more \\"realistic,\\" has less whimsey, and more suspense than you'd expect.Overall, a very well-crafted book that is something different for the author. I recommend it highly, but you may want to adjust your expectations of Diana Wynne Jones before reading it."},{"Title":"Power of Three","review":"Combining the atmosphere of Celtic folklore with a plot reminiscent of Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\", as well as an intricate plot (including a huge twist halfway through that will completely turn your perception of the story on its head) and likeable characters, \\"Power of Three\\" is one of Diana Wynne Jones's best novels - and so inevitably it is one of her least known.Set on moorlands inhabited by Giants, reptilian Dorig and tribes of warrior-like clans, the first two chapters introduces the rest of the story to come. First, Adara and her bullish brother Orban come across a young Dorig princeling, and Orban demands the beautiful collar around its neck. Refusing, the Dorig places a deep curse upon the collar that will bestow bad luck upon the holder and the surroundings.Chapter two takes place several years later when Adara elopes with the chief of a neighbouring Mound. This reads like a Celtic legend as the hero Gest must perform three impossible tasks concerning riddles, collars, standing stones, Dorig and Giants, and exactly how he manages to accomplish these feats is a mystery that (like the influence of the curse) is explored more deeply in the rest of the book that skips onto the next generation.Gest and Adara's three children are Ayna, Gair and Ceri. Ayna the eldest can answer any question posed toward her, whilst Ceri can not only find anything that is lost but manipulate matter with his mind. Gair however is devastatingly normal, and so considers himself a disappointment to his entire community. But with the evil of the curse winding its way into all aspects of life (including food supply, war with the Dorig, and an unwelcome invasion of relatives into their Mound), Gair finally reaches breaking point and heads for the countryside. Tailed by Ayna and Ceri, the three siblings find adventures with both Dorig and Giants waiting for them, and realisation that the Moor itself is in danger of destruction.In terms of theme and plot, \\"Power of Three\\" may very well be the deepest and most complicated novel for young readers that DWJ has written. Exploring the definition of humanity, the worth of the individual and the necessity for peace at its core, the book also has plenty of humour, quirky characters and intricate subplots - far too many to properly explain in a simple review. But it is worth saying that this book in particular has a range of interesting and vivid characters - from saintly Adara, woebegone Gerald, bossy Brenda, spoilt Ceri, sage-like Ayna and the odious Ondo. But the spotlight mostly falls on Gair, and he is a protagonist that most will find very easy to relate to - melancholy and serious, but determined and intelligent, and altogether a likeable guy.The author also makes some wonderful connections between characters - the siblings in particular are warm and affectionate (most of the time) and the friendships that Gair forges within the story are also realistic and enjoyable to read. But then again, DWJ is an expert at portraying human behaviour and it should come as no surprise to any familiar readers that such things are handled just as well here.\\"Power of Three\\" definitely has my recommendation, though I should warn you about reading other reviews on the story, as some of them give away the big twist - something that shouldn't be revealed if you want to truly revel in DWJ's genius."},{"Title":"Power of Three","review":"I have never met a book by Diana Wynne Jones I didn't like.

Don't let the 9-12 age group scare you, because I underestimated the book a bit. It is a great book.It starts with Gair, an unsure boy who's the middle child of Gest, whose other children (Ayna, Ceri) both have gifts. Gair thinks he's a nothing among his two siblings, but one fateful day when the Dorig attack their village and his loved ones are captured, he encounters the giants with his siblings and they end up in the middle of a deal that could put their family in danger. The fate of Gair's village is in his hands, but he supposedly has no gift...The writing is very descriptive, hands down. The emotions in the mind of Gair really symbolize the troubles a child goes through in adolescence. The story really comes together in the end, and a fourth of the time it is told through flashbacks. It starts out as an unfinshed puzzle that you put together as you read on and on. The main character's not corny, like in books like Harry Potter, \\"OH MY GOD! IT'S THE BOY WHO LIVED!! LET'S GO ON FOR ANOTHER SEVEN BOOKS ABOUT HIM AND WRITE IN THE MOST UNORIGINAL MANNER POSSIBLE!\\", Gair is just a brilliant, antisocial lone wolf whose world is literally falling apart. Nobody understands him, that's why he's such a good character and he doesn't whine (like a similar character from Neon Genesis Evangelion, Shinji). The great thing is that Power of Three isn't as stereotypical for a fantasy as you'd expect, it's a bit darker and somewhat more complex.You seriously need to read this if you think that reading sucks, no matter how old you are. Don't base this on the cover art, this is a brilliant piece of original work, not a fake Harry potter takeoff because this was before Harry-mania! It's an epic."},{"Title":"Power of Three","review":"One of the best writers ever, hands down, is Diana Wynn Jones. She must have the most amazing imagination, she comes up with so many new and fresh ideas and her characters are real people. The Power of Three is one of her best books, the premise is marvelous and there is a twist where you suddenly see yourself as seen by the characers and you are rocked. It is also great fun to read, you will finish it and start at the beginning again."},{"Title":"Power of Three","review":"I have long since been a fan of Diana Wynne Jones. I have yet to find a book of her's that I didn't like, however, sometimes you can see re-occuring characteristics in some of her characters. With &#34;Power of Three&#34; I felt a very different voice. It was a little darker than some of her other books of hers I've read, but equally addicting. It's a must read that will keep you guessing."},{"Title":"Power of Three","review":"As the story progressed it got better, but I felt as though the writing style for this book lacked something. Perhaps a younger reader may have enjoyed it more, though I found myself getting lost several times trying to keep straight who was who. Names of characters hard to pronounce as well. I found the it hard to lose myself in the world she was trying to create because their were too many unanswered questions and bad explanations for things."},{"Title":"Power of Three","review":"Definitely one of her best stories.

This is an adventure story starring three siblings, with suspense and surprises, and it also deals with kids bullying, feeling like no one understands you, and parent-child relationships with a light touch that doesn't get in the way of the story. A really great read."},{"Title":"Power of Three","review":"This is by far one of my favorite books by Jones.

Power of Three is one of the best books I've Ever read! It's very captivating and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. It's like you're actually a part of the book! It's the kind of book where you can't help but wonder if there's a sequel.

It seemed rushed, poorly thought out and I was extremely disappointed."},{"Title":"Rorey's Secret (Country Road Chronicles #1)","review":"Although touted as the first book in the \\"Country Road Chronicles\\" series, ROREY'S SECRET will feel more like a follow-up to Leisha Kelly's first three novels, which spin the story of the Wortham family in the Depression years.If you haven't read Kelly's earlier books --- JULIA'S HOPE, EMMA'S GIFT and KATIE'S DREAM --- put this review down now and read them first. In JULIA'S HOPE, we are introduced to Samuel and Julia Wortham and their young family as they come to Illinois during hard times, looking for work and a place to live. Through the generosity of the elderly Emma Graham (EMMA'S GIFT), they find stability of sorts and community on a farm in rural Illinois. KATIE'S DREAM explores issues of trust as the Worthams add another child to their family. The Hammond family, with its multitude of rag-tag children living on a neighboring farm, provides plenty of chaos to keep the story chugging along.ROREY'S SECRET takes place over a few days, but there are plenty of crises. Sam Hammond's wife Thelma arrives at their house with their two-year-old active toddler, Georgie, just in time to go into labor with their second child. The doctor is nowhere to be found (a stock device in so many novels). It's up to Julia to deliver the baby. Meanwhile, 13-year-old Rorey Hammond is up to no good with 18-year-old bad boy Lester Turrey, whose influence bodes ill for the young girl. When the Hammonds' barn and crops go up in flames, Rorey's best friend Sarah Wortham realizes that a secret Rorey has told her could hold the answer as to who is responsible. Samuel Wortham is injured in the fire, and the rest of the story revolves around his recovery (which takes place in an unbelievably short time).Without proof of who caused the fire, the scripture-spouting Franky serves as a scapegoat. He also serves as a Christ-figure, even down to the wounds in both hands and his talent at carpentry, but the allegory is obvious rather than subtle. Franky seems too good to be true, and more dimension in his portrayal would have been welcome.This recent offering in the Illinois family saga shows evidence that the Worthams' story may be wearing a bit thin. The many changes in points of view from chapter to chapter, which worked well in JULIA'S HOPE, seem almost superfluous here --- one wonders if a single narrator could have made for a more powerful read. Kelly has done a good job in earlier novels letting the characters carry the story, but the reliance on too many big crises (childbirth, a fire, a life-threatening injury) too fast, and a father (George Hammond) who seems too gullible and unfeeling to be credible mar this installment.These problems aside, Kelly does a good job examining the response of conscientious children to tragedy (Sarah believes that her father's injury is her fault, since she hid Rorey's secret). Kelly once again also wrestles with the problem of bad things that happen to good people through the character of Julia. \\"Why Lord? Why did this have to happen? Samuel's been so good. And he's gone through so much in his life. It doesn't seem right.\\" Anyone who has watched a good family go through hard times will resonate with her feelings.Readers of the series will enjoy the happy ending that brings various estranged family members back together after years apart. Although this is the weakest of the four books in the series, Kelly's loyal readership will enjoy catching up with the lives of the characters.--- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby.

One woman harbors a disturbing secret about what really caused the fire, yet she is trapped at a crossroads between telling the truth and betraying a promise to a close friend. An emotionally moving story about faith, hard choices, and the healing power of forgiveness unfolds. Also recommended are author Leisha Kelly's previous novels, \\"Julia's Hope\\", \\"Emma's Gift\\", and \\"Katie's Dream\\"."},{"Title":"Rorey's Secret (Country Road Chronicles #1)","review":"I love the continuing story of the Worthams and the Hammonds. Helping a large family when they have next to nothing is heartwarming and their creativity is very interesting. There's a lot we can learn about living simply and it definitely shows how important love is. I hope there will be another in the series."},{"Title":"Rorey's Secret (Country Road Chronicles #1)","review":"Though life has been hard during the Depression, Samuel and Julia Wortham have weathered the storms through faith while raising their children. The Worthams believe they are blessed as they and their children have been healthy, they still own their Dearing, Illinois farm, and the two remain very happy with one another and with their children.However, in 1938, disaster strikes at the farm of their close friend and neighbor George Hammond when a fire destroys much of his property. After the blaze is put out, but not before much damage to the crops and the barn occurs, everyone begins to wonder what caused the inferno. Most people believe Franky Hammond set the fire except teenage Sarah who feels Rorey caused the disaster as they share a secret that both keeps silent about even as their families struggle with a new beginning with only their faith in God keeping them going.Six years have passed since the Great Depression impacted the Wortham and Hammond families (see KATIE'S DREAM, JULIA'S HOPE AND EMMA'S GIFT) and the children in those tales are now adults or teens. However, the message remains the same though told from new perspectives; that when things seem bleak, hopeless, and darkest salvation and solace is with the Lord. The story line is exciting as readers observe varying viewpoints about the fire and its aftermath. Americana Historical Christian readers will enjoy this fine tale of salvation after the brutal test of fire.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Rorey's Secret (Country Road Chronicles #1)","review":"I was really surprised that I liked this book so much. For one, I'd never heard of the author or her other books, and since I got it free for the Kindle, I wasn't expecting much (I wasn't impressed by my previous \\"free limited time promotional offer\\" read). Secondly, I'm not a huge fan of the Christian novel genre: too many seem corny, contrived, and all too predictable.Despite my preconceptions, I really did enjoy this book. The first thing the novel had going for it in my mind was its setting in a historical time period; I do really enjoy historical fiction. Beyond that though, it's just an easy novel to get caught up in. Characters were not cheesily Christian and too-perfect; they were more real than that, messing up, even knowing it, but still struggling to have faith in the belief they proclaimed. I liked how the narrators shifted, as it threw in some unpredictability (especially since the title character Rorey wasn't a narrator until later in the novel, when her secret was already revealed), but my favorite was Juli, who I connected with completely both in her faith and in her struggle to walk in it, trusting completely amidst such stressful circumstances. At first I was a bit lost with the sheer number of important characters, but it ended up being one of my favorite parts of the book: so many twists and turns were possible with so many ages, personalities, and the interactions between them all.I give it five stars, but will share my one bit of \\"constructive criticism\\": the last chapter did seem to wrap things up a bit too quickly. Since it's #1 in a series, I would have preferred it leaving things at a bit of a cliffhanger (which also would have encouraged me to seek out and buy #2 ;-D). As it was, I was a bit disappointed to see a book which was otherwise authentic and unpredictable end up with such an uninteresting point-by-point, matter-of-fact \\"and this happened to Rorey, and this is how Samuel is now, and we wrote letters to Grandma, The End\\".All in all though, a great read... especially if you can get it free on Kindle! Smart marketing for the publisher because this author's other books are now going on my wishlist :-D"},{"Title":"Rorey's Secret (Country Road Chronicles #1)","review":"After the fire almost destroyed all they had, the Hammonds and the Worthams pulled through with the help pf each other. At night a fire broke out at the Hammond's farm. The Samuel and Robert Wortham rushed to help out. In an attempt to save his animals, one of the Hammond boys ran into the barn. Samuel ran in after him and managed to save his life, but not with out almost killing himself. After managing to put the fire out the whole family of Hammonds plus the others went over to the Wortham's house to house for the night. Rorey Hammond, who actually started the fire with her not supposed to be boyfriend by knocking over a lantern while dancing, blamed Franky, her older brother who wasn't very bright, because her boyfriend, Lester Turrey, said to. As a result, everyone believed Rorey until Sarah told the family about Rorey's secret plans with Lester Turrey. Meanwhile, Samuel wasn't getting better because he suffered from a head concussion, a huge gash in his foot, and possibly broken ribs. In the end everything works for the good and Samuel is fun in no time and the Hammond family pulled together even closer. Rorey's Secret was an exceptional book and worth the read.On reason why this book was so good was because it was very emotional. Some examples from the book are when, one, Franky's dad always got mad at him for no reason and would punish him unfairly and yell at him constantly. Two, Sarah yelled at Rorey until she confessed it was her that started the fire. This was emotional because Sarah and Rorey had been friends for seven years and know Sarah had to set things straight. Three, in the end of the book Samuel's mother, who had a bad reputation of being a drunk, came to visit the family for the first time.Another reason was because the book was full of suspense. One example was when Samuel ran into the barn and came out unconscious and Julia Wortham, his wife, was extremely worried. Another was when Rorey miss treated her brother, Franky, after he followed her to one of her meetings with Lester by placing the blame on him for the fire. The last example was when Rorey and Mr. Hammond didn't talk to or come over to the Wortham's even though all his kids were there.The last reason why this book was so good was because it had interesting characters that told the story from their point of view. One of those characters was Julia Wortham. She was a worried wife and a good hostest. In the book the thing that makes the most interesting was when had over 20 people at her house and they all need special attention. She managed to see to it all but she got next to nothing in hours of sleep and got up the next day ready to the same thing. The other character was Sarah Wortham, Julia's daughter. She was the only one besides her mom who believed him when he said he didn't start the fire, Because Sarah had inside information, she was the one who figured out that Rorey started the fire. The last character is Franky Hammond; the kid who everyone believed started the fire. He was a boy who dropped out of school on account of that he had trouble reading and doing math and other things. He worked with Samuel and was taught by Julia, who was like his second mother. Because he had the learning disability, everyone didn't like him and blamed all their trouble on him.The most important reason why I liked this book was because it was very moving. It was moving to the fact that God could pull all of them through something like that and end in a good note. One reason why was so moving was because everyone had already been through one crisis and hadn't completely gotten through it when they had the fire. Another reason was because Samuel's mother came back to apologize for the way she acted from when he was little and turned her life to the Lord. I recommend this book in the highest regards.H.Wissmann"},{"Title":"Rorey's Secret (Country Road Chronicles #1)","review":"All of the books in this series have been excellent.

Using a familiar and engaging voice, he addresses some of the big questions about science, revealing its true nature to the learned scientist and the novice alike."},{"Title":"The limits of science","review":"Although it begins \\"This is a serious book\\", this is not a serious book. Its first two essays do not even pretend to be serious but are instead concerned with such things as quipping about \\"the incredulous derision\\" with which a modern-day grant-giving body would have greeted \\"a research proposal 'to discover a means of making human flesh transparent'\\" in 1900 (p. 46), and quoting a 17th century Shadwell play on the tension between pure and applied science: \\"When the curtain goes up, Sir Nicholas Gimcrack is seen making froglike swimming movements on the table in his workroom. Does he intend to swim in the water? ... Never, sir; I hate the water. I content myself with the speculative part of swimming and care not for the practical.\\" (p. 8). The third and \\"principal\\" (p. xii) essay at least has serious claims in it, but its arguments are so utterly underdeveloped that it can hardly be called an essay at all. The main claim is that \\"there is an intrinsic, built-in limitation upon the growth of scientific understanding\\" (p. 59), stemming from \\"the Law of Conservation of Information, which runs as follows: No process of logical reasoning---no mere act of mind or computer-programmable operation---can enlarge the information content of the axioms and premises or observation statements from which it proceeds.\\" (p. 79). Medawar's only proof of this law is to debunk a possible counter-argument: if science could reach inductive conclusions of the type \\"all swans are white\\" then the law would be false, for the statement says more than the totality of observations that prompted it. But it is not credible to admit such induction as science (p. 80). For one thing, \\"Our sense of the fitness of things is offended by the idea that an induction such as 'All swans are white' can be corroborated by the discovery in a trash heap of an old black boot, yet so it is: for if all swans are white, if follows logically that all non-white objects are non-swans. If, then, any black object is discovered which anxious scrutiny shows not to be a swan, then we have confirmed a logical prediction from a hypothesis and given ourselves an extra incentive to believe in it.\\" (p. 15). From Medawar's law it apparently follows, in some manner not further explicated, that science cannot answer \\"ultimate questions\\" such as \\"what is the point of living?\\" (p. 66), and that to answer such questions from within science is as impossible as \\"to deduce from the axioms and postulates of Euclid a theorem to do with how to cook an omelet or bake a cake\\" (p. 82). Medawar further maintains that there are no other limits on the growth of science, which he also purports to prove by equally lightweight arguments. For example, increased specialisation is not a problem because \\"There were always sciences and there were always arts, and no one man knew them all---no one man ever had the know-how to make glass, brew beer, dress leather, make paper and cast a bell\\" (p. 71). That Newton did not know how to brew beer is hardly very conclusive proof that pathological specialisation is not detrimental to scientific progress, but that is beside the point: this unserious book proves nothing but is delightful reading all the same."},{"Title":"Nizam Ad-Din Awliya: Morals for the Heart: Conversations of Shaykh Nizam Ad-Din Awliya Recorded by Amir Hasan Sijzi (Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"This an excellent diary of the discourses made by a major early Indian Sufi Master.

I happen to love mysteries, but both as a writer of short stories and one who has studied enough literary fiction to be a bit of a critic and a compulsive editor, I find that my tastes are sometimes too particular to enjoy some of the more popular authors.

I won't name them here, but many of them I just can no longer bear to read because the prose is horridly written or the characters lack any degree of depth with which to hold my interest.This collection has sent me happily off looking for works by the authors.

The TARDIS arrives on an alien world, and Jo heads out into the jungle to seek help. But little does she realise that the fluid sprayed on her by the plants around the TARDIS has infected her...When the Doctor awakes, he goes out looking for Jo. He encounters a party of Thals, one of the two intelligent races from the planet Skaro. They are on this planet, Spiridon, seeking to uncover the plans of their enemies, the other race from Skaro, the Daleks. The Daleks are amassing an army to plunder the Earth and Draconian empires after the war that the Master is trying to provoke begins.If you are familiar with the first Dalek story, you will find much that is familiar in this one. However, compared to most Dalek stories ('The Dalek Master Plan' aside), this one is written on a much bigger scale. It is one of those times when the Daleks truly seem a threat to space faring races, even though they are rather bogged down in this story.Terrance Dicks' adaptation could do with more spark, but given that the characters as portrayed in the original are fairly flat this is possibly no surprise.

There is just something about this book for me, that if I were in Fahrenheit 451 I would introduce myself as \\"I am The Ingoldsby Legends, Myths and Marvels.\\""},{"Title":"The Colditz Story","review":"P.R. Reid was interned in an old Austrian Schloss (castle) in the town of Colditz during World War II. He wrote the first book about his experiences in the camp, and The Latter Days At Colditz describing what happened after he successfully escaped. He effectively describes the colorful and engaging characters he was privileged to meet during what would be a bleak existence to an outside observer. The prisoners of Colditz, deemed dangerous by the Third Reich, were concentrated in this one place deep within Austria. The escape attempts described included tunnels that began in top of the clock tower. A glider (that was never discovered by the Germans) that was built to take off from the rooftops. A tunnel the French built that made so much noise that tunnelling could be heard at all hours of the day and night throughout the castle. These two books are rivetting accounts of life as a prisoner of war."},{"Title":"The Colditz Story","review":"If you ask anyone in Britain to name a German prisoner-of-war camp from World War II, the answer (unless it is \\"don't know\\") will almost certainly be Colditz; few, if any, other camps have achieved anything like the same level of fame. Much of the reason for this lies with this book, the film that was made from it in 1955 and the 1970s television series \\"Colditz\\".The author, Pat Reid, was one of the first British prisoners at Colditz, and he tells the story of his escape from another camp, Laufen, in November 1940, his recapture while trying to make his way to still-neutral Yugoslavia, his detention in Colditz and his eventual successful escape to Switzerland in October 1942. He also wrote another book, \\"The Latter Days\\", telling the story of the camp from 1942 until liberation in 1945.Throughout the book Reid's main concern is the repeated attempts by the prisoners to escape. There must have been thousands of Allied POWs who never attempted to escape, and may never even have thought seriously of doing so, but they were unlikely ever to end up in Colditz. The camp, officially known as Oflag IV-C, was regarded by the Germans as a \\"Sonderlager\\", or \\"special camp\\"; it was also referred to by them as a \\"Straflager\\", or \\"punishment camp\\". Situated in a mediaeval castle in the heart of the Third Reich, it was used to house prisoners- British, Polish, French, Dutch and Belgian- who were regarded as particularly anti-German or who had escaped from other camps before being recaptured. The Germans were determined to house such men in an especially secure, escape-proof camp where the inmates would always be outnumbered by their guards.The prisoners, naturally, were equally determined to prove the enemy wrong about the camp being escape-proof, and there were a number of successful escapes. The German plan was, in fact, self-defeating; by concentrating the most determined and skilful escapers in a single camp they had effectively created a \\"university of escaping\\". Indeed, so keen were the inmates to escape that each nationality had to set up its own \\"escape committee\\" to vet all escape plans and to weed out those judged to have no chance of success.The most striking thing about the book is the ingenuity which the prisoners displayed in their escape attempts. Getting out of the camp itself was only half the battle. The escaper also had to be prepared for a long trek across German or German-occupied territory to the safety of neutral Switzerland, which meant that he had to be supplied with food, German currency, civilian clothing and travel documents. We learn how the prisoners managed to procure or manufacture these items, as well as how they managed to break out of the castle, generally tunnelling, by surmounting the barbed-wire fences, by picking locks or (as was done on more than one occasion) by impersonating a German. The future Conservative MP Airey Neave, later murdered by the IRA, walked out disguised as a Nazi officer and became the first British officer to make a \\"home run\\" back to Britain.\\"The Colditz Story\\" may be a book about men in captivity, but there is nothing depressing about it. It is, indeed, notable for a light-hearted tone, and it is clear that many of the inmates of the castle responded to their situation with a good deal of wit and humour. Despite his evident patriotism and his equally evident detestation of Nazi philosophy, Reid clearly had no bitterness or hatred towards his German captors, whom he saw as men doing a job as professional soldiers. Often amusing, often exciting, this is a highly readable volume of war memoirs."},{"Title":"The Colditz Story","review":"Let us see, when you have a group of proven escape artists, and you don't want them escaping any more, what do you do?Oh, you send them all to the one supposedly secure facility so they can all combine their talents and come up with even more impressive methods and escapes.Pretty much that is a lot of what happened at Colditz, it seems. An excellent look at the ingenuity of some prisoners of the Germans."},{"Title":"The Colditz Story","review":"This book is an excellent description of the life of a prisoner-of-war in Nazi Germany. The ones sent to Colditz were those determined by the Third Reich to be &quot;dangerous.&quot; These include those determined to be (held for future use in bargaining with the enemy) political prisoners, repeated attempts to escape, etc. More than just a description of escape attempts, P.R. Reid describes the psychology of a protracted stay in a prison camp in an extremely candid manner."},{"Title":"The Colditz Story","review":"Many WWII stories are somber, and for many good reasons. That is not the case with TCS; at times, in its humour it sounds more like Hogan's Heroes than real life. Perhaps the guards at Colditz were not nazis but merely Germans caught on something beyond their control. Whatever, they treated British, French and Dutch prisoners quite decently and involuntarily provided them with several opportunities to escape. These are very well told, in a proficient literary style, by Captain Reid, making for a very entertaining reading. The book is also a testament of the prisoners' heroism and their commitment to personal freedom."},{"Title":"The Colditz Story","review":"This is one of the greatest novels concerning escape in World War 2 ever written. It focuses on a series of escapes attempted at the famous fortress prison at the town of Colditz known as OFlag IVC. The massive castle was dubbed 'escape proof' by the Germans, yet hundreds of escapes were attempted. Few succeded, but they proved that the castle wasn't 'escape proof'. Reid's book tells the story about his own experiences, as well as those of others in Colditz Castle. This is a fascinating book and everyone should read it. Also check out the movie 'The Colditz Story' which is based on this book. Also be sure to check out two other very good escape books: 'The Wooden Horse' by Eric Williams, and 'The Great Escape' by Paul Brickhill."},{"Title":"The Colditz Story","review":"This book is written by Pat Reid, a British officer who was captured by the German in the second world war. Colditz is the castle like camp that he was taken to, though only after attempting to escape from another camp. That was the sort of prisoners of war (POW) that Colditz inhabited. He was named escape officer at Colditz, so he has many stories about escapes and escape attempts during the war.Originally I was interested in this book by the familiarity of the name Colditz by a computer game carrying the same name that I used to play as a kid, Escape from Colditz, it was called.I liked reading about all the different kinds of ways that the British, French and Polish (and some other nationalities) came up with. And about how they used some of their time making fun of the Germans. And I liked what Reid wrote about how well the different nationalities worked together. For me there could've been a little bit less people that the book told about, I got confused and did not remember if a certain character had already been introduced earlier. Any world war themed thing reminds me of the fact that it wasn't that long ago, which makes it all hard to believe.For me this book was not an easy or fast read, even though it was only 222 pages long. This book is one that I think I do have to read again one day, and the kind that I might have to read in my mother tongue. I felt that I should've understood even the little things they were doing when planning and making their escapes. I did not enjoy it as much as I believe that I could've because I was bothered in not understanding all. And the book was mostly about the escapes, not about the kind of people there were or what the normal routines were like."},{"Title":"The Colditz Story","review":"\\"The Colditz Story\\" by P. R. Reid, tells the story of Mr. Reid's escapes from German POW camps and attempts to get out of Germany during World War II from his initial capture until he finally succeeded in October 1942. Mr Reid was a captain in the British Army and was captured in June 1940. His book is interesting on several levels ... first, it shows how the escapees initially started out very inexperienced but rapidly became more sophisticated in their techniques, as did their German captors. Second, it touches upon some of the stresses and motivations of the prisoners and how they coped (or didn't cope) with being held captive. And finally, it's a rousing good story, well and often humorously told.The book, first published in 1952, reads like \\"we're on a grand adventure\\" and \\"never say die\\" kind of tale, in keeping with stereotypical British tendency to understate problems and difficulties. Colditz Castle was where the Germans started sending the officers of all nationalities who had attempted escapes from other POW camps or were deemed a threat to Germany. Colditz was considered escape-proof by the Germans, although by concentrating the most active and experienced escape artists in one place, the Germans were also unwittingly creating an \\"escape university\\", whereby the officers held there could compare notes and use their various skills and experience to the best effect.The book itself ends in October 1942 when Mr Reid and another officer reach Switzerland. As an aside, he authored two other books, one dealing with Colditz from the time he escaped until the end of the war, and the second giving full inside story about how the prisoners at Colditz accomplished many of the things that they did, details that he withheld in his earlier books so that they could be re-used by future prisoners.I highly recommend this book. Along with \\"The Great Escape\\" by Paul Brickhill, it's one of the best books I've read about POW camp life and escape attempts by a one of the participants."},{"Title":"The Colditz Story","review":"This book is an easily read, often light-hearted testament to the ingenuity and perseverance of a large group of would-be escape artists during WWII. It reads like fiction, in that it is somewhat superficial and understated. Nowhere does the reader feel the rigors and deprivation of captivity. Does this reflect artistic license, or the British gift of understatement? You be the judge. The book is a triumph nonetheless."},{"Title":"The story of King Arthur and his knights,","review":"This book was well written, but the language was extremely sophisticated. The author wrote the novel in how ,now days,we thought the residents of the Medival Times talked. The overall story wasn't too bad, but not as good as I thought it would be. Although the novel was difficult to read, from what you could make out was truly brought to life. You could tell that Howard Pyle truly has a love for writting; reflected from the content in the novel. This novel would be for anyone with an adventerous soul. This novel truly helped my understanding of the Medival history."},{"Title":"The story of King Arthur and his knights,","review":"I was very impressed with this book...a great read for my 10 year old grandson"},{"Title":"The story of King Arthur and his knights,","review":"I think it would be difficult to find a folk hero, historical figure or group of legends that are better known, have spawned more literature and have had more movies made of them than King Arthur and his legendary Round Table and the Knights and Ladies who were a part of his story. To be frank, I grew up on this stuff, and furtherer more, admit to having been tremendously influenced by these stories when I was younger. In a fashion, they are very much a part of my total make up. I can well remember reading and being read to out of this very rendition. That being said...Howard Pyle first published this work in 1902. This book represents the first volume of Pyle's retelling of the Arthurian Legend. These books, as most of this author's work, were directed toward young people of that time. Do not though make the mistake of considering this work a simple child's story, as it is far more than that. When I was in high school and then college, I ran headlong into Thomas Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur, and like many other young students, when completely numb. Later, I read Baines' rendition, which was of course more readable, but still quite a chore. While these works are certainly worthwhile, and should certainly be read by anyone with the least bit of interest in classical literature, they never-the-less are not easy works. Actually, they are rather difficult and you actually have to work at them. This is good, but sometimes you just want to relax and enjoy a good story. (I often speculate as to just how many people have been completely turned off to classical literature via having been forced to read these old tales when they were young. For those of you who were; a suggestion...try rereading them now. It is amazing what twenty or thirty years will do to your outlook!This offering by Pyle fits that need, both for the younger reader and for the adult. I admit to taking great delight in reading this author's rendition of these old tales and am absolutely thrilled that they are again in print and in such a wonderful edition. The language Pyle uses stays true to the archaic style it was meant to be, yet it is not overwhelming. While the Malory translation is just a kick above G. Chaucer's, it is never the less difficult in this day and age. Pyle has toned things down so that the average reader can read and enjoy without a lap full of arcane dictionaries setting in their lap, yet he has not lost the essence and beauty of the original work.This volume starts with the birth of Arthur and then covers many of the tales concerning the various Knights of the Round Table. We meet Sir Kay, Queen Morgana le Fay, Sir Pellias, Sir Gawaine, the wicked down fall of Merlin; The Lady Vivian, Merlin himself and many, many others. The courtly manners, speech and now long outdated attitudes are all meticulously recorded in a readable manner. Now do beware; this is not a politically correct book by any means. The original basis for the story goes back hundreds of years and Pyle's rendition was, after all, written in 1902. Actually, if this one is read to a much younger child, an adult really should do the reading and offer explanations as to why events were handled in the way they were.This particular volume is of course illustrated by Howard Pyle himself. I must admit that he is probably one of my most, if not the most, favorite of the older illustrators. The pen and ink drawings are so typically Pyle that it is difficult to confuse him with others. The ample illustrations in this volume are all of that style and in fact strongly resemble old wood engravings. Pyle of course was the creator, or at least the inspirational origin of the Brandy Wine School of Illustration, which include some of the best of the past and are still quite influential today.For a pure reading joy, this volume is difficult to beat. I cannot wait to get my hand on the rest of the things.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"The story of King Arthur and his knights,","review":"This is a great version King Arthur.

We follow Arthur during his \\"Sword in the Stone\\" period, then on to adulthood with a nod at the romantic complications that the play/movie \\"Camelot\\" focused on, then later an older Arthur and his followers articulate the legend of the grail (spoofed by Monty Python and reverently presented by a score of other writers).Although 1902 was just past the end of the \\"Decadent\\" movement in English arts and literature, this volume displays no cloying irony or clever design a la Aubrey Beardsley. It was, after all, meant for children, although very small children should have it read to them by an understanding sibling or adult. In fact, what I appreciate most about it is its full-body quality that appeals to me as an adult just as it did as a child.Is calling this tome \\"unabridged\\" a mere marketing ploy? Fortunately not. So many kids' books -- this one included -- have been abridged, then dumbed down, and frequently illustated so profusely that they come across more as a kind of black-and-white Classics Comic than the real thing. And rarely does the book jacket or publishing page admit as much! Of course, I'm not totally averse to abridging a long and challenging work for the sake of the children, and there have been a couple of intelligent shortenings of Pyle's work. But the publishers of this book wisely chose to indicate it is unabridged -- a novel exception these days and a happy one. When we're dealing with cultural history and myth this seminal, it's best not to gloss over the details and the nuances of interpersonal relations that give the Arthurian legend such \\"oomph\\" even today.A note on the quality of the physical book itself: it is extraordinary, really about halfway in workmanship between an ordinary hardbound book meant to mass readership and the much more expensive Folio Society type of book with its art papers and commissioned drawings. THE STORY OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS (Unabridged) has smoothly-trimmed pages, beginning to be a rarity in this age of sloppy, pseudo-deckle cuts. The type font is accessible and attractive and there's enough room to make reading it a pleasure but not so much that it screams \\"Kid stuff.\\" The spine is bound in quarter-round buckram, not synthetic fabric or cardboard. There's even a ribbon marker included. At this price, I doubt any publisher using USA presses could make much of a profit; this version was printed in China. (There are some people who object to buying/receiving made-in-Mainland-China goods, so the potential gift-giver might think about that beforehand.) But for the money -- and even for more money -- you'll never get this kind of quality, both literary and physical.

I read this book aloud to my ten year old daughter and sometimes my wife and we all loved the spirit and adventure. Be aware that this book is not &quot;politically correct&quot; (written in 1903!).

Some have complained of the archaic english, but I love it. It only adds to the magic of Pyle's story. This book is filled with the adventures of noble knights, and it does an amazing job of keeping your interest. Somehow, even after many previous jousts and sword matches, Pyle makes each one more interesting than the last.I also love the \\"moral of the story\\" section he does at the end of most major book divisions. He did not do that in the other Pyle book I have read (The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood), and I very much liked them. In such he made allegories of Excalibur and its sheath (to God's Truth and faith), and does likewise with many things, always wishing to teach to us some truth through his writings about Arthur and his knights. I also loved the oath of the knights of the Round Table:\\"And this was the covenant of their Knighthood of the Round Table: That they would be gentle unto the weak; that they would be courageous unto the strong; that they would be terrible unto the wicked and the evil-doer that they would defend the helpless who should call upon them for aid; that all women should be held unto them sacred; that they would stand unto the defence of one another whensoever such defence should be required; that they would be merciful unto all men; that they would be gentle of deed, true in friendship, and faithful in love. This was their covenant, and unto it each knight sware upon the cross of his sword, and in witness thereof did kiss the hilt thereof.\\"This except, I think, well sums up this book, in which these oaths are held, and if they are not, retribution always follows swiftly. In the land of Camelot, good deeds before God are of highest value, and wicked deeds are always subject to disapproval and punishment."},{"Title":"The story of King Arthur and his knights,","review":"Though nothing in the title or description at Amazon says so, this is an abridged version.

When I glance at my Grail Lore books, his name jumps out at me again and again. Not only is he a wonderful storyteller, he does some of the most amazing illustrations for each tale.Born before the US Civil War in Wilmington Delaware, he was enchanted by storybooks and the drawings such as Grimm's Faerytales and that influence is clear in his books. So Pyle set about in his twenties to pen stories of Pirates, Robin Hood and Arthur and his knight. His love of these tales was brought to bear as he created \\"grown-up\\" storybooks.This is one of my favourite of his works. The illustrations of Arthur, Merline and the Knights of the Table are brilliant. It covers the early tales of Arthur, as his identity was discovered by performing the Miracle of the Sword, then moves on to Arthur's winning of his Queen.

It is a great story of legend. The stories have been passed down for many generations; Howard Pyle has done a great job of keeping the stories alive and well written.

In the beginning of the novel starting with the young King Arthur, before he was the king, telling of how he meet each one of the knights of the round table, and how they came to be at his services. To me that most interesting part of the book was in the beginning when Sir Kay and the other knights where engaged in the battle, the description of the fight, and especially of how Arthur came by the great sword excalibur. The descriptions of not just the first, but of all of the great battles involved in the unfolding of the final story are just great.

I believe they all have something of value in them, even to the very basic or beginning cook...except this cookbook.

Slice the pepper and cucumber and with a little spoon make little balls with the cantaloupe. Yeah, that makes sense. I have cookbooks put together and sold as fund raisers and I really do love the way the average person writes and explains a recipe, but this is just a poorly written waste of your money. If you do happen to find something in the book you want to try, please do not look at the photo! All the photos are grossly over-exposed and of a terrible grainy quality. Gray proscuitto is bad enough, but the photo of the Hot and Sour Soup looks like old dishwater. Then to top if off at the end of this so called 'cookbook\\" there is a recommendation from the \\"author\\" for a book on how to: 'have an unlimited cash flow with out working at all'...can you say info-mercial?? This is the first time I have ever been completely and totally disgusted with a cookbook purchase. I donated it to my neighbor's yard sale.

In this volume, edited by the expert on memory and belief Daniel Schacter of Harvard, we have an innovative interdisciplinary examination into the question of memory, why it fails, and what happens when it does.The volume is divided into the following sections by discpline: 1) Cognitive Perspectives, 2) Psychiatric and Psychopathological Perspectives, 3) Neurophyschological Perspectives, 4) Neurobiological Perspectives, 5) Sociocultural Perspectives, 6)Concluding Reflections.The articles, each by a different contributor, are not the easiest to jump into, especially for those without a scientific background. In fact, the overall emphasis is very much on science with the social sciences rather underrepresented (in my opinion). This is the reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. However, those with a scientific inclination, yet also philosophical or social science inclinations towards questions of identity, autobiography, belief and fantasy will find this book of great interest. I would advise you to also look at the much more recent volume (2000) by Schacter entitled 'Memory, the Brain and Belief', which may in fact be more up to date."},{"Title":"Arcadian Afterthoughts","review":"Before I read this book, I had the advantage of having heard the author read at a book signing in Memphis Tennesee.

I found myself, over and over, nodding my head as I read, captivated by his ability to correlate emotional chaos into peace and understanding.

The book's explanations are quite technical (which is sometimes helpful, especially in the grammar section) but my intermediate-level students all found the practice exercises in the book too easy. The CD-ROM practice tests, on the other hand, were too hard. Some of the Writing section's explanations were good--especially with thesis statements and conclusions--but the Reading section was ridiculously banal. In addition, there aren't enough practice tests, especially in comparison with other TOEFL study materials available on the market. For the price you're paying, you'd be better off buying Longman's Complete Preparation (for intermediate to advanced students), Longman's Introductory Preparation (for beginner students), or Barron's TOEFL book with 8 practice tests."},{"Title":"Kaplan TOEFL CBT W/CD-Rom, 2nd Edition","review":"I not only studied this book, but also took Toefl classes in Kaplan for 6 months and I have to admit that I wasted my money (which was a lot what they took from me) and my time. I scored 187 studying at Kaplan with Kaplan's books and I was not the only person from the Kaplan's courses scoring such an awful low score. Most of the Kaplan students from different nationalities, my classmates of course, scored below 200. I don't know how these Kaplan individuals manage to have customers who fall for it. Moreover, the only excellent thing about Kaplan is their marketing and propaganda about themselves, and the luxurious facilities that help to trick you into their courses, but other than that, it is a lousy teaching approach.I tried to get my money back , or at least part of it, in order to be able to go to study in a decent, honest Institute. But they refused to refund any of it, because they don't give any guarantees of scoring high with their courses.

A lot of practice all are on the CD Rom.2)Grammar is far difficult as compare with any real test and, thus, it is utterly irrelevant. There are a lot of excercises, nonetheless, the section is more like very general overview for those who know English well.

All my friends had actual results better than on Kaplan's CD Rom.If you need practice Delta's Key for the Toefl Test has 10 tests, Cambridge Toefl has 7 tests, and Cliffs has 6 tests.5) There is no virtually any strategy for Essay seection.

I needed 250 on the CBT Toefl. I was advised to attend the best and most expensive prep center, Kaplan Bogota, so I did. I took the TOEFL twice. The first time I scored 207 and the second time 190, very far from the score I needed for my MBA. Seriously, I don't know how could somebody claim to have scored 290 with Kaplan preparation, and even less with this Kaplan TOEFL book that I recently disposed in the garbage. Moreover checking the ETS's statistics for the last 3 years and the standard deviation for Toefl scores, no one has scored above 287. Therefore I find very dubious some reports stated herein. Use common sense and never enroll in a Kaplan course."},{"Title":"Kaplan TOEFL CBT W/CD-Rom, 2nd Edition","review":"I got my TOELF scores today and I was happy to see that I ACED it. +290 on the CBT.

Since I've been in American International Schools K-12 I knew for a fact that American Idiomatic English was not something that would challenge me.My point is, it doesnt matter what book you use, you MUST MASTER ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND IDIOMS. There is NO WAY you will LEARN english in a coupple of months with books. All these books do is help you become familiar with the TYPES of questions. Certainly, Kaplan did a good job with that.

This is a must have for urban-based scenarios."},{"Title":"Blank Check: The Pentagon's Black Budget","review":"Blank Check is a meticulously researched and chilling account of how the Cold War led the nation into a frenzy of spending based on fear and propaganda. The book spans 40 years of government development and National crises from the viewpoint of a checkbook. However, the fact that the book was published before the fall of the Soviet Union means that, to a modern reader, the stories told are a frightening look at times gone by rather than a relevant commentary on modern life. Also, with no central character to latch onto the book, while conscience stirring, is not necessarily compelling. That said, revelations in this book about the government's outright violation of the constitution in the name of National Security still have the ability to leave a reader appalled."},{"Title":"Blank Check: The Pentagon's Black Budget","review":"I admit, I read the book about 2 years ago, but, I will remember the hard cold facts. The American public is so misinformed about how the miltary is spending our money. It is very disturbing to find out what I thought was true. Blank Check, opened my eyes a lot wider. Did you ever really think the government was honest with us and congress? Don't believe it."},{"Title":"Blank Check: The Pentagon's Black Budget","review":"I know the author personally, from his time as the New York Times investigative journalist responsible for covering the US national and military intelligence programs, and I consider him one of the most balanced, thoughtful, and well-intentioned reporters in the intelligence field.His book remains very, very important because the Pentagon is in the process of reconstituting the \\"Yellow Fruit\\" organization, with the same blank check black budget, and the same mind-sets that previously led to enormous ineffectiveness, waste, and some outright corruption and theft of government funds. Known as Gray Fox, this new incarnation of Yellow Fruit has Richard Secord, one of the leaders or the Iran-Contra scandal for which several top personalities were indicted and some convicted, as a primary player.Tim Weiner's book is important, it is relevant, and it should be read by those responsible for the oversight of military intelligence budgets and capabilities--and by citizens who might wish to question their elected representatives on this important topic."},{"Title":"Blank Check: The Pentagon's Black Budget","review":"What i love about this guy is that he digs up real dirt without getting into conspiracy theories. I wish he would do an update of this book as I'm sure the black budget has gotten way more intense in the past 10 years. I also strongly recommend legacy of ashes. Don't just read this book, pass it on to someone else when you're done."},{"Title":"Blank Check: The Pentagon's Black Budget","review":"Fantastic book and interesting how useful reading an \\"older\\" investigation of the defense department black budget and associated misappropriations/abuses can be in easily tying the very same ethical/strategic defense issues to the more recent \\"Spies for Hire\\" by Tim Shorrock (also a fantastic read).The similarities regarding decades long ethical issues with regard to the lack of oversight within black budget is almost overwhelming while simultaneously intriguing and disheartening: no concrete evidence, whatsoever, that Congressional or other government oversight of black budget operations or DoD contracting, in general, has improved. In fact, following 9/11 the situation, if anything, financial and ethical accountability has actually degraded.This timeless, still-compelling book provides that much-needed historical perspective yet also begs the question: over the next 10 or 20 years is there any reason to believe money will be spent, appropriately, to truly and measurable advance US National Security with concrete accountability for those instances where projects and leaders fail to act responsibly...at great expense to the American taxpayers actually undermining US defense and war fighter readiness?"},{"Title":"Blank Check: The Pentagon's Black Budget","review":"Ever since I read Tim Weiner's brilliant book on the FBI's history, called 'Enemies', which showed clearly how the FBI has been operating outside the law since its inception with the support of various Presidents, all the way from FDR to George.W.Bush, I decided to read the other two investigative books by him - one on the Pentagon and the other on the CIA.'Blank Check' is his book on the Pentagon and it was written in 1990. Though I read it 22 years later now, it still feels very current because the secrecy and deception that Weiner has talked about does not seem to have gone anywhere. We see the same practices in dealing with the Guantanamo Bay inmates and in the war in Iraq.This book is about the Black budget of the Pentagon. The term 'black budget' itself was new to me till I read this book. To those who are like me, a black budget is a budget that is secretly collected from the overall income of a country and spend it on expenses related to military research, clandestine operations of the intelligence, assassinations overseas, destabilization of foreign govts and such dubious activities by the US government. The budget is kept secret from Congress and the public for national security reasons. Wikipedia says that the Pentagon's estimated black budget as of 2009 is $50 billion. That is about $138 million everyday!Weiner traces the history of the Black budget by saying that the US simply did not get itself out of the 'War mentality' after the end of the second world war. Cold War replaced the World War and kept the nation in a 'war mentality'. Though the book covers only up to 1990, we know that the 'war on terror' has replaced the Cold War now and is still continuing.Weiner says that the Manhattan project in the 1940s to produce the atomic bomb created the culture of the government doing things outside the scrutiny of Congress and the public and laid the foundations of the Black Budget. Money was allocated by the DoD for the Manhattan project from a Black budget. Gradually during the execution of this project, extraordinary secrecy with regard to accountability became acceptable. After the Korean War in the early 1950s, the Pentagon allocated vast sums of money to an outlandish project of winning a Nuclear war in future. It was supposed to be executed with robot soldiers, satellites and computers and the US was to prevail over six months after the destruction of much of civilization. The Pentagon allocated billions for the development of MILSTAR, which is a constellation of communication satellites in geostationary orbit for this project. The development of the Stealth bomber also was part of this nuclear strategy.The other areas where the black budget played a big role was in covert operations by the CIA and the Pentagon in various civil wars where the communists and the Arabs were involved against US interests. Money flowed to the contras in Nicaragua, to the Iranians and the Saudis in exchange for routing arms to Afghanistan and the contras. Money also was sent to the Chilean Army to destabilize Salvador Allende's elected government in 1973. Then there was the project Yellow Fruit, which was a secret army inside the Army which ferried undercover Army operatives to Honduras, where they trained Honduran troops for bloody hit-and-run operations into Nicaragua. It broke the laws of this country and landed its progenitors in trouble after they squandered $325 million in this venture. As if all this sordid drama was not enough, there was fraud, theft, corruption and kickbacks during all these operations, which I suppose, is inevitable.The book is well researched and the author raises serious questions about our democracy and the veil of secrecy that our governments have cast over many of its operations against the laws of this land and the Constitution. Many of our revered Presidents like FDR, Eisenhower and Reagan have been responsible for breaking the law time and again and appropriating taxpayer's money for activities which are unaccounted for. Nixon, Carter and Johnson fare no better either. The book also makes the point that the Stealth Bomber finally is a white-elephant, costing almost a billion dollars per plane and still being vulnerable to Russian long-range radars.The book shocked me deeply as it makes one question the rule of law in this country and the immunity with which the powerful people get away with breaking the laws of the land. In 2008, we saw that it is not just the Pentagon, but Wall Street too has the same immunity. There is the poignant chapter at the end of the book where the author details the case of an ordinary citizen, William Richardson, who took on the US government as a taxpayer challenging the state which functioned outside the limits of the Constitution. Unfortunately, Richardson lost the case. Still, it is important that every concerned citizen must read this book and absorb its lessons in the interests of democracy."},{"Title":"Blank Check: The Pentagon's Black Budget","review":"This excellent book should be read by every USA taxpayer, civilian and military. Mr. Weiner, with an excellent bibliography, tells it like it is. Without barriers, he gives historical, verifiable--if you desire--facts on the irresposible mechanisms used by USA presidents to advance an empire through the throats of many countries--beginning with the USA itself, and justify murders, lies, frauds, thefts, violations of the USA Constitution, through the military and paramilitar civil agencies such as the CIA, based on the very doubtful and euphemistic principle that almost anything is a threat to USA national security. Excellent book. Written almost 20 years ago it is as updated as if it had been written yesterday."},{"Title":"Edgar Allan Poe (American writers series)","review":"this is a good collection for younger readers who have not been intoduced to poe- there are side notes that define the out-of-date words and a summary at the beginning of each story excert/poem.

The much misunderstood author is given a fair look in this 50 minute overview. They bring us the sad, broken Poe, stumbling through lectures and readings, but they also show us a good man who loved literature and wanted to succeed as a writer.Any student of Poe has been inundated with macabre, morbid tales of involving dead women, drug abuse and affairs. What is disregarded by early biographers are the facts between the tales. He crafted stories with careful excellence, depending on technique, and not the lack of sobriety. He drew from his personal life, but also fabricated complex fantasies that became the model for Stephen King, Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie and others. His poetry caught the attention of European greats like Charles Baudelaire and Mihaly Babits, who, in turn, translated Poe's works for the world.We see where Poe lived an, and hear not only from his literary works, but his letters and the writings of those who knew him. We are able to attain a sense that Poe was not a monster only brooding in his woes, but a family man who longed to remain with Virginia, who lived with, as he wrote in \\"Annabel Lee,\\" \\"no other thought than to love and be loved by me.\\"The affect of the tragedies which surrounded him are explored, from his poor relationship with his adoptive father to the many deaths of loved ones, lost to tuberculosis. Many men would have been enfeebled to write, but Poe took his sadness and expressed it as literary art.I fully recommend \\"Biography - Edgar Allan Poe.\\" His life has the legendary elements of scandal and addiction, but to know Poe better, it is important to learn beyond the cliches like \\"master of the macabre.\\" This video does that.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"Edgar Allan Poe (American writers series)","review":"When read by Basil Rathbone, these Poe stories are better heard than read -- if that is possible.

My favorite is the poem called \\"The Raven.\\" Some of the poems are a bit scary, and there are some scary pictures. I would recommend it for ages 8+. There are also poems that you can't find in any of Poe's books because they are shortened versions of larger, unabridged poems. Also, some of the poems have to do with death.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Edgar Allan Poe (American writers series)","review":"I cannot think of a better way to introduce the poetry of Edgar Allen Poe than this small volume. The selection is excellent and of interest you the young reader. The commentary is quite relevant as are the pictures which accompany it. I find that often now, our young people go all the way through the early grades in school and many of them have never heard of Poe, much less read his poetry. This was the sort of stuff my generation and the generation before it grew up on and cut our teeth on. I do not feel I am any worse for the wear. I am fearful that we are bringing up an entire generation (rightfully or wrong, although I feel it is the later) of young folks who will have no appreciation to this great art form and will miss a lot. This book helps. This entire series helps, as a matter of fact and I certainly recommend you add this one and the others to your library. Actually, it is rather fun reading these with the young folk and then talking about them. Not only do you get to enjoy the work your self and perhaps bring back some great memories, but you have the opportunity to interact with your child or student. It is actually rather surprising what some of the kids come up with. I read these to my grandchildren and to the kids in my classes at school. For the most part, when I really get to discussing the work with them, they enjoy it.

What I liked most about this book was its variety. I've never cared much for minor league baseball, and I've never even heard of fantasy baseball, but this book did a great job exploring both. I actually understand what a fantasy league is now, and I was convinced that I should see a minor league game next year.I am a huge baseball history buff, so that section of the book was a real winner for me. This book takes a great look at both the legal and economic timelines of baseball, while at the same time listing some of the sports finer moments on the field. This was a great combination that I haven't found in any other book.The epilogue also contained some great insight. I share the same opinion as a number of the members of the special focus group that was asked the question: \\"What will you do if there is no MLB next year?\\" This question brought to the forefront of my mind the disgust I currently feel toward the competitive imbalance in the game. However, the book as a whole really did as the authors claim, and helped me remember why I truly love the game."},{"Title":"Stranded: A Guide to Life Without Major League Baseball","review":"Although I didn't appreciate the book slamming my Yankees, (I'm a life-long Yankees fan) I greatly appreciated the history section. I lived through a number of the events discussed, and I remember things like Curt Flood and the reserve clause, but before reading this book I didn't fully understand the impact of such events. The book did a great job of providing a readable synopsis of a number of elements that shaped baseball as it is today.The fantasy league section has a little over my head, but I can see how the most hardcore fans would appreciate it. I used to spend countless hours as a youth playing dice baseball, so the video game and simulation section really brought back memories.I would recommend this book to every baseball fan. It can be read in one sitting, and it's actually kind of hard to put down if you are a true fan of the game."},{"Title":"Las Rubias de 5th Avenue (Spanish Edition)","review":"Yes, I had the same problem and it is not mentioned anywhere that it is in Spanish until you get in your hands.

When I went to a lecture by the Reverend Mr Fox on &quot;creation spirituality&quot; at the local University, it was interested to see tables set out outside the lecture theatre selling his books with a merry jingling of cash-registers. No prizes for guessing what it reminded me of. Who:whom? Lenin was wont to ask. In this case; who got the money? And how does this alleged apostle of anti-capitalism get the wherewithal to travel the world promoting his ill-written and error-filled books? Hardly &quot;religious right&quot; questions but worth thinking about. As for the actual intellectual content of the work, it is beneath criticism but not beneath a proper contempt."},{"Title":"Creation Spirituality: Liberating Gifts for the Peoples of the Earth","review":"Matthew Fox has &quot;rediscovered&quot; mystical Christianity, which celebrates the &quot;Christ&quot; present in all of creation. Such mysticism was a significant movement within Christianity during the Middle Ages, but it was effectively silenced by the centralized Church and then ignored when enlightenment ideologies favored much more reductionistic, as opposed to mysticism's more holistic, thought. Fox astutely notes that the same worldview expressed by mystical Christians has also been appreciated by Jewish and Muslim mystics, and by aboriginal peoples. He is particularly drawn to Native American traditions. Fox suggests, I think correctly, that spiritualities that focus on personal salvation with little regard for the rest of Creation tend to be spiritually unfulfilling for the undividual and destructive for the world."},{"Title":"Creation Spirituality: Liberating Gifts for the Peoples of the Earth","review":"For those looking for a spirituality that is positive and all embracing, vursus one which is exclusive and judgemental, this is the place to start. Matthew Fox introduces the reader to ideas and themes that are more fully developed in his book &quot;Original Blessing&quot;. Original Blessing v. Original Sin is one such theme. Others are the Four Paths of Creation Spirituality, art as meditation, liberation for First World peoples, and the return of true Trinitarian Christianity.Bottom line: Matthew Fox puts forward a Christianity that is a beautiful relection of Jesus the Christ and shows how such a Christianity can help to heal the world."},{"Title":"Creation Spirituality: Liberating Gifts for the Peoples of the Earth","review":"For those of you who dont't know,Matthew Fox is the only man who dares to find the connections between seemingly conflicting dogma. He is the freshest voice. He is a true Christian- one who loves, who accepts, one who ministers. The hate ridden religious right has a lot to learn from Matthew Fox.Jesus never hated anyone. Creation Spirituality is a good primer for the next millenium"},{"Title":"Creation Spirituality: Liberating Gifts for the Peoples of the Earth","review":"Have you ever looked at the Moon with a pair of binoculars? Or at the rings around Saturn with a telescope? Or thought about a Hummingbird flying to Central America? Or saw in a flower the rays of the sun, the minerals of the earth, the awareness of day and night?Jesus was not fixated on any one aspect of reality. He was not a religious fundamentalist. Jesus was a mystic that was so awestruck by the Cosmos that he gave his life for all life. God is no respecter of persons. God is not isolated by anything or anyone. God is a part of everything. God is omnipresent. Everything has value. Everything is worthy of honor. Not just mankind. A shephard without a flock is superfluous. Though each aspect of reality has its role none is above the other for everything is interconnected. We do not have to climb a ladder to get to God. God is within as well as without. Heaven is beneath our feet.Creation theology is a glass is half-full perspective. A holistic perspective. A fresh start. Hopeful. Original Sin theology tends to be a glass is half-empty perspective. A narrow perspective. A dead-end. A never ending dark night of the soul. With that said; Pope John Paul II turned original sin upside down with his affirmation that there is no evil from which God cannot draw forth a greater good. John Paul had the heart of a lion and the eyes of an eagle. He was fearless and could see a blade of wheat in a field of weeds. He was truly a great man of God. Personally, I prefer the easier and more positive approach to my religion. Jesus did not die for our sins, he died for us. This may be more a matter of semantics than an actual difference. Though our perspectives may be different, we are still looking at the same thing. In any event, a Cosmological perspective is the perspective of God. God looked at his creation and it was good. Original Sin theology is for the most part the product of State Religion. It is based on fear and shame. True Christianity, the kind the Pope preached, is fearless. He had enough confidence in his God that he did not feel he had to defend his faith every time he talked to someone of another Faith. He had reduced God down to his simplest terms, God is love. The Pope was more a moral man than a religious man. Jesus was more a moral man than a religious man. (I am amending this review after the Death of Pope John Paul II). Fundamentalist religion, as opposed to spirituality, all too often is used by the powerful to control the weak, to divide and conquer. \\"The Love-Religion has no code or doctrine. Only God\\", Rumi. Creation Theology is a liberating religion based on awe and joy. Wisdom does not start with 'fear', that is a poor translation, wisdom starts with 'awe', wonder, amazement, joy. Go and sin no more. You are free. If the next Pope is from Latin America, I believe even more of the sensitivities of Creation Theology will find their way into the Catholic Church. This would be a good thing. God cares about life, not just human life.Some of the other reviewers have chosen to attack Fox. That the Dominican Order excommunicated him is true. Their Order also conducted the Inquisition. That Fox slips into Pantheism, that nature is God. Actually he slips into panentheism, that nature is part of God. A nuance perhaps, but a fundamental nuance nontheless. All monotheists make 'one' fundamental mistake, that all is numerically one. Trinitarians are onto something but don't quite realize what it is. Let 'us' make man in 'our' image. If all is numerically one then it is all just a game. A license to kill in the name of God. A license to do whatever one pleases like the hedonistic Nicolatians. The background for the despair of existentialism and the schizophrenia of solipsism. This is wrong thinking. All is not numerically one. Reality is much more complicated than that. Everything is not the figment of our imagination. All is more than one but less than two. And this makes all the difference in the world. The whole of everything, the Universe, God, the Tao, is not a linear function. One is a number, God is not a number. Not one. This misperception is due to the fundamental error of applying dualistic logic to the nondual realm of reality.There are fundamentally two aspects to reality. The dual and the nondual. The dual side of the coin is where we find ourselves at present. Up/down, good/bad, duality. Nonduality, the spirit realm that includes duality but goes beyond time and space, good and evil, is not to be understood properly based solely upon a dualistic perspective. All wholes manifest a synergetic effect wherein the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The tensile strength of steel is far greater than the sum of the tensile strength of the individual minerals and metals used to create steel. God is not One. God is whole, more than one, but less than two. And in between one and two lies infinity. God is neither alone nor all one. We are not alone. Things matter. Life isn't just a game of pretense, though there are certainly elements of game playing going on. Life is 'like' a masquerade ball. A dance. More verb than noun. Even Advaita sages create a dualism with their need for Maya as a means of contrasting the One. They are confused. The blind leading the blind. Our world is real. Impermanent in its configuration but real nonetheless. That one never stands in the same river twice does not mean the river is an illusion. Because one cannot put a river in a bucket nor the wind in a bag does not mean they do not exist. To reason purely discursively like the Kantians do is an exercise in futility where nonduality is concerned. Idealized Continental philosophy is a maze in the middle of a minefield. Nonduality is a labyrinth in the holy of holies, the heart. In my Father's house there are many mansions, and if it were not so I would tell you. More than one, less than two. We are a point, a morphogenetic field of spiritual energy, a seed of divinity, between one and two. Made in the image of God we are godlike beings for it takes a god to worship God. We are godlike but not God, lest any man should boast. The Father and I are a fractal symmetry.Thou essence art that essence."},{"Title":"Creation Spirituality: Liberating Gifts for the Peoples of the Earth","review":"This is an easy eye opening read to the cosmos of Matthew Fox and his reclaimed vision of true human spirituality. Having spent his life challenging many long standing, but non-biblical, Christian doctrines and dogmas (and being excommunicated for doing so), he opens the door to the cosmos which is the source, quest and goal of Creation Spirituality and the recognition, affirmation and celebration of all people's spirituality. He doesn't create new senses of spirituality or just another collection of doctrines and dogmas; he affirms the spirituality inherent in our history and in our lives today.Buy \\"Original Blessing\\": his seminal, detailed discourse on Creation Spirituality at the same time an read on...He allows us to embrace all the world's spirituality as common to our own.

During my recent sabbatical, I put some effort into such an essay, and the result is this short book. While on sabbatical I traveled ... and if I was awakened to anything during those trips, it is this: The issues that creation spirituality addresses have worldwide significance.\\"He suggests that after the Galileo affair in 1616, science and religion parted ways. \\"Today, however, science is once again interested in the sacred, and creation spirituality provides a bridge between the two.\\" (Pg. 15) He endorses panentheism (\\"God is in all things and all things are in God\\"), which reminds us that \\"we are all beautiful, all interdependent, all necessary in a single web of life.\\" (Pg. 104-105)He suggests that \\"spirituality is praxis... Thinking about God is no substitute for tasting God, and talking about God is no substitute for giving people ways of experiencing God.\\" (Pg. 74)He summarizes, \\"creation spirituality can be understood as a liberation theology for 'First World' peoples... the movement to liberate the overdeveloped peoples of the northern hemisphere indeed parallels liberation theology in the south. The north... remains severely underdeveloped in our imagination and spirits and indignation. We need to get on with the task of liberating ourselves.\\" (Pg. 87)This book is nevertheless a very accessible introduction to Fox's thinking."},{"Title":"Creation Spirituality: Liberating Gifts for the Peoples of the Earth","review":"This book does a really good job of showing how the world is seen through the eyes of Creation Spirituality.

If you want to read anything by Fox, read that first and then come back to this book."},{"Title":"Creation Spirituality: Liberating Gifts for the Peoples of the Earth","review":"Fox draws on many sources such as Meister Eckhart and Hildegard of Bingen to try to craft a spirituality based on awe of Creation. What I fear however is that his slide towards pantheism denies some of the rich spiritual gifts of Christ and the Holy Spirit. For example it is Eckhart who says \\"God begets his Son in you whether you like it or not.\\" (See for example the book \\"Meister Eckhart from Whom God Hid Nothing : Sermons, Writings, and Sayings\\", or Schurmann's analysis of Eckhart in \\"Wandering Joy\\"). Subsequent to this book, Fox was expelled from the Dominican order in 1993.At times Fox also seems to blame all that is ecologically corrupt on traditional Christianity, for example \\"Pantheism is not only democratic, it is also ecological, Theism, on the other hand, reinforces anthropocentrisms \\". Additionally he makes a broad claim that \\"Creation Spirituality\\" encompasses such broad divergent groups as \\"AA\\", Support groups, and Protestant parishes.Though I agree with Fox's quest for a deeper ecumenism, he seems to pick what he wants out of the Christian tradition. I still find ample mining in a more traditional, though slightly broadened views of the Holy Trinity, rather than his Cosmology, Liberation, and Wisdom. Although I don't always agree with Fox, he does offer an injection of joy and awe."},{"Title":"Cold Flat Junction (Emma Graham Mysteries (Paperback))","review":"What a wonderful book and audio-book! This is an extraordinary coming-of-age novel, with characters that you really care about and a haunting, ambiguous story. Bernadette Dunn is a wonderful narrator for this story as well. I bought a copy of the book after listening to it on tape first, and her voice echoes through my reading.Emma Graham is a wonderful, rare, twelve year old narrator, perched right on the verge of adulthood. Her imaginative child self and her growing intuition about the interesting adults in her life sometimes work together here and sometimes battle each other in a fascinating mix.This is also a beautifully lyrical novel that takes place in a world that seems quite timeless.

You get the sense that both books are a fable of sorts.Grimes' sequel (a continuation really) surpasses the first novel in recounting the cleverness and tenacity of its 12-year-old heroine. Every character is true-to-life from the sympathetic sheriff with the philandering wife to Maude, the good-hearted waitress at the Rainbow Cafe, to the speech-addled Wood brothers to the nasty and domineering 16-year-old Reejane, Emma's nemesis.

Period. However, that said, this is Martha Grimes writing as Martha Grimes, and an excellent job she does, too. (There's no compelling reason all her books have to be about Jury &amp; the Long Pid Gang--much as we wish they were!)In \\"Cold Flat Junction,\\" Grimes returns to the scene, as it were, from an earlier book (which did involve Jury) called \\"Hotel Paradise.\\" In an interview in October, 1999, Grimes explained that she was returning to that scene, not that she was tired of Jury, but that she felt that this story needed to be told, as well. Here, we find young Emma Graham, 12 years old (and most curious!), and a sleuth in her own \\"write.\\" The setting is small town America (Grimes is, surprisingly, American) and picks up some three weeks after \\"Hotel Paradise\\" ends. Emma, precocious that she is, sets out to investigate not one, but three family murders. Sound like too much? Surprisingly not. Grimes, truly, is in good from here (yes, yes, get on with it: it's NOT Richard Jury!) and with the precision of a talented, if not competent, surgeon, she makes \\"Cold Flat Junction\\" a worthy read.Grimes' style is fresh, filled with good literary allusions and at times a sharp wit. While the book, granted, is not her masterpiece (maybe \\"Jerusalem Inn\\"? Yes--it's Jury!), Grimes holds her own--and she commands a large literary field--with this one.

She's written a lot of books I admired, a few that seemed lacking, and at least one that struck me as a total disaster (see &quot;Bite the Moon&quot;), but here she dispels all fears that her skills as a writer have atrophied.There is scarcely a paragraph in this book that doesn't contain a gem of humor, poignancy, or simply character observation worth savoring. It's especially interesting that the theme is similar to the one in the much maligned effort mentioned above - a lonely and resourceful kid tackling some very adult problems. But here there's something very genuine about the emotions. The characters are wonderfully realized and their interaction is often hilarious.

This is a wonderful coming of age tale starring a very curious and intelligent 12 year old girl. And before you think \\"Oh children's story\\", it's not anything at all like that. There is much to learn about human nature in these two books, and Emma's friends and acquaintenaces are absolutely wonderful. And Ms. Grimes' sense of place is so realistic that you are right there with Emma in this pokey little New England town. The Rainbow Diner, BrokeDown house, Slaw's Garage, and Windy Run Diner seem as real as any places that are in your own life.

It is definitely preferable to read Hotel Paradise first, this is a sequel, and assumes knowledge from the prior book. You could read it alone, but I think it would become frustrating. The best is to read them together.***This is not a classic who-dun-it*****In fact, we're barely sure of the details of the crime itself, or the long ago events that caused it. This is the story of a (lonely-though I doubt she'd describe herself that way)-12 year old girl's mission to decipher the meaning of a recent crime, and to discover its connection to crimes or sins commited long ago. It builds on the mystery she (mostly) deciphered in \\"Hotel Paradise\\".This book is wonderful. Not only are the old and new mysteries hauntingly engaging, but Emma's journey to decipher them made me laugh and cry at how well it describes what it's like to be 12. Not yet accepted as an adult, but old enough to have the persistence and ingenuity to get help from the adults who can help her investigate, while pretending to be nonchalantly wandering, just like a child. Emma made me remember what it was like to almost believe, that if you didn't stare at someone, they wouldn't notice you. She is precocious, but very realistic and likeable. Sheriff Sam DeGheyn,even seen through her critical eyes, is obviously wonderfully kind, caring and intelligent man.she finds help from unlikely allies, finally coming to a resolution, that is wonderful, solving unanswered questions from \\"Hotel Paradise\\" as well.Again: don't expect a \\"Jury and Plant\\" story-but you'll get something rare and precious."},{"Title":"Cold Flat Junction (Emma Graham Mysteries (Paperback))","review":"I have a love/not quite hate-more like an ambivlent(sic) feeling about both this book and Hotel Paradise.

Emma knows Ben did not commit the current homicide and begins to believe he did not do the other either. She starts her own inquiries going back to the original event that occurred over forty years ago that she feels triggered the subsequent homicides.The second Emma Graham amateur sleuth investigation is a charming tale that cleverly uses a who-done-it to provide a coming of age novel.

Her life is a lot like Cinderella's except that her mother is still alive.In this story, Emma does her usual waitressing and food preparation chores at the Hotel Paradise while solving three deaths. To complicate matters, her mother, business partner and business partner's daughter all go away on a vacation leaving Emma to cook for the resident guests and to pine for Florida. She creates her own fantasy vacation while they are away. To take some of the sting out of being left behind, she pulls little tricks on a grumpy guest and spends more time investigating.After I finished reading the book, I couldn't decide if Ms. Grimes intended the detection to be a fantasy as well (delusions of a deluded person) or just decided to ignore reality as a writer. In either case, the book didn't work for me.Let me explain the problem. Emma's mom is supposed to be short of money. Emma gets her money from tips, but the hotel seems to only have 2 or 3 guests. How much can she earn in tips? Presumably, not very much. Yet, Emma is constantly racing around in taxis, taking trains, having lunch in diners, and buying expensive supplies. She spends much more pocket money daily than I do as a management consultant.As another dimension of this problem, Emma is able to get an attractive young man (who is a poacher) to drive her around and help her check out an old house whenever she wants. Neither Emma nor anyone else is worried about them heading off together in a car. Really?Many of the characters seem to think that Emma isn't all there mentally. Are they right, or just myopic?Emma also comes out succeeding in some pretty over-the-top ways at the end of the story. Fantasy or overly imaginative writing?The mystery itself isn't a particularly intriguing one.If you like the idea of Cinderella as a detective rather than going to the ball, you will probably enjoy this story. If you like your mysteries to have more realism in them, pick one of the Richard Jury novels that Ms. Grimes writes so well instead.Where does personal fantasy begin to undermine the ability to function? How can you guard against this?Take a cold-eyed look around you!"},{"Title":"Cold Flat Junction (Emma Graham Mysteries (Paperback))","review":"Martha Grimes returns to us her 12 year old narrator, Emma, and Emma's friend the Sheriff, along with a cast of characters at the old hotel where Emma's mother cooks. Over the nearly four hundred pages of the novel, Emma's company wears a little thin. She is a fully realized character, but with all the limitations of her age; her passionate likes and dislikes loom large in the story--and frankly, they are predictable to the point of being cliched. The mystery slowly, oh so slowly, unravels. This tale could have been told more cleanly and concisely in half the time. Martha Grimes is apparently very fond of her fictional creation, young Emma, but her adult readers may yearn for a return to a more mature narrator, or at least to a child who is more seasoned and prescient."},{"Title":"Cold Flat Junction (Emma Graham Mysteries (Paperback))","review":"Having grown the love the Richard Jury mysteries, I was bitterly disappointed by this novel. I tried to wade through it but it was so gawd-awful boring that I just gave up."},{"Title":"Cold Flat Junction (Emma Graham Mysteries (Paperback))","review":"to much like the last book"},{"Title":"Cold Flat Junction (Emma Graham Mysteries (Paperback))","review":"I've read Grimes before and find her non-Jury books have many of the qualities of fantasy. It seems most evident in this one. First, we have a precocious & engaging twelve year old girl - Emma - with a very active imagination. She constantly builds a colorful & active daydream world - and she's well aware that these are day dreams - a world she constructs as she would have her real world if she had a choice. As the book progresses, it's as though the it IS her daydream. Consider - a twelve year old girl who is left alone, in charge of the day to day operation of a country hotel, who takes taxis & trains as most twelve year olds ride a bike, who 'interviews' adults in a most mature way and is awarded the attention and respect normally reserved by adults FOR adults.There is an unreal, dreamy quality to the described background scenes though the characters peopling these scenes are well realized - it's almost as though they move against a surreal background. The climactic scenes read like a young girl's fantasy - triumphantly unbelievable. Trust me - I WAS Emma, with that same active imagination at that age and the ability to construct elaborate, ongoing adventures for myself while well aware that they were indeed my own construction.I agree with [those] who comment that the story line is slight - it's the way it's told that holds your interest. It's an unusual book. I'd like to hear what the author has to say about it."},{"Title":"Cold Flat Junction (Emma Graham Mysteries (Paperback))","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but it helps if you read Hotel Paradise first. I am still waiting for answers and hope Martha has a sequel up her sleeve...there were just too many loose ends at the end! I just love the way Martha writes and its always such a pleasure to read her...but who was Rose and Mary-Evelyn's Mother?"},{"Title":"Cold Flat Junction (Emma Graham Mysteries (Paperback))","review":"Grimes' love of words and literature are unseen characters in this &quot;coming of age&quot; novel. The heroine, Emma, is waking up to life and the twin powers of history and the telling of it. Through Emma, the reader remembers the delight of discovering everything from Greek myths to Patsy Cline to murky and murderous family crimes.The mystery itself (continued from &quot;Hotel Paradise&quot;) is wonderfully convoluted and woven with tantalizing care. Don't bother reading this one if you like to skim brain-candy; savor it like a fine, rich dinner."},{"Title":"Cold Flat Junction (Emma Graham Mysteries (Paperback))","review":"I have a friend who refuses to read Martha Grimes. As an avid mystery lover, she finds the Richard Jury series too graphic in their discriptions...too violent and ugly. I, on the other hand, throughly enjoy these books for the very reasons she gives for disliking them...not because I enjoy violence or its aftermath, but because Grimes is able to capture the reality of a hideous crime without making it gratuitous. So, when I read Cold Flat Junction, I thought I was in for the same sort of story telling...a different location and new characters, but a story with basically the same gritty feeling. Boy, was I wrong! This book was a complete surprise in every way. This is such a departure for Grimes that it's almost as if someone else actually wrote it. This book is a pure delight in every respect. Yes, there is a murder...but, it's the &quot;mystery&quot; that is the driving power here. The characters that fill the pages are like none you have come across in a Grimes story either. The main character is a 12 year old girl named Emma Graham. Emma can be compared to Scout, the little girl in &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot;, as she has the same heart, determination, loyalty, sweetness and wisdom far beyond her years as this much beloved character. She refuses to let go of a 50 year old drowning, ruled accidental, but murder in the mind of Emma. She is determined to prove this...and in turn... prove the innocence of someone who has been charged in a current murder. Grimes captures the essence of childhood brillantly, while still telling a gripping story filled with suspense...and even a touch of romance. This isn't just a great mystery...it's great story telling...period. My friend that I mentioned at the beginning of this review, concurs. With much pleading on my part, I finally convinced her...although reluctanly...to give Marth Grimes another try. Well, she did and she can't stop raving about this book. It's a gem. Be prepared for something very different and quite wonderful. Read this book and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Cold Flat Junction (Emma Graham Mysteries (Paperback))","review":"The prequel to this book, Hotel Paradise, is one of my favorite, read-over-and-over books. Unfortunately, it seems Grimes hadn't even read it recently before writing this. The first few chapters contradict previous events so many times I wanted to scream in frustration. It also seems to have lost the dreamlike, meandering quality I liked so much, as the 12-year-old narrator seems to have matured the 10 years or so that passed between the writing of the two novels, and is now looking back on the events that took place immediately following, while previously, she seemed to be telling about things as they happened. She explains things a lot more now. While some of this is exposition to remind us of what happened in the last book (with the aforementioned contradictions and just plain inaccuracies), it continues through new events, so that what seemed before to be a kid's eye view of things, is just plodding and mechanical. It was so disconcerting reading these virtually back-to-back; Emma didn't even seem like the same person. Sheriff Sam DeGehyn also seemed to have undergone an abrupt makeover. Emma's high praise of him being someone who didn't treat her like a kid and actually listened to her as though her thoughts were just as important as an adult's completely vanished, as he discounted her and her investigation of the murders, basically telling her to keep her little nose out of it. Especially if you consider Sam's actions in The End of the Pier where Sam is the only one who doesn't believe the convenient suspect is guilty, it's hard to see Sam here acting like he wants to pin everything on Ben, just because it's so coincidental and obvious. In fact, come to think of it, the two mysteries are quite similar in that there are several murders, an obvious suspect, and then a less obvious guilty party. Only Sam's attitude has done a complete 180 in terms of who he'd prefer to blame.Two other small nit-picks with Emma's character are that she seems to spend a lot of time going off places with strange men she just met, one even an admitted poacher(!), and aside from said poacher mentioning this one time, no one seems to have any problem with it. Second, I really could have done without Emma's intermittent descriptions of her imaginary vacation to Florida.(Emma's vacation is imaginary because her mom took off on a real vacation to Florida with Lola Davidow, co-owner of the hotel, and Davidow's daughter, ReeJane. Emma was not even invited.) In an almost-400-page book, a little more editing is definitely necessary. Also, who goes on vacation and leaves their two kids, aged 12 and 14, with no supervision except their 90 year old great-aunt, who never leaves the 4th floor, and a \\"slow-witted\\" dishwasher? If this story took place anywhere near reality, this kid would have been tragically raped, murdered, kidnapped, or burnt down the hotel instead of running around solving mysteries.I did like the way the story was wrapped up, and I do look forward to the third book, Belle Ruin, mostly because I haven't any idea what it could be about unless it's another mystery entirely. I didn't really think the first one needed such an extended wrap-up (the ambiguousness of Hotel Paradise's ending was part of its beauty), but it was interesting to find out more about the Deveraus and get some confirmation of certain theories. At this point, I'm not really sure whether to recommend this book or not. It's kind of a toss-up."},{"Title":"Cold Flat Junction (Emma Graham Mysteries (Paperback))","review":"I found I preferred this book to the Richard Jury mysteries. I used to read them avidly, but I tired of his recurring characters. I thought they were flat and cartoonish.This book, on the other hand, portrays a complicated and endearing main character.

The enjoyable part is the way in which the story is told."},{"Title":"Cold Flat Junction (Emma Graham Mysteries (Paperback))","review":"This is an wonderful book but the mystery is -confusing- and never ends.

I'm glad I read Hotel Paradise first, as I might have been a little lost in the plot if I hadn't. Cold Flat Junction moves faster and has a more defined plot than Hotel Paradise, so it was satisfying in that way. I also loved Emma's thoughts and actions, especially her pretend vacation to Florida which mirrored her mother's vacation, but was actually even better, and her small torments to the demanding irritating guest she has to wait on in her hotel dining room. Emma's take on these events are a scream. I appreciate Ms. Grimes' originality in the plot and the narrative voice in her \\"Emma Graham mysteries.\\""},{"Title":"The Cossacks","review":"Every once in a while a classic comes along that excites the imagination with a tale of adventure which leads to great understanding in the end. The Cossacks gives us a glimpse inside the Cossack world while helping us search for love and adventure through the travels of a young Russian soldier in the Caucuses. It is an adventure tale with all the color and swashbuckling a young man could desire but then adds the twist of romance to excite every imagination. The characters have depth and are brimming with cultural character. You too will fall in love on the great Cossack adventure of your life. Not a classic for nothing. Also a wonderful introduction to Tolstoi since the names are less unfamiliar than the names and places one is bombareded with in _War and Peace_. A great gift for anyone longing for adventure."},{"Title":"Glencoe World History","review":"Interesting and readable.

Hopefully they will start to bring Seymour's other titles back into print.Taking place years after the collapse of the Soviet Union and in the new age of the war on terror, a Russian naval officer provides intelligence information to the British Secret Service. Compromised, he misses his dead drops, and a cunning interrogator of the FSB is brought in from the battlefields of Chechnya to break the traitor. British intelligence officials debate what, if anything, is to be done, and four former Royal Marine commandos of the Special Boat Service are tasked with getting him out of the Russian naval base where he is held.A fast paced plot populated by a cast of multifaceted, varied characters, this is Seymour's best book."},{"Title":"Traitor's Kiss","review":"A British fishing trawler, assisting a distress call, puts into a Russian port. A Russian naval officer gives the captain an envelope and asks that it be delivered to British intelligence. The envelope contains classified information and an offer to provide more. The Russian officer, Viktor Archenko, is assigned codename Ferret.Four years later, Rupert Mowbray learns that Archenko is in trouble. Mowbray, recently retired from the SIS and Ferret's former handler, is one of the few who recalls Checkpoint Charlie and the Berlin Wall with fondness. They symbolize \\"a world of certainties, and a place of brave men\\"; they are a reminder of a time when Mowbray's work was unquestionably relevant. Now Mowbray is a relic, viewed by young operatives as a cold warrior stuck in the past. Yet Mowbray engineers a return to action when a confidante tells him that Archenko needs to be pulled out of Kaliningrad and that the SIS decision-makers would prefer to let Ferret rot rather than risk an extraction. Because of his former status and his stirring reminder that disloyalty to its assets will cripple the ability of SIS to recruit new ones, Mowbray convinces the powers to allow him to select and direct an extraction team -- a team of expendables whose relationship to the British government can be denied if the operation doesn't succeed.The negative reviews of Traitor's Kiss correctly suggest that this is not a novel for those who want nonstop action involving larger than life heroes battling cartoonishly evil bad guys (when they aren't busy seducing beautiful women). Seymour writes stories that are more realistic than escapist, featuring dedicated, multidimensional servants of government who (unlike their politically minded, job-protecting superiors) try to make sound decisions in a morally ambiguous world. Seymour's novels are not for those who crave instant action, high tech weaponry, and perfectly happy endings. Nonetheless, they are far from dull. Although Traitor's Kiss gets off to a slower start than some of Seymour's novels, suspense builds steadily after he sets the scene. As the crisis looms, tension becomes palpable. The rescue attempt, when it finally comes, is exciting enough for the most jaded action junkie -- and a reward for those whose attention spans allow them to progress deeply into this carefully constructed novel. The ending is immensely powerful and poignant, really quite brilliant.Seymour brings life to the characters in Traitor's Kiss, investing even second string players with detailed backgrounds. Some readers find that boring because it slows the pace; I think the emphasis on character makes the novel more interesting than the predictable action stories manufactured by less talented writers of spy fiction. As Mowbray matches wits against a Russian interrogator, the minor characters become pawns in the manipulative games played by their masters. An unexpected love story lurks in the background (the product of Mowbray's manipulation), contributing to the tension by giving the reader even more reason to care about the main characters.This isn't Seymour's best work -- it lacks the complexity and moral dilemmas that makeHome Runso engrossing -- but it is a fine, nuanced piece of writing. The more I think about this novel, the more I like it. I would give Traitor's Kiss 4 1/2 stars if Amazon made that option available."},{"Title":"Traitor's Kiss","review":"The spy thriller fell on hard times with the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. Most spy novelists have lost their way in the new reality of the world. Seymour, to give him his due, ignores the new reality and portrays 21st Century Russia as a carbon copy of the Soviet Union. The KGB has become the FSB. Whatever changes remains the same.\\"Traitor's Kiss\\" is a complex spy novel in the vein of John Le Carre. The author carefully draws characters and atmosphere in a dark renewed Cold War environment. Kaliningrad stands in for Berlin as the center of the intrigue; the plot revolves around the rescue of a Russian spy leaking secrets to the British a la \\"The Spy who Came in from the Cold\\"; the characters include an over-age British agent a la George Smiley and several disgraced soldiers eager to redeem themselves for past sins plus a super-efficient Russian opponent a la Karla. Le Carreish...and that is intended as high praise.Unfortunately, despite the promise of the book the author doesn't quite carry it off. About page 250 I started getting impatient and it was more a chore than a pleasure to make it through another 178 pages. The book moves too slowly and is too long. Cut it down to 300 - 350 pages and you have an excellent spy novel. And you save paper too.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Traitor's Kiss","review":"Although the work was fiction, I know for a fact, that liasons are made with people from other countries. Whether it is peacetime, war-time or a 'cold war', relationships continue. This was a gripping description of 'The Game', written in part from a woman's perspective. The characters in this book come to life and some of them die, just as in real life. Beyond the thrill and the challenge, lies the responsiblity of friend-to-friend and lover-to-lover. For those who wonder what motivates people to help one another, please read this book. Maybe the countries change but the work continues. Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Traitor's Kiss","review":"I kind of figured from reading backcovers of Seymour's other books that he is not specialised in secret agent novels (like Tom Clany at his high and the Jack Ryan series.) And maybe as the Cold War is officially over this kind of theme is difficult to pose.I think the author is not satisfied with a simple, clean, fast-paced thriller, but attempted to discuss the issue of glory, duty, loyalty, love, redemption, etc. The characters of the novel are given too many irrelevant details. The fact that the Delta team was made-up of 4 drop-out, failure ex-soliders made most of the the Havoc operation unconvincing. The retired Cold warrior can step back into heading an op again just by giving convincing speeches to seniors? And those seniors rubber-stamp the op just like that?? Too naive.The characters have unstable character - one minute good friend, one minute killer. The interrogator and the conscript are two very confusing dudes, as well as the Russian mafiya. The way the op ended was really a humiliation to the UK intelligence service than a show of victory and glory.And it dragged on for too long. Don't know how it got so long with such a simple plot. Unnecessary details, I suppose.I think the best thriller ever occupied my bookcase is The Hunt for Red October. If that one scores 10, this one scores 4. Not going to read another one by the same author."},{"Title":"Traitor's Kiss","review":"My second attempt to like Seymour, as did my first, failed.The reviewers who compare Seymour to LeCarre and Greene surely cannot have read much of either. Seymour is more a writer of thrillers, more Clancy-like,than either LeCarre or Greene. Both of the latter write something very close to literature; Seymour (or Clancy for that matter)never come close to that level. His plots are intriging, even at times exciting, but his people portraits rarely more than caricatures."},{"Title":"Traitor's Kiss","review":"One of the worst spy novels that I've ever read.

His cover has been blown and he is in mortal danger. He wants to be removed and it is the job of a group of MI6 agents to get him out of the country and safely back to Britain.Gerald Seymour uses quick sections with alternating point of views to tell the story in this overblown and introspective espionage novel. This technique should serve to accelerate the pacing, keep the pages flying and readers at the edge of their seats. Actually the author spends a great deal of time covering every possible bit of minutia on all the major characters. The reader really never has the opportunity to feel any sympathy toward any of the relatively large cast. Like John LeCarre, Gerald Seymour writes a very literate spy novel but it isn't an exciting or enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Sanskrit Grammar for Students","review":"I found the text to suffer from poor OCR conversion from the original work.

Stripped of her rags, the now luminous Sara is coveted by a ships officer, Andrew Macleay, whom she soon marries, much to the disapproval of the colonial establishment.

Thing go awry and she soon runs afoul of the law is unfairly convicted of petty theft and transported via prison ship to New South Wales (Australia). While on board, Sara hits a bit of luck when one of the lady's maids dies and she's chosen for the position - and once cleaned up the beauteous Sara attracts the attention of all the men, including Andrew Maclay who is willing to give up his future to marry Sara and settle in the new colony.Once wed, Sara is pardoned but the closely knit community continues to shun the former convict despite her and Andrew's growing success and fortune. Not one to sit at home doing needlepoint, Sara is actively involved in Andrew's business interests and the growing prosperity of the colony. The novel covers about a twenty year period in Sara's life as she struggles to keep her independence and freedom as well as her relationships with the four men who loved her but could never control her. Who will win her heart in the end - her first love Richard? The ambitious Andrew? The Irish rebel/convict Jeremy? Or the ever so smooth Frenchman Louis de Borget who would rather have his wife at home raising babies?All in all a pretty entertaining read and I learned a lot about the early days of what would eventually become Australia. I found it a bit predictable at times (you could always tell when one of Sara's husbands was going to bite the dust...), and things really started to drag on a bit at the end, but still a worthwhile read - especially for those preferring a heroine with a bit more backbone and less helpless victim mentality. 3.5/5 stars."},{"Title":"Sara Dane","review":"I enjoyed the strength of Sara's character as other reviewers mentioned. But the story is the point of view of European wealthy colonists to Australia. I found that viewpoint tiring. Money and status and clothes and power seemed to be what was important -- that's what all Sara's strength of character got her. Lots of snobbery and classism."},{"Title":"Sara Dane","review":"I recently rediscovered an old friend. I hadn't seen her for over thirty years, but I recognised her instantly. Her name is Sara Dane, and with more than 2 million copies sold, she became the most acclaimed novel of 20 authored by Catherine Gaskin (1929 - 2009). Needless to say, our friendship had stood the test of time, and our meeting again resulted in another reading of this very memorable book.The novel, Sara Dane is a romance (historical), published in 1954. It's the story about a young convict woman, sentenced to transportation to Port Jackson, in 1792 (for nothing more than would be considered a child's prank in modern times) and the hardships she endures in overcoming the stigma of her conviction, before rising to a position of wealth and prominence among the citizens of early New South Wales.This book appealed to me for several reasons back in the 1980's; it was most likely the very first novel (fiction) I had ever read on British settlement in Australia, and as an Australian, why I found it especially interesting. It also appealed to me because Sara Dane is an unforgettable character with a great deal of backbone, unlike many heroines in earlier romance novels.However, the reason I consider the novel Sara Dane to be an old friend, is quite frankly because the author Catherine Gaskin is such a wonderful story teller. Well written stories aren't easily forgotten, and the memories of them often remain in both a readers mind and heart. It wasn't at all surprising after reading Sara Dane to learn that many of Catherine Gaskins novels became best sellers, and earned her such titles as \`the girl with the golden pen' and \`the queen of storytellers'.~Sara Dane by Catherine Gaskin (Back Cover):-A wild cacophony of screams and shrieks issued from the dark hold where a maniacal group of women rolled together in a frenzied struggle.Lieutenant Andrew Maclay could see that one of them, almost hidden beneath the others, was fighting alone. \`Silence!' Andrew roared. The mob slowly quietened. \`Is there a woman here called Sara Dane?' he asked.The lone fighter struggled to her feet. Slim and straight, the skin of her throat and face was unlined, but the dirt of the stinking hold covered whatever beauty she might have possessed. She wore a hacked and tattered gown many sizes too large; but she wore it with an air of cherished grandeur. She lifted her head proudly.\`I am Sara Dane,' she said.~J M Lennox"},{"Title":"Sara Dane","review":"SARA DANE...TRANSPORTED FROM ENGLAND TO AUSTRALIA IN CHAINS...HER BEAUTY COULD WIN HER FREEDOM, BUT LOVE IMPRISONED HER HEART.While gentle trade winds filled the billowing white sails of the clipper ship, no breeze stirred the foul air below decks where proud, impetuous Sara Dane lay imprisoned. Her crime had been to love above her station; her sentence, to serve as an indentured servant on a distant dangerous continent. Yet even the rags she wore couldn't hide the rare pale gold of her beauty from the lust of desperate men...or from the adoring eyes of handsome ship's officer Andrew Maclay. His rich love promising ambition matched her own desire to found an empire of wealth and power in this new, growing land. But could his strong arms tame her wild nature...or keep her heart from beating fast at the sound of another man's name? Sara was a very strong willed woman who survived all of the adversity of her new country. Made me weep in places. Getting transported for the least crimes were crimes in and of themselves by the English peerage. She was put in Newgate for taking two coins that were given to her.A SAGA OF ROMANCE AND REBELLION! ! !Anyone who loves stories of Australia will love the series \\"THE AUSTRALIANS\\" It is a twelve(12) book series.

This novel is not her story, but is based on the assumption that what one woman can do, so may another. The broad outlines of the lives of mary Reibey and of Sara Dane are similar - the details differ sharply. This books is meant in no way to be a portrait of Mary Reibey, but simply a novel of her times."},{"Title":"Common Information Model: Implementing the Object Model for Enterprise Management","review":"I bought the book in order to learn faster about the following: (a) How can (should) I use existing CIM schemas in order to develop CIM schema for my company devices. (b) How to represent all these concepts in XML (c) Relation of CIM to network management and DEN.I expected to find some examples how all that look and work in real life. This, however, is not a book that I needed. It gives you some background in OO modeling that I did not like and actually did not need at all. I also suspect that somebody without previous OO knowledge might be confused. For example, on page 41, Properties, it is written: &quot;A property is a value used to denote a characteristic of a class; it can be thought of as a pair of functions, one to set the property value and one to return the property value.&quot; Property access methods are confused with a property itself !XML part is very short and general so I still have to go somewhere else to figure out how to implement XML part. Almost the same can be said about DEN - CIM relation.The authors are obviously knowledgeable in the areas of OOA/OOD, Patterns and Enterprise management. I do not like their presentation but it may happen that I am not a part of their 'target group' for which they wrote the book. That is why I gave the book 3 stars.

Also, most computer books lag behind the actual software they cover. There are a few indispensable &quot;classic&quot; computer books out there, but they're all about stuff like UNIX, TCP/IP, and C, targets that don't move as quickly as Java does.But I don't think I'm the only professional programmer in the world who appreciates having printed documentation. It's handy to be able to take a book on the road, or to the nearest couch, and flip through the pages at my leisure. I like putting a finger in one page and a pencil in another while I flip to a few cross-references. I doubt that online docs will ever really replace the Real Thing for me.O'Reilly is one of the two or three best computer book publishers out there (Addison-Wesley and Prentice-Hall are also excellent, but pricey). This book is typical of O'Reilly's stuff: practical, dependable and inexpensive. I do Java GUI programming full-time, and I've used this book a lot.

As the dynamic html reference gets richer in each 1.1.x release, the benefit of buying this hardcopy deminishes. The samples in this book are largely overstated.

A must for any seeker"},{"Title":"Psychedelics Encyclopedia","review":"I've altered my review because I realized that I was disappointed by this book because my expectations were too high and that's not the book's fault. Overall, I'm glad I read the book and am glad that I still have a copy of it on my shelves. I'd give it 3.5/5 if I could.This book has a number of blatant errors in it that caused me to question everything asserted as fact in this book. Examples of errors would be the error about the asymmetric carbon in MDMA and in the number of molecules in 2/100ths of a microgram of LSD. These are only a few of the errors, just for illustration.I also find that the book logically contradicts itself often. For example, when making a point about LSD and alcoholism, the author makes it clear that the LSD experience is not like the DTs (and thus 'curing' alcoholism according to this hypothesis didn't work). Later, however, the author asserts high success rates for alcoholism treatment with LSD.What disappoints me most about this book is that it is too obviously biased towards psychedelics drugs. When I bought the book I was really looking for something objective, but this book has almost nothing bad to say about psychedelic drugs at all. It ventures in to the absurd discourses of \\"enlightenment\\" and creativity enhancement under scientific pretenses.This book was a disappointment to me because in some spots it is just as misleading (though less inaccurate) than much anti-drug propaganda. If you're looking for an objective, balanced book about psychedelic drugs, this may not be the book for you. I say it \\"may not\\" be the book for you because despite some errors and what I see as a \\"pro-psychedelic bias,\\" it does still contain a lot of accurate, potentially useful and often fascinating information.The sections of the book detailing the histories of each drug are excellent. These parts were very interesting. The book does a good job of detailing the attitudes of various societies at various times towards certain drugs.Again, even though my rating hasn't increased, I'd like to point out a few of the book's strengths:It's logically laid out, with the chapters on each class of substances being well organized. It is an excellent book for anyone who is simply interested in psychedelic drugs or for someone wanting to start a personal library on psychedelics. I still pick it up and use it as a reference because it's not only well organized, but also because it contains the kind of information that people often want to know about psychedelic drugs (e.g. where does the drug come from? how does it work? how is it related, chemically, to other drugs in the same category? what are its effects?). Most of the book is full of information that would be useful to people who are interested in psychedelics."},{"Title":"Psychedelics Encyclopedia","review":"An excellent book, one of the defining classics of the genre. It does have a few minor factual errors here and there, but overall a great book on the subject matter. Put simply, it is overflowing with information. It's also a very entertaining read, which makes it more than a simple reference. Worth the investment, even for those who are already well versed in the topic."},{"Title":"Psychedelics Encyclopedia","review":"A very well constructed foray into the psychedelic world from the more objective point of view.

No book will hence be able to cover the field completely and without omissions. What is still very useful is an introduction to all major classes of psychedelics.Stafford's book is such an useful introduction. He covers the history, botany (if plant-derived) chemistry and subjective effects of a wide variety of psychedelics, such as LSD, psylocibin, cannabinoids, nutmeg and others. MDMA, \\"exctacy\\" is treated as something of a newcomer, which is due to the, at this time, somewhat advanced age of the book (3rd edition published in 1993). Newer synthetic psychedelics and substances like salvia divinorum are hence not covered. There are good online resources to fill these gaps - as a starter for the psychedelically interested reader, this book is still useful. Stafford is sympathetic to psychedelic exploration, but does not sing an uncritical praise of these substances.So often, when \\"drugs\\" (and psychedelics are too often grouped with qualitatively so different substances) are discussed in public, blatant misinformation distorts the debate. A few evenings worth of reading by the disputants in a book like Stafford's could easily right these annoying problems."},{"Title":"Psychedelics Encyclopedia","review":"Very interesting book filled with everything you ever wanted to know about substances that create an altered state of awareness.

Gone--or going-- were Toms, Coons, Minstrels, Mammies, and Noble Savages. Among the casualties was the Uncle Remus stereotype created by Joel Chandler Harris and reinforced by the Disney motion picture Song of the South. An unfortunate side effect of the new black consciousness was dismissal of the vast collection of African folk stories Harris had collected in the 19th Century and first published in 1878. The Brer Rabbit stories, far from symbolizing slavery and oppression, are genuine products of African culture and tradition. That they have been ignored or disregarded by so many modern readers of color is a great loss. However discomforting Harris' gathering of tales may be--and reading Uncle Remus is indeed difficult--his work represents the largest single collection of African-American folk tales ever published.Sister Karima Amin, well known storyteller, author, and teacher, seeks to remedy both this loss and our discomfort with the publication of The Adventures of Brer Rabbit and Friends. Amin takes possession of the folk tales--in fact, reclaims them--and retells ten of them with her own ample gifts for imagery, sound, and humor. Absent is the degrading Uncle Remus frame, which worked so much subconscious damage on those of us exposed to these tales in the 40s and 50s. In his place is Amin's wonderful voice--which translates well to the printed page, even for those unfortunate enough never to have heard her speak. (In the kindest of all universes, she will do an audiobook of this.)Gone also is the degrading imagery I recall from one of my grammar school readers. Eric Copeland's lavish illustrations distance themselves from racial stereotype. The Tar Baby, for example, is a faceless mound of tar, not the black child in my fourth grade reader, and the animals are dressed in a variety of clothing, not traditional plantation garb. Without the burdens of the types of images Spike Lee derides in Bamboozled, the stories are free to be just what they are--object lessons, histories, entertainments, and, most of all, ours.The book is further enhanced by a detailed map of Brer Rabbit's world, complete with footprints indicating the habitats of the animal characters profiled in the margins; extensive information about real rabbits, foxes, and the like; and a section on the history of African and African-American folk tales and slavery. Brer Rabbit and Friends can be enjoyed by children and adults from all walks of life without rousing uneasiness, inferiority, or superiority. Amin's only cultural agenda is to preserve African-American folklore with the respect it deserves. For that reason alone, the book deserves an honored place on the family bookshelf."},{"Title":"Adventures of Brer Rabbit and Friends","review":"I give The Adventures of Brer Rabbit and Friends to every new baby I know! As a parent, grandparent, early childhood educator and school board member, I am thrilled to find a book that meets my criteria for excellence.

The colorful, active illustrations also draw us into the wonderful world of pranks, surprises, and fun. Sections on the African storytelling tradition, the Southern plantation world of Brer Rabbit, and the animals native to Southern USA deepen our learning and appreciation of the treasured tales we have in this lovely book. Brer Rabbit and Friends is perfect for lap reading, group reading, dramatization and learning to be a storyteller.

However I just finished re-reading The Adventures of Brer Rabbit and Friends as retold by performing storyteller Karima Amin, and it was like drinking a magic spring tonic. Instantly, I found myself transported to the warm, sun-drenched, dreamy world of Brer Rabbit and his myriad animal neighbors. The text of each story wraps and winds its way around the lush color illustrations by Eric Copeland, with a sprinkling of big, bold, bouncy exclamations of \\"Bookity-Bookity\\", \\"Splishy-splushy\\", and \\"Lippity-clippety\\" jumping out to grab your attention at just the right moment. The stories have a universal appeal because they reflect the \\"life lessons\\" we all struggle to learn when growing up - to pay attention, to get along with your neighbors, to use your natural abilities, to take time to laugh. Of course, these stories didn't appear out of thin air and the book includes insightful background on the historical context of these classic African American tales and their even-earlier African origins. The only way the publishers could have improved upon this well-done project would have been to offer a cassette or cd/book read-along package.

His mom was just as entranced as she recalled the stories I used to tell her. The rhythm in this book is like a lullaby, warm and soothing with enough dialect to savour southern tradition yet easy to read and appreciate.Amin has given us Brer Rabbit of the 21st century. He is forever sly, cunning and humorous; but the plantation stereotype and negative images have been suitably dropped.As an adult, reading to my grandson, I especially like Amin&quot;s &quot;Tales from Africa&quot; and &quot;Meet the Animals&quot; sections at the end of her book.

Ann Monroe, an attorney in Madison, Wisconsin, is the no-nonsense protagonist of this fast paced novel. Ann is bringing a civil action lawsuit on behalf of a gay student at the University against two young men who had attacked him. She is also the attorney for a Planned Parenthood clinic that is under fire from a fundamentalist religious group. Ann has unfortunately had a previous run in with the Rev. Tremaine, the bigoted fire and brimstone preacher who heads the group called the Lambs of God. While the two cases are seemingly unrelated at first, there are indications that the \\"Lambs\\" might be involved in violent actions that take place against both of Ann's clients.Ann's character is very well developed; she is strong-minded, yet soft when she needs to be. When things go wrong and she is in a precarious situation the reader can relate to her fears. There is a also romance in the book which is very deftly woven into the story. The supporting characters are very interesting as well, especially Gary Carlson, her friend the reporter/investigator.The author is an attorney in Madison, and has written three other legal mysteries.

Her latest client, Bill Robinson, the victim of gay bashing, wants her to try his case in civil court since he lost in a jury trial and his attackers went free. Ann looks at the court records, but wonders how anti-gay people were placed on the jury with neither the judge nor the prosecutor recusing them.Another client of Ann's, a Planned Parenthood clinic, comes under attack from a group of extreme religious fundamentalists Lambs of God. Preacher Charles Tremaine, an enemy of Ann, leads these zealots. She tries to thwart him once again, but she becomes a target of attack from a sub-group within the main church. A frustrated Ann calls upon her friends for help and they come up with links between the two cases that puts the lives of Ann and her allies in danger.Fans of Nancy Taylor Rosenberg will definitely want to read Nancy Kopp's latest legal thrill FINAL JUSTICE. The heroine is a strong woman who doesn't let fear get in her way from doing the right things even if it means wearing rubber underwear. Her support allies are equally admirable though Charles and his horde pale in comparison. Although the author provides an extremely exciting novel, there is a clear social message about hate crimes that Ms. Kopp cleverly works into the plot.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati's Sri Caitanya-candramrta =: The nectar moon of 'Sri Caitanya","review":"The Book is wonderful.

I use these books with my private teacher both as an exercise source and as read aloud material, but one can go through them alone as well."},{"Title":"Concepts in Programming Languages","review":"I can't speak to John Mitchell's skill as a lecturer, but some of the complaints here seem to betray a misunderstanding of the purpose of the book: to serve as an introduction to programming language theory, such as can be found in Mitchell's other book *Foundations for Programming Languages*. Mitchell is taking you *out of* the marketable skills zone and into abstract computer science, and he's being pretty nice about it -- the book contains friendly precises of topics like lambda calculus and denotational semantics, which make up the formal core of programming languages. What you will learn has applications in all popular programming languages, even if it's not spelled out in the text.ML was a good choice as an example language, because it includes many of the features a programming language might have (being both imperative and functional), and furthermore is a serious research language on account of its well-understood semantics and type system. Focusing on it to explain core concepts was not a mistake. Mitchell knows how to do it the other way, too: explanations of the basic elements of object-orientation are parceled out over several notable OO languages, providing a way to compare and contrast how the major OO concepts can be implemented. (I didn't find the final chapter, Apt's summary of Prolog, as helpful: the declarative paradigm is too far removed from what was developed in the rest of the book.)On account of its relatively gentle explanations and the importance of its concepts for all aspects of CS, this would be a good book for a relative beginner in CS to pick up (provided they can comprehend more than just code). But if you find it too repellent, you're probably not going to be much happier with more advanced treatments: its character just reflects the nature of the field."},{"Title":"Concepts in Programming Languages","review":"While I cannot speak to the quality of Mitchell's course, having only read his book, the earlier criticisms of his use of ML in the book are missing the point of a programming languages class. It's not meant to teach you a random sampling of the 2500+ computer languages that are out there. The idea is to learn about the fundamental paradigms of programming, with a focus on the functional and logical approaches since students are generally already familiar with imperative and object-oriented programming.ML is one of several good choices for illustrating functional programming, and is actually one of the more popular functional languages (especially the OCaML dialect.) There are many well written books and tutorials on the ML family of languages freely available on the web if you need more examples or detail than he provides in this text. However, the point isn't to learn ML, but rather that once you understand functional programming in any language, you can take advantage of its power, not only in languages like perl and python which offer some limited but nice functional features like map and anonymous functions, but also in imperative languages like C via function pointers and callback techniques."},{"Title":"Concepts in Programming Languages","review":"I really enjoyed reading Concepts in Programming Languages.The book covers a little bit of everything. It includes an introduction to mathematical foundations such as computability theory and lambda calculus, but I found it quite readable (at the time when I was reading it, which was early during my undergraduate studies). It also includes a tiny bit on the semantics of programming languages (that is, how to describe the meaning formally), which is another important concept from the mathematical foundations of programming languages.Then it talks about many programming languages and concepts that come from them and are interesting including LISP (which is a basis for Clojure), ML (a basis for Microsoft's F#) but also Simula and Smalltalk (two fundamental OO languages that inspired all modern OO languages, both dynamic such as Ruby and static such as Java). It also talks about C++ and Java (practical OO languages with quite different approach). There are also a few notes about different approaches to concurrency (quite important nowadays!) and logical programming (an iteresting alternative).It doesn't go into much details and covers wide range of topics, which I consider as a benefit if you want to read it to get a broad overview of the programming language theory. The book actually motivated my current interest in programming languages :-)."},{"Title":"Concepts in Programming Languages","review":"INTRODUCTIONFirst the disclaimer: This reviewer is neither a computer scientist nor a mathematician, but I strongly enjoy reading those subjects anyway, and can perhaps be more open minded about such a controversial textbook as this one. That said, I am reading this textbook in late fall of 2012, and at this writing am in late chapter 4, reading about denotational semantics. So far, this book has been fairly interesting and not difficult for this reader. Please check the Amazon 'Look Inside' utility for more viewable details about this book.GENERAL CONTENTSHere are the complicated basic contents: Preface-ix / PART 1 Functions and Foundations // 1 Introduction-3 / 2 Computability-10 / 3 Lisp: Functions, Recursion, and Lists-18 / 4 Fundamentals-48 // PART 2 Procedures, Types, Memory Management, and Control // 5 The Algol Family and ML-93 / 6 Type Systems and Type Inference-129 / 7 Scope, Functions, and Storage Management-162 / 8 Control in Sequential Languages-204 // PART 3 Modularity, Abstraction, and Object-Oriented Programming // 9 Data Abstraction and Modularity-235 / 10 Concepts in Object-Orientated Languages-277 / 11 History of Objects: Simula and Smalltalk-300 / 12 Objects and Run-Time Efficiency: C++ -337 / 13 Portability and Safety: Java // PART 4 Concurrency and Logic Programming // 14 Concurrent and Distributed Programming-431 / 15 The Logic Programming Paradigm and Prolog-475 // Appendix A Additional Programming Examples-509 / Glossary-521 / Index-525READING THIS BOOKAs I survey this book, it does appear in a rather strange order of subjects, but as a mathy person, its somewhat mathematical approach is welcome. For example, section 4.2 summarizing lambda calculus was one of the more clear treatments of that arcane formalism I've seen. LC can be quite difficult and awkward, as I have read quite a bit about it from other sources. Section 4.3 seemed to dive us rather far into denotational semantics with little background preparation. Not ideal. Finished chapter4 mid day Tue 13Nov12.Started reading this book on Wed 31Oct12.Chapter 1 is straightforward background, as expected.Chapter 2 is a tiny 8-page treatment of computability theory, my strongest personal specialty.Chapter 3 is an interesting and fairly detailed discussion of a near-original version of the rampantly hacked LISP mostly functional language. The only programming language this reader has is the current MIT version of Scheme, a combination of LISP with block structured programming ported from one of the Algols.Chapter 4 'Fundamentals' was mentioned in my 2nd paragraph above. A long chapter covering some compiler issues, then the good intro to lambda calculus, and the a bit over our heads treatment of denotational semantics. Finally section 4.4 discussed functional vs. imperative languages, with John Backus' 1977 Turing Award thoughts as a major theme. A fascinating section! Finishing chapter 4 on Tues 13Nov12 also completes Part 1 of this book.Large start of good chapter 5 and Part 2 of this book on Thu 15Nov12. This chapter is on Algol-related languages, including Algol 60, Algol 68, Pascal, and super popular C. Much of the chapter starts Mitchell's first go at the ML language, criticized by some reviewers. ML is somewhat multi-paradigm, so probably is a decent choice to use quite a bit. ML features intensely strong type checking, which I rather like about it. Finished chapter 5 Sat 17Nov12 afternoon.Started absolutely numbing chapter 6 on type theory on Sun 18Nov12 afternoon. Can't imagine anything much more boring than the way Prof Mitchell wrote this chapter on this important subject. Mostly restarted on Monday, after taking a look at Michael Scott's 100pg chapter 7 on types, and this chapter 6 became normally interesting for this book after all. However, section 6.3 on type inference mostly lost me, so I nearly stopped reading this book in that section late morning on Tue 20Nov12. On Sat 1Dec12 afternoon, while reading chapter 9, I came back to read section 6.4 on type polymorphism and overloading, and also 6.5 on type equality that I skipped earlier. Finished the backtracking chap 6 read on that Saturday night.Started interesting-looking chapter 7 on scope and related issues on mid day Fri 23Nov12. About as interesting as chapter 6 mostly wasn't. Much of the chapter deals with interesting stack diagrams for various kinds of algorithms. Finished this very good chapter on Tue 27Nov12 afternoon. I noticed with this chapter especially, strong parallels to the great SICP book:Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science), which I read well into hyper long chapter 2 in Mar-Apr12, and have restarted reading SICP in section 2.2 on Mon 28Jan13.Long chapter 8 on control in sequential languages was started mid day of Wed 28Nov12. Blasting thru this rather interesting chapter quickly. It features discussions of exceptions and continuations mainly for Mitchell's favorite, ML, but also somewhat for C++ as a second language that handles these issues differently than ML's version. Near final 'Force' and 'Delay' techniques apply most straightforwardly to my own Scheme language and other versions of Lisp. Chapter 8 and Part 2 of this book complete on Fri 30Nov12 afternoon.Big start on chapter 9 on modularity and abstraction and part 3 of book on Fri 30Nov12 evening. Continuing that fair chapter, while going back to read skipped sections 6.4 and 6.5 in the next couple of days. Resumed chap 9 daytime Sun 2Dec12. Chapter getting tedious for this reader in its 9.3 modularity section. Skipped much on C++ in section 9.4 to finish most of tedious chapter 9 Tue 4Dec12 afternoon.Started chapter 10 on general object-oriented concepts, also on Tue 4Dec12 afternoon. Chap 10 shall be my last chapter to read in this book. For me, chapter 10, similarly to chapter 9, tends to be a tedious read. It appears that this reader might have done better to quit reading at end of Part 2 of this textbook. Chapter 10 and my reading of this book complete at 18:55 on Wed 5Dec12. Touched up the black marker over the cats and put the book back on shelf that night.Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 have been the more interesting ones for this reader.FOLLOW-UP READINGAfter going thru chapter 10 of this good book by John Mitchell, I've started the greatTypes and Programming Languages, which is a somewhat mathematical/logical 600 page text on computational type theory. Thru chapter 10 at least, this follow-on book by Benjamin Pierce is excellent for this reader. After reading most of both the present book by Mitchell and the Type Theory book by Pierce, that reading enabled me to restart reading SICP in early chapter 2, finishing that chapter on Thu 7Feb13, and continuing it with much better understanding than a year ago's reading in that great book.WHY THE THREE CATS ON THE COVER?One negative point about this book is its cover: Why on earth are there pictures of three species of large predatory cats on the cover of a general book on programming languages? After all, this isn't a zoology textbook! I found the cats to be unacceptable, and so completely blacked them out with a black marker, creating a big angular black smudge on the cover over them. Problem solved. I posted two photos of my altered copy on the page for this book on Mon 12Nov12. It seems odd that the normal pictures on the page for this book show the front cats being much 'taller' than on my copy, on which the top of the black cover-up is far below the title, and still covers the two front cats fully."},{"Title":"Concepts in Programming Languages","review":"I read this book out of interest in programming languages theory. I did not want to read a pure theoretical book but wanted to get an understanding on how important concepts are currently implemented in various different languages. This book does this job quite effectively. It also has a puritan theoretical flavor that I liked. It used ML for explaining important concepts and I think that is a right choice. It also has pointed out many good references at the end of every chapter in case one may want to explore more about a topic.

Had he put some decent effort in helping people actually understand ML, maybe it won't have been so frustrating (back then it was pre-2000, so there weren't many ML material available online - and you haven't heard of Google yet:-). For functional language, wouldn't Lisp be a better example for instructive purposes?Someone in the class at that time suggested him talk about scripting languages such as Perl (Python is now getting interesting).

Anyway: this - or rather: An Blascaod M&oacute;r - is the name of the largest of the Blaskets, a small group of Irish islands a few miles west of the Dingle peninsula, near Dunquin and Ballyferriter. A magical place - in the early eighties, my wife Jaane and I spent several wonderful holidays there.On one of those occasions, we were lucky enough to meet mr. Ray Stagles in person: an aimiable, interesting elderly gentlemen, who camped in a deserted cow shed close to the guesthouse we were staying in. At the time, there was no gas or electricity (and no roads, and no radio, and no tv, and no ...) on the island, so after dark all we could do was light a fire and tell each other stories; very appropriate, in this place with its long tradition of storytellers.Mr. Stagles was great at it. He probably isn't around anymore, but at least something of his warm spirit, his fondness of stories, his essence, can be found in the book he and his wife Joan wrote. A delight to read. But maybe I am prejudiced.Unfortunately, visiting the Great Blasket is not really an option nowadays, I'm afraid. I read somewhere the guesthouse was closed. However, there is a regular ferry service bow, so I wonder if that old magical atmosphere still can be found there - probably it was blown away by huge waves of tourists.Or maybe it isn't. I just don't know, for I haven't been there since 1985. We always have been afraid to return there, for Jaane and I would HATE to see or memories spoiled by harsh, modern reality.And of course, there always is this book - the best book in my Blasket library."},{"Title":"Performance of a 41 foot high geotextile wall","review":"My mother-in-law was born on the island and I try to read as many of the books about the island and its people that I can.We visited the island on our first trip to Ireland and stood among the ruins of her family home.

His review of The West and Christianity derive from a single outdated work from 1898. What the author fails to check is the 10 volume work by Pierre Duhem The System of the World which traces the history and rise of science in the West from the 1300's up to the present. The development of science from within the matrix of the medieval university system would be more enlightening than his chapter on various isolated conflicts between the church and individual scientists.The primary difference between Islam and Christianity, is that the Christian theologians emphasized God's rationality from the beginning while Islamic theologians over emphasized Allah's will to the extent of deny human free will and that laws could govern the universe. This led to the follies of Ghazzali that the author documents and those of other theologians trying to protect Allah's absolute freedomA while back, the Guardian published an odd commentary piece by Ajmal Masroor, the director of Communities in Action. It was odd because Masroor was openly proselytizing for Islam, wondering why former British Prime Minister Tony Blair didn't convert to Islam rather than to Catholicism. One doesn't usually see such open proselytizing in a major newspaper. In any case, in the course of his piece Masroor said this:According to Blair, Islam \\"extols science and knowledge and abhors superstition\\". I agree, but why has he embraced Catholicism with its history of hostility towards science and is embedded with superstition?Why indeed? I can't and won't speak for Blair, but the idea that Islam extols science while Christianity is hostile to it is historically and conceptually false. And it's an important question, not only for science, but also for the defense of the West in general against the civilizational challenge posed by the Islamic jihadists. In my book Religion of Peace?, therefore, I discuss it in detail, beginning with an explanation of the importance of the question from none other than Friedrich Nietzche, who once noted that \\"there is no such thing as science \`without any presuppositions.'...a philosophy, a \`faith,' must always be there first, so that science can acquire from it a direction, a meaning, a limit, a method, a right to exist.\\"It may be jarring to those who are accustomed to believing that faith and reason are perpetually at odds with each other, and that religion is an eternal enemy to science, but it is nevertheless a matter of historical fact that modern science has derived a great deal of its direction, meaning, limit, method, and right to exist from Christianity. It is likewise true, and probably just as jarring to those who assume that all religions are essentially identical in character, that Islam has not provided, either historically or in the present day, the same kind of impetus to its development.At Regensburg, Pope Benedict XVI observed that \\"for Muslim teaching, God is absolutely transcendent. His will is not bound up with any of our categories, even that of rationality.\\" The one hundred Muslim authorities who wrote an Open Letter to the Pope replied that \\"To say that for Muslims \`God's Will is not bound up in any of our categories' is also a simplification which may lead to a misunderstanding. God has many Names in Islam, including the Merciful, the Just, the Seeing, the Hearing, the Knowing, the Loving, and the Gentle....As this concerns His Will, to conclude that Muslims believe in a capricious God who might or might not command us to evil is to forget that God says in the Qur'an, Lo! God enjoins justice and kindness, and giving to kinsfolk, and forbids lewdness and abomination and wickedness. He exhorts you in order that ye may take heed (al-Nahl, 16:90). Equally, it is to forget that God says in the Qur'an that He has prescribed for Himself mercy (al-An'am, 6:12; see also 6:54), and that God says in the Qur'an, My Mercy encompasses everything (al-A\`raf 7:156). The word for mercy, rahmah, can also be translated as love, kindness, and compassion. From this word rahmah comes the sacred formula Muslims use daily, In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Is it not self-evident that spilling innocent blood goes against mercy and compassion?\\"Fair enough, although we have often seen the limitations within an Islamic context of condemning the spilling of \\"innocent blood\\": who is innocent? Under what circumstances? But aside from that, the authors of the Open Letter seem to be contradicting the Pope's point about the Islamic view of God, but they do not actually do so. In attempting to refute the idea that Islam envisions \\"a capricious God who might or might not command us to evil,\\" the writers offer a number of Qur'an quotes that assert that \\"God enjoins justice and kindness,\\" and is merciful and compassionate. Yet in noting that in Islam, Allah's \\"will is not bound up with any of our categories\\" and quoting Ibn Hazm saying \\"Were it God's will, we would even have to practise idolatry,\\" the Pope was not so much saying that in the Islamic view Allah would command his people to do evil, but that he might change the content of the concepts of good and evil. In other words, Allah would always enjoin \\"justice and kindness,\\" but what constitutes \\"justice and kindness,\\" just as what constitutes \\"innocent blood,\\" might change.This idea has extraordinarily important implications for the development of science. There is an odd passage in the Qur'an that sums up this perspective, and how it differs from the Judeo-Christian view of God: \\"The Jews say: Allah's hand is fettered. Their hands are fettered and they are accursed for saying so.\\" (5:64).The Jews, in their wickedness, claimed that \\"Allah's hand is fettered,\\" but in fact Allah's hand is not fettered. It is unclear what Jewish concept the Qur'an is referring to in this case, but the indignant response to it is clear: Allah's hand being unfettered is a vivid image of divine freedom. Such a God can be bound by no laws. Muslim theologians argued during the long controversy with the Mu\`tazilite sect, which exalted human reason beyond the point that the eventual victors were willing to tolerate, that Allah was free to act as he pleased. He was thus not bound to govern the universe according to consistent and observable laws. \\"He cannot be questioned concerning what He does\\" (Qur'an 21:23).Accordingly, there was no point to observing the workings of the physical world; there was no reason to expect that any pattern to its workings would be consistent, or even discernable. If Allah could not be counted on to be consistent, why waste time observing the order of things? It could change tomorrow. Stanley Jaki, a Catholic priest and physicist, explains that it was al-Ghazali, the philosopher that the authors of the Open Letter recommend to the Pope, who \\"denounced natural laws, the very objective of science, as a blasphemous constraint upon the free will of Allah.\\" He adds that \\"Muslim mystics decried the notion of scientific law (as formulated by Aristotle) as blasphemous and irrational, depriving as it does the Creator of his freedom.\\" Social scientist Rodney Stark adds that \\"it would seem that Islam has a conception of God appropriate to underwrite the rise of science. Not so. Allah is not presented as a lawful creator but is conceived of as an extremely active God who intrudes in the world as he deems it appropriate. This prompted the formation of a major theological bloc within Islam that condemns all efforts to formulate natural laws as blasphemy in that they deny Allah's freedom to act.\\"The great Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides (1135-1204) explained orthodox Islamic cosmology in these terms:Human intellect does not perceive any reason why a body should be in a certain place instead of being in another. In the same manner they say that reason admits the possibility that an existing being should be larger or smaller than it really is, or that it should be different in form and position from what it really is; e.g., a man might have the height of a mountain, might have several heads, and fly in the air; or an elephant might be as small as an insect, or an insect as huge as an elephant.This method of admitting possibilities is applied to the whole Universe. Whenever they affirm that a thing belongs to this class of admitted possibilities, they say that it can have this form and that it is also possible that it be found differently, and that the one form is not more possible than the other; but they do not ask whether the reality confirms their assumption. They say that the thing which exists with certain constant and permanent forms, dimensions, and properties, only follows the direction of habit, just as the king generally rides on horseback through the streets of the city, and is never found departing from this habit; but reason does not find it impossible that he should walk on foot through the place: there is no doubt that he may do so, and this possibility is fully admitted by the intellect.Similarly, earth moves towards the centre, fire turns away from the centre; fire causes heat, water causes cold, in accordance with a certain habit; but it is logically not impossible that a deviation from this habit should occur, namely, that fire should cause cold, move downward, and still be fire; that the water should cause heat, move upward, and still be water. On this foundation their whole fabric is constructed.This odd theory was derived entirely from the Islamic conviction of the absolute sovereignty of Allah. Relatively early in its history, therefore, science was deprived in the Islamic world of the philosophical foundation it needed in order to flourish. Consequently, Jaki observes, \\"the improvements brought by Muslim scientists to the Greek scientific corpus were never substantial.\\" The consequences of this have been far-reaching. Jaki details some of them:More than two hundred years after the construction of the famed Blue Mosque, W. Eton, for many years a resident in Turkey and Russia, found that Turkish architects still could not calculate the lateral pressures of curves. Nor could they understand why the catenary curve, so useful in building ships, could also be useful in drawing blueprints for cupolas. The reign of Suleiman the Magnificent may be memorable for its wealth of gorgeously illustrated manuscripts and princely paraphernalia, but for no items worth mentioning from the viewpoint of science and technology. At the Battle of Lepanto the Turkish navy lacked improvements long in use on French and Italian vessels. Two hundred years later, Turkish artillery was primitive by Western standards. Worse, while in Western Europe the dangers of the use of lead had for some time been clearly realized, lead was still a heavy ingredient in kitchenware used in Turkish lands.Those technological differences were decisive at the Battle of Lepanto, which took place on October 7, 1571. The Holy League, comprised of the Papal States, the Republic of Venice, Spain, Genoa, and others, defeated the Ottoman Turks in a decisive sea battle that significantly diminished the jihadists' chances to subdue all of Europe at that time. Stark explains: \\"The European galleys not only had far more and far better cannons than did the Turks but they no longer had their forward fire zone blocked by a high ramming beak - since they meant to blow the Turks out of the water, not ram into them. Firing powerful forward volleys, the Europeans annihilated Ottoman galleys while still rowing toward them; the Turks had to stop and turn sideways to fire, presenting much larger targets.\\"In contrast to the dogmatic stagnation of the Islamic world, science was able to flourish in Christian Europe during the same period because Christian scientists were working from assumptions derived from the Bible, which were very different from those that Muslims derived from the Qur'an. In the Old Testament, says Jaki, \\"the faithfulness of the God of history is supported not only with a reference to another saving intervention of God into human affairs, but very often also by a pointed and detailed reference to the faithfulness of the regular working and permanence of a nature created by God.\\" For example, God refers to the regularity of day and night to emphasize the permanence of his covenant with the Israelites, telling the prophet Jeremiah: \\"If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night will not come at their appointed time, then also my covenant with David my servant may be broken, so that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne...\\" (Jeremiah 33:20-21). The Psalmist speaks of God having \\"fixed all the bounds of the earth\\" (Psalm 74:17), and of his word as fixed as well: \\"For ever, O LORD, thy word is firmly fixed in the heavens\\" (Psalm 119:89). In these and many other similar passages, there is a strong sense of the stability of creation - a sine qua non of scientific investigation.Of course, the Qur'an contains similar affirmations: \\"The word of thy Lord doth find its fulfilment in truth and in justice: None can change His words: for He is the one who heareth and knoweth all\\" (6:115). However, even in the Qur'an itself Allah says that he does sometimes change his words: \\"None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, but We substitute something better or similar: knowest thou not that Allah hath power over all things?\\" (2:106).If Allah's \\"power over all things\\" extended to the ability to replace his own words with something \\"better or similar\\" but in any case contradictory, since otherwise the replacement wouldn't be necessary, then Muslims would find it difficult to accept the Jewish and Christian understanding that that God created the universe according to reliably observable laws, and, whether or not he is bound to do so, freely chose to uphold the laws that he created. \\"Islam,\\" notes Stark, \\"did not fully embrace the notion that the universe ran along on fundamental principles laid down by God at the creation but assumed that the world was sustained by his will on a continuing basis.\\"However, the idea that the universe did run \\"on fundamental principles laid down by God at the creation\\" gave a major impetus to the rise of modern science in Christian Europe. Christian mathematicians and astronomers knew that their investigations would lead to knowledge of the truth, because they believed that God had established the universe according to certain laws - laws that could be discovered through observation and study. St. Thomas Aquinas even goes so far as to assert that \\"since the principles of certain sciences -- of logic, geometry, and arithmetic, for instance -- are derived exclusively from the formal principals of things, upon which their essence depends, it follows that God cannot make the contraries of these principles; He cannot make the genus not to be predicable of the species, nor lines drawn from a circle's center to its circumference not to be equal, nor the three angles of a rectilinear triangle not to be equal to two right angles.\\"This is a far cry from Maimonides' depiction of Muslim philosophers envisioning elephants becoming snakes and fire turning cool. And to be sure, to a pious Muslim of Aquinas's day the idea that God could not do anything would have appeared as the highest form of blasphemy. It would have been equivalent to saying that \\"Allah's hand is fettered.\\" But Christians did not consider it blasphemous in the least. \\"The rise of science,\\" Stark explains, \\"was not an extension of classical learning. It was the natural outgrowth of Christian doctrine: nature exists because it was created by God. In order to love and honor God, it necessary to fully appreciate the wonders of his handiwork. Because God is perfect, that handiwork functions in accord with immutable principles. By the full use of our God-given powers of reason and observation, it ought to be possible to discover those principles.\\"The importance of this cannot be overemphasized. Stark concludes: \\"These were the crucial ideas that explain why science arose in Christian Europe and nowhere else.\\"Now wait a minute. Didn't modern science originate in the Islamic world?If you have received a modern education in a Western country, you may find Stark's statement implausible. After all, didn't modern science begin in the Islamic world? Didn't Muslims invent algebra, the astrolabe, and the zero? Didn't Muslims preserve the classics of ancient Greek philosophy while Europe was blinded to their value by a narrow Christian dogmatism? Weren't the great Islamic empires of the past the bright lights of civilization, while Christian Europe was comparatively barbaric and primitive? \\"For while [the Caliphs] al-Rashid [786-809] and al-Mamun [813-833] were delving into Greek and Persian philosophy,\\" according to historian Philip K. Hitti, \\"their contemporaries in the West, Charlemagne and his lords, were reportedly dabbling in the art of writing their names....No people in the early Middle Ages contributed to human progress as much as did the Arabs.\\"In fact, much of this has been exaggerated in regard to both Islam and Europe, often for quite transparent apologetic motives. The astrolabe was developed, if not perfected, long before Muhammad was born. The zero, which is often attributed to Muslims, and what we know today as \\"Arabic numerals\\" did not originate in Arabia, but in pre-Islamic India. Aristotle's work was preserved in Arabic not initially by Muslims at all, but by Christians such as the fifth century priest Probus of Antioch, who introduced Aristotle to the Arabic-speaking world. Another Christian, Huneyn ibn-Ishaq (809-873), translated many works by Aristotle, Galen, Plato and Hippocrates into Syriac. His son then translated them into Arabic. The Syrian Christian Yahya ibn \`Adi (893-974) also translated works of philosophy into Arabic, and wrote one of his own, The Reformation of Morals. His student, another Christian named Abu \`Ali \`Isa ibn Zur'a (943-1008), also translated Aristotle and others from Syriac into Arabic. The first Arabic-language medical treatise was written by a Christian priest and translated into Arabic by a Jewish doctor in 683. The first hospital was founded in Baghdad during the Abbasid caliphate -- not by a Muslim, but a Nestorian Christian. A pioneering medical school was founded at Gundeshapur in Persia -- by Assyrian Christians.In sum, there was a time when it was indeed true that Islamic culture was more advanced than that of Europeans, but that superiority corresponds exactly to the period when Muslims were able to draw on and advance the achievements of Byzantine and other civilizations. But when the Muslim overlords had taken what they could from their subject peoples, and the Jewish and Christian communities had been stripped of their material and intellectual wealth and thoroughly subdued, Islam went into a period of intellectual decline from which it has not yet recovered.Certainly Muslims have innovated at high levels. Civilized people owe a debt to Muslim believers such as Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (780-850), whose pioneering treatise on algebra, Al-Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah, gave algebra its name and enjoyed wide influence in Europe. (Al-Khwarizmi, of course, was following in the pioneering footsteps of Diophantus of Alexandria, who died late in the third Christian century.) Abu Raihan al-Biruni (973-1048) did groundbreaking work on calculating longitude and latitude. The Caliph Harun al-Rashid's son Abu Jafar al-Ma\`mun (786-833), who became caliph in 813, established professional standards for physicians and pharmacists. Abu Bakr al-Razi, or Rhazes (865-925), wrote lengthy treatises on medicine and alchemy that influenced the development of medical science and chemistry in medieval Europe. The famous Muslim philosopher Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980-1037) wrote a medical textbook that was preeminent among European doctors for five centuries, until the 1600s. The prolific scholar Abu \`Uthman \`Amr ibn Bahr al-Jahiz (776-868) wrote over two hundred books on a multitude of subjects: from politics (The Institution of the Caliphate) and zoology (the seven-volume Book of Animals) to cuisine (Arab Food), and day-to-day living (Sobriety and Mirth; The Art of Keeping One's Mouth Shut.) The mathematician Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham (965-1039) did early and influential work in optics.However, Stark points out that \\"Islamic scholars achieved significant progress only in terms of specific knowledge, such as certain aspects of astronomy and medicine, which did not require any general theoretical basis. And as time passed, even this sort of progress ceased.\\"\\"1001 Inventions\\" describes itself as \\"a unique UK based educational project that reveals the rich heritage that the Muslim community share with other communities in the UK and Europe.\\" It says that it is \\"a non-religious and non-political project seeking to allow the positive aspects of progress in science and technology to act as a bridge in understanding the interdependence of communities throughout human history\\" - and it does this by highlighting 1001 inventions that Muslims are supposed to have brought to the world. This exhibit is designed for maximum popular appeal: \\"1001 Inventions consists of a UK-wide travelling exhibition, a colourful easy to read book, a dedicated website and a themed collection of educational posters complementing a secondary school teachers' pack.\\" It invites participants to \\"Discover Muslim Heritage in our World in seven conveniently organised zones: home, school, market, hospital, town, world and universe.\\"Many of these 1001 inventions involve things on the order of \\"the world's first soft drink,\\" and the perspective of this enterprise's organizers comes clear from a section they include detailing astronomical revelations that can be found in the Qur'an. In a manner reminiscent of Khruschev-era Soviet propaganda about everything from baseball to zoology to Russians, it frequently asserts that innovations and discoveries usually attributed to Westerners actually originated in the Islamic world. \\"Abbas ibn Firnas,\\" we're told, \\"was the first person to make a real attempt to construct a flying machine and fly. His first flight took place in 852 in Cordoba when he wrapped himself in a loose cloak stiffened with wooden struts and jumped from the minaret of the Great Mosque of Cordoba. Though this attempt was unsuccessful, he continued working on improving his design.\\" And a bit more seriously, \\"the Polish scholar and inventor Copernicus is credited as the founder of modern astronomy. Historians have recently established that most of his theories were based on those of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi and Ibn Shatir. Ibn al-Shatir's planetary theory and models are exactly mathematically identical to those prepared by Copernicus over a century after him, which raised the issue of how Copernicus acquired such elements of information. The line of transmission lies in Italy where Greek and Latin materials that made use of al-Tusi's device were circulating in Italy at about the time Copernicus studied there.\\"Such assertions only highlight the discomfiture of those who make them. For if Muslims really did make innovations in aerodynamics, astronomy, and other fields long before Europeans did, what happened then? Why were the Europeans the ones who made use of these discoveries for technological advancement? Even if Copernicus (who came from a devout Catholic family and may have been a priest himself) was influenced by Ibn al-Shatir, which is not universally accepted, why didn't Muslims make use of the insights of Ibn al-Shatir the way Copernicus did? Ibn al-Shatir died in 1375, just under a hundred years before Copernicus was born in 1473. Yet in that century, and in the centuries thereafter, Islamic astronomers did nothing significant with their coreligionist's discoveries. If Islam contained the seeds of the high level of cultural attainment that the Islamic world enjoyed at its apex, why has it been unable to reverse its precipitous decline from those heights? Many Muslim and non-Muslim writers today answer this by blaming the West, but this just once again avoids the problem - for if Islam contains within it the means by which civilization can advance beyond anything the non-Muslim world has to offer, one would think that Muslims would be able to devise ways to circumvent the West's baneful influence.Anyway, while an endeavor like \\"1001 Inventions\\" may have its merits, it is noteworthy that there is no corresponding project spotlighting inventions by Christians. Of course, the organizers of \\"1001 Inventions\\" would probably respond that this is because it is only Muslims whose civilizations and achievements are being denigrated, and so only Muslims need to remind the world of their forefathers' attainments. Also, it is generally assumed that the worldview and history of the dominant culture in any given area are generally known. However, in this age of multiculturalism and a tendency toward suicidal self-incrimination in the West, that can no longer be taken for granted. With hatred for their own culture and history rampant among young people in the West, it is likely that few students in the West today are aware of the historical innovations for which Christians are responsible, including those which were not just incidentally developed in a Christian context, but which owed their existence in whole or part from Christian assumptions. Most people are likely unaware, for example, of the Catholic Church's pivotal role, which Woods details, in the development of the university, free market economics, and even secular legal codes. The Islamic world, of course, was among the beneficiaries of many of these Christian innovations, large and small. In the late fifteenth century, the Persian mystical poet Nur ad-Din Abd ar-Rahman Jami (1414-1492) said that his vision had become extremely poor, although \\"with the aid of Frankish glasses,\\" he could see things clearly again. Could the fatalism that is deeply rooted in the Islamic consciousness have retarded the development by Muslims of aids to vision?Stark also details some of the innovations and discoveries of Christian Europe, principally advances in production methods, navigation and war technology, and concludes: \\"All of these remarkable developments can be traced to the unique Christian conviction that progress was a God-given obligation, entailed in the gift of reason. That new technologies and techniques would always be forthcoming was a fundamental article of Christian faith. Hence, no bishops or theologians denounced clocks or sailing ships -- although both were condemned on religious grounds in various non-Western societies.\\" Indeed, clocks originated in medieval Catholic Europe, while in 1560, Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, the Austrian ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, wrote that his hosts had \\"never been able to bring themselves to print books and set up public clocks. They hold that their scriptures, that is, their sacred books, would no longer be scriptures if they were printed; and if they established public clocks, they think that the authority of their muezzins and their ancient rites would suffer diminution.\\" It was not until the mid-nineteenth century, time in which Islamic norms were on the defensive and in retreat, that the first public clock was installed in Constantinople; this may have been the first public clock erected in any Islamic country.The effects of the Christian openness to innovation and the Islamic resistance to it reverberate in many fields. Even in medicine, while the Islamic world points proudly to many early physicians and medical theorists, it was not a Muslim, but the Belgian physician and researcher Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564), who paved the way for modern medical advances when he published the first accurate description of human internal organs, De Humani Corporis Fabrica (On the Fabric of the Human Body) in 1543. Why was a Muslim not able to do this? Because Vesalius was able to dissect human bodies, while that practice was forbidden in Islam. What's more, Vesalius' book is filled with detailed anatomical drawings -- but also forbidden in Islam are artistic representations of the human body.Stark's reference to \\"the unique Christian conviction that progress was a God-given obligation\\" may strike some as odd in light of the fact that the Catholic Church condemned Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), the \\"father of science\\" himself, as a heretic for saying that the earth moved around the sun. Galileo and the Scopes Monkey Trial generally form the Catholic and Protestant bookends of the case that Christianity is anti-science. However, historian Thomas Woods notes of the former: \\"The one-sided version of the Galileo affair with which most people are familiar is very largely to blame for the widespread belief that the Church has obstructed the advance of scientific inquiry. But even if the Galileo incident had been every bit as bad as people think it was, John Henry Cardinal Newman, the celebrated nineteenth-century convert from Anglicanism, found it revealing that this is practically the only example that ever comes to mind.\\"The myth is that an obscurantist Church blinded by dogma, hounded and condemned Galileo because Church officials could not square the idea that the earth moved around the sun with Scriptural declarations such as \\"Thou didst set the earth on its foundations, so that it should never be shaken\\" (Psalm 104:5). Reality was not quite so pat. In fact, Jesuit astronomers were among Galileo's earliest and most enthusiastic supporters. When Galileo first published supporting evidence for the Copernican heliocentric theory, Cardinal Maffeo Barberini (1568-1644), the future Pope Urban VIII - the Pope of whom he was later to run afoul - sent him a letter of congratulations. When Galileo visited Rome in 1624, Urban VIII, who had become Pope the year before, welcomed the scientist, gave him gifts, and assured him that the Church would never declare heliocentrism heretical. This is odd behavior on Barberini's part if he thought that Galileo was a heretic for teaching heliocentrism. In reality, the Pope and other churchmen, according to historian Jerome Langford, \\"believed that Galileo might be right, but they had to wait for more proof.\\"What about the Biblical passages that seemed to teach that the Earth did not move? Cardinal Robert Bellarmine (1542-1621) explained that \\"if there were a real proof...that the sun does not go round the earth but the earth round the sun, then we should have to proceed with great circumspection in explaining passages of Scripture which appear to teach the contrary, and rather admit that we did not understand them than declare an opinion to be false which is proved to be true. But as for myself, I shall not believe that there are such proofs until they are shown to me.\\" And that was the ultimate source of Galileo's conflict with the Church: he was teaching as fact what still at that time had only the status of theory. When Church officials asked Galileo in 1616 to teach heliocentrism as theory rather than as fact, he agreed; however, in 1632 he published a new work, Dialogue on the Great World Systems, in which he presented heliocentrism as fact again.That was why Galileo was put on trial for suspected heresy and placed under house arrest; an order that he not be allowed to publish was not enforced. Historian J. L. Heilbron notes that from the beginning the controversy was not understood the way it has been presented by many critics of the Church since then. The condemnation of Galileo, says Heilbron, \\"had no general or theological significance. Gassendi, in 1642, observed that the decision of the cardinals [who condemned Galileo], though important for the faithful, did not amount to an article of faith; Riccioli, in 1651, that heliocentrism was not a heresy; Mengeli, in 1675, that interpretations of Scripture can only bind Catholics if agreed to at a general council; and Baldigiani, in 1678, that everyone knew all that.\\"Speaking about the Galileo case in 1992, Pope John Paul II remarked:From the beginning of the Age of Enlightenment down to our own day, the Galileo case has been a sort of \\"myth\\", in which the image fabricated ou"},{"Title":"The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World","review":"Charles Freeman in the Greek Achievement (The Foundations of the Western World) will take the reader through 1,500 years of history that is fascinating, entertaining, and enlightening.

If you have any interest in the classical world, this would be a great place to start.Now I know a little something about boring history books. I majored in history and even taught it at the high school level for a short time.

Although it concentrates heavily on the Athenian contribution to history, it does not stop with the end of the classical period as if nothing of importance had happened after the end of the Peloponnesian War. From notes by professional reviewers I had understood that Charles Freeman was a British professor, so I found most unusual his use of translations of Greek and Latin texts by other authors, even of quotes of translations quoted by other secondary sources (p. 189). This left me with a feeling that the author's credentials might be a little weak. He definitely offers little that is new with respect to the interpretation of historic events, art, architecture, etc, but he does offer insight into the history of the West's concept of Greek achievement. I had already learned of the painted surfaces and crowded display of statuary that we now see as pristine white marble displayed with great care, individually in our museums world wide. What I hadn't quite understood was the degree to which the character of ancient Greek culture, even of the notion of &quot;Greece&quot; and &quot;Greek,&quot; had been filtered through the prism of the 19th Century psyche, particularly those of scholar Robert Wood, art historian Johann Winkelmann, and financier and adventurer Heinrich Schliemann. For anyone wanting to find out about the overall events of the period this is a good place to start. There is an excellent date list with summary of events and artistic examples on pages 445 to 462, which might help the survey student study for exams, and a list of books on various topics (with publication dates from the mid 80's to the mid 90's) with which to follow up on selected subjects.

It took me quite a while to finish it, but it was definitly worth it."},{"Title":"The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World","review":"At first, when I started reading this book, I thought I was going to be disappointed with its non-academic purpose. I've seen many works destined to the general reader which lack depth or are simply too plain on their approach. No footnotes, not even mention to the exact passages of ancient authors; I was prepared not to like it.Mr. Freeman's book surprised me. Most of all, his writing style flows with ease and is extremely enjoyable to read. I finished its almost 500 pages in three days... Unlike many books about ancient Greece, it has a good space for discussion of Roman influence on the Greek world (going further until the end of Antiquity), as well as up-to-date information on the new historiography trends of gender and approach to slavery. It also includes information from recent archaeology discoveries, and the discussions on Greek architecture and art are very interesting.On the whole, despite a couple of almost annoying repetitions of the same examples over the text, this book is a refreshing approach not only for the general reader, but also as a relief from some heavy, opinionated schorlarly texts on the same subject."},{"Title":"The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World","review":"Charles Freeman's &quot;The Greek Achievement&quot; is a solid survey of the culture and achievements of ancient Greece. It is packed with information and may, at times, be a little overwhelming for those not familiar with the subject...especially as it does not pull together and develop any one aspect of Greek history. But, as to its purpose, Freeman does a commendable job and this book should be read by anyone interested in ancient Greece. My only arguments with Freeman are that he doesn't develop the rise of independent agriculture to explain the change in culture that took place at the end of the Greek Dark Age, and that he somewhat misses the boat on the relationships between men and women. During the Greek Dark Age, for example, he reveals that women of the higher classes &quot;have a status of their own, as acceptable marriage partners...and also as overseerers of the domestic arrangements of the household, the oikos, but often there is found something more, the adulation of a woman for herself....&quot; Women were often viewed as goddesses in ancient Greece. But, in his chapter on relationships between the sexes, Freeman never seems quite sure just what the real situation is. He seems to imply that this situation changed dramatically somehow and that the status of women declined. Then he acknowledges that &quot;as so often, the Athenian evidence may not be typical of women's lives in Greece as a whole.&quot; The chapter, as a whole, is very weak and gives far too much credence to the absurd views of the radical feminist writer Eva Keul. One should start learning about this subject by reading Thornton's &quot;Eros: The Myth of Ancient Greek Sexuality.&quot; All in all, however, Freeman does a nice job and is to be commended for his summation of a vast amount of material despite little originality."},{"Title":"The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World","review":"If you are looking for just one book to do a solid job in surveying the history and contributions of the Ancient Greeks this would probably be the one to buy.Freeman's narrative skills are very good, and he makes reading \\"dry history\\" a treat.

I found it honestly a whole lot more interesting to read than Kitto's book (which still remains the authoratative source on the cultural aspects of Ancient Greece), but I realise that there are some faults as well: the military history was not covered to my liking and there was a lot about the economic nature of the empire that remains conjecture. Although these criticisms of mine are probably just personal qualms.All in all a good read and my pick for a good overview of Ancient Greek civilisation. A good one for the plane whilst on your way to the Ageaen."},{"Title":"The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World","review":"I knew nothing about ancient Greece before this book, but now I have a real non-idealistic picture of Ancient Greek life. Why? Because this book treats you like a laymen and not a scholar. You see it sucks you in by addressing more contemporary curiosities (like what's up the the man on boy love?) rather than seeming more like second period history class. I really enjoyed it, but like you I wanted to make sure I picked the right introduction into Ancient Greece. Yes the names, dates, and places are there; but mixed in a sea of interesting stories difficult not to enjoy. Only obvious flaw (due to the number of pages) is that the book is very thorough. But if you were getting married, wouldn't you want to know everything about your partner? That's how I feel about my Greek History! Enjoy"},{"Title":"The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World","review":"I traveled to Greece recently, and have read over a dozen books, both recent & 'classic' histories, books about Greek culture, military, art, poetry etc. Freeman is in a class by himself. His book is the most thorough, well written and fascinating. I loved his attitude. He is almost unique in his honest and fair appraisal of ancient Greek culture, the good, the bad, all of it. That seems to have made some reviewers unhappy. I loved it. The discussion of 18 and 19th century European discovery of the ancient Greeks and how they santized things they couldn't respect was especially interesting - in itself, and because of our culture wars today. Much of classical over-idealization of ancient Greece (which tended to idealize itself, too!) grew out of the work of homosexual and antisemitic GErman scholars, and a British elite that admired the aristocratic, anti-democratic strands they could pull out of Greek culture - it's a very interesting piece of intellectual history. The Greeks were masters of beauty and thought, but they were moral midgets. That bothers some people. I loved being told the truth."},{"Title":"The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World","review":"The Greek Achievement by Charles Freeman portrays a unique perspective on Greek history by explaining its many accomplishments, along with much criticism as well. Although Freeman explains much of the splendor of the Greeks, he seems to focus on criticizing the Greeks for their faults, and seemed to spend more time searching for faults rather than giving credit where it is due. Although the author seems to elaborate on the negative aspects of Greek history, it seems that he does this with excellence, because it demonstrates a great contrast to traditional praise of Greek achievements by use of valid evidence."},{"Title":"The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World","review":"Perhaps the best feature of this extremely well written and lucid text is the ability to selectively read the thematically differentiated chapters. While I read the book from cover to cover and there is a general chronology to the text, the reader could easily jump from section to section based on personal interest. Academic writing that is not obtuse or overly theoretical is often hard to come by. As a previous writer stated, there is perhaps not much interpretation involved, but the overall structure of the text is truly remarkable and should take precedence to any criticism."},{"Title":"The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World","review":"I don't know why Amazon didn't include the reviews of the hardcover here so the interested reader should refer to those, too!Freeman gives a very broad overview of the Greek civilization from its beginnings till Roman times. What I like about the book is the way the Greek world is presented. It is sorted following time but for many periods it also contains separate chapters on different topics. For instance, there is a chapter on the development of theater, there is a chapter on science, a chapter of philosophy (which I found somewhat weak). So one gets a good introduction into the events which happened but also into the intellectual and sociological development of the Greek civilization. It is debatable whether certain points have to be made the way Freeman makes them. One of the reviewers of the hardcover said he didn't like what Freeman had to say about the roles of women and slaves. Well, I guess if you're into history you're still a child of your time so you'll follow all the fads and actual movements. I disagree with that reader that Freeman's book suffers from his chapter on the role of women. To summarize, this is a very nice and enjoyable review of Greek history and it will leave you with a lot of knowledge about what happened then and how &quot;Western Civilization&quot; was influenced by it."},{"Title":"The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World","review":"Unfortunately the author has missed a great opportunity to introduce the Glory that was Greece to the general reader. While he does a credible job of delineating the achievements of the ancient Greeks, his decision to dwell on the irrelevant issues of slavery and the treatment of women tarnishes his work. In comparison to less developed cultures both then and now the ancient Greeks were probably much more civilized in their behavior toward slaves and women. The classification of woman into three categories the child bearer, the prostitute and the courtesan or hetaera was particularly civilized and probably did more to channel the Greek male spirit and intellect toward the accomplishments that were the foundations of Western Civilization, the pinnacle of human achievement. If the author was interested in discussing these issues then he could have made a much more interesting case had he discussed how slavery and the role of women enabled the Greek achievement rather to criticize the ancient Greeks for having slaves and for there treatment of women and thereby somehow attempt to diminish their tremendous achievements. The author's transparent attempt to mollify the current and prevailing banal multiculturalism made for a difficult read. If one approaches the book from the point of view that the author is obviously caught up in the current egalitarian fad then one can filter out the bias and truly appreciate the Greek Achievement."},{"Title":"The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World","review":"It is obvious that when he wrote this book Freeman had an agenda. There is so much that is wrong with Freeman's thesis that it is difficult to know where to begin. Freeman is attempting to show that the Greek achievement is an exaggeration that has led to, among other things, Hitler.Freeman criticises the Greeks for their practice of slavery. He attributes both the abolition of slavery and the elevation of the status of women to Christian morality: \\"The flaw of the Greek political system was that it never developed a theory of human rights. Rights and duties were assigned not on a universal basis but on the grounds of status and sex. It is in the Christian tradition with its emphasis that each soul is of equal interest to God that the possibilities of such rights lay, even if they were not fully articulated, as \\"natural rights,\\" before the eighteenth century. So the religion that destroyed the Greek way of thinking also provided the means of resolving its greatest flaw. Such are the paradoxes of history.\\" p.443. \\"Aristotle argued that there was a hierarchy in nature, in the way, for instance, human beings controlled animals. Similarly within human society experience suggested there were natural hierarchies. Aristotle noted how men ruled over women, children, and slaves...\\" p. 282In his haste to level criticism at Aristotle (and the Greeks in general) & claim that Aristotelian hierarchic ideas predisposed the Greeks to endorse slavery, he omits what Aristotle himself wrote in his definition of man:\\"...whiteness or blackness in a man does not produce a specific difference, nor would there be even if a single name was introduced for each... Nor are men species of men because of matter, even though the flesh and bones from which A and B are composed are other ... Nor is there, then a specific difference between a bronze and a wooden circle...\\" Aristotle, Metaphysics. Book Iota, 9.Additionally, Freeman totally omits any mention of Alkimadas (Alcimadas) fo Elaea's \\"Messenian Oration\\", in which Alkidamas proclaimed \\"God left all men free; Nature has made no man a slave.\\" Freeman makes his assertion solely by omission to permit himself to falsely claim that the Bible instead makes all men equal.The following passages from the Bible though, illustrate well enough what the position of Judaism and Christianity is on slavery and racial purity:\\"When YHWH your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess... and has delivered them [the peoples of those lands] over to you and you have defeated them, then you must destroy them totally. Make no treaty with them and show them no mercy. Do not intermarry with them.... Break down their alters, smash their sacred stones... For you are the people holy to YHWH your God. YHWH your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people, his treasured possession.\\" Deuteronomy 7.1-6\\"Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you... You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you... they will become your property.\\" Leviticus 25.44-46Joshua 23.12-13 (OT) insists that if the holy race intermarries with others then they will be abandoned by god. And in the New Testament:\\"Slaves obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.\\" Ephesians 6.5 (Also, Colossians 3.22; 1 Peter 2.18; Titus 2.9-10)Instead of providing edicts against slavery or racism, the Judaeo/Christian position demands racial purity and slavery, and worse still, even defines a believer's right to enslave women purely for sexual gratification:\\"When you go to war against your enemies and YHWH your God delivers them into your hands and you take captives, if you notice among the captives a beautiful woman and are attracted to her you may take her as your wife... After she has lived in your house and mourned her father and mother [whom you have killed] for a full month, then you may go to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife.\\" Deuteronomy 21.10-13According to Freeman's book the unbridled celebration of the Greek Achievement gave rise to Hitler. Freeman should have looked at his Bible first."},{"Title":"Catholic for a Reason III: Scripture and the Mystery of the Mass","review":"This book is filled with short essays (10-15 pages) written by top Catholic apologists on different aspects of the sacrifice of the mass. Some essays are more apologetical in nature; others are evangelistic or catechetic. All in all, this is a wonderful place to learn more about the mass."},{"Title":"Catholic for a Reason III: Scripture and the Mystery of the Mass","review":"This collection of weighty essays on the Mass give ample reason to be Catholic. Indeed, it would seem *the* reason to look closely at the Catholic expression of Christian worship. Interesting too that so many of the authors are converts from other traditions, reminding us again how \\"cradle-Catholics\\" too often seem to have neglected such great treasures in their tradition.A short review could, in no way, convey the depth and breadth of these essays. However, just to provide a quick overview, here is a sampling of what you will find. From Dr. Edward Sri we are given a solid linking of the Mass as it is revealed in scripture. This is not the kind of appeal many Christians of other traditions may be prepared for - but it is the traditional Catholic approach of conveying, \\"this is what the Church has always taught and scripture bears witness to that fact.\\" Exceeding simple proof-texting, Dr. Sri gives us a depth and direction to scripture in the context of the Church's teaching.Those familiar with Dr. Hahn's work will still be thrilled with the insights that can be gleaned when one sees how the Church has always viewed the Eucharist as Parousia. This is indeed one of the keys to the early church on the topic of the Eucharist as well. It is, as always from Dr. Hahn, a unique and deep study one could read over and over again.Tim Gray provides my personal favorite in showing the link between the ancient Jewish Todah sacrifice. Jewish tradition indicated that only the Todah would remain for eternity. This perspective of the Mass gives us perhaps the most striking continuity to our Jewish roots. It is a fascinating study that gives much food for deep meditation and discussion. This essay alone is worth the price of the book but then there is so much more as well.Another wonderful link of continuity with Judaism is found in the liturgical calendar's link to the Jewish feasts as described in Sean Innerst's essay. The topic may not excite a lot of readers but I found myself deeply moved as I read. You will not want to overlook this gem.Jeff Cavins provides a wonderful introduction to the problem of suffering as expressed in the Mass. It is both emotionally stirring and intellectually satisfying.The final essay from Kimberly Hahn is a comparison of the Eucharist to marriage. It is a fitting wrap-up to this collection and gives us a better sense of the great mystical bond we have with our bridegroom.There are many other essays well worth greater study and I hate to have skipped over so many. But every essay you will find rewarding and thought-provoking stirring you up to love and good works."},{"Title":"Radio-activity","review":"A review of the knowledge of radioactivity as of 1905 by the one who had done more than any other to establish it.

Moments before General Smith arrives, a man identifying himself as Dr. Bush warns the boys to beware of General Smith. Shortly thereafter a woman calls to warn the boys about Dr. Bush. While the boys are discussing the phone calls a person calling himself General Smith shows up at the Hardy home. The boys are concerned about General Smith's animated behavior and act strangely themselves. The boys' behavior becomes more bizarre when Dr. Bush calls again and Joe Hardy and Chet Morton rush off to see if they can intercept Dr. Bush. After Joe and Chet return, the tension between the boys and General Smith threatens to erupt when Fenton Hardy arrives and greets General Smith as an old friend.Frank and Joe Hardy and Chet Morton have become involved in a Smith family mystery that dates back to the Civil War. Beauregard Smith, a cousin of General Smith's great-grandfather, promised to bury his gold and the local bank's gold if enemy troops got too close. Three generations of Smiths have unsuccessfully attempted to discover the hiding place of the gold. General Smith asks Fenton Hardy to take on the case. However, Fenton has other commitments and sends Frank, Joe and Chet to begin the investigation.The boys and General Smith follow a series of clues, hoping that the clues will eventually lead them to the treasure. The boys soon encounter mysterious Professor Randolph and other suspicious characters, including Junior, Hank and Smiley, who may also be searching for the treasure. As the search for the treasure progresses the danger increases. Frank and Joe are kidnapped, Chet is ambushed and someone shoots at the boys in one of the most exciting and interesting Hardy Boys books to this point in the series.The first 29 Hardy Boys books have been a bumpy ride in quality. However, this book fulfills the promise of the teaser and is a thrilling book that even many teens might enjoy.The Hardy Boys series is recommended for ages 8 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14. However, this book in the series contains many interesting moments and will keep most readers guessing the answers to the mysteries until the author reveals the final solution."},{"Title":"The Secret of the Lost Tunnel (Hardy Boys, Book 29)","review":"This review concerns the original 1950 edition. Frank, Joe and Chet travel to the southern U.S. to help a retired general find a fortune lost during the civil war. This was a really good book; it was well written and had a lot of action. Two things that I liked about this book were that unlike some books where Frank and Joe have little contact with the criminals until the last chapters, in this book they were constantly running into the crooks, also, there was actually a mystery to solve in this book (the location of the treasure), instead of some other volumes where Frank and Joe are merely trying to capture a certain gang.

If you're thinking about buying this book, I would recommend that you go to the library instead and read whichever version they happen to have on hand, even if it dates back to the early 90s. On the other hand, if you don't know anything about the reputation of particular schools, this book can be helpful in giving you a snapshot view.

While reading the latest edition, I noticed that the only info that had been updated was the stats--most of the reviews and anecdotes about each school were the same--and I mean word for word!

As previous reviews have noted, some of the material is also outdated.One specific example... Their profile of Boston College Law, which is one of only two Jesuit law schools in the US, fails to mention this important fact. The BCLS literature dedicates the the first five or so pages of its current bulletin to explaining the importance of the Jesuit tradition to the School... meanwhile \\"Inside the Law Schools\\" publicizes the fact that BCLS has a \\"mercifully short application form\\" as one of the features that makes it unique.

Citing Meister Eckhart, Thomas Aquinas, Hildegard von Bingen, the Bhagavad Gita, Tao Te Ching, Studs Terkel, Patch Adams, and progressive economists, Fox explores the concept of work and how it can be healthier physically, emotionally, and intellectually, but primarily socially, environmentally, and spiritually.Fox believes that the Enlightenment and the industrial age have left us with a machine-centered, anthropocentric world that focuses on outer work and rewards at the cost of inner work and spirituality, and destroys rather than creates. Real wealth results from preserving the health of the planet, not in the artificiality of money or possessions. The result has been a world often at war, where the gaps between affluent and poor continue to spread, where the environmental health of non-industrialised nations is sacrificed for the comforts of the industrialised, and where the work that is available and that most people have serves machines and leaves the worker stressed, addicted to work, ill, angry and even violent, and unfulfilled intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually.Fox cites mystics like Eckhart and Aquinas to show that they understood what is important and that they prophetically understood the traps that man is prone to fall into. He also recounts the stories of people who reinvent themselves through work, who are willing to sacrifice position and possessions to find an avocation that matters, like the man who gives up a high-paying position to become a fireman and who is ecstatic about the meaning it brings to his life.Fox carefully sets up all that is wrong with our modern concept of work and, indeed, life, since so much of who we are, how we feel, and how we live is tied up in what we do for a living, or what we mistakenly call \\"work.\\" His proposed solutions are centered around creation spirituality, which is a \\"creation-centered mysticism that is also prophetic and socially transformative.\\" While creation spirituality is not very clearly defined here-Fox has written several other books about it and refers to them-it appears to center around the idea that creation comes from within and that we create our world, which is part of a greater, interdependent cosmos that continues to undergo creation. For Fox, \\"enlightenment\\" might mean recognising and embracing creation spirituality and our responsibility and role in the ongoing creation of the cosmos-a recognition that begins with inner work and extends outer work, and that redefines wealth and poverty. Fox is quick to point out that this is neither communism nor socialism, both of which suffer from the same destructive values as capitalism.There are many elements involved in creation spirituality, which embraces many aspects of life that have been neglected, distorted, or abused, from education, health care, art, psychology, and sexuality to something he believes is critical yet missing or misused-ritual. In creation spirituality and the reinvention of work, properly conceived and performed ritual is meaningful, bringing people together, bringing out emotions, and acknowledging what has been done in the name of war, destruction, and hate. Ritual can also be playful and energising, for example, circle dances. Whatever the focus, ritual brings us together to share our common joys and sorrows. Ritual heals.Mysticism appeals to me, and Fox's assessments of what's wrong and what could be done to change our course make sense and are supported by the quotes he provides from a broad array of sources, including psychologists, economists, writers, and artists. The consequences of not changing are clear, but it is equally clear that those consequences have not penetrated to either the masses or their leaders. (Even the rising price of gasoline in 2005 has not inspired any more than cautious apprehension.) We are like smokers who are able to quit our habit only when terminal lung cancer has been diagnosed.To get billions of conditioned consumers (and their consumers-in-training children) to give up their increasingly complex lifestyles, comforts, and amusements in the interest of a healthier, more just world for all and for better personal mental and physical health requires a utopian change that most people will not embrace. As with the Woolgers in their book, The Goddess Within, Fox tries to find a movement in the mid-1990s that has not materialised yet. Generally, people do not choose to change; they are forced to. Perhaps someday, when the gaps have widened too far, and society and our home can no longer support our appetites (and the corresponding waste), we may be ready to listen to Fox and his adherents, at which point they will need to provide practical answers. Who will \\"make ritual\\"? Who will produce the necessities and how? Who will distribute them? How will they be paid, or what will replace a monetary/barter economy? What if there is imbalance between what people want to do and what needs to be done? In practical, everyday terms, what does the reinvention of work look like? And do I want to live long enough to experience the disasters that are likely to be required to bring it about?Eckhart, Aquinas, von Bingen, the Bhagavad Gita, Tao Te Ching-all wise beyond their times. And beyond ours as well.Diane L. Schirf, 21 August 2005."},{"Title":"The Reinvention of Work: A New Vision of Livelihood for Our Time","review":"The Reinvention of Work changed the way I view work. As a Career Counselor I realized new ways to work with clients. The book helps one go deeper into understanding what we are really all about in relationship to work. It is not a self-help book and does not profess to be one. The book helps us step outside of ourselves and to consider what is important to each of us in our work beyond the paycheck. It truly creates a vision of what our work life can be if we take the time to listen to our inner wisdom."},{"Title":"The Reinvention of Work: A New Vision of Livelihood for Our Time","review":"Like most of Fox's books, this one ranges from the sublime (the cosmic implications of &quot;true work&quot;) to the ridiculous (there's nothing sillier than a celibate priest writing about sex). And Fox's ego is far too much in evidence at times. Still, I'd recommend this book to anyone who's trying to rethink their relationship to &quot;work.&quot; I picked it up at a time when I was undergoing immense life and career changes. Although it wasn't much help in practical decision-making, it did give me a fresh perspective on how my values related to the jobs I'd had (they didn't), and got me thinking about how I could translate them into work I felt better about. Also, although I'm a former Catholic and hypersensitive to writers who try to force their doctrinal perspective on you, I felt that Fox generally managed to be spiritual without being sectarian (that's probably why he's no longer a Catholic!). In general, this book has a lot to recommend it, although keeping your tongue in your cheek at times is strongly advised."},{"Title":"The Reinvention of Work: A New Vision of Livelihood for Our Time","review":"Matthew Fox (born 1940) is a theologian and bestselling advocate of \\"Creation Spirituality.\\" He became a Catholic priest of the Dominican order, but was removed in 1992, and has subsequently become an Episcopalian priest.

Our minds never know too much. Our minds want to be stretched to experience the infinite, another word for which is Spirit.\\"\\"I believe that where life is most desperate ... art is the answer. Let me propose a wild and necessary idea: a series of art/entertainment universities set up in the inner cities of the United States... I believe such universities would succeed. Why? Because many unemployed persons would attend, drawn by art's natural attraction.\\"\\"As I see it, the most important work of our time is work on the human species itself. This is how we will both reinvent work and redeem the work worlds in which we operate.\\""},{"Title":"The Reinvention of Work: A New Vision of Livelihood for Our Time","review":"A wide ranging exploration of the meaning of work and a call for its resacralization from a creatively radical priest, this book offers both challenge and hope. Noting that hunter/gatherer societies had no unemployment whereas modern industrial society now forces more than one sixth of the planetary population into that state as a permanent condition, Fox pronounces the system a failure. We have created jobs without meaning and devastated the earth in the process. His call is for a redefinition of wealth and a return to the roots of \\"economy\\" which originally meant running a home. He suggests that there is no intrinsic reason to value scarce metals and gems, gold is only valuable because those who hold it claim it to be so. Fox suggests that real wealth is having our house in order, having a biosphere that supports life, having a sufficiency of material necessary for participation in the creative work of the Universe. His perspective is deeply spiritual, seeing humanity's role as inseparable from the work of God, all that is, the Tao, the Cosmic Christ ... his definition of our source is widely inclusive. In fact, his view is so inclusive that it begs me to ask, \\"Why include religiosity at all?\\" If we look around at what needs to be done, Fox suggests, our work is plain. There can be no unemployment in a society which values life as the highest goal. Notwithstanding his religious hang-up, the breadth of Fox's view is delightful and surprising. In conjunction with theorizing, he offers practical ways to renew ourselves and our perspective on work. He suggests that vegetarianism, recycling, bicycling, farming organically, adopting clean energy systems, taking back our entertainment hours from industrial producers, studying, becoming activists, stabilizing population and investing responsibly are expressions of an urgently needed new ethic. He argues that we are sacred, life is sacred, our work must be sacred too. Well, okay. But the suggestions work just as well if one strips out the putative sanctification and simply honors the living system that supports us. From a book laced with pertinent and thought provoking quotes, I will conclude with this. \\"A person works in a stable. That person has a breakthrough. What does she do?

There was a sudden switch in climate in the late Middle Ages, the decade 1310-1320 was disastrous and many starved. By the beginning of the 15th century the seas around Greenland had frozen and the old Viking population had died out. The River Thames regularly froze over. Storms were severe and in 1413 the Scottish town of Forvie was covered by what is now a 30m high sand dune. Although scientists are divided there seems to be a correlation between sunspot activity and climate change. During the Medieval Optimum solar activity may have been double today's and it was during the mini ice age that followed that solar activity dropped to a low level.Sunspot activity, on an 11-year cycle, peaked in 1969 and 1979 and was preceded by troughs in 1964 and 1976. Over a period of 90,000-100,000 years the earth shifts its course around the sun from one that is circular to one that is more elliptical. There is another cycle every 25,000 years when the Northern Hemisphere enjoys its summer when closest to the sun. Then there is the Milankovich Wobble, which may be the impetus that switches one climate regime to another. Interglacial periods last about 10,000 years with glacial periods, when ice sheets 1km thick have stretched from NY State to the Rockies, of about 90,000 years. We are due for an ice age but perhaps this is being offset by global warming.The equator receives 2.5 times as much energy as the poles and if that energy was not distributed by the winds, oceans and forests the equator would be 14C warmer and the poles 25C colder than today. Although the winds have a lower thermal capacity than water, in a week the atmospheric jet streams can distribute the ash from volcanic eruptions throughout the world. The Gulf Stream, equivalent to 100 river Amazons carries to the north water 8C warmer than the returning, deep, cold water. Tropical forests transfer prodigious quantities of energy in the form of water vapor by taking up latent heat which is carried away in massive rain clouds, with the heat being distributed by air currents in higher latitudes. This energy transfer is the equivalent of six million atomic bombs daily over the Amazon Basin.Climate has clanged dramatically and rapidly over the last 1000 years and it appears that we are now living through one of those periods. Since the industrial revolution man has increasingly affected nature's processes. Since the war we have added to the atmosphere three times the CO2 released by mankind over the rest of time put together. Models indicate that temperatures will rise by 0.4C per decade due to CO2 build up - an increase which is unprecedented in human history. Rain forests act as regulators of atmospheric and ocean systems but their wholesale destruction over the last 40 years has seriously jeopardized the efficiency with which energy is transferred from the equator to higher latitudes resulting in a greater area of ocean warming up. Hurricanes occur when the ocean temperature is over 26C to a considerable depth. 1995 was a record year with 16 hurricanes. In one day a full-blown hurricane may unleash the energy equivalent of half a million Hiroshima-sized bombs. The El Nino has changed in the last 30 years from once or perhaps twice per decade to several years running; two in the past 15 years may have been stronger than any in the last five centuries. The latest El Nino, with temperature rises of 6C involved massive releases of energy from the Pacific Ocean, with violent downpours in desert regions and droughts elsewhere. Farmers had their crops wiped out. The Goddard Space Center reports a surface loss of Greenland's ice sheet of about 30cms per year. Mean annual temperatures 1m below the surface in Canada have increased 1C since 1989. An increase of only 0.25% in the fresh water flowing into the North Atlantic will bring the warm northward flowing Gulf Stream to a shuddering halt. Global warming is more intense over the poles.Man is managing 40% of the land surface for production but a reliable food base requires that climate remains within reasonable limits. Insurers tell us that the cost of natural disasters has risen 85 times since the 1960s indicating that serious changes are taking place. With more frequent El Ninos rainfall becomes unpredictable. With warmer oceans, hurricanes become more frequent. With melting ice caps the flow of the Gulf Stream might be affected and temperatures in Northern Europe would plunge. The unpredictability and rapidity of climate change has very serious consequences for agriculture and feeding people. For the first time in modern history US grain production fell below consumption in the 1988 drought. Normally the US provides half the world's grain exports. Demand for grain is rising as more people in developing countries eat meat. One-third of grain feeds animals. The rise in sea level, likely to be greater than currently predicted, would threaten one-third of the world's cropland.There is still disagreement whether it is best to carry on with business-as-usual and pick up the bill later or to act now to reduce future costs. Peter Bunyard points out that we are woefully ignorant of our impact on the planet. We face the danger than many, interconnected, though separate positive feed backs could all be triggered at the same time, all acting synergistically to exaggerate the impacts of the others. We will never be truly effective while the earth's resources are handed over to corporate, profit-seeking interests. We need to learn how to manage ourselves and our relationship to the environment. Then we might have hope of bringing an end to the destruction that is threatening our very existence.dwillis@afs.edu.gr"},{"Title":"Behavior, Bias, and Handicaps: Labeling the Emotionally Disturbed Child (Observations in Education)","review":"at 15 I was dealing with a abusive father, a mom that didn't really care, and racists bullies at school.

Telling others the truth about our wretched condition before God, and His gracious provision in Christ is not optional. The problem with much of today's evangelism is that it is aimed at appealing to the hearer--the so-called &quot;seeker sensitive&quot; movement being a prime example. But if you have any experience with such methods, you know that they are ineffective at best, and harmful at worst. Kuiper gives evangelism the emphasis it deserves: a God centered presentation of the gospel. Yes, if you haven't figured it out yet, Kuiper is a Calvinist, and this book is simply a Calvinistic understanding of depravity, grace, and sovereignty. And yet, unlike many Calvinistic documents, this one gives asimple but effective instruction in the presentaion of the good news found in Jesus Christ. Tired of man-centered preaching that does no one any good? Let Kuiper show you the glory of God as you preach the gospel of God!"},{"Title":"God-centered evangelism;: A presentation of the Scriptural theology of evangelism","review":"R.B. Kuiper's God-Centred Evangelism, written in the mid-20th century, is as relevant now as it was when first printed by Banner of Truth in 1966. The book is Bible-saturated, clearly written and very helful. Each chapter begins with the word \\"God\\", focusing the reader's attention on the intent of the book. Much of the book is just an excellent review of the biblical truths regarding the love of God, the sovereignty of God, and God's work in salvation. In addressing these subjects, Kuiper deals thoroughly with their application to evangelism and what acceptance of these truths forces us to reject (universalism, moralism, fatalism, etc.). This book is intensely practical because it lays the biblical foundation necessary for faithful evangelism.My favorite illustration from the book is on page 155 and is a good example of Kuiper's writing style and content throughout the book . . .\\"A criminal finds himself in prison, locked in his cell. A visiting friend calls out to him: 'I have good news for you.' With eager expectation the prisoner demands: 'What is it? Out with it! The answer comes: 'Be good.' Well that might drive the prisoner mad. Yet, precisely that is the only message which some who call themselves evangelists have for the sinner. It is not good news. It is not news at all. Good news for the sinner is that provision has been made for his release from sin and hell.\\""},{"Title":"God-centered evangelism;: A presentation of the Scriptural theology of evangelism","review":"This is a solid review of evangelism, especially in relation to God and His sovereignty. Do not expect quick gimmicks on how to \\"win souls\\" here. This book provides a solid theological framework for evangelism. So often modern day evangelistic efforts lack depth, and the ideas being presented in this book are a great antidote to that! Not all parts of this book interested me, but I found it to generally cut right to the heart with a simple writing style that powerfully exhorts the reader with both emotion and reason! Kuiper definately has a great writing style, not spectacular but very Biblical and digestable."},{"Title":"God-centered evangelism;: A presentation of the Scriptural theology of evangelism","review":"In \\"God-Centered Evangelism\\" R.B. Kuiper (student of B.B. Warfield and later a professor of Westminster Theological Seminary from 1933-1952) delivers a volume aimed at the advancement evangelism utilizing the biblical method and message.Kuiper's stated his purpose as a \\"plea for a God-centred, in contradistinction to man-centred, evangelism. In other words it presents a theology of evangelism\\" (p. 8).First addition was published in 1966 and the edition I am reviewing in 1998.Chapters include:- God the Author of Evangelism- God's Infinite Love and Evangelsim- God and the Scope of Evangelism- God and the Urgency of Evangelism- God and the Means of Evangelism- God and the Triumph of Evangelism- And many more theology based essays on evangelismBible-minded believers need to witness more often. The great English Puritan, John Rogers, one time stirred up his congregation for the lost by imitating the screams of the souls in hell. Hell should prompt your mouth to open and trumpet the truth of God. Your love for Jesus should enkindle your heart to urge Christ upon the pagan; your glorious union with Christ should prompt you to yearn for the salvation of those God has providentially set in your path. It is no longer you who live, but Christ lives in you, the one who loved you and died for you. As a Christian, Jesus lives in your heart by faith. Jesus said, \\"I came to seek and save that which was lost\\" (Luke 19:10). Since that was one of His goals, and He dwells in our hearts; we must follow Him as a seeker of the lost. To arouse your heart for the unsaved: ponder the cross, consider the love and excellencies of Jesus, look to the glories of heaven, and the eternal pangs of hell. As one old preacher said, \\"I want the stench of hell in my nostrils and the splendor of heaven in my eyes.\\"God Centered Evangelism is a wonderful book (247 pages) on witnessing. Kuiper exhorts the church with the following: \\"God commands sovereignly and for that very reason must be obeyed... To apply the foregoing to evangelism, the sovereignty of God comes to vigorous expression in the many missionary commands of the Bible, and in the measure in which one recognizes the divine sovereignty, in that very measure must one be zealous in carrying out those commands.\\"Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And you are witnesses of these things (Luke 24:46-48).for more essays on biblical evangelism and apologetics see my book:Truth, Knowledge and the Reason sfor God: The Defense of the Rational Assurance of Christianityor\\"God Does Exist!: Defending the faith using Presuppositional Apologetics, Evidence, and the Impossibility of the Contrary\\""},{"Title":"On the Edge of the Wild: Passions and Pleasures of a Naturalist","review":"Stephen Bodio presents a compelling,thoughtful series of essays mostly about New Mexico and the western backcountry.

What an exceptional combination! He is not afraid to deliver his Self, across the board, as far as I can tell. He's not writing for anyone but himself, really. And maybe the animals,or rather Nature. This book, like his others, does not fail to deliver the full banquet of naturalist type info, history, geography, and whatever else touches him most deeply, be it in the heart or mind or soul.

He primarily wrote novels, but these stories demonstrate that he could write great short pieces too. I once loved his writing, but I now find a lot of it disturbing. Perhaps this is due to me finding his life and death disturbing - his intense narcissism, his political extremism, and his closeted bi or homosexuality. In his writing he seemed to be after some sort of purity and beauty, but he associated these things with violence and suicide. He lived a life of great success and achievement, but was never satisfied, and began to come unglued toward the end of his life. Still, there is no denying his power as a writer. He could write lines of perfect, radiant prose. He portrayed the subtle inner lives of repressed characters with great power and feeling.A couple of these are early stories and not especially interesting, altho they do show the young writer beginning to exercise his talent. \\"Sword\\" is well written, and it showcases Mishima's fascination with kendo and youthful masculinity. \\"Sea and Sunset\\" is proof that Mishima had a great sense of humor, one that he did not show often enough. \\"Act of Worship\\" is the real masterpiece of the book, and shows Mishima at the height of his powers, doing what he does best - describing an uptight, repressed woman with the hots for a man who is out of her reach. In this case, an old maid becomes the housekeeper for a brilliant, wall-eyed old poetry professor, a man who commands great respect, but is deeply lonely. He describes their subtle communications and interactions brilliantly. This is worthwhile reading for fans, and a good place to start if you have never Mishima's stuff before."},{"Title":"Acts of Worship: Seven Stories","review":"Acts Of Worship: Seven Stories is an anthology of short stories by the internationally famous Japanese author Yukio Mishima, who is perhaps most notorious for his dramatic ritual suicide in 1970. Flawlessly translated into English by John Bester, the short stories include: Fountains in the Rain; Raisin Bread; Sword; Sea and Sunset; Cigarette; Martyrdom; and the title piece, Act of Worship, and bespeak the rigid mentality of one born and rigorously raised in the traditions of the samurai caste, long after the era of the samurai. Written with biting insight, sharp ruthlessness and a keen eye for just how much (or how little) human life is worth, Acts Of Worship documents Yukio Mishima as having been an undeniably strong and articulate voice in Japan's modern literary tradition."},{"Title":"Acts of Worship: Seven Stories","review":"Contrary to what the translator claims in the introduction, based on this collection of short stories, Mishima Yukio's work as a novelist far exceeds in quality that of the short story writer. While some stories are quite good - &quot;Acts of Worship,&quot; &quot;Cigarette,&quot; and &quot;Sword&quot; come to mind - and demonstrate not only the thought but also the large amounts of research Mishima put into his writing, others only evince lukewarm sentiments or insights into the author's aesthetic tastes. While this in itself is certainly not enough to merit a &quot;low rating,&quot; these same sentiments are more effectively conveyed in his novels.Another complaint is that these stories are presented largely in an ahistorical way. That is, there is little reference to when Mishima wrote them, what he was experiencing at the time, and what the situation of Japan was like, socioeconomically. Understanding these concepts is crucial to understanding Mishima's motives and writing."},{"Title":"Acts of Worship: Seven Stories","review":"When I first found Mishima, I wondered why I'd never heard of him before. I quickly fell in love with his style of writing tight, consistent, entertaining, and vexing novels. \\"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion\\" is one of my all time favorite novels, and with reading it I found Mishima to be my favorite author.But I had never read a short story (or play) from him until I found this collection.Now I feel even more strongly about Mishima, and even more solidly convinced that his detractors have no validity. These seven stories are all radically different; characters, time period, length--but they all hold something very poignant about them. Like the Professor recommending to his maid in \\"Act of Worship\\" the beautifully written prose of vast scenery and metaphoric imagery -- I too recommend this collection for those reasons.\\"Fountains in the Rain\\" is a simple and short narrative between two lovers, with Mishima juxtaposing the female's tears' with the fountains they (the couple) stumble upon while in rain. Wonderful layering here, but this is the one \\"throw-away\\" story (if you could even call it that). The following, \\"Raisin Bread\\", is where the stories take an almost psychologically horrific turn; the subject matter is dark from here on out, but Mishima wields this territory like a blade.\\"Sword\\" is next, one of this collection's two largest stories (the other one being the self-titled) concerning, yes, a kendo/swordplay training school. Characters are introduced quickly and tension is held high as we see guilt and honor flowing together until the final line reveals the story's conclusion. You can feel the sweat on the students' faces and can nearly see the golden hue of the dojo floor.\\"Sea and Sunset\\" takes a very different story (which is itself told inside of another story) about a French farm hand sold into slavery, landing in a Buddhist shrine in Japan. The two items in the title seem to suggest a waning of life for the protagonist. Wonderful little story.Now, the two most brilliant pieces come next. They express, alone, why I think Mishima is head and shoulders above most any Japanese literature -- and also why his detractors (who claim he falls from being able to create the metaphysical dreamscapes of Haruki Murakami) should reconsider his worth.\\"Cigarette\\" is a personal diatribe from an adolescent that would otherwise be boring if not for being so acutely written. In a few pages, I felt that Mishima and I had had the same childhood. He crossed into territory that many do (think the typical \\"teen experience\\" movie) but the end result is something entirely believable and fascinating. The grinding of adolescence on culture; feeling the need to \\"fit in\\"; feeling unwelcomed anywhere -- Mishima captures it all with clarity that I have never seen anywhere else. I'll be re-reading this one many times.When I first started \\"Martyrdom\\", I didn't expect it to hold much. Demon King? I wondered. But by the end, I was shocked. This piece holds such poetry and metaphor in every line, and crosses paths between Christian mythology and Japanese idealism. The tortured protagonist (making the last story's main character to look brave in comparison) and his story are probably predictable with the story's title, but there is more than expected, and when I finished this story I could only be reminded of what Murakami had said of Mishima, and I wondered if he had had a chance to read this! It truly moved me like not many of his novels have.Mishima changed the landscape of Japanese literature. He wrote 40 novels, 18 plays and 20 volumes worth of short stories. He also, unlike many of his influences, was able to see many of them translated into English and made popular among his current generation (also a rare thing among Japanese authors).His untimely death is what people most remember about him. Let them, then. In my own life, I'll only remember that he changed the way I felt about everything."},{"Title":"Acts of Worship: Seven Stories","review":"This a great collection to get a sense of Mishima's imaginative spectrum of characters and themes.

It amazes me that after several years of sailing student crews around in this yacht (and no, it is not 'a fishing schooner,' or anything like it!) that the author has so little to say about his student crew. After all, the whole PURPOSE of these cruises is supposed to be about young men and women and THEIR personal development, not so some self-satisfied 'yachtie' can get a free ride for the Summer! The commentary about such places as Naushon Island are also offensive, especially considering the generous nature of the Forbes family in even allowing the author and his students to land on the private island at all, let alone opening it up to all and sundry (Ted Kennedy himself has been summarily chucked off the island in the past for trespass!). No doubt the author would welcome a bunch of vagrants fetching up on his front lawn to camp for the Summer too! A quick look across the Sound and the over-priced tourist horrors of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket should be reason enough to celebrate the isolation and pristine nature of the Elizabeth Islands generally, and Naushon in particular! Apparently the author has 'agonies of conscience' in just about every other harbor he has fetched up at as well, and it makes me wonder, why doesn't he just give up sailing, join some sort of monastery somewhere and leave the rest of us alone?"},{"Title":"Aesthetics (Fundamentals in Philosophy Series , Vol 1)","review":"This book was core reading for the aesthetics module of my philosophy major and I found it to be an engrossing read.

From Surprise to Reckoning is the published unclassified version of the Kargil Review Committee chaired by noted Indian defense analyst K. Subrahmanyam who was chartered by the Indian government in July 1999 to &quot;review the events leading up to the Pakistani aggression in the Kargl District of Ladakh in Jammu &amp; Kashmir and to recommend such measures as are considered necessary to safeguard national security against armed intrusions&quot;.Amazingly enough, the Kargil Commission actually got a fair level of cooperation from the various agencies within the Indian government and produced a scathing account of Indian intelligence omissions and failures in the months leading up to the war in the summer of 1999. Although the book has numerous deletions due to classification and generally reflects the long-held biases of its chairman K. Subrahmanyan (who has a long history of championing certain Indian defense issues), the book is the starting point for any scholarly or academic research on the Kargil War.It should be noted that From Suprise to Reckoning focuses mainly on intelligence issues and some of the surrounding defense subjects such as the 'nuclear backdrop; and the 'defense budget' - it is not an operational military history per se. This will take a lot more time to produce and in fact it is unlikely that the Indian Army will ever publish an official military account of the war which will transcends the usual regimental histories commemorating the brave sacrifices of the jawans who died there.Scholars will of course have to wait even longer for any official Pakistani version of the war. The Pakistani government still insists that somehow brave groups of Kashmiri mujahideen took it upon themselves to seize Indian fighting positions at elevations in excess of 16,000 feet where nobody lives to achieve some mysterious purpose -- obviously these guerrillas have not read their Mao Zedong in which &quot;guerrillas live among the people as the fish swims in the water&quot;."},{"Title":"From Surprise To Reckoning","review":"Authors of Kargil Review Committee need no introduction, if they do then please dont spend $ 67/- to get hold of this rare book as it is a dated report (dec 15, 1999) and you won't enjoy reading dry verbalese containing tons of insight.sample this ...(DGMI) it's primary role is not collection of intelligence...it's primary role is strategic and tactical military assessment and its dissemination within the Army... so if you are thinking duh! and your eyes don't light up either you are from military intelligence and have surmised from the way it functions that it is stating the obvious and not the only thing mi does and hence miss the importance or you do not have the background to realise how over the years it has drifted into doing other things out of structure, training and posture into things it should not be doing and the primary role goes by default.k subrahmanyam is no longer around and india has lost a truly brilliant mind, for b g verghese and satish chandra this is a done project and their writing no longer appear as frequently in public domain so you would miss their wisdom too. defence remains a holy cow and far too much is not brought out in the name of security for example all of the annex. are not available to public. thus this is one of a kind product if atr on kargil committee available in public domain has made you hungtry for more and the exec. summary on nuclearweaponarchive.org does not seem enough you have no option but to buy this product."},{"Title":"From Surprise To Reckoning","review":"it is a pity that government does not make public most of the reports even after 30 years.it is refreshing change to the trend that this book got published.

Thankfully, there is no shortage of caring professionals motivated to improve care and the problems are solvable. As with any effort to improve performance, measurement is the first step to improving care and reducing medical mistakes. As I often remind clients and colleagues: you can't fix what you can't see.However, measuring hospital and physician quality is complex. And too often efforts to measure quality get bogged down - perfect becomes the enemy of good and analysis becomes the enemy of action.This book serves as an excellent, up-to-date guide on how to design and implement an effective quality measurement program, particularly in hospitals. While paying close attention to the importance of clinically sound measurement, this guide focuses on providing practical and actionable advice. Specifically, the book provides:1. Helpful overview on quality measurement, the increasing demands of consumers and purchasers for public disclosure of provider quality, and the information consumers find most valuable in their decision making.2. Practical advice on how to select quality indicators, collect and organize data, and create a dashboard to monitor progress.3. Technical guidance on how to analyze data effectively, including how and when to accept limitations and variations.4. Cases studies on how to use quality measurement to improve both clinical and operational performance.The author, Robert Lloyd, PhD, is executive director of performance improvement at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (ihi.org) and a highly regarded expert in quality measurement."},{"Title":"Quality Health Care: A Guide to Developing and Using Indicators","review":"The chapters are well organized and the prose style well written and easy to understand.

He pulls no punches, and his incisive narrative and wry wit are as sharp as a sabre slash. There is no beating around the bush here, and you can tell who and what he admires, and what he doesn't.The Continental Army may have been the best, most enduring army in American history. No American army ever had to endure, both from the type of hardship to the length of wartime service, that the Continentals did. They won because of three things: Washington, their own hard-won skill at arms, and the French intervention. These three factors are brought out in evidence in this volume. This excellent piece of scholarship and tale of high deeds beongs on every enthusiasts bookshelf and should be read and reread until the lessons sink in."},{"Title":"Battles Of The Revolutionary War: 1775-1781 (Major Battles and Campaigns)","review":"I've gone through quite a few histories of the revolution, but this book is different in that it is written purely from the military aspect. The author doesn't critique all the battles but makes a representative selection from each type of battle.Each engagement is accompanied by detailed drawings showing the placement of troops, cavalry, and cannon. He discusses the use of terrain for each battle. In the case of the &quot;Battle Of The Cowpens&quot; he reflects on the purpose of the American commander in putting a river at his back was to prevent his soldiers from having an easy means of running away from the battle.All in all, a good informative read."},{"Title":"Battles Of The Revolutionary War: 1775-1781 (Major Battles and Campaigns)","review":"If you are in the market for a good book on the major battles and campaigns of the Revolutionary Army then this is the book for you.

Wood's text has the advantage of covering battles in both northern and southern colonies while Lumpkin focuses on the south.Battles of the Revolution includes northern colony battles such as: Bunker Hill, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Oriskany, and Saratoga. Battles in the southern colonies include: Kings Mountain, Cowpens, Camden, Guilford Courthouse, and the Chesapeake Capes (including Yorktown).The authors' knowledge of not only the war, but also terrain and strategy, are evident throughout the book. While most of the battles covered were American victories, Wood does include some battles won by the British. The text is easy to read and includes interesting anecdotes of the various Revolutionary War leaders. Battle summaries are interesting without being overly simplistic and lack the dry descriptions found in other military books.The only reason I did not give the book 5 stars was the maps - not quite enough in number and detail. I'm a real stickler for books with good battle maps - including several such maps makes the flow of the battle and stategy easier to follow and understand.Complaint aside, I highly recommend the book as quite possibly the best comprehensive book of a largely forgotten war.Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Battles Of The Revolutionary War: 1775-1781 (Major Battles and Campaigns)","review":"For those wanting to learn more about some of the key battles of the Revolutionary War, this isn't a bad starting point. John Eisenhower, in the Introduction, notes the approach adopted by the author, W. J. Wood (pages xiv-xv): \\". . .he selects certain battles to describe, purposefully omitting others. His criteria for selection includes drama of a particular engagement, its ability to illustrate a certain military principle, and its uniqueness.\\"Needless to say, there will be questions as to which battles were selected and which were omitted. Only ten are included. These range from Bunker Hill to the Chesapeake Capes (for which, read Yorktown). Most represent American victories. One exception: the debacle at Quebec and, to some extent, Brandywine), and this is one issue: Why not the disastrous series of battles on Long Island and Manhattan? These illustrate the learning curve of George Washington and his top aides. Nonetheless, the battles covered here represent a reasonable choice.Some of the other battles covered (besides those already mentioned) include Trenton and Princeton, Oriskany, Saratoga, King's Mountain, Cowpens, and Guilford Courthouse. The maps included in the text are useful for helping the reader to visualize what was going on. The text is competently written. There is enough detail to get a good sense of each battle (although, of course, there is not great detail on any single struggle).In short, a nice volume for those who want a quick introduction to key battles of the Revolutionary War."},{"Title":"Battles Of The Revolutionary War: 1775-1781 (Major Battles and Campaigns)","review":"I read a library copy of this book to obatin some further information on several Rev. War battles. So I had to obtain my own copy when I saw it offered at the right price. The author not only provides a solid overview of the battles, but uses the opportunity to analyze significant circumstances which materially impacted those battles. This book does not cover all the War for Independence battles. It does cover some which are not particularly well known or included in general works. For example, Oriskany (NY) was a British pincer movement of British regulars, French militia & Iroquois in the Saratoga Campaign where Benedict Arnold provided some assistance in a quick march to aid a beseiged Patriot fort another NY militia group was striving to relieve when ambushed at Oriskany. It expands your view of the operations at Saratoga [as does reading Washington's correspondence (John C. Fitzpatrick online) during August 1777 moving troops & examining Howe's shifting British troop reinforcements from England while struggling to open the Delaware River at Philadelphia.

The book covers all the major actions of the war of independece from Bunker Hill through to the siege of Yorktown in riveting detail. The author claims it is not a history of the revolutionary war but of its battles. Here he does not dissapoint! His descriptions of the maneuvers and actions are great. During the Guilford Courthouse battle, after hearing the sounds of battle, I too, saw the redcoats comming out of the woods to engage the Maryland and Virginia Continentals!One can easily follow the strategic maneuvering and the reasons behind them from the viewpoint of both armies from the excellent maps provided. 16 pages of fine illustrations of all the major players both British and American grace the pages.This book is a must have for any military history buff who wants to learn or relearn the major battles of the war of Independence."},{"Title":"Battles Of The Revolutionary War: 1775-1781 (Major Battles and Campaigns)","review":"I finally got around to reading this and I must say it's pretty good. The battles are well researched and remain pretty clear as to what's going no. There's not much who, what, where, when, what's a flank? syndrome. The illustrations and battle schematics were helpful. I only wish there were more.Some of the generals make out great. Tarleton and Greene look like geniuses. Which to some extent they were, but not as much as Wood makes them out to be. The only knock against Greene is that he never decidedly defeated Cornwallis, allowing him to \\"escape\\" to Virginia. While Tarleton could probably be called a butcher...or jerk.Others are not spared, Benjamin Lincoln for example, is written off briefly as a bad general. One could argue that Lincoln was not really a bad general because his subordinates refused to co-operate with him or they failed him at crucial moments. Regardless of those 0pinions Washington thought fairly highly of him as he allowed Lincoln to accept Cornwallis's sword at Yorktown.Wood does a decent job with sources. He gives the title of where his secondary information came from. But if you've ever seen a copy of the \\"Encyclopedia of the American Revolution\\" it's not going to be easy to find a three line quote. The author also includes a nice essay on sources. Although short the list points the reader in the right direction. Having been a historian and currently a library science person bibliographies are necessary for historical research. Sorry, you can't Google everything...yet.Overall, this is an excellent book for dispelling that old myth of the yeoman farmer dropping the plow, picking up the family Kentucky rifle and laying waste to the British Army one shot - one kill style. Also a nice introduction to some of the more in-depth studies of the major battles, especially Saratoga."},{"Title":"Battles Of The Revolutionary War: 1775-1781 (Major Battles and Campaigns)","review":"Wood's book does not cover every battle or campaign, nor does it seek to, so those seeking a more complete study of the conflict will find this book lacking.

While it is not an all encompassing history of every battle, the author takes the chosen battles and does a fantastic job of putting the reader in the midst of the chaos.

Worth the effort."},{"Title":"Battles Of The Revolutionary War: 1775-1781 (Major Battles and Campaigns)","review":"This is a good account of some of the major battles of the Revolution, but the author's bias is so decidely pro-rebel that it takes away from the quality of the book. First, the selection of battles is very slanted. All American victories, with references made only to some of the other engagements. Thus we have no Monmouth, Brandywine, Germantown, Camden, etc. This makes hardly for a balanced account of the war.The author consistantly seems to downgrade rebel casualties while usually increasing British ones. A noted example is Guiford Courthouse. While a costly British victory with perhaps more losses sustained, the author neglects to point out how knocked about Greene's army really was. The rebel army was shattered by mass desertions of nearly all its militia componet during and after the battle and was in no condition to take the field for some time. Also, the author praises Greene no end, yet it appears that he took little real part in the actual battle other than to order a retreat! None of this is mentioned in Wood's mostly Star-Spangled account!This work reminds me of many of John Elting's books that were also decidely pro-American in outlook and often lacked non-bias. This is also a somewhat dated work. Readers would do well to balance this book with newer, more scholarly works that take an even-handed approach to the Revolution. Too many American historians get carried away with the Spirit of 76 element in their writings. The result is patriotic flag waving which some reviewers above perhaps never get tired of, but which does not always provide good, balanced history."},{"Title":"Battles Of The Revolutionary War: 1775-1781 (Major Battles and Campaigns)","review":"The author has done a very good job of presenting this very important event in American history into readable and understandable terms. Unfortunately, it is totally biased to the &quot;American&quot; view point. He (W.J.Wood) admits that he has selected battles that the &quot;Americans&quot; won through superior generalship and &quot;British&quot; incompetence and the occasional battle that the &quot;British&quot; won through &quot;American&quot; incompetence. He admits that the &quot;Americans&quot; lost nine battles out of ten they fought. We don't get to hear about most of them!As for John S. D. Eisenhower - in his introduction, he states &quot;American successes such as Bunker Hill and Kings (sic) Mountain were fought by militia alone&quot;. I am shocked by such a statement, made by someone who should know better. The &quot;Americans&quot; LOST the battle of Bunker Hill - how can that be a success? Kings (sic) Mountain was basically a squabble in the woods - there were no &quot;Red Coats&quot; there!Saratoga is very well done - again a &quot;British&quot; defeat. Yorktown and the Battle of the Capes are very nicely described. However, the fact remains that if it was not for the French getting into the action (thanks to Benjamin Franklin after Saratoga) &quot;Americans&quot; would still be &quot;British&quot;. Lieutenant Colonel Wood does a very nice (biased as it may be) job of describing what was going on in that period.I thoroughly recommend this book as an excellent viewpoint from the &quot;American&quot; side.

Crouch concentrates on Octave Chanute, Samuel P. Langley, Otto Lilienthal, and others in the pre-Wright era who steadily moved toward the objective of controlled, powered, sustained, heaver-than-air flight. Most important, Crouch shows that the Wright brothers did not work in a vacuum. They were part of a cadre of serious investigators who worked diligently to solve the practical problems of flight. He rightly notes that \\"a cooperative, well-directed flight research program involving many men with broad technical experience\\" made possible the success of the Wrights at Kitty Hawk (p. 29). Rescuing this community of researchers from obscurity is the most important contribution of \\"A Dream of Wings.\\"The hero of \\"A Dream of Wings\\" is Octave Chanute, a French-born, Chicago-based engineer who explored the challenge of flight in Gilded Age America. His personal investigations into the problems of flight measurably advanced knowledge about powered flight in the 1890s, and he shared that knowledge with the Wrights as they undertook the research that led to their successful 1903 test flights. The brothers corresponded with Chanute throughout their preliminary research, seeking his counsel and incorporating his ideas into their designs for an airplane. Once successful, Chanute even visited the Wrights at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, while they were testing their planes.Not until 1886, at age 54, did Chanute begin a second career by devoting himself to solving the problems of flight. In typical engineering fashion of step-by-step investigation, Chanute assembled all known data on the science into a single synthesis and catalogued its problems. Very early he began building a community of researchers, organized symposia, and served as the central clearing house for information on the subject. Crouch tells this story exceptionally well in this book, and he holds up Chanute's approach as a model in collegial engineering, as opposed to the proprietary approach taken by most corporations. Chanute deeply believed that the advancement of flight science must be the work of many. He corresponded internationally, and encouraged the pioneers, including the Wright brothers of whom he was a special friend and mentor. He sought no patents on his inventions and gave his findings openly to all. The Wright brothers used his research when they designed their aircraft. Chanute, for instance, advised Wilbur Wright to find a sandy place, with strong prevailing winds, to lessen the problem of landing and of moving the vehicles from the point of landing back to the point of takeoff. This sparked the brothers' decision to journey from their native Dayton, Ohio, to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, where the conditions Chanute recommended existed nearly year round.No one proved a more effective advocate for the Wright brothers after their famous first flight than Octave Chanute, and Crouch tells this story as well. Chanute steadfastly supported the brothers and remained their confidante until patent disputes erupted over aeronautical technology. Chanute broke off his correspondence with them at that time because he disagreed with their desire to control the technology of flight. For him, technical information was a public commodity, and he believed that the ability to fly would usher in a new age of enlightenment that the Wrights were thwarting. The relation was mending when Chanute died in 1910 and the brothers attended his funeral. Wilbur Wright delivered his eulogy.This is a very fine history of the quest for flight, with usch characters as Octave Chanute center stage in the effort to create practical airplanes. I commend it to all interested in the development of flight in America."},{"Title":"Nude Thoughts","review":"found this book, picked it up.. could not putit down! amazing writer; can't wait for more from her.buy this."},{"Title":"Love Signals","review":"This book was facinating.

Japanese, Chinese, Thai. Recently I've bought a few cook books to help us learn how to make some of this stuff correctly.The latest one is Simply Sushi by Steven Pallett. It's a book that includes a DVD and a bamboo matt for rolling.Just finished watching the DVD. Very clear, easy to follow.This book gives a brief on the origins and the 4 basic types, then moves on to the essentials needed, including kitchen items & basic ingredients, followed by specific recipes and complete how-to info for each type.It's all here, clearly & simply explained, from choosing fish suitable for use to slicing techniques to presentation.Some common ingredients have been hard for us to find. May have to do some internet shopping to fill in the gaps for some recipes.From what I've been told by people who already know how to do this, a real key issue is in making sure you prepare the rice correctly. Pallett covers that in detail & without the info I can see that it'd be real easy to mess that up, LOLHaving tried our hand at it, we are indeed finding getting the rice right a bit tricky. Something that will just take a bit more experience in the kitchen.The author is Australian (I'm American), so he left me one real reason to criticize the book & DVD.Measurements. Being from Oz, he uses a lot of metric values, but not universally so. For example, when talking about rice he sometimes specifies cups, other times grams, other times tablespoons.Most recipe values are provided in metric, so it's probably going to be simpler to just make sure you have basic tools that measure in grams & milliliters to save the hassle & possible errors of converting.If making your own sushi at home is of interest to you I'd have to say I'd recommend this one."},{"Title":"Simply Sushi - Book & DVD","review":"This book and DVD show with great detail how one makes sushi.

Alex Moreno is the son of migrant farm workers and the town's bad boy. Jessica Sumners is the daughter of a judge and the town's very good girl. But they are linked by a common past -- they went to high school together in Palo Verde -- and a common passion -- they have been completely unable to forget each other.Alex, after being encouraged to leave town by Jessica's father, is back and ready to prove himself as the stellar historic remodeler he has become. He doesn't particularly seem to have noticed that he is lonely until Jessica asks him over to her house to do a remodeling job. Jessica, who owns a cherry-red Beemer, takes jaunts to Sweden to write software programs and has plenty of friends, does know that something's missing in her life. So she sets out to remedy that, taking her cues from a list of \\"10 Things Every Woman Should Do,\\" excerpted from the fictional \\"Saucy\\" magazine.As she has in her previous novels, Emily exhibits a talent for meticulous plotting. A kiss jealously observed in early in the book, for example, reappears later in greater detail and helps explain Alex's behavior.Emily writes with wit and compassion, so that passages stay with the reader after the book is finished.

Full color plates show both scrolls and actual garments and accessories. Nice close up photos of hats, boots, armor, mandarin patches and the exquisite white jade belt that was on display at the exhibit. Also includes photos and supporting text for a nice selection of bronzes, porcelains, furniture ant textile fragments. The catalog is arranged by &quot;room&quot; which mirrors the way the exhibit was set up. This format is a refreshing change from the standard chronological theme, and triggers my memory on the the pieces within their context, and how they were grouped and used together. One of the most important exhibit catalogs to date."},{"Title":"Son of Heaven: Imperial Arts of China","review":"This book was sold as a companion guide and souvenir at the Son of Heaven: Imperial Arts of China exhibition that toured the United States in the late 1980's. Items produced by the Chinese imperial workshops were gathered from all over China into this one show. You'll never view all these pieces together in one place again. The photographs are exquisite, featuring some of the best items from the exhibit. The text gives brief overviews of various aspects of life inside the Imperial Court of China, arranged by \\"rooms\\" for each broad subject.Most of the items in this book were made specifically for the Chinese Imperial Court and are, thus, examples of the highest quality of craftsmanship at the time of their creation. Not to be missed are the Jade and Gold Belt, and the Emperor's Dragon Robe. Both are examples of the intricacy and incredible skill that went into making items for the Son of Heaven.As a side note, there was also a video of the same title available for sale along side this book. If you have a chance to purchase it, by all means, DO IT! The items presented, the authentic music and narration enhance the experience even more."},{"Title":"The General and the Bomb: A Biography of General Leslie R. Groves, Director of the Manhattan Project","review":"I've read two other seminal books on the Manhattan Project and General Leslie Groves: \\"Now It Can Be Told : The Story of the Manhattan Project\\" by Leslie R. Groves and the Pulitzer Prize winner \\"The Making of the Atomic Bomb\\" by Richard Rhodes.William Lawren's biography is a personal and intimate look at General Groves in ways lacking in these other two fine books. Groves is a master at sizing up people and situations, deciding on change, and finding the right people to put in charge. While Robert Oppenheimer may have been Groves' most conspicuous choice during the Manhattan Project, he made dozens of other quality people and organizational decisions and adjustments along the way. Groves' people moved at Internet speed before there was such a thing. He practiced high touch before there was email or cell phones. He anticipated cultural clashes especially between the command and control military and collegiate scientists, and dealt with it. Consequently, Groves' staff understood his expectation that the scientists' care and well being were their highest priority even though the scientists disdained their military sponsors.Groves was not easily intimidated or bamboozled by title or genius. In fact, he seemed to have the greatest respect for non-scientist engineers who got things done quickly, competently and with a practical efficiency. If the scientists had their way...and I respect them...nothing would have been built of any consequences. Groves recognized the need to bring in engineering talent early, even before the scientific solutions were determined. And he convinced DuPont and other engineering firms to take on this project despite the risks and unknowns.I found this to be a great story of leadership and practical management. In fact Groves didn't even want the job and initially thought it had little chance for success. I came away enormously impressed by Groves' energy, determination and focus. Too bad this book is no longer in print...it beats 99% of the management books out there today.I bought it used through Amazon."},{"Title":"Internet Standards & Protocols","review":"Following is the review I left on another web site: So far I found 2 errors which MS confirmed: page 4, definition of UTP; and, page 17, max segment length 10base2; these are the errors I caught with my limited knowledge; my faith in the accuracy of the book has been undermined.

Instead of offering the same old business platitudes, it forces you to do the deep thinking you should be doing. As the \\"reader\\" of this workbook, you must ask and answer difficult questions of yourself and your partners or customers, you must do the research, you must analyze the results.

Frank and Joe go to his deserted house and find that it has no doors, windows or locks. In place of a front door there is a fish symbol. Read this action packed book to find out how this strange house helps Frank &amp; Joe solve the television burglaries. It's great."},{"Title":"The Secret Panel (Hardy Boys, Book 25)","review":"I would have titled this review \\"Ho Hum,\\" but I did that for another Hardy Boys book review recently. The review for this book required a title that meant something similar. The teaser for this book promises thrills and suspense, but it does not deliver.Frank and Joe Hardy meet John Mead when his car has an accident. Soon the Hardys learn that John Mead was killed five years earlier. The boys also discover that the late Mr. Mead had no will and no heirs. The boys take a key, which they found after the man calling himself John Mead left the accident scene, and visit the Mead mansion. The mansion has four doors and no keyholes.The theme of this book is locks. The late John Mead was a locksmith, and he built a house apparently devoid of locks because he no longer wanted to see locks after he retired. The boys also encounter a group of burglars and learn that a boy named Lenny Stryker may have inadvertently become involved with the burglars. Frank and Joe also learn that Lenny may have been shot. Lenny was able to call his mother, but the only words she could make out were \\"secret panel.\\"Eventually Frank and Joe find the secret panel. They also find Lenny and capture the crooks, learning the relationship between the man calling himself John Mead with the late John Mead.The mansion without locks is one of the most interesting plot devices devised for the Hardy Boys series. Unfortunately, the plot drags and the level of excitement stays low. I was more interested in the story ending than I was in the mystery, which is never a good sign. The only thing I found fascinating was the house with no apparent locks, including the locks inside the house. This story is definitely one that can be left as a later read for collectors or can be left altogether for those interested in only the best of the Hardy Boys. However, consider the uniqueness of the Mead mansion before dismissing this book completely.The Hardy Boys series is recommended for ages 8 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14. However, the series still contains some interesting moments and will keep most readers guessing the answers to the mysteries until the final solution is revealed."},{"Title":"The Secret Panel (Hardy Boys, Book 25)","review":"Hiding sercret panels is a lot harder than it used to be. For one thing, a gypsum-board wall does not often show many seams, so it's hard to see how that all fits together, for one thing.For another, though, we are nonplused to learn here that there are innovative and unusual locks used to secure this secret panel.

What he didn't realize is how important he was to boys that religiously read every Hardy Boys book. \\"The Secret Panel\\" is possibly Dixon's best story in the series. The Hardy Boys almost have a car accident with a mysterious man named John Meade and Joe finds a unique key with a weird symbol after he leaves.

Things get even stranger when Chet Morton's beat up boat sinks for no apparent reason."},{"Title":"The Secret Panel (Hardy Boys, Book 25)","review":"I may be somewhat biased with this volume. I absolutely loved it. Secret Panel is one of the few volumes that revolved around a solid structure - that of a \\"spooky\\" mansion right in Bayport. Aside from While The Clock Ticked no other volume deals with such a thing. The book was swift paced from beginning to end and had some pretty creative cliff hangers that dealt with a revelation rather than predictable violence as was the case with The Arctic Patrol Mystery.

An have fun reading the most greatest series ever!"},{"Title":"The Secret Panel (Hardy Boys, Book 25)","review":"The Hardy Boys are at it again! For those who aren't fans of the series, the Hardy Boys are Frank and Joe, 2 teenage detectives who have a sweet tooth for mystery and adventure. Their father is a famous American detective (Fenton Hardy), and the Hardy Boys help their father crack cases. By doing this, the Hardy Boys have also earned their share of the limelight.Their best friend, Chet Morton, is a slightly chubby boy who has weird interests. Chet has many odd hobbies, and the Hardy Boys enjoy seeing all them when he is not tagging along with them through Bayport solving mysteries with them.The book starts as Frank and Joe Hardy slam the brakes of their convertible to avoid slamming into an automobile that ran down the road into a ditch. After fixing the tire that flew off the car due to a bad repair job, the man, who happened to speak with a British accent, revealed himself to be John Mead, a rich man who lives in a mansion in Barmet Bay near Bayport.However, as the Hardy Boys are leaving the crash site, Joe finds a key. It's no ordinary key either. It's an ornately designed, ancient key. But when they check up on John Mead's background with their dad's boss, chief of police in Bayport Chief Collig, they find that John Mead died 5 years ago with no heir to claim his mansion. Even stranger, his house has no visible locks; just ornately designed doors on all 4 of the mansions sides and they haven't been maintained for years.Then, strange things start happening. The odd \\"y\\" symbol Frank and Joe noticed on John Mead's ring turns out to be the insigne for a gang of thieves that are infamous for electronics theft. A shifty locksmith named Mike Batton repaired the Hardy's door lock with no input from anyone including his new boss, Ben Whittaker. Mike is actually a thief that is making a bum rep for Ben Whittaker, an honest man. The fresh new kleptomaniac Mike stole from Ben's customers and they are suing Ben, and, if it keeps up, he'll be out of business.Also, Chet bought a battered dory named The Bloodhound which sank on it's first use with a mysterious locked box inside. The box then is then lifted with the boat and stolen by the same mysterious man. Finally, a boy named Lenny Stryker is kidnapped with no clue except a message from him, \\"secret panel...\\". Oddly enough, these happenings are all connected by Lenny's last message.This book ranks up as one of my favorites. It is a mix of action, adventure, and mystery suitable for all ages. However, kids from 9-14 will get an extra \\"Kick\\" from it. If you'd like one last clue to the mastermind here, he has an alias of Whitey Masco. I hope that if you read The Secret Panel, you'll love it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Secret Panel (Hardy Boys, Book 25)","review":"This reveiw concerns the original 1946 edition and the revised 1969 edition. A stranger nearly crashes into Frank and Joe's car due to poor repair work. He introduces himself as John Mead and later asks Frank and Joe to go to his house to turn off a light he left on; however, Frank and Joe learn that the man they talked to has been dead for five years and the doors of his mansion have no visible doorknobs or keyholes. Also, a woman seeks Mr. Hardy's help in locating her son, Lenny, who got mixed up with a group of criminals, was shot during a robbery and is now being hidden behind a secret panel. The original and revised editions are nearly identical. One of the few differences that I noticed was that, in the revised edition, John Mead drops his key and Joe finds it after Mead has left. This was an action packed mystery with many different angles that all tied together in the end (don't they always). Although, it didn't take much thought to figure out where Lenny was hidden, the book is well written and interesting. It may not be the best Hardy Boys book, but I'd be surprised if any Hardy Boys fan thought this one was bad."},{"Title":"The Secret Panel (Hardy Boys, Book 25)","review":"The secret panel by Franklin W.

PPP can also be used as T1 lines and other such high speed connections.This book is definitely intended for the network admins who are running (or hope to run) some sort of PPP-related service. The book explains how PPP connections work, from PPP packet header information to network and routing setups as well as debugging them. The information is very detailed and comprehensive, and well-written.A user who just wants to setup a modem connection from home will probably find this book is not for them though. The topics covered focus more on using the PPP protocol in a network setting, rather than just a home computer. However, the chapter on setting up a dial-out modem does show a home-user how to setup a modem connection on several operating systems, and answers questions that even modem &quot;veterans&quot; like me have. :)In closing, this book is well-suited for network admins, but regular users should find a book more suited for home use.

But few critics have been willing to see foreign aid for what it is - a sophisticated instrument of control. This book attempts to do that.\\"Weissman is unabashed that his view belong firmly on the side of the left-liberal, but his main contribution is an outlook and criticism of foreign aid that is not based on the usual delineation of the left- and the right- in economics. Rather, Weissman examines the political motives behind the establishment of the foreign aid apparatus (using my own term here), and goes a step further by examining how these motives find their way into implementation.Another point that Weissman made is that politics are meaningless without considering corporate support, and vice-versa. What happens is a system in which corporations support foreign aid when and because it is done in such way that they are the biggest beneficiaries. Although it is outdated, the figure on page 31 is an excellent examination of this trend: AID-financed commodity expenditures purchased in the US (versus abroad) goes from roughly 42% in 1960 up to roughly 98% in 1970.In making his point, Weissman reviewed the history of the various instruments of US foreign aid: the world bank, the IMF, the treaties, and other humanitarian efforts. He also gave a few examples of how these assets were harnessed, for example in South Vietnam and in Indonesia.Although I enjoyed this book, I find it hard to recommend it to everybody because of the large number of organizations and people who are mentioned in this book. After a while they just get really unwieldy and confusing, and I believe that with a different referencing and citation strategy this book can be made significantly less wieldy."},{"Title":"Little Mouse: The Mouse Who Lived With Henry David Thoreau at Walden Pond","review":"I am the author of the book - so you will say I am biased.But in the back of the second edition of Little Mouse you will find coments by 3rd grade readers.

The naturalist reveals and explains his most popular philosophies to her. He even takes her to Concord and shows her the town. Eventually Little Mouse meets Carpenter Mouse, and they make a home together. I guess we shouldn't be surprised at the relationship between Thoreau and Little Mouse. \\"Mice and people still get along very well. They are friends with each other today, just as in Mr. Thoreau's time.\\"Background information about Thoreau appears at the front of the book, along with the excerpt of the mouse episode from \\"Walden.\\" The book concludes with photos and descriptions of the Emerson house, Concord Museum, and the cabin replica at Walden Pond.At least two children's books have focused on this small tale from \\"Walden.\\" \\"The Mouse and the Song\\" by Marilynne K. Roach is more subtle in its approach and is not as anthropomorphic as \\"Little Mouse.\\" While Mr. Montague uses an interesting approach to introduce Thoreau's ideas to children, the text is just too \\"teachy.\\" In more recent years, D.B. Johnson has created individual picture book stories to illustrate Henry's philosophies, and he succeeds at the task by showing, not telling.

So many books on sales techniques are so dry and virtually unreadable, but Mr. Kantin's witty style and real world examples of proposal design have had an impact on the quality of my proposals and my philosophy of sales in general. I found the proposal RATER particularly useful, as it pinpointed the areas that I needed too focus on in my proposals. My only regret is that Mr. Kantin did not write this book threeyears ago.

The advice given in the book is worthwhile, encompassing and I found good concepts, yet was also disappointed with the lack of things like bid/no bid processes. The test for any proposal advice given is how good the final proposal is. This is a guide that results in a narcisistic self focussed proposal that has an outdated look and feel.In my oppinion \\"Persuasive Business Proposals\\" from Tom Sant is far superiour, and has been the basis for proposal processes in companies from GE, Boeing and downwards.You can get good elements from this book, but don't use Bob Kantin's templates.

I was coming of age, preparing to graduate eighth grade that coming June and to start high school. Who Wants To Be A Millionaire was ABC's cash cow, the no-talent neanderthal Fred Durst was still popular, and, of course, millions of giggly kids tuned in to a popular MTV show called \\"Total Request Live\\". The premise of the show would be to allow the aforementioned giggly kids to vote for a certain music video, and try to get it to the coveted #1 spot. Sounds good, right? Well... the videos were mostly of the brainless pop genre. The clientele were mostly over-excitable pre-teen girls. And the host, Carson \\"Carsick\\" Daly, was about as exciting and interesting as a sack of wet diapers.Did I watch? Okay, you got me, I'll admit I watched on occasion, hoping that the Beastie Boys, Korn, or Limp Bizkit would be on (I was 13 too... I still kinda like the Beasties though, and Korn's \\"Word Up\\" is cool). Even in retrospect, it wasn't that cool. I remember one time they literally showed about seven seconds of \\"Intergalactic\\". It then cut to Carsick, prompting me to yell to the TV, \\"I HATE YOU CARSON!\\" I never watched another god-forsaken TRL episode, and my brain cells still thank me for that to this very day!But the real problem lay in the usual TRL fare. Most of it, as you all probably know, consisted of boy bands and pop tarts getting tons of airtime, and, of course, the less-than-intellegent kids on the street, screaming their lungs out just because \\"OMGOMGOMG!!! IT'S CARSON!!!!! I'M GONNA BE ON TV FOR TWO SECONDS!!! EEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!\\" Lest we forget the geniuses paraded on camera during the actual videos' run. \\"OH MY GOD, okay, like I wanna like request the BACKSTREET BOYS because they are like SOOO CUUUUUUUTEEEE!! EEEEEEEEEE!!!!!\\" Oh yeah, and the e-mails scrolled across the bottom of the screen. \\"OMGO)MMGOMG, lyk,i wanna reqwezt nsync bcz justin ais lyk ssoooo HAWTT!!!! - Buffy, 14\\" Talk about lowest common denominator... (Hey, you wanna hear something funny? I heard some moron from my high school was crying because she couldn't get on the show! HAHAHA! Sad or what?)Sure, there was an option to request your OWN video, but I don't think one vote for Pantera would make it because it would simply get lost in a sea of the votes of shrieking tweens for their fluffy pop \\"muzik\\".I think this stupid show is still on, but thankfully it's no longer popular. Even Carsick was smart enough to jump ship! Yes, folks, this was surely a very low point of an already dismal period (1999-2001ish). But thankfully, we can pretty much put this one behind us.All the former teenyboppers who love Carson can now bombadeer me with unhelpful votes. Thanks for reading my wacky diatribe."},{"Title":"Total Request Live","review":"This is a wonderful book for all of the trl fans out their.

The book is too scary for children obviously, and not many adults I know read Garfield cartoons. However, any self-respecting fan of graphic novels will probably enjoy the darker aspects of this book. But at the time that this book was written the graphic novel wasn't a fully realized possibility, and so Jim Davis wouldn't have written it for that audience. Who then was this book written for ? Sure, it makes a nice book for kids... at least some sections. I discovered the book in my uncle and aunt's basement when I was five or six and, liking Garfield, tore into it. I had some of the stories read to me. Images from this book have been burned into my mind, and my inner-child still quivers at segments like Primal Self. Before buying this book for children, consider Primal Self. It's the most frightining example of \\"children's literature\\" I've ever read, and I have read the original Brothers Grimm. In it, a cat ( who looks quite realistic and nothing like lovable Garfield ) is possessed by an evil spirit. This spirit throws the cat's body against a wall. And then the cat attacks its owner, a gentle old grandmother holding a picture her grandkids drew for her. Try explaining all that to your five year old. It's still a good book, for strong-stomached youth. There are segments like Garfield, the Exterminators, the Viking one, Space Cat, the Garden ( although I was never able to make out the cursive writing when I was a kid ) and pretty much everything else except for the lab animal one. Oh, and the introduction with the Cat-Man ( Glowing eyes of primal fire and suit of spotted orange: half skin, half fur, half suit. What is he and what is he not ? ). It's a nice book. There's still the mystery of why it exists but it shouldn't prevent you from enjoying it. If your kids have watched Harry Potter or Willy Wonka or the Dark Crystal ( especially the latter two ) and didn't have bad dreams then they should be okay."},{"Title":"Garfield: His 9 Lives","review":"This is the very first true GRAPHIC NOVEL I have ever gotten in my whole life. I received this truly manificent book for my 15th birthday and I really relished in the varying styles of stories and artwork featuring Garfield's adventures in each of his nine lives - all quite masterful and color-splashed. Very witty and humorous as well! But I must warn you, this book has some real TEETH despite the very fact it's all about our very own fat huggable old orange meatball of Garfield himself that we've known and loved for over 20 years. VERY SHARP TEETH. In fact, a couple of stories are pretty scary and there are some mild vulgarity especially in the Viking part as well as...oh, yes!...some bad words. But right after my very first initial shock, Garfield's wild and colorful Viking life turned out to be my most favorite! So - beware, this will be NOTHING like you have ever seen before and you'll NEVER look at Garfield the same way ever again!"},{"Title":"Garfield: His 9 Lives","review":"i have the video of this book and it is so cute and fun that i tracked down the book. it is wonderful. the art work, not just by Jim Davis is impressive and goes through several styles in its story telling. the Babes and Bullets vignette is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Garfield: His 9 Lives","review":"I read this when I was little, but the images still resonate with me. Some are fun and familiar (like Cave Cat) while others are zany and trippy (such as The Garden). But, the ones that really stuck with me were the dark tales, The Experiment and Primal Self. If you were to read those separately (as with a few of the others) you'd never know this was a part of Garfield. They are very active and violent, unlike the lazy, lasagna eating fellow we all know and love. The ending of the book is also somewhat existentialist, something else you wouldn't expect from Garfield. Well, maybe you would to an extent. All-in-all this is an excellent book and any Garfield fans should really read through it at least once."},{"Title":"Garfield: His 9 Lives","review":"Not really ment for kids, however, any garfield collector would be pleased to have this in their collection. Comic Collectors alike will be thrilled to have this gem!"},{"Title":"Garfield: His 9 Lives","review":"All cats have 9 lives, right? So what about Garfield? What were *his* other lives like?This thought led to not only this book, but an hour-long television special, each with lives in common (Cave Cat, The Garden, Lab Animal 19-GB, Garfield, and Space Cat) and different (The Vikings and Primal Self being the most different). Also, while the TV special features a cameo by Krazy Kat and two musical lives (the cracked Court Musician and the touching Diana's Piano), the book relies on visuals for its character.It should be noted that this book is nowhere near as child-friendly as its animated counterpart. In The Beginning is a lot less oblique in its portrayal of God, and portrays Heaven as an office building (patterned after the one used at the time by PAWS, no doubt), and the network-friendly ending is nowhere to be found. The Vikings spoofs comic books in a manner not unlike Mad magazine, with all the entendres one would expect. Babes And Bullets, which was later adapted into its own special, reads like an old detective novel (and, unlike the special, involves priests instead of professors). Lab Animal 19-GB is a darker, more politically aware Garfield tale than is the norm, and Primal Self is bone-chillingly frightening (particularly the final splash page).These caveats aside, Garfield: His 9 Lives is a great read and, more often than not, extremely funny. The Exterminators, for example, which was likely eliminated from the special for time constraints, is especially funny if you enjoy The Three Stooges (and who doesn't?). And even with the altered ending, Space Cat is still a grand farce of Shatnerian proportions (though some of the funnier sequences were concocted for animation, instead of this book). If you like Garfield, you'll certainly enjoy this flight of fancy and its animated cousin."},{"Title":"Garfield: His 9 Lives","review":"With an introduction to each by the feline himself, the book details the nine adventures that befell the incarnations of Garfield in their respective lives. The stories are, for the most part, written by creator/artist Jim Davis, while the illustrations are provided by others, adding their spin on the \\"look\\" of the cat.It's the \\"mixed bag\\" feel that causes some concern for this reviewer. While the majority of the \\"tails\\" have the whimsy and lovable sarcasm that makes the cat popular among comic strip readers, there are a few that take too many liberties and portray a more \\"pulp fiction-type\\" scenario.Two of the latter are \\"Lab Animal\\" in which a lab cat escapes and is pursued by searchers and dogs and \\"Primal Self\\" with its disturbing final scene. Both of these are not for children.\\"Babes and Bullet,\\" homage to Sam Spade, is a bit too sexually suggestive in its text, written in the form of a Raymond Chandler novel.\\"The Vikings\\" is a nice farce but may be over the head of younger readers.Only does \\"Cave Cat,\\" \\"The Exterminators,\\" \\"The Garden,\\" \\"Garfield,\\" and \\"Space Cat\\" capture the essence of the beloved cat.A marginal recommendation can be given for this collection, being unsuitable for ALL members of the family.For the most part, it's for young teens and adults ONLY."},{"Title":"Garfield: His 9 Lives","review":"I can't begin to tell you how weird this book is.When I was around ten, I enjoyed the very first three or so Garfield books--you know, those rectangular ones that were released each year after a while--because I like cats. After a while, though, the strip began to show serious signs of self-consciousness and became nothing but jokes about obesity and dog-bashing gimmicks. I began to quickly lose interest as Garfield became less of a \\"cat\\" and more of a \\"gimmick character\\" intended to sell merchandise. When Jim Davis remarked in an interview during that period that he had always dreamed of creating a cartoon that would be as famous and make him as much money as Charlie Brown, I grew more and more suspicious that money was his driving goal--not art or genuine entertainment. The release of this book cofirmed my suspicions, and at age twelve I vowed never to have anything to do with Garfield again.Simply put, this book ruined Garfield for me once and forever. I could not, and would not, ever be able to look at him the same way again.Weird, warped and carrying the most puzzling tone I have ever encountered in a comic strip related publication to this day, \\"9 Lives\\" stands tall as one of the worst examples of what money, ego and power can do to a cartoonist. Those of you expecting a clean cut, cartoon frolic here will be horribly disappointed, because the book is not the least bit rollicking; it's too dark and freakish in areas for that. Its tone is inconsistant and disturbing, its filled with an overall joylessness that destroys any of the lighter material, at least one story contains profanity and some of it is guaranteed to frighten children.The problem is that by that point Davis could have slapped the Garfield brand name on ANYTHING and had it sell like crazy. And that's exactly what this book is--an excuse to cash in.Simply put, I challenge even the biggest Garfield nut to explain precisely how this book fits in as a whole with the Garfield concept--aside from the limp idea of \\"each story is one of his 9 lives\\", which was really just an excuse for Davis to go berzerk to the point where you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms, talcum powder or something equally toxic.A couple of the stories included here are done very realistically, with fully believable atmopshere, lighting and mood. Unfortunately, attempting to use this approach for \\"light\\" material the way this book does simply doesn't work. A strong example is \\"Lab Animal\\". While this may have been intended to be \\"light\\", its all-too-realistic and nightmarish mood in its look destroys any hope of comedy (especially when you consider its subject matter). The last frame of this piece, apparently intended to be a punchline, instead features an image which by itself ALONE was guaranteed to make a small five-year-old child I knew at the time scream in horror.Another example of this is in the opening piece entitled \\"In the beginning...\\", which goes through a series of what are really actual photographs altered with paint and pen. Because it is all done so realistically instead of using sheer cartoonish visuals, the last panel comes across not as some sort of whacked joked by as a nightmarish freakout. And yet this is supposed to be all done in comedy.The most horrific sequence of all is easily \\"Primal Self\\", which is not only done realistically but also is NOT intended to be comedy, but instead flat-out horror. This one is the bit that received the most complaints after parents willing to trust in the \\"Garfield\\" name bought it for their children who later found \\"Primal Self\\" much too realistic and frightening. (When \\"9 Lives\\" was later turned into a television special, this was one of several sequences to get the axe due to its content). What does this have to do with Garfield? For that matter, what does this have to do with ANYTHING?Even weirder, the sequences have bizarre inconsistencies within them which make no sense, such as the fact that Garfield could never talk but in previous lives he obviously could. And the horror story which clearly shows his owner reading a newspaper with \\"Garfield\\" printed in it when he hasn't even reached that \\"life\\" yet. Such errors are clear evidence over just how much Davis used the whole concept as an excuse to run wild.Meanwhile, some sequences are merely dumb (\\"Babes and Bullets\\" and \\"Space Cat\\") and are simply a waste.Now there *are* some sequences here that beg for better company. \\"The Vikings\\" is workable... \\"Cave Cat\\" works into the basic concept, as does \\"The Exterminators\\" to a reasonable degree.But \\"The Garden\\" is a real jewel. Here is the one piece in the entire book which DOES manage to work within the Garfield concept AND combine it with a different artistic approach beautifully. The piece is gorgeous, uplifting and genuinely fulfilling to read (it can even be argued that there's a lot of wisdom in it)... everything that the rest of this book is not.A waste of time and money. Hey, I wouldn't even buy it used because I wouldn't ever want the thing in my home, certainly not where my own children can get at it. Davis's hugest folly, it is guaranteed to get readers everywhere scratching their heads in amazement in a way they haven't since they saw the climax of the movie \\"The Black Hole\\" and wondering \\"What the HECK was Jim Davis THINKING?!\\"If Davis ever decides to release \\"The Garden\\" by itself as a little booklet, however, I'll be the first in line."},{"Title":"Garfield: His 9 Lives","review":"I didn't understand The Beginning part. In Cave Cat, there was a dog dinosaur! And there were cave men too! In Sam Spayed, they said bad words and where were all the humans? Everyone were cats! And in The Exterminators, how did the cats talk? Garfield can't talk! Lab Animal was weird and stupid! I didn't understand Primal Self! And in Garfield, Jon said he bought Odie. But in the comic strip, Odie was Jon's roomate's dog and Odie moved in with the roomate. And Space Cat was disappointing because the space thing turned out to be a video game! The book didn't have a good ending. If you want to buy this book, think hard about it!"},{"Title":"Garfield: His 9 Lives","review":"This is quite a rare book about Garfield, to be sure, but it definitely proves Jim Davis cannot be put into the proverbial box. The story lines are diverse, with both whimiscal themes as well as the disturbing.

If you really want to appreciate Mr. Davis' creativity, definitely get this book."},{"Title":"Garfield: His 9 Lives","review":"Okay, folks, incase you have no idea what NINE LIVES is all about, I'll sum it up for you: Through reincanation, Garfield well lead nine seperate lives! That's right. These are a collection of short stories that tell who he was, what he was, and what he well be in his former lives, present life, and future life. It's an interesting book for Garfield fans (Just because I'm a 21st century mouse, that doesn't mean I don't like the tubby tabby like the rest of you), butlets face it, each story has nothing to do with each other. That's why I'm forced to write seperate reviews on each of the ten stories... IN THE BEGINNING: B This short story takes a look at how God created the cat. Hip and funny. CAVE CAT: A This one portrays Garfield as the first cat ever. Hilarious! THE VIKINGS: B- It's good, but look at the time frame. According to this, these vikings liked in 1984. But so did Garfield! How is this possible? BABES &amp; BULLETS: A+ The best story in the boo! k! Clever, funny, and mysterious. EXTERMINATORS: A+ The funniest story in the book. I love the old lady. LAB ANIMAL: F The ending ruined the story. GARDEN: A- Original, with brilliant art PRIMAL SELF: C An otherwise good story, it's just too short. GARFIELD: A+ Funny!

You'll filp when ya' see it."},{"Title":"Garfield: His 9 Lives","review":"It has been far too long (almost 20 years) since I read this book as a kid but even then I was blown away by it. Yes, I'm reviewing a book based on very old memories but I do this because this book is a tragedy that can still be reversed. Jim Davis, who may only be remembered as a hack, actually has incredible talent along with a dark side and a thoughtful side that is never seen in the factory churned comics of Garfield. \\"Nine Lives\\" shows this in very bizarre ways. Some have said it was frightening to children but I, as a very timid child who was scared by the Thriller video, was really amazed by this comic. It may have been my earliest exposure to what comics can really do.I can't say much more about this other than that I hope my review and others might be a signal that this book should be more than a rare collectors item seen as a \\"fluke.\\" If anything, I hope it shows that Jim Davis didn't just create a cute licensing icon but actually created great art that the world wasn't ready for."},{"Title":"Garfield: His 9 Lives","review":"I used to be a big fan of Garfield when I grew up in the 70s and 80s. I've always maintained an interest in comics as a medium, but as I ascended into adolescence Garfield was rapidly replaced by new mature favourites such as the graphic novels of people like Alan Moore, Will Eisner and Neil Gaiman. The Garfield concept is, after all, very limited and rather monotonous, focused as it is on standard themes such as Garfield's gluttony, Jon's social ineptitude etc.A couple of years ago I was walking past a second hand comic store and happened to see \\"Garfield: His 9 Lives\\" displayed in the window. It was obvious from the cover design that this was an attempt at a new take on the comic, and it sparked my curiosity. What I found was something very different from the Garfield I had known as a child - deep, introspective and in parts even dark and disturbing. It most certainly gave me a new found respect for Jim Davis - I would imagine that it takes both courage and creativity beyond the capabilities of most average unprovocative syndicated cartoonists to experiment with their characters to such an extent, and to do a good job of it.I can certainly see how some of the stories in this book would be frightening to some children, so I'd say that a bit of caution would be required on the part of any parents who buy this book for their kids. I wouldn't consider it unsuitable, but a bit of parental guidance may be called for in the case of young children who are easily frightened (but then again, the same can be said for much of what is routinely considered \\"harmless children's entertainment\\" these days). For myself, as an adult ex-Garfield fan, the reading of this book was however an entirely positive experience."},{"Title":"Garfield: His 9 Lives","review":"I first found this book in 7th Grade in a comic book box at my high school library, and I was amazed. I'd always liked the Garfield comic strips, but this book was so much more. The artwork in all the stories was beautiful and the story lines were both delightful and hilarious. Garfield's commentary was also good.Because these stories are all very different I'll rate them each individually.In the Beginning: 4/5 This story is one of the cleverest in how it presents the 'joke' of the story and the artwork is very interesting, as it appears to be a amalgym of photographs, trippy colour saturation and air brush art. Very cool.Cave Cat: 3/5 this one was funny but probably one of the weaker stories. The artwork was interesting and would certainly entertain a small child.Viking Story (don't remember the title): 4/5 Funny, well drawn and true, in a sense, to the original Garfield comics. It has cheeky moments that would keep adults (or library dwelling teenaged girls, in my case) entertained, but would not be really picked up by younger readers. The artwork was truly comic book style, and Garfield looked like himself behind the beard and helmet.Detective Story (again the title eludes me): 4/5 This is nothing like you would expect, it's very film noir, but funny none the less. The illustrations are very lovely and well drawn (reminds me a bit of Blacksad), and the story is actually quite a clever mystery. It loses a star because it's not really a comic per se, but it is still an entertaining addition to the book.The Exterminators: 4/5 Bravo Jim Davis! This story is hilarious both for it's own jokes and for it's rather clever parody of the Three Stooges. True to original Garfield, but still unique and interesting, and the art is quite scribbly and humourous.Lab Animal: 4/5 This story is a bit darker in tone, and the humour a little more oblique, but it's one of the most interesting tales in the book. Other reviewers have slammed it for being too scary, but this one isn't really too bad in my view, it is funny in its own way and it gets you thinking. The art is fascinting in its detail, and the realism suits the story.The Garden: 4/5 this story probably deserves two ratings, one for the story and another for the art. The story isn't really funny, but it is very gentle (perfect for little kids) and it carries a nice message. The art is colourful and stunning, and it is certainly the most beautiful story in the book. The art work makes me think of Lisa Frank stationary and it is both futuristic in a way, yet also very eighties. Almost psychadelic, really.Primal Self: 5/5 This one is probably my favorite from a story point of view. It builds suspense very well, and I laughed myself sick at the end. Primal Self is very unusual and if you like your humour a little dark and creepy, like I do, then this story has real appeal. The artwork is realistic, yet surreal and captures the mood of the story perfectly. I might scare very little children, but I'd say any child over seven could deal with this one, especially if they have a devillish sense of humour.Garfield: 5/5 This is easily the most funny and obviously the truest to Garfield as we know and love him. It chronicles Garfield's birth and childhood and has a couple of very funny moments, especially when Garfield first goes to the pet shop. The artwork is colourful and nice and this story has the cutest pictures of baby Garfield and Odie. Little kids would love this one.Space Cat: 5/5 Also very funny and interesting. The opening bit was hilarious and the overall story was clever and engaging. The art is unusual and similar to the comic strip. It neatly finishes the book and I really liked it.I can't recommend this book enough, for fans of any age, it will impress any comic buff, and provides an interesting comparison of styles. My favorite ever Garfield book, and one of the best graphic novels I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Deserves every star."},{"Title":"Garfield: His 9 Lives","review":"Having been a serious Garfield fan from the day I could read, this is by far the best Garfield book. Watching him \\"grow\\" from the dawn of time (when chickens had teeth) to a \\"futuristic\\" Garfield, is fantastic. He even tries his paws at sleuthing. A definite must read for the Garfield fan."},{"Title":"Garfield: His 9 Lives","review":"Before Garfield and Friends, before the milestone anniversaries, before...yes...the Internet, the fine folks at Paws Inc. decided to get creative.This 1984 work is a series of unusual short stories chronicling Garfield's past (and present and one future) lives. All of them are dramatically different from the mundane 3-panel comic or even the early TV specials. Supposedly the point is to illustrate how the present Garfield's personality came to be, but a lot of it looks all the world like it's just for fun or what someone on the Paws staff thought was a cool idea.Except for Babes and Bullets, the stories are very simple, if not perfunctory (I got through The Exterminators in less than 2 minutes the first time). What really makes this great is the sheer variety of the tales and the artwork that goes with them. The artwork deserves special mention, as it's vastly more elaborate and detailed (and pretty!) than anything else I've ever seen under the Garfield banner.Ultimately, as Jim Davis himself says in the introduction, the whole point of the book is that Garfield is supposed to entertain. There's nothing here that I'd consider even remotely \\"canon\\", and in fact completely lacks anything even remotely resembling a consistent timeline (which is why I don't have any problem with the TV version being so different).It's the most fascinating, weird, wonderful, offbeat, and unbelievable Garfield has ever been. That alone makes this a must-have.Some details on the individual stories:In The Beginning (prologue) - We're given a glimpse into the creation of the chubby orange icon. The setting is a computer-aided design and development center, headed by an ornery boss (\\"Cat Man\\", for lack of a better name) and staffed by a disgruntled crew of technicians. Airbrushed color graphics. (It's uncertain whether this is supposed to represent Paws Inc.; the techs are presented as generic workers, and no names are given.)1. Cave Cat - This is one of three stories (the others being The Vikings and The Exterminators) to use \\"comic book\\" style artwork. A short, silly tale about a prehistoric Garfield emerging from the sea, chasing after a female cat, and being mercilessly domesticated by early man. Odie's prehistoric origin is also given.2. The Vikings - A small clan of Vikings and their pet, Garfield The Orange, find themselves in modern-day Minnesota and struggle to fit in. As weird as it sounds. This is the most \\"adult\\" of all the stories (although still a far cry from South Park and the like), and also has the dubious distinction of having the only instance of The Word That Means The Same Thing As \\"Donkey\\" in the Garfield universe (and I was as surprised as anyone when I discovered it). The transformation into ordinary Americans alone is a bundle of laughs.3. Babes And Bullets - The longest and wordiest of the stories, and one I always found a little cumbersome; it seems like it should be a whole book by itself (which it eventually did become). If you have a little patience, however, it's an entertaining tale, and even today I'm impressed that writer Ron Tuthill was able to pull it off. The characters are black-and-white anthromorphs, which I found simultaneously fascinating and a bit disturbing.4. The Exterminators - Pure, unbridled, shameless, mindless slapstick, and a direct, er, tribute to The Three Stooges. If anything, it's too short; those nitwits should've really had the chance to wreak total havoc.5. Lab Animal - One of the two \\"dark\\" stories. Garfield is a captive in a federal research facility and makes a desperate dash for freedom after having an unspeakable experiment performed on him. Minimal dialogue; it's pretty much pure action. There's a tiny bit of violence, but no blood (thankfully). This supposedly explains Garfield's fear of medicine, although what happens to him here is far more extreme than anything Liz ever subjected him to.6. The Garden - By far the most visually impressive story; surrealistic landscapes with a dizzying array of colors. This is sort of a riff on the Garden of Eden story, but it also encapsulates the whole Garfield ethos: fun, happiness, friendship, love. Somewhat predictable ending (maybe), but a beautiful tale nonetheless.7. Primal Self - The other dark story, and the most...well, difficult to explain. Virtually no dialogue; it's just a short montage of vaguely creepy scenes where what's \\"really\\" going on is left to our imaginations. Despite what you may have heard, there's no violence, but this is by far the most unsettling Garfield-related tale ever. Personally, I loved it. :-D8. Garfield - An utterly non-canon telling of Garfield and Odie's origins. This is the only story that's done in the same style as the actual comic.9. Space Cat - And to round it off, a \\"graphic novel\\"-esque saga of a futuristic Garfield's ill-fated foray into outer space. Lots of great snappy dialogue, some nice in-jokes, and a suitable nemesis. And the twist ending is PERFECT. I won't spoil it; suffice to say that this story isn't as far in the future as you might expect..."},{"Title":"Garfield: His 9 Lives","review":"First off I am not a kid; I am 16.

Interestingly enough, I also remember the somewhat more adult parts of the book, despite the fact that I was too young to be shocked by any of it! Anyway, it's a darn shame that for the past five years or so the Garfield comic has been just completely unfunny, and for me this is a reminder of the good old days when I considered Garfield hilarious(we had a lot of the old collections in our elementary school).

ChapmanOne of the most comprehensive compendiums of bird lore ever published in handbook form, this book has remained the standard guide to birds of eastern North America from its original 1895 edition to the final edition of 1940.The listing of birds is organized in the standard arrangement of the A.O.U. (1931 check-list), and includes detailed descriptions of 675 species and sub species of birds. A typical description includes size, color and field marks for the adult male, female and immature birds; seasonal plumages, where different; the calls and song of the bird; it habitat and range; its resident status across the country-whether a permanent, seasonal or transient resident; dates of its migrations; the nest and eggs with date and place of nesting. An unusual sighting at an extreme of the bird's range or season is reported with date and locale of the sighting. The bird's behavior is described by Chapman or another well-known ornithologist, from direct field observation. Finally, the reader is referred to a book or article for more specialized information.For the beginner, Chapman has worked out several short cuts. The first is a brief key to some 70 of the commonest birds, placed in groups according to their predominant color. Another aid is a concise synopsis of orders and suborders, well illustrated, to show pecularitics of beak, foot and head shape that will identify a bird with a particular order. With these helps and a little experience, the beginner will soon be using the more detailed color keys which appear in the body of the book.Other features of interest: a discussion of the bird in general, with short but detailed studies of migration, the voices of birds, factors influencing distribution, nesting, plumage and feeding habits; an introduction to bird study for beginners, including advice on equipment, making a bird blind, keeping records of birds seen, making bird skins; a color chart of 30 colors to which all descriptions in the text are keyed; 195 excellent drawings and photos; a bibliography of books on birds of particular localities listed by state; and a full index.Both beginner and expert could hardly find a better companion to take into the field than this book. It is easy to use, an efficient tool for bird identification, and packed with information, yet compact and portable enough to be a true handbook.Unabridged, corrected reprint of 2nd revised (1940) edition. 29 full page drawings and photos; 166 figures.

The stories of Nero Wolfe are entertaining, well written, and full of colorful, eccentric characters. This story is well written with the small details and descriptions fleshed out nicely. The story is about two murders, initially unconnected until Nero Wolfe sniffs out the truth. Read several of the Nero Wolfe stories and you will feel right at home in the Brownstone on 35th Street. Fer-De-Lance might be the first of the Nero Wolfe series, but it is a wonderful first book. The rotund Nero Wolfe does the thinking and Archie Goodwin does the 'legwork' with a sweet, sarcastic nature. I strongly recommend this story and many others in the Nero Wolfe series to all mystery and detective story lovers."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin remain the finest inventions of detective fiction; Chandler may have been a better writer, and Sayers may have been more properly literary, but Stout's books are the best as detective fiction. This is the first Nero Wolfe mystery--the characters aren't quite settled down into their comfortable places yet (and some of the members of the cast haven't appeared on stage yet--Lily Rowan doesn't appear until SOME BURIED CAESAR, perhaps my personal favorite of the series), and the mystery isn't Stout's best. However, Nero and Archie are there, and the sheer joy of listening to them and following Archie's narration are in full bloom. There is no particular reason to start with FER-DE-LANCE, but it's not a bad way to begin one of the most pleasureable creations (the series in full) of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"In their first recorded enterprise, the Big Bad Wolfe and his sidekick Archie Goodwin apply their wits and charms to unravel a strange case of announced death... Vintage Stout with some memorable scenes, Fer-de-lance deserves a special place on your bookshelf.This particular edition is quite good for a paperback, including as it does an introduction and some memorabilia from the private world of great Rex Stout. Definitely an excellent choice for the lover of classic mystery fiction."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"Having recently made the acquaintance of Rex Stout's eccentric sleuth, Nero Wolfe, I have been devouring the (thankfully numerous)items in the canon as I find them. One of the endearing things about Nero Wolfe's world is its consistency and solidity. The characters are clearly drawn and clearly themselves. I must admit, however, that I was surprised to discover, when I ran into FER DE LANCE in the course of my explorations, that this is actually the first Wolfe novel. Archie and Wolfe, Theodore and Fritz, and the brownstone on 35th are as notably themselves in this, the first of the series, as they are anywhere in the series. If you read attentively, you may pick up a few clues here and there that show that the author was not completely polished, not totally settled into the world of Nero Wolfe yet - but there's nothing obvious, and that is quite an achievement. This is one strong first book, and an original twist on the murder mystery to boot!"},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"FER-DE-LANCE is our introduction to the realm of Nero Wolfe and his capable assistant Archie Goodwin. Al, the elements are here, the office, Fritz and his culinary skills, Theodore and the orchids, and the general idea of Wolfe's eccentricities are well-conveyed. There are a few oddities, like Saul Panzer being on salary and Archie lacking the sophistication he shows later, that are forgotten as the series continues, but the overall tone is set. The mystery itself with a rather far-fetched murder is not the strongest, neither are the loose ends left dangling, some kind of denouement for Carla Maffei perhaps, and some rather unfortunate stereotyping make this one of the weaker outings, but there is definitely enough here to make Nero Wolfe a character that mystery lovers will be willing to follow for many years to come."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"Rex Stout didn't just create a character when he thought up Nero Wolfe, but a major franchise that endures to this day. Fer-de-Lance is the beginning of it all where the reader is first introduced to Nero Wolfe, Archie Goodwin, Fritz, Saul Panzer, and the rest of the supporting cast. Introduced may be too strong a word, however, because things pick up as if these characters' adventures had been published many times before. The team is in place and Archie Goodwin actually says that he's been with Wolfe for 7 years so we certainly aren't there for the beginning of the relationship. In this way, Fer-de-Lance is structured much as any other Wolfe novel.The plot begins with a young woman asking Wolfe to help find her missing brother. We learn pretty quickly that her brother has been killed and shortly thereafter we learn of a second murder that is connected to his. Thus begins the typical process of the murder plot revealing itself layer by layer like until we know who the murderer is. Even though this is the first Wolfe novel, the characters are surprisingly mature and little changed from what you would read in later stories.It is worth noting, however, that this book does have its shortcomings. First, the snappy patter and humor that is so characteristic of the series is present but not quite as sharp as it would be later. Also, Stout makes an error in pacing the novel as he reveals the murderer to both Wolfe and the reader nearly 100 pages prior to the end of the book. The rest is largely taken up by Archie and Wolfe trying to gather the proof they need to definitively convict the murderer. This made the last part of the book less interesting and when it should have been building up tension for the big reveal, it is instead a bit tired despite a slightly unexpected outcome in the finale. On a petty note, this edition is also marred by several typographical errors that are largely unimportant but always irritating and the editors should have caught them.All in all, Fer-de-Lance is well worth reading for a fan of Nero Wolfe but I would not recommend it as an introduction to someone who has never read one of his novels. There are others that are more entertaining (e.g.Some Buried Caesar) and there is nothing here that you need to know to enjoy the stories written subsequently. Save this one until after you've read a few and are curious about how it all started."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"Where most famous detective series actually start at a beginning point--Doyle's Study in Scarlett actually starts with Watson meeting Holmes, and Christie's Mysterious Affair at Styles shows us Hastings meeting Poirot--this amazing series begins in medias res, running on all its cylinders. Archie Goodwin is drinking milk and making smart-aleck remarks; Nero Wolfe is more concerned with his orchid schedule and the quality of his beer than the conclusion of the case. It is amazing that Rex Stout created this wonderful world out of whole cloth; if you're familiar to the series, you feel right at home, and if you're new to it, you feel as if you haven't missed a thing.The plotting here isn't particularly fabulous--the mystery involves the rather elaborate murder of a university president, and the suspects are narrowed to one well before the end. Nevertheless, the pleasures of this book are many. Stout combines Archie's gumshoe attitude with the eccentricity of Wolfe's genius detective--straight out of a British cozy. The relationship between the two--and their interactions, both with the secondary characters (the perpetually dispepsic Det. Cramer, Fritz, the haughty chef, Saul Panzer, the detective's detective, et al.) and with the various clients and suspects who present themselves are a joy to behold. As with the fun A&amp;E video series, the enjoyment is derived from the attitude and the interaction, more than from the working out of the actual mystery. If you're a timetable-and-map fan, this series probably isn't for you. But if you like a memorable cast of characters interacting in perpetually surprising, always inevitable ways, this is a great place to start a wonderful series."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"The first book in the series is a great deal of fun. Archie's narration is biting and funny, never more than when's he's describing Wolfe's finger wagging and cheek folding (his euphemism for Nero's smile). And the mystery itself is rich and involving. Every suspect's motive is clearly established and understandable. In fact, my only complaint about this book is that Archie and Wolfe have already been together for appox. seven years when it opens. I would have loved to have been there when they first met and work out their unique professional relationship. But I'm sure Wolfe would tell me that I'm quibbling."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"As a mystery author with my first novel in initial release, I must admit to admiring the work of Rex Stout. His Nero Wolfe series shows us all how a master works. FER-DE-LANCE was the first book in Stout's lengthy series, and he had all the elements of his series in place when he wrote this excellent mystery. He combined the softer classic tradition, personified by Nero Wolfe, with the tougher hardboiled tradition, personified by Archie Goodwin. They work together in this novel to solve this homicide, as they will in dozens of future novels. His famous list of suspects with their lists of peculiarities are introduced in this novel as are the tensions between Wolfe and Goodwin that will play out for decades. FER-DE-LANCE is a classic of American mystery fiction."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"A prominent businessman drops dead of an apparent heart attack while playing golf. A few days later an out-of-work machinist disappears and is found murdered. Wolfe &quot;links&quot; the two incidents, demonstrates the first death to be a murder, and undertakes to collect the $50,000.00 reward posted for identifying the killer. In the process he tampers with witnesses, conceals evidence, and otherwise places himself and his assistant Archie Goodwin in danger of arrest. He turns in a dazzling display of deductive ability without leaving his home and without getting arrested in the process.Most series begin at a beginning and work chronologically to an end. The characters grow and mature, and supporting cast comes and goes. So we have it with Horace Rumpole and Hercule Poirot. Other series skip about, giving stories from various stages of the star's career in a manner which perplexes would-be biographers. Sherlock Holmes is the classic example of this type series.The Nero Wolfe series is a singular exception. Wolfe never ages, never changes. His supporting cast remains constant, and life in the brownstone is pretty much the same in the first book as it is throughout the series. &quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot; is the first book in the series, and the ensemble cast is almost fully in place. Archie, Theodore, Fritz, Saul, and the others all play much the same role as they will throughout the series. Only the irascible Inspector Cramer is missing.I came to &quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot; after having read several later Wolfe books. The differed only in quality. &quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot; is much better-written than most of the later stuff I've read. The book reveals Stout to be an accomplished wordsmith and a crafter of ingenious plots. Although his craftsmanship as a deviser of plots remained strong throughout the series, his ability to turn a phrase diminished.I sometimes jot down artful phrases from books I read, hoping to possibly incorporate them into jury arguments in appropriate cases. &quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot; was the first Nero Wolfe book to send me scurrying for pen and notebook. I particularly liked one observation Wolfe made on detecting homicides: &quot;No man can commit so complex a deed as murder and leave no vulnerable points. The best he can do is render them inaccessible save to patience and ingenuity.&quot;"},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"I am no Rex Stout expert. Matter of fact, this is the first of his books I have read, I have however read my fair share of mysteries, and this one is a hoot. The plot of this one is more than a bit fantastical, since it involves darts flying out of golf clubs, and exotic snakes threatening to kill our protagonists, but the character are outrageously well constructed and fascinating. It seems like now a days few modern mystery fans (myself included) dip into these older books, that's a shame because the writing and plot construction, and especially the characters, here are top notch.This is the novel that introduced the world to Nero Wolfe, is an orchid enthusiast, gourmand, and shut in. He is the brilliant and arrogant. He is a Sherlock Holmes updated to 20th Century New York, all the wit and charm, plus a fair amount of New York neurotic. His right hand man Archie Goodwin is an odd construction - more hard boiled than Wolfe, he ventures into the tough neighborhoods, occasionally carries a gun, but prefers milk to whiskey on most occasions. Somewhere between Watson and a noir style P.I. He is fascinating, and I am looking forward to seeing he and Wolfe develop as the books go on.Definitely worth reading for anyone interested in a well built mystery inhabited with some compelling characters."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"This is the first of the Wolfe series, and my second (I started with The Second Confession). I love the snappy banter between Wolfe and Goodwin, and Wolfe's eccentricities. Goodwin enjoys jabbing at his boss at every turn, and I can just picture the fat, lazy genius who refuses to get out of his chair when a lady comes to his presence. Wolfe scores a zinger early as he figures out the method with which Barstow is killed. The latter part of the book was dissappointing. We figure out the killer way too early, and the &quot;suspense&quot; ends up trying to figure out Wolfe's plan for the finale. Once we got there, I was stunned - surely Wolfe could have planned something better than that! Yes, the killer pays, but I expected Wolfe to come up with a cleaner way of disposing of the case."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"Bantam was in a hurry to monetize their Nero Wolfe license and did not even bother with a basic proofread. The printing is littered with mistakes. Some are just annoying; others completely confuse and alter the meanings of important sentences. Since the writing is from another time, phrases and phrasings are different; thus it becomes difficult to tell whether a sentence is strange because language has changed or because some idiot at Bantam couldn't be bothered to pull her finger out of her nose long enough to do a classic justice. Possibly the worst offense is that the back cover blurb needlessly reveals a major plot point that happens towards the end of the book. I will NEVER buy another Bantam book again. You shouldn't either. These illiterates shouldn't be printing PennySavers let alone a classic of detective fiction that still sells robustly and enjoys a healthy popularity. Disgraceful."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"Saul Rubinek, who reads many of Rex Stout's books on tape, is excellent. For my money, he's the best in the business. For that reason, it was with some reservation that I purchased Fer-De-Lance read by Michael Prichard. Would that I had listened to my reservations. Prichard can't read. He has a voice that could sell a lot of Buicks on tv ads between innings on a Sunday afternoon. He should be kept well away from actual prose. Long pauses in the middle of clauses, no awareness of the meaning of the words that come stumbling out of his mouth. My best guess is that Prichard is the result of a bizzare experiment in which he learned perfect English pronunciation but has absolutely no understanding of the meaning of any of the words in the English language, and he sees punctuation as unnecessary decoration."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"Maybe this type of book just isn't my cup of tea. It wasn't a bad book in itself, but just not for me."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"In Rex Stout\`s first Nero-Wolfe story the ample private investigator is asked by a friend of his legman Fred Durkin to find her brother Carlo Maffei, who has disappeared. Shortly afterwards the latter is found murdered. Wolfe\`s inquiries reveal a connection with the sudden death of university president Barstow on the links, which turns out to be a murder. Barstow's widow then offers a reward for identifying the perpetrator and Wolfe undertakes to collect the money. Eventually, a ball boy from the golf course provides the crucial hint that leads to the killer, who attempts to silence Wolfe by means of a highly poisonous snake called fer-de-lance yet fails.How the suspects respond to the questions they are asked, is being noticed in psychological detail. Wolfe's conclusions are immediately revealed to the reader and not withheld until the end as in so many other Wolfe-stories. However, the end is utterly disappointing. Wolfe stage-manages a mugging to obtain evidence. Instead of handing it over to the D.A., he sends the evidence to the killer, anticipating that the same will commit another murder and flee from justice. Moreover, he thus deceives the D.A. who paid $ 10.000 to him for being handed over the culprit. This behavior is not at all like Wolfe, who is a stickler for the rules and never acts outside the law. In real life he would certainly end up in the dock if he behaved like this.Also, there is a discrepancy between Stouts lengthy descriptions of routine interviews and his silence when it comes to explaining the background: the motive and the particulars of the murders remain in the dark and Stout fails to explain why the killer saddles himself with lots of difficulties and risks to have a sophisticated murder weapon constructed instead of simply firing a shot from a hidden place. All in all, this crime story leaves mixed impressions and is certainly one of Stout's worse ones."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"Fer-de-Lance wasn't the first Nero Wolfe novel I read, and I'm actually grateful for that. It's one of the weaker books in a great series, but many a writer has trouble finding his or her characters until the second or third novel. In this book, it seems as if Rex Stout was imposing traits and habits on his characters. Wolfe in his corpulence seems roughly modeled on Charlie Chan . . . though a reading of the novel shows how original this character is. In any case, Archie, Nero, and the cast are born here, and mature in the other novels.This is a good mystery, though a bit contrived. I will say that the murder method is ingenious, as was common in novels of the 1920s and 1930s. And I will also say that after I read this novel, I always remembered what a fer-de-lance was!If you like period mysteries, particularly of the 1930s, you cannot do better than to start reading Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe novels, with the understanding that after Fer-de-Lance they get better and better."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"This book is remarkable in two ways. One is in how consistent the writing has been in the series, and the second is how true the television series on A & E had been in presenting the stories.Unless you checked the chronology, or nitpicked throughout the story, most readers would not be able to find any discontinuity or breaks in flow or inconsistency in style in this story. I was hard pressed to believe that this is the first book in the series. Rex Stout made no special effort to introduce the characters that we all know and love in this book. They were introduced, but to no great fanfare, very little background was given, yet he was able to get the reader involved in the plot. Archie starts out in his inimitable style, as does Nero Wolfe. The intelligence, was there, the styling is there, and the eccentricities are there.I came to the Nero Wolfe mysteries through the A & E series:Nero Wolfe - The Complete First SeasonandNero Wolfe - The Complete Second Season. It struck me while reading this book as to how true to the stories the producers were in putting the same ethos and peculiarities. The furnishings were very well described in the book, and the show did a remarkable job filling in the blank spots.The story itself was classic Nero Wolfe, lots of thing going on to derail the line of reasoning, yet everything falls together brilliantly. Stout doesn't overly indulge in springing surprises, always a turnoff in a good mystery, nor does he telegraph his hand until the very end. The mystery was well paced and the dialog was clever and streetwise, all at the same time. The book was written in 1933, so one would expect the dialog top be very corny and conspicuous in its datedness, but it wasn't really noticeable, besides, this gives the story a noirish spin that is both entertaining and cool sounding.This book, being the first book in the series, is an anomalous book because one would expect something that is less than perfect from a first book. Even though this book isn't perfect, it is, however, quite satisfactory."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"As a voracious reader in my youth I devoured books at an alarming rate, with never a backward glance. As I aged I began to spend more time selecting books and less time reading them, becoming more selective about how I spend my hard won reading time. One of the great joys in life is reading a really good book, but even the heftiest novels are all too fleetingly enjoyed, and all too soon their passing mourned. Rex Stout is the antidote for this 'readers remorse' in that he has created a world that rarely changes. His Nero Wolfe series is truly a literary time capsule. FER-DE-LANCE was the first book in Stout's lengthy series, and he had all the elements of his series in place when he wrote this excellent mystery. He deliberately mentions prior cases to establish their world as a constant presence. We aren't there for the beginning of the Archie/Nero relationship, if indeed there ever was one, but we are invited to stop by and visit whenever we wish. Having established the comfortable and familiar brownstone background against which all of his cases will play out, Mr. Stout then combined the softer classic deductive reasoning tradition, embodied in Nero Wolfe, with the tougher hardboiled action tradition, embodied in Archie Goodwin. They work together in this novel and dozens to follow, solving the homicide in a style all their own. His famous list of suspects with their lists of peculiarities are introduced in this novel as are, with the noted exception of Inspector Cramer, their comrades in arms. The characters ebb and flow throughout the series, but never seem to age or tire. This creates a span of thousands of well written pages to share with our new friends. FER-DE-LANCE is a unique and timeless classic of American mystery fiction."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"One of the best Rex Stout ever wrote.

Archie has yet to find his true voice, and there's no Cramer yet, but Wolfe starts as he means to go on. Stands the test of time better than any of the other early books before Some Buried Caesar. A good and original plot."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"I have read or listened to more than a dozen Nero Wolfe mysteries and this one is the first I felt compelled to review. Others I have enjoyed due to their wonderful and sometimes even humorous indulgence of my sense of fair play. The bad guys who seem beyond the reach of more pedestrian justice are brought not only to justice but to heel by the depth of Wolfe's understanding. Where the police would give us flat but proper procedural justice, Nero Wolfe, when the circumstances of the case demands it, satisfies not only the impersonal demands of the legal system, but the specific demands of every character involved, sometimes even the murderer's.This particular story delighted me because the ending caught me so thoroughly immersed in Archie's viewpoint that I was as furious with Wolfe as Archie was, and was ready to walk away in disgust. Then the final wrap up showed me that once again Wolfe had thought of everything and delivered a nuanced justice that kept my little gray cells spinning for a long time."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"This was the first Nero Wolfe book I ever read.

Why taunt me? Why upbraid me? I am merely a genius, not a god. -Nero WolfeRex Stout was in the midst of an unusually interesting life (including being a child math prodigy and serving on President Theodore Roosevelt's yacht) when he created one of the great detective series of all time, introducing Nero Wolfe for the first of 72 adventures in Fer-de-Lance. The brilliance of Stout's creation lies in the blending of Wolfe--an eccentric, elephantine, misanthropic, misogynistic, beer guzzling, gourmand--and his footman, Archie Goodwin--a classic, wise cracking, hard boiled dick. The combination, sort of like teaming Mycroft Holmes and Sam Spade, allowed him to use the best elements of both the British drawing room mystery and the American private eye novel. The result has enchanted readers for almost 70 years. Fans include everyone from Oliver Wendell Holmes to PG Wodehouse, James M. Cain to Kingsley Amis.Nero Wolfe, logging in around 280 lbs and quaffing 6 quarts of beer a day, rarely leaves his 35th Street brownstone in Manhattan, preferring to tend his orchids and worry over the exquisite meals prepared by his butler/chef Fritz. To support his high living, Wolfe takes on investigations in a very unofficial capacity, relying on Goodwin to do the physical work and periodically summoning the principals in a case to his home for an exhibition of his deductive genius. His arrogant manner is nicely captured in the following admonition to a sporting goods salesman who has condescendingly demonstrated the proper use of golf clubs:You know, Mr. Townsend, it is our good fortune that the exigencies of birth and training furnish all of us with opportunities for snobbery. My ignorance of this special nomenclature provided yours; your innocence of the elementary processes provides mine.Meanwhile, Archie narrates the stories in the familiar sardonic banter of the great noir novels:When I consider the different kinds I've seen it seems silly to say it, but somehow to me all lawyers look alike. It's a sort of mixture of a scared look and a satisfied look, as if they were crossing a traffic-filled street where they expect to get run over any minute but they know exactly what kind of paper to hand the driver if they get killed and they've got one right in their pocket.This sets up an amusing dramatic tension between the two, as when Nero tells Archie:Sit down. I would prefer to have you here, idle and useless...As I have remarked before, to have you with me like this is always refreshing because it constantly reminds me how distressing it would be to have someone present--a wife, for instance--whom I could not dismiss at will.Lest it seem that Wolfe is to much of an egomaniac to be tolerated, Archie makes it clear that he stays around just for the sheer joy of watching the elephantine savant in action and Wolfe himself acknowledges that much of his facade is mere pretense when a District Attorney commands his presence in Westchester, he tells Archie to refuse, saying &quot;I understand the technique of eccentricity; it would be futile for a man to labor at establishing a reputation for oddity if he were ready at the slightest provocation to revert to normal action.&quot; And Wolfe sometimes lets slip his admiration for Archie, telling a witness in the case, &quot;Mr. Goodwin is a man of discretion, common decency and immeasurable valor.&quot;It has long been a theory of mine that if you create characters of sufficient interest to enrapture your audience, you can get away with not always cranking out a top flight story, we'll show up just to spend some time with familiar friends (this carried Magnum PI and Cheers through some mighty lean episodes &amp; even whole seasons). Nero and Archie are always worth a visit, never more so than in this their inaugural case.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"Rex Stout wrote 47 Nero Wolfe books. Some are great, some are good, none are bad. You might as well start with the first one -- and if you like it, you will read them all.I think my main takeaway is how books written 60 years in the past can be so topical. No more 5 cent phone calls, or having to go to a drugstore to make a call, or having Archie gripe about having to pay for two sandwiches costing a total of 95 cents -- yet Rex Stout engrosses you in his mysteries as if they were contemporary.I read all of them I could get from libraries in the 1960's -- now I have chosen to listen to the whole series read by Michael Prichard. I own them all on tape, and I'm currently on number 18, taking my delicatable time.The fact that they were written that long ago sets the hook -- this is not a contemporary writer trying to recreate the past, but a writer writing in the here and now, it seems.Just as we get comfortable with characters in modern TV series, so will you get comfortable with the idiosycracies of Wolfe and Goodwin. You will have a compulsive desire to read them all -- which is why this remains an immensely popular series. Read two or three, and if you think you are a mystery fan ..... and don't get hooked ..... then switch to romance novels."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"Rex Stout was truly an amazing man. (A brief bio is included in the Bantam Crime Line series.) He published his very first Nero Wolfe novel at the age of 48, after having completed extraordinary careers as a warrant officer on Theodore Roosevelt's yacht, a sightseeing guide, a bookkeeper, and devising a banking system. (Whew!) While &quot;Fer-De-Lance&quot; is not the best Wolfe story, it is the first. I originally read all the novels as I found them and am now reading them in chronological order. It really doesn't matter what order you take them in. Just try one or two. For those who are unfamiliar with the Wolfe novels, Nero Wolfe is a New York private detective who detests work, spends four hours a day cultivating his orchids, drinks gallons of beer, and tolerates women only when absolutely necessary. His assistant, Archie Goodwin, does the legwork for Wolfe. Goodwin is a good looking, wise-cracking, milk-drinking foil for Wolfe. Other assorted characters appear from time to time who are just as colorful. The great thing about the Wolfe novels is the way that Stout brings each character to life. To be honest, you really don't care that much &quot;whodunnit&quot; because the characters and atmosphere are so entertaining. A great, great series. If you've never tried them, what are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"Nero Wolfe is one of the most famous detectives in fiction. Wolfe is a genius for solving murders but that is not what makes these books worth reading. It is Wolfe's eccentricities combined with the narration of Wolfe's assistant, Archie Goodwin. Rex Stout displays clever and funny writing (especially the dialogs), to keep the story moving. Nero Wolfe is, of course, the incredibly obese detective who rarely leaves his apartment in Manhattan but sends Archie Goodwin, (his hardboiled, skirt-chasing assistant) to gather evidence for him so that Wolfe can sit in his chair and solve the case.Fer-De-Lance is the first book in the Nero Wolfe series (there are 73 in the series) and it is amazing how fully developed the characters were even in this first book. It has been said that that you can pick up any of the novels in any order and you won't feel out of place. In this story, Wolfe is short of money (a perennial problem as he lives in an expensive apartment, with a chef, a gardener to maintain his precious orchids, and Archie on staff). Wolfe first needs to find a case that can pay him enough and he is lucky enough to find a convenient murder and even better he has a clue that the police don't have as he knows another murder is linked to the first. Slowly, and yet inexorably, Wolfe reels in the murderer and solves the case.But solving the murder is only a small part of the story. It is the narration of Archie Goodwin, the wonderful dialog, and the uniqueness of Nero Wolfe, that make this a fun story to read. There is little mystery in the actual murder but watching Wolfe crack the case and figure out how to get the evidence against the killer is pure joy."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"After watching the Nero Wolfe episodes from A & E, brilliantly rendered by Timothy Hutton and company, I am finally getting around to reading these terrific books. I am starting at the beginning, and am enjoying myself enormously. According to many readers and Amazon reviewers, I have a lot to look forward to, because they get even better than this book. Hooray! But one star off and a poke in the eye to Bantam Crime Line. There are irritating and unnecessary typos in this edition. These wonderful books (and their fans!) deserve better."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"Rex Stout was a prolific writer. Like Edgar Rice Burroughs, he was also adept at getting paid. Over the decades, the characterizations of Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe underwent a slow metamorphosis. The characters became slightly softer as Stout's readership grew. But that's not how things started.\\"Fer-De-Lance\\" was the first Nero Wolfe novel, and it's a bit more hard-boiled. The Nero Wolfe of this book is cold and somewhat ruthless, certainly as assured of his own genius as Howard Roark in Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead\\". Archie Goodwin is a glib tough guy, brilliant in his own right, and Inspector Cramer truly does hate Wolfe (unlike later tales, when he seems almost amiable).With so many Nero Wolfe books available, I think it's important that this be the first you read. It is undistilled brilliance. When suspicious characters or bloated egos encounter Wolfe's cunning, incisive interrogation, the result is quite entertaining."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"This one started it all and is the best one of all.The old cliche, \\"Does he have a book in him?\\" applies absolutely here. Stout began his long writing career after a string of entrepreneurial business successes. He published this during prohibition and experienced a quick, deserved success.Fans of the gargantuan appreciate many dimensions of Stout's clean, well-lighted place: Archie's wisecracks and lifestyle, his internal ruminations. But I like best Wolfe's observations about life, and this book is extremely rich in them - more so than any other book, I believe.Among all the books, this one has the cleverest murder technique and one of the most subtle plot setups. Beware, though: it also contains some blunt instruments of racism and prejudice along for the ride.What a great book, though. If you've never read any of the series, please start here if you can manage."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"The Nero Wolfe series is absolutely outstanding, and this book serves as a good introduction for it. The plot concerns an Italian immigrant and a university president who have just been killed. Although there seems to be no link between the two, Wolfe discovers it and exploits it to expose a killer.Don't expect an Agatha Christie or Sherlock Holmes plot for this novel--Stout wrote good mysteries, but his gems are in his characters. Wolfe, the overweight, orchid-loving, car-fearing gourmand, and his sidekick Archie, the epitome of the 1930's fast-talking, sarcastic detective, are lovable right from the beginning. Although Stout still has a few details to work out, the set-up is the same in this book as it is in the last. That isn't to say Stout didn't improve it--he didn't have to; it was perfect from the start. He achieved the rare find in the world of mystery--FOUR-dimensional characters in a plausible setting with a credible mystery.Bottom Line: Serves as a good introduction, but don't expect a great mystery, just exemplary characters!! Make certain you get the Bantam Crime Line edition--it comes with an introduction and trivia about Nero Wolfe at the end of the novel--great for either the beginning reader or the long-time fan."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"This is the first Nero Wolfe novel but not the first Nero Wolfe investigation: Nero and Archie have been together for some years, and some people owe them great debts of gratitude. Like many later stories, this is largely set in Westchester County. There is a definite affinity with P. G. Wodehouse in the mixture of accuracy and escapist fantasy."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"Rex Stout is one of my favorite authors of all time. If you're new to his works, beware, you'll become addicted. But that isn't such a bad thing, he was a prolific writer and you'll not soon run out of material. Fer-De-Lance is the first Stout published about the now famous team of inspiring, albeit grumpy and slighly neurotic, genius detective Nero Wolfe and charming legman Archie Goodwin, who frequently purposely ruffles Nero's feathers. This book is definitely worth reading. Highly entertaining, with one caveat: if you have never read Wolfe before, begin with a different one as your very first. Try Some buried Caesar, or The Silent Speaker first to help you develop a feel for this incredible duo....then I think you'll appreciate Fer-De-Lance more. (You can also find Nero Wolfe on cable TV... a serious treat for any Wolfe fan) Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"Fer-De-Lance introduces master detective Nero Wolfe and his right-hand man, Archie Goodwin. As author Loren Estleman, (Amos Walker series), points out in the introduction of the edition of this book I read, the reader meets the two protagonists as fully developed characters and seven years into their \\"partnership\\". Wolfe - cantankerous, agoraphobic and massive - is fully entrenched in his twice daily greenhouse visits to his beloved orchids - never to be interrupted - as well as pursuing his insatiable culinary habits. Goodwin, Wolfe's legman as well as his eyes and ears out in the real world, does most of the sleuthing, while not so gently prodding his boss into action - which is thinking - for when Wolfe applies himself - he is a genius.In this adventure Wolfe takes on the case of a missing person which quickly intersects with the seemingly unrelated death - presumably of natural causes - of a college president on a golf course. Our weighty hero adds up 2 + 2 and comes up with seven, declaring said golfing university head was murdered - This out of the blue claim subsequently proven, much to the chagrin of the local authorities. And it's then off to the proverbial investigative races as our two heroes work to collect the clues, find the murderer and collect a hefty fee.Although Fer-De-Lance sets the pattern for the many Wolfe/Goodwin books to follow, there are a few subtle, yet fascinating differences. The author, through Wolfe's admissions and Goodwin's observations, provides the reader with a peek into the inner psyche of the master detective as he goes about his business. Also the solution and the identification of the culprit occur outside of the confines of Wolfe's office - the usual locale where Wolfe pieces together the puzzle.Good book - Great series."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"Fer de Lance is the first book to introduce the by now iconic characters of Nero Wolfe and his eyes, legs, and at times enforcer, Archie Goodwin.This book opens in the early 30s, although as far as Wolfe is concerned time might never move forward. His hours are tightly regulated with meals and times set aside to look after his fabulous collection of orchids in his brownstone on 35th Street. Crime intrudes as a welcomed intrusion, but only because Wolfe is constantly in need of funds to pay for his expensive orchid hobby and his array of personal assistants and staff.There is a line between the type of crime fiction that was produced during the 1930s when Rex Stout began his career. On one side were the Hercule Poirots, the Sherlock Holmes and Lord Peter Whimseys of the world who lead the lives of gentlemen of largely independent means and who solved crimes as a lark to exercise their vast intellects. These were the brains.On the other side were the Sam Spades and the Phillip Marlows of the world (and much later Mike Hammer) who represented the hard-boiled school of detective fiction. Leading less refined lives than their more intellectual counterparts, these denizens lived a life on the edge filled with booze and broads and bust ups. These represent the brawn.In Rex Stout's detective fiction there is an attempt to \\"square the circle\\" by giving us the usual detective with his \\"Dr Watson\\" (the stories are told from Archie's point of view). However whereas Wolfe represents the intellectual side (although one who prefers beer) and Archie the more physical (although his beverage of choice is milk). One gets an example of two very different types of detectives for the price of one.Even though this is the first book in the series of Wolfe and Archie adventures, they have been together for a number of years. Archie mentions previous cases which do not form part of the adventures given over to full exploration (perhaps some enterprising figure may attempt to explore some of these adventures that lie outside the Rex Stout cannon). The routine of the later books is already well established despite that this is earliest of the Wolfe chronicles.It would be impossible to offer much in the way of a plot summary or even explain away the title of the book without giving too much away. Suffice it to say Wolfe is presented with not just one but two slippery murders and the problem is to determine their connection. In the end it is Fer de Lance who is the connection.This is an excellent opening for the series of books, my only complaint is that the murderer is revealed perhaps sooner than I would have liked and when the motive was uncovered it was somewhat of a let down although Stout managed to instill a series plot twists that made up in part for this clumsiness. These stories are driven as much by character as they are by plot which is characteristic of the best of detective fiction.One final word about this story, it was written in the early 1930s and there are several things, the way immigrants are portray and various ethnic groups which while authentic (if not more polite than the average person would have behaved pre FDR) might not be the most welcomed expressions in 2010. I actually found this added an additional historical layer to Fer de Lance which was not in Stout's original intent. The overly sensitive and politically correct may not enjoy this work as much as those who can recognize it as a product of its time."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"Some of the greatest characters in the cozy mystery genre are eccentrics. Just think of Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot. Nero Wolfe is no exception, just switch Holmes pipe for beer and the violin for orchids and you start to transformation. Then add a sidekick who is in charge of telling the story, and finally add a collection of extravagant behaviors and you are close to getting the picture.Rex Stout keeps the plot focused and to the point, spending very little time in describing the characters and keeping that to the minimum necessary to convey the relationship between Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin, and the main characteristics of each. The mystery is well crafted, and even though the identity of the culprit is known fairly early, the interest lies not only in knowing who did it, but also in the way in which Wolfe is able to prove the case. The powers of deduction of this character do not lag behind any of the other great detectives in other series.Overall, this is an enjoyable book, and those that are new to the series can use their experience with Sherlock Holmes and Poirot to gauge if they are going to like it."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"\\"Fer-De-Lance\\" by Rex Stout is the first novel in the heralded Nero Wolfe series. Nero Wolfe is an obese, \\"armchair\\" detective who is obsessed with plantlife (which he dedicates 4 UNDISTURBED hrs. a day to)and crime. This man has solved some complex cases from the comfort and \\"safety\\" of his prestigous New York apartment. This would only be possible with the aide of a tough, trusty, quick-witted, determined, dedicated employee and that comes in the form of one Archibald Goodwin. Archie is a long-term employee who is part-time gopher, part-time interrogator, part-time note-taker, and part-time henchman. He is always willing to do Wolfe's dirt work which is aplenty.The story centers around the death of an Italian immigrant laborer and a wealthy college professor. Wolfe is approached to find the, then missing, laborer which triggers a story that will leave you guessing not necessarily who did the crime but how will Wolfe and Archie be able proove it. Your jaw may drop at some of Wolfe's crazy ideas and outrageous tacticts he employs, especially for the time when this was written (1934).This is not Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot. While they can lay charm on any witness they will also devise sinister plots to come to the solution.I love mysteries (especially series) and this one is at the top. While the killer isn't so much in question for the majority of the novel the proof is and the payoff is worth it. Please enjoy."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"Fer-de-lance remains the source one of Stout's greatest creations: Nero Wolfe. Not so much becuase Wolfe himself is such a great character but rather he provides so much for Archie to talk about. For anyone who missed out on the unmitigated energy, charm and social manipulations of depression era New York will enjoy the book merely as a period peice. THe dialog remains some of the best in mystery writing and those stuck in British cozies have something to move on to."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"I know what your thinking how could a book possibly be so good?

I look forward to re-reading the 47 Nero Wolfe books as mentioned by a prior reviewer. I do have a complaint about the publisher's pricing for the Kindle version of the books.Forty-seven books are a lot of Nero Wolfe. Since you can buy used editions for .01 or can purchase a new paperback edition for the same price as the electronic book,it seems as if the pricing for the Kindle editions is intended to soak collectors who want to own both paper and electronic copies. It makes no sense that current bestsellers are discounted, but these old classics are priced the same whether in an ebook or print. At a mimimum, it would appear to make sense to offer a discount on some of the earlier books to welcome a new generation of readers to Nero Wolfe.And as long as I'm whining, why can't we purchase a Compendium of all of the books in one easy swoop? Collecting is well and good, but sometimes having the option of purchasing a favorite author's entire bibliography with one magic button would be a joy."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"First Sentence: There was no reason why I shouldn't have been sent for the beer that day, for the last ends of the Fairmont National Bank case had been gathered in the week before and there was nothing for me to do but errands, and Wolfe never hesitated about running me down to Murray Street for a can of shoe-polish if he happened to need one.Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin's first published case becomes one of two parts; a young woman hires Wolfe to find her missing brother, and a college president has been murdered on the golf course. The link: a golf club.The fun of reading Nero Wolfe is not the plot, although this one did have a good twist to it, but for the characters. On one hand, you have Wolfe, the corpulent, beer drinking, gourmand who has orchids cultivated in his attic conservatory. He is well-read, well-spoken, often difficult to deal with yet a brilliant deductive and intuitive thinker.On the other hand is Archie, orphaned as a child, lives in Wolfe's brownstone, uses common English, and drinks milk. The two characters are complete opposites but one immediately senses the underlying respect and affection which goes beyond a working relationship.It is the dialogue, as well as the relationship of these two characters, that make the book, and series, work. An interesting aspect to this book is that we meet the characters seven years in, so references to previous cases abound. In most cases, this would annoy me as there would be that sense of something missing.Stout, however, is so adept in his writing and his characters are so well developed, the previous case references simply become historical notations. Stout was writing in present time, now history to us. Because of that, we are presented a living sense of time, place, social mores and behavior. There were certain expressions, common at the time. They are objectionable to us today and serve as a reminder of our advancement from the past. One element with which I did have a problem, was some of Archie's slang. There were times I had to re-read sentences or paragraphs to understand what he was saying.It was fun to go back and re-visit Nero and Archie, but not so much as to make me want to reread all the books. However, if you've never read Rex Stout, I do recommend picking up at least a few of his books.FER-DE-LANCE (Pri Inv-Nero Wolf/Archie Goodwin-New York City-Golden Age/1934) - GoodStout, Rex - 1st in seriesBantam Books, 1934, US Paperback - ISBN: 0553278193"},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"I do not know if my opinion is what you are looking for. I qwn all of the Nero Wolfe books and have read and reread every one of them numerous times.I evidently like the way they are written because ,from a purely personal stand point, I do not like either of the two main characters, and in real life would want no part of them.This may be a reason for someone else to love and admire them but I think you have to love New York and it's style of living and attitudes. I don't.Never the less because, in my opinion, the stories are so well told and the characters are so well defined, they over come my personal dislike of the people. I admire the talent of the man writing the stories.Wolfe is a self centered, Opinionated egomaniac with no sense of humorand a total diregard for convention.He uses words that are only useful to the curious because they will look them up and increase their vocabulary which in turn may increase their ability to work cross word puzzles, because those words ane not useed in normal discourse.The thing that constantly amazes me is , that with so many things about the two lead characters that I don't like, I continue to read the stories over and over again.The technical aspects are not my concern , mostly I read for relaxation and enjoyment I am not looking for education, morals or religion , just enjoyment, and Rex Stout, with whom I disagree in most philosophical areas, particularly politics,has the ability to enchant me with something that makes me forget that I don't like him and read another of his tales, again.I am 85 years old and somewhat of a puritan, I know all the dirty words and have used them to good effect at times ,but not in mixed company and not in print, so If you want the tough talking ,hard boiled wiseguy who has a vocabulary of nothing but four letter words, Nero Wolfe is not your meat. These stories are squeaky clean. There also are some regular characters such as Fritz,Saul and Durkin who are as kind, thoughtful and caring as Wolfe and Goodwin are abrasive.

I downloaded it to my Kindle on Friday 13th.It is a somewhat dated only because it is written in such beautiful English and every part of the plot is immaculately explained. And of course, there is no overt violence, except to a reptile.The reason it is essential reading is because it was published in 1934 and is the first of the 47 volumes concerning Rex Stout (if we consider the volumes of short stories as well).Fer de Lance sets the scene for Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin, the genius detective and his smart sidekick; in the Kindle edition there is even a map of the office (not quite as I imagined it), and full and fascinating notes on the characters, which were never intended for publication, but have been eagerly enjoyed by his huge following.Because he cleverly referred to previous cases, I did not realise that this was the first in series. One has to read every word to understand the full and quite complicated plot. It is a relatively long novel, if one compares it to some that follow. All the better for that. But it was satisfying and interesting explore the machinations of the devious killer as he is outwitted at every turn by our brilliant master investigator.We are given the first delicious intimations of books to come, the interest in gourmet cooking for the gourmand that is Wolfe. His orchid sideline is introduced. Maybe some of the books that follow are a little slicker, a little more amusing. Rex Stout was part of his characters by then. But you have to read this book to get the most out of the rest. I loved it and couldn't put it down, the last third I was stuck at the breakfast table in my dressing gown until I finished it at noon.

This one is superb."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"The first Nero Wolfe book is an excellent mystery that also manages to establish the main characters of the series. Porcine Nero Wolfe is a clear genius, but his weight (and perhaps other factors) keeps him house-bound in his stylish New York brownstone. He relies on his man Friday, Archie Goodwin, therefore, to do all the actual sleuthing and footwork. In this first mystery, an Italian woman hires Nero to find her brother. At first, Nero thinks that there isn't much to the mystery, but eventually after interviewing people involved in the case, Wolfe realizes that the man's disappearance is related to a much larger mystery. Along the way, Wolfe has fun with the local law enforcement and the DA, as he solves this complex mystery.I generally like mysteries especially police procedurals and crime noir. The Nero Wolfe series seems to straddle this line quite nicely, with just enough sludge and darkness to keep things interesting. Considering that the book was published in 1934, it was surprisingly contemporary. The interplay between Wolfe and Archie is funny and refreshing, with each getting off some humorous zingers at the other. Having Archie collect all the clues in the field, and then depicting Wolfe process the information is a clever conceit that allows the audience to play along in a unique manner. Like Archie, we are grasping at straws waiting for the genius of Wolfe to kick in and solve the mystery. The mystery itself also is clever, starting in one manner and morphing several times before the ending. \\"Fer-de-Lance\\" is the first in the series as well as the first that I have read (I generally try to read the initial book in series first); I immediately downloaded the next one, \\"The League of Frightened Men\\" and hope to read it soon.Note: This review is for the Kindle e-version. I read the book on my Kindle Fire. There are a few errors strewn throughout the text, but not enough to really affect one's reading of the story. I was, though, disappointed that the text was right-justified, resulting in odd spacing at times."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe Fer-De-Lance N2774","review":"This review is for the electronic version only. The story itself is excellent and it was enjoyable to see early versions of the characters. However, if you are annoyed by occasional typos, don't buy this and instead buy the paperback. I purchased this so that I could view it on my tablet. There are many errors that were missed by the editor of the electronic version. In one obvious case the name \\"Saul\\" showed up as \\"Said\\". Also, often the quotes from different characters are run together with no indentation so that it is unclear that they are two different quotes. I also own the paperback which has no typos that I could find.

In the first version of the book this idea, widely disputed among Marxists, was intended to show that socialism was the necessary culmination of a history of increasing development of the productive forces. This is a difficult thesis to maintain today, and indeed in more recent work, some of which is embodied in the second edition of the book, Cohen retracts it, suggesting only that the development of the productive forces makes socialism possible. (Subsequently he seems to have backpedaled even on this.) The implications of the weakening of historical materialism (along with a sharp critique of Cohen's original view, one that he now largely accepts) were offered by Wright, Levine, and Sober in their Reconstructing Marxism, an essential companion piece to Cohen's book. They essentially involve taking apart the optimistic claims that Marxism offers an integrated scientifically based program of social change that inspires optimism about progress towards socialism. Cohen's main thesis, as an interpretation of Marx and as a _defense_ of Marx, seems much less plausible than, for example, the alternative \\"class struggle\\" interpretations of historical materialism urged, for example, by Robert Brenner or (formerly) Richard Miller in his Analyzing Marx.Nonetheless, Cohen's book remains a model of clarity, depth, and ruthlessly honest exposition that shows up the places where it runs into problems. It contains must that is salvageable, not least an interpretation of what it is for the economic to be \\"primary\\" in terms of a theory of functional explanation, on which the ideological superstructure and the state are explained in part in terms of their functionality for the economic base, and revolutionary social change due to \\"fettering\\" of the productive forces understood in terms of dysfunctionality. People who like their Marx fuzzy and obscure enough to avoid intelligible criticism (Althusserians, for example) have never liked this book, but if Marxism _as a theory_ has a future in the wake of collapse of the Marxism _as a movement_, Cohen here set the standard for what that theory should look like in procedure and rigor if not necessarily in its substanative claims. Serious study of Marx's theory of history starts here."},{"Title":"Correlation of the IJK roadmeter to the International Roughness Index: Final report","review":"In the Base-Superstructure debate that has been raging for a while, and still is, within modern Marxism, GA Cohen's Defense of Karl Marx's Theory of History is one of the more powerful blows struck and deserves to be read.Cohen is a supporter of &quot;the primary of productive forces&quot; (the word primacy here being used to avoid the label of being a determinist or vulgar marxist) and argues to uphold the base-superstructure metaphor which Marx set forth in the 1859 preface to the Contribution to Political Economy. In a nutshell, the metaphor basically said that the base of all society is the economic structure, where everything else (legal and political institutions, for example) rise as a superstructure on this base. The implication is that the most influential thing in society is indeed our economic system. The further implication here, and surely what Marx was trying to say, is that capitalism is the defining aspect of everything and essentially the primarily determining entity in society.GA Cohen upholds this metaphor by first scouring the 1859 preface, then other Marx works and finally arguing for the legitimacy of the &quot;primary of productive forces&quot; himself. His arguments are concise and powerful. If you are a serious student of Marxism, the read is basically mandatory and helps break the illusion that there is really one theory of Marxism and thats it. Cohen's interpertation of Marx tends to be the one that most people identify Marx with themselves and also tends to paint Marxism as cold and determinist (despite his attempts to keep away from the dreaded title).However, if you are going to read this, be sure to read Althusser, Williams and Lukacs. These are the other three major points on the debate and reading them will give you a rounded perspective on the entire thing. I tend not to agree with Cohen (though that doesn't show in my rating) and think that if you read a lot of Marx, you can see he himself differing from Cohen. The famous 11th statement in his Thesis of Feurbach sums it all up:&quot;The philosophers have only interperted the world, in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.&quot;Cohen's views on the economic base's primacy doesn't leave much room for this statement to be anything other than a hollow statement."},{"Title":"Correlation of the IJK roadmeter to the International Roughness Index: Final report","review":"This book has some virtues, in terms of clarity of exposition, but as a reading of Marx it leaves a lot to be desired. Like Jon Elster's attempts of making (non)sense of Marx that followed it, this text reads into Marx a set of assumptions taken for granted within neoclassical economics but entirely foreign to Marx's work. If you want to see how Marx and Marxism measure up to the unquestionable and seemingly unthinkable criteria of bourgeois thought, read this. But if you want to understand Marx, read Althusser. 'For Marx' is a good place to start, but be sure to read the essays collected in 'The Humanist Controversy' and 'Philosophy and the Spontaneous Philosophy of the Scientists' too, not to mention 'Reading Capital' and 'Machiavelli and Us' ... Cohen may be easier to read, but only because Cohen doesn't challenge any of the ideology of capitalism that is as invisible to most people as water is to the fish that swim in it."},{"Title":"Oscillator Design & Computer Simulation","review":"The book is probably the best available on general discrete oscillator design from low frequency up through several GHz.

Lewis, mere Christian","review":"First of all, let me qualify my comments by saying that I am an ARDENT and DEVOTED C.S. Lewis fan. I have two shelves in one of my six sagging bookcases exclusively devoted to C.S. Lewis' works alone. Long ago, I committed myself to reading at least one book by Lewis each month of the year, and I have faithfully kept up this practice for many years now. I say all of this only to introduce myself as a somewhat enlightened Lewis-monger. When I greedily approached the book &quot;C.S. Lewis: Mere Christian&quot; I was no stranger to the world and writings of C.S. Lewis. But this book by Kathryn Lindskoog opened up realms (literal &quot;realms&quot;) of understanding about the man and his thought that I could not possibly have held together and formulated on my own. Her knowledge of each area of Lewis' thought is not only the knowledge of a well-read enthusiast (as mine may perhaps be), but here in her work one gets the sense of a profound scholar who has actually met the man. She speaks with such authority that each summary dazzles the reader, awakening an important point hitherto unrealized. Here you will not find a boring half-hearted amalgam of foot-noted facts, but a living and cohesive STORY worthy of the depth and consistency of C.S. Lewis. For instance, in my favorite chapter, entitled &quot;Prayer&quot; the author cites Lewis' marvelous poem of the same name, and comments that &quot;he warned readers not to take the last line too seriously.&quot; This is an allusion to Lewis' own comments in a later book of his own, entitled &quot;Prayer: Letters To Malcolm&quot;. Not many of us are blessed with such a concordance-like Lindskoogian grasp of Lewis' thought. And truly, that is the beauty of her achievement here. As you are gripped by her easy flowing writing style, you almost forget that you are getting a Ph.D. in Lewisology. Reading this book is like cramming forty topically-arranged C.S. Lewis books into your head with the ease and delight of sipping a cup of coffee. And this brings me to my vacation. When I took &quot;Mere Christian&quot; along with me to Vancouver Island one fine summer, I found that instead of enjoying the ocean as much as I should have... too often I was rather tucked away in some coffee shop... taking notes on napkins, looking up only long enough to see that the sun had gone down. C.S. Lewis died thirteen days before I was born. I have often wished, and wished sincerely, that I could have talked with this man who has meant so much to me in my life. I look forward to doing so in heaven. This book is the closest I have come to doing so on earth."},{"Title":"C.S. Lewis, mere Christian","review":"Kate Lindskoog's masterful synopsis of Lewisian thought is like a detailed map of the Alps. You can enjoy the Alps without a map, and you can enjoy Lewis without Lindskoog. But you understand the terrain so much better with the map!I have been saturating in C. S. Lewis's books for the past six months and this is one of the most helpful books I have come across. It is a topical guide to C. S. Lewis, but more than that, it is also a commentary. Lindskoog's documentation is thorough and each chapter ends with suggestions for further reading about the given topic. Perhaps the most delightful aspect of this book is Lindskoog's mastery not only of Lewis's apologetics, but of his fiction. She deftly illustrates the former with the latter, and therein reveals the incredible unity in Lewis's own work.Excellent!!!"},{"Title":"C.S. Lewis, mere Christian","review":"No C.S.

Lewis, mere Christian","review":"Getting inside the mind of Lewis is the great accomplishment of Kathryn Lindskoog. She does a wonderful job summarizing the thinking of CS Lewis. Those who are fascinated with Lewis, a man who I believe was quite mysterious in his private world but fairly public with his writing, will devour this book. Here you will learn about Lewis' thoughts on smoking and drinking (he knew smoking was a bad idea, but he was not a teetotaler); that next to Christianity, dualism makes the most sense (interesting!); and the fact that Lewis gave 2/3rds of his money to charity--and why.This gives you an idea of the information available to us through the good biographer Lindskoog. She does not fail to support herself with endnotes, and one of the 5 appendices gives a calendar of how you could read a Lewis book every month during the year (with suggestions based on the season). I might have to try it myself, though I've already read most of what is suggested. (Nothing wrong with rereading Lewis!)

Published in 1939, it is the first ethnographic study of a Japanese village, indeed one of the first work of anthropology which did not take as its object a tribal society or an isolated island community. As such, it served as a reference for generations of students, who first tried to compensate the dearth of scholarly material in English about Japanese society, then used the book as a benchmark to assess social change in the post-war period. Suye Mura even created its sequel industry, with a book on The Women of Suye Mura based on the research notes of John Embree's widow, and several essays by a Japanese ethnographer documenting the changes in the village in the five decades after Embree's study. Suyemura has now been merged with five other localities to form Asagiri Town in Kumamoto Prefecture, and thus no longer exists as an administrative unit.On a first approach, the reader could confuse this small village community in Southwestern Japan with a primitive society on a remote island or a tribal group in the heart of Africa. The ethnographic method, borrowed from Radcliffe-Brown who directed Embree's studies at Chicago and wrote the book's Introduction, reinforces the isolation of the local community from the national context and depicts village life as largely static, with little change in social structure and lifestyles from past centuries.Rural life in Suye Mura appears today as the reflection of a distant past, with alien mores and customs. The photo pages includes a picture of small children hunting lice in each other's head, or another of an elderly woman with bare breasts, depicted as a \\"farmer's wife in hot-weather working attire\\". Practical pranks include serving soup with live frogs which jump out as each guest lifts the cover of her soup bowl. People use shochu mixed with snake skin to cure venereal disease. When the firstborn child in a family is a daughter, people will say politely, \\"That is fortunate--now, when the son is born, there will be a nursemaid to carry him about.\\" For good measure, the villagers see distant foreigners as uncouth and dirty: they explain the depression in silk prices by the laziness of American girls, who \\"did not care to wash their silk stockings and now bought only cheap rayon hose which could be thrown away as soon as they became soiled\\".As Embree notes, peasants the world over are notorious for their broad and earthy humor, and the Japanese peasant is no exception. Any ceremony, however minor, always winds up with some drinking and singing. A social gathering usually begins with stiff formality and ends with orgiastic abandon. Farmers' wives drink and smoke in abundance, and they exchange lewd jokes about each other's sex life. Obscene songs and dances are typical of rural festivities, and traditional songs include references to men's penises or women's genitals. While the actual sex act is very private, jokes about it and imitation of it in dances are both free and frequent. Young children, especially boys, often play at sex games, jokingly chasing girls and exposing themselves. When young men return from the barracks, the women of their village dress up in outlandish costumes, often as soldiers or as tramps, and meet the returning procession with obscene jokes and pranks, causing bursts of laughter and gaiety.Elder women are particularly bawdry, and \\"young women would not think of indulging in the dances of their mothers\\". The school and local authorities have instilled a new self consciousness and modesty concerning sex, so that young people with more education tend to be less frank in speech and action. But it was still customary for a young man to wrap a towel around his face at night and to enter a maid room unobserved by the family and unseen by the girl until he actually lay down beside her. In such a case she could accept or refuse him a she pleased, and since his face was covered by a towel there would be no bruised feelings if he was rejected. Another living custom in this rural community was the \\"three-day rent marriage\\", in which a girl goes a few days to the house of the groom, and then either concludes formal marriage or returns to her family if the experience failed.The years 1935 to 1936, during which John Embree and his wife conducted fieldwork, were just one year away from Japan's all-out military aggression in China. Despite later criticism that Embree was impervious to the changes occurring around him, nationalism and the rise of militarism loom large in his account of village life. Concern over the military had a weight in the anthropologist's consideration when choosing the field. He states that \\"Suye is far from any military zone, and thus our work did not come under undue suspicion by the military\\". Schoolteachers are full of conscious nationalism and the uplift spirit. They bring the nation to the village: being constantly changed from place to place by the government, their loyalty are chiefly to Japan as a nation rather than any particular region. Their recreation and associations are mostly among themselves, and their wives neither drink nor smoke in contrast to farmers' wives, \\"who do both constantly\\".Nationalism and devotion to the Emperor are stressed in education, in conscription, in public lectures by governmental officials, and in the encouragement of societies such as the Women's Patriotic Society. Once a year the village has its attention drawn to war through the reservists' military review by army officers from Kumamoto. Some conscripts are sent to Tokyo as Imperial guards, or to the distant lands of Formosa and Manchukuo. In every classroom is a world-map or map of Asia which shows Japan in red as a very small land indeed, compared to the mainland nations of Asia. Charts of various nations' military strength, always emphasizing the smallness of Japan in comparison to these others, are hung in various schoolrooms. In neutral tone, Embree notes that \\"these maps and charts illustrate to the farmer and his child how essentially reasonable it is for Japan to enlarge, and how unreasonable are those nations that object\\".Colonialism is brought closer to home through patterns of migration. Many people emigrate from Suye to other regions, and people from outside the village form a significant proportion of households. Although most people migrate to nearby towns and provinces, outposts of the Japanese empire provide a safety valve for individualists and other misfits: \\"today most of the cases of men who \\"did not get along\\" have gone to Manchukuo, the land of opportunity\\". The author also notes that \\"historically, many Koreans have come into Kyushu\\", and he refers on several occasions to a few Koreans families in the remote hamlet of Hirayama. These Korean mountain workers seem to face severe prejudices from the rest of the population. They have no official koseki record and their children do not attend the village school. One one occasion the police comes to the village to arrest one Korean worker from Hirayama \\"to prevent him from beating his wife to death\\". Reflecting on his experience, John Embree notes with nostalgia that \\"international friendship was never at a higher point than during some of Suye's drinking parties of 1935-36\\". But some parties were already excluded from the feast, and international relations between Japan and the United States would soon take a more somber tone."},{"Title":"Suye Mura: A Japanese village ([The University of Chicago publications in anthropology : ethnological series])","review":"Written in 1936, Suye Mura looks at life in rural Japan from an anthropologist's perspective. Initially I was very impressed with the book as the writing seemed breezy and informative. However, the second half of the book began to drag, as Embree's writing became more pedantic. Further, in later chapters he freely peppers the text with Japanese terms (not a bad thing if the book has a glossery to refer to - but with no glossery it becomes irritating to flip back and forth to figure out what the word is)."},{"Title":"The wisdom of the living religions","review":"But it is a cool old book.

The result of this closure returned western Europe to an earlier &quot;natural&quot; and rural economic system, which set in motion a shifting of the balance of power in Europe from the Mediterranean region to the north.Although by the time Mohammed and Charlemagne was published the theory that Rome had collapsed suddenly under the impact of the immense German invasions during the fifth century was being qualified, it was Pirenne's theory on the end of the Ancient World and the beginning of the Middle Ages that upset traditional historical conceptions. He advanced the thesis that the Ancient World ended only after the Arab invasions of the seventh and eighth centuries had swept around the coasts of Mediterranean and had converted it into a Moslem lake on which, as one Arab writer said, the Christians could no longer &quot;float a plank.&quot; This, Pirenne argued, had been accomplished by the last quarter of the eighth century and had destroyed the essential unity of the Roman Empire. For centuries the Mediterranean had been a &quot;Roman lake&quot; the Mare Nostrum of the Romans which held the great imperial structure together: Rome's trade and commerce, its military and naval might, the important exchange of ideas.The Mediterranean unity of the Roman Empire had not, according to Pirenne, been destroyed by the German tribes that had occupied the western Empire. The Germans admired the superior Roman civilization and diligently set about to continue it, copying everything from the Roman emperors' dress and ceremonies to the government structures and gold coinage. They did whatever they could to preserve Roman culture.This book is a classic which is as timely today as it was when it was first published on the eve of WWII. Read it for Pirenne's immaculate scholarship and his then provocative theory that the Teutonic &quot;barbarians&quot; were the upholders and awestruck heirs of Rome and not its destroyers--that distinction belongs to rise Islam."},{"Title":"Mohammed and Charlemagne","review":"Mohammed and Charlemagne is the last work of Henri Pirenne. It was published after his death and represents a masterpiece of historical scholarship. This is a seminal work that challenged the thesis that Germanic barbarians obliterated the Roman Empire. His revolutionary thesis was that the unexpected rise and advance of Islam led to the downfall of the Empire. With the rise of Islam, the Mediterranean was no longer a thoroughfare of commerce and ideas. Without the Mediterranean, commerce dried up to a trickle and Europe slipped into the Middle Ages.The revision and completion of the book was completed by one of Pirenne's students after his death. That leads to one of my criticisms. Previous works by Pirenne I found engaging and masterfully written. This work however, seemed to lack the same literary style and, as a consequence, I found it to be a choppy read that lacked the clear crispness of his previous works. While this statement is subjective, it is not irrelevant. When Pirenne expounds on economic and sociological issues of the Middle Ages his words literally leap off the page. It is disappointing that this subject does not surface until the end of the book."},{"Title":"Mohammed and Charlemagne","review":"Henri Pirenne's legacy lies in his famous thesis, publishedposthumously in 1937 as \\"Mohammed and Charlemagne\\" (and statedearlier in numerous articles): namely, that whereas theGermanic invasions of the IV and V century broke the politicalunity of the Mediterranean world, they did not break itscultural and economic unity. The ancient world kept huggingthe coastline 'like frogs around a pond' and the East reassertedits supremacy over the West. All this changed when the Islamicinvasions conquered Northern Africa and the EasternMediterranean, closing the commercial and cultural exchangesbetween the two halves of the Roman empire and capturing thetwo most vibrant centres of commerce and culture (especially,theological culture) of the Byzantine empire: Syria and Egypt,whose religious separatism had been a constant worry for theEastern Roman emperors.As a consequence, the center of gravity of the European economyshifted to the more agrarian and less romanized regions aroundthe Rhine (Charlemagne's capital is in Aix-La-Chapelle, nowadaysAachen) while the cities of Italy and Southern France decayed.It is this which eventually led to the emergence of a diversifiedWestern European culture as opposed to the Middle East and,eventually, Eastern (Orthodox) Europe. And therefore Charlemagnecould never have existed without Mohammed.However, this is not the whole story. As Dennett and Lopez noted,lack of Oriental merchandise in Merovingian lists may notnecessarily be due to a dearth of imports but to events onthe supply side and most importantly to the opening of theRussian route to Baghdad, as Scandinavian coin hoards show(e.g., Bohlin and Riising). Hence the rise of Quentovic andDorestad as important ports and the Frisian trade until theirdestruction by Northman raiders.Although commerce was now closed to Frankish shipping,trade in the Mediterranean had long been the prerogativeof Syrians, who had extensive colonies in Marseilles.Meroviangian cities in the region had already been decliningfor some time and ideas of a renaissance of a Romano-Germanculture in the VI and VII centuries are overrated by itslack of originality; the foremost product of VI centuryerudition is the largely fallacious encyclopedia of Isidore.Despite its flaws, this work is fundamental for its boldness inpresenting a continental and often world view of history andof great transformations.

His point is well taken, that the Moslem invasions of the 7th and 8th centuries were just as crucial, if not more so, to the dawn of the Middle Ages as were the Germanic invasions of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th. However, as far-sighted as this idea may be, there is a near obsessiveness with proving his point that tends to make Pirenne's work seem less than well-founded. Several wide sweeping generalizations are made, such as the observation that the Germanic invaders contributed nothing of worth to their new surroundings, but rather came for the social paradise that was the Roman Empire. Also, he seems to contradict his own conclusions from time to time, as in his assertion that Charlemagne both sought and did not seek a Mediterranean Empire during his reign. As a whole, though, the book is a fascinating read.For those who do not have any knowledge of Latin or French, the book makes a difficult read, as many of his sources are quoted in their original language, and beginning historians may have trouble with the veritable barrage of unfamiliar names and concepts. However, two works which may make this problem a little less severe are William Bark's &quot;Origins of the Medieval World,&quot; and &quot;The Pirenne Thesis,&quot; edited by Alfred Havighurst."},{"Title":"Mohammed and Charlemagne","review":"Although by many dismissed as \\"dated\\", Pirenne's \\"M&C;\\" remains a central piece of historical writing that cannot be ignored.That is why first-rate scholars of today, like Michael McCormick, are still wrestling with the range of issues Pirenne brought into focus. (McCormick's \\"Origins of the European economy, 300-900\\" is an indispensable modern masterpiece, by the way).While Pirenne certainly overstated his case in some respects (particularly in minimizing the economic decline of the Mediterrenean in the fifth and sixth centuries along with an oversimplified picture of the Carolingian Empire as an essentially non-monetary society), some aspects retain relevance, and also some validity:1. Pirenne emphasized the crucial importance of the nort-western Frisian trade in Carolingian times in the \\"new economy\\". This point is uncontroversial today; what is probably dated is Pirenne's restriction of monetary Carolingian economy to this region; McCormick, for example, is highly convincing in his arguments that the Carolingian juggernaut fed the Slavic slave export to the Islamic countries (and to a lesser extent, to Byzantium) by way of Venice.2. It is an indubitable fact that the Rhone valley and ports like Marseilles were wholly insignificant in Carolingian times, in complete contrast to their pivotal role in Merovingian times. (McCormick and others don't dispute that).But, this is the only region of Gaul that has a direct Mediterrenean connection!!Thus, dynamically speaking, Pirenne is perfectly correct in saying that France's link to the rest of the Old Roman world shifted northwards, namely through the Alpine passes and Germany and so on.The Mediterrenean \\"unity\\" was indeed a broken thing at the time of Charlemagne, in the sense that it was not transport acrooss the sea that connected Gaul to the rest as it had been up till the..seventh century.And what might the role of the rise of Islam be here?To mention a few points:1. McCormick notes that the large factories for the production of garum around Gibraltar went into a precipitious decline as the result of the Muslim invasions of North Africa (and then Spain). This is an uncontroversial issue.But, how would these products have been spread throughout the (northern) Mediterrenean?An ideal stopping place along a coastal-hugging route would, indeed, be Marseilles.It would therefore be highly interesting to study whether Marseilles, in Merovingian times up to the Arab invasions, was a major transit station milking off Spanish products.If that was the case, then the Muslim expansion cannot get \\"off the hook\\" for the decline in the importance of the Rhone area.2. If I remember correctly, a major export article from Merovingian Gaul was timber, along with wine and grain. The timber was sent to wood-poor areas like Nort Africa and Syria.While the withering of Rome in the fifth and sixth centuries would result in a probable collapse in the wine and grain export from Gaul, the timber export would hardly have been affected (or rather, that is something to find out!).But, the demand after construction materials like timber is highly sensitive to political distress. Furthermore, as the result of the Muslim invasions, it would seem highly imprudent to furnish the new masters in Syria and North Africa with building materials for fleets.Thus, as I see it, the Muslim invasions in the southern mediterrenean may have dealt the deathblow to a flourishing timber trade down the Rhone, and that in this sense, Pirenne was right with regard to the devastating impact of these invasions on Gaulish economy.Anyway, aside from these speculations, Pirenne's book is elegantly written and is a very good read."},{"Title":"Mohammed and Charlemagne","review":"This was a dense and sometimes intractable read with a few startling insights. I found it hard going but worth the slog. Pirenne suffers a little from the historian's deformity of Kingitis, and expends a deal of space tracking the rise and fall of the early Germanic monarchs and those around them. This is reality TV for the pre-Marconi erudite, and not for everyone. I personally have a taste for more details of the agricultural landscape, diet, medicine, philosophical ideas and the other trappings of a whole civilisation. As we are dealing with the fall of the classical West, philosophical ideas are not far away, but that it about as far as it goes.So I might have written this book off with two or three stars. Why didn't I? Well, because there is a striking new way of looking at the Mediterranean world and the transition from late antiquity to the Middle Ages, and one that I find Pirenne has managed to sell to me. Pirenne's assiduous collection of royal mugs reveals a picture of the hairy barbarians who penetrated the Empire quite different to the usual. He states no less that that the Goths, Vandals, Lombards and Franks who indundated most of Western Rome, beside sacking the odd city like Rome, did not actually displace Rome. They became part of it. Continuity was preserved, not just in Byzantium but in Africa, Italy, Languedoc and Iberia. The Germans wanted the status of Roman citizenship, once they had tasted it.So why, then, did the Western Empire nevertheless collapse and Europe sink into a Dark Age? The economy collapsed, feudalism took hold, gold coin was no longer minted and Latin fragmented into the score of languages we see today, retained in a pure form only by the clergy. Why, if the martially potent Germans sought to retain the empire, did they not do so? Pirenne's answer is that the astonishing, explosive expansion of Islam a mere few years after the death of Muhammad turned Europe on its head and the Western Mediterranean into a corsairs' boating lake. Africa, the bread-basket, was lost in a flash. Trade across the sea stagnated. Iberia and Sicily were overrun and Constantinople besieged. Parts of Southern France were occupied and cities from Italy to Scandinavia raided. What the German and Turkic barbarians did not achieve by way of fragmenting the Empire Islam achieved in a moment. Europe turned in on itself.This is a compelling vision, and explains some oddities such as the simultaneous fragmentation of Latin as a vulgar tongue and perfection as a language of erudition. It also chimes well with the aspiration to continuity which obviously hung about the Holy Roman Empire. The Empire felt itself to be the old but clearly was not. The oddly tense relationship between the Church and the Emperor acquires some clarity in Pirenne's light, as well.So on the whole I found this a tiring but very worthwhile read. I am glad I persevered."},{"Title":"Mohammed and Charlemagne","review":"Like most revisionist histories, it's enjoyable to see an authors attempts at cause and effect even if you don't agree with some of their arguments.The Roman Empire faced a north-south divide between the Roman south and the German north before being broken by the Wanderung, so the concept is not new and the idea that the Islamic Conquest closed off the Roman Mare Nostrum is self-evident. I do take issue with this thesis that the Germanic invasions had no lasting impact (you should remember that each historian is a product of their time), they don't call it the Dark Ages for nothing. Yes, the world of 650AD may have been recognisable to an inhabitant of 400AD, but in purely technological or agricultural terms. After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, where are the tax receipts, the literature, the civic building projects and the infrastructure repairs and the developed legal processes? While the german tribes who crossed the Rhine may have looked upon the Empire as a cash cow or lands to be expropriated, they were too unsophisticated to run it themselves, relying first on romanised patricians, then the Church to handle the levers of government as the provinces collapsed into decay and internecine warfare. It wasn't until those statelets coalesced into mature principalities that the decay was able to be reversed from Charlemagne onwards. However they still harked back to the forms of the Roman Empire that they had supplanted.The closing off of the Mediterranean is a different matter, easily verified through documentary, archaeological and mercantile sources. Again, a group of people looking enviously at the Roman patrimony who did their best to supplant it, but one that Pirenne here accurately describes as a huge cultural and economic shift, that continues to this day with a north-south and an east-west divide across the Mediterranean. The only real obstacle to an Islamic Roman Empire was Byzantium, behind who sheltered the western statelets.Whether you agree with Pirenne or not, it is still an absorbing study of the collapse and division of the Roman Empire whose ghost still haunts us today."},{"Title":"Mohammed and Charlemagne","review":"This magnificent 284 page piece of scholarship was first published in English in 1939 by W.W.

Read David Whitehouse's &quot;Moh, Charl and Origins..&quot; and that tells you what P says quite quickly. That's the only book you need.

Prienne tackles on how the Germanic invasions affected the day to day life and function of the Roman Empire. Then he addresses how the spread of Islam was really the death knell for the Roman Empire."},{"Title":"Mohammed and Charlemagne","review":"The central question discussed in this book is: why the Dark Ages? Why did Europe take such a catastrophic slide backwards?Pirenne's answer is that Arab conquerors turned the Mediterranean into a Muslim lake, and, as a result, trade plummeted and Europe went into an economic death-spiral.Unfortunately, this answer does not satisfy many modern historians. At their boldest, they claim that Pirenne was trying to explain something (\\"The Dark Ages\\") that simply did not exist. You might want to argue about that, but there is very little argument about the idea of the \\"Muslim Lake.\\" In fact, during most of the period under investigation, the Eastern Mediterranean was a Byzantinue lake!Let us not forget that Muhammad and his tribes were people of the desert, who knew everything about camels but nothing at all about ships: \\"Muslim fleets\\" were built by non-Arabs (and non-Muslims) and they were also staffed by mercenaries who knew which way the winds blew in the Mediterranean. Nevertheless, the \\"Muslim fleets\\" were annihilated by the Byzantine \\"secret weapon\\" known as \\"Greek Fire.\\"To cap it all off, there is no evidence at all that trade between Europe and the Middle East took a fall. Prof. Pirenne thought he had found some, but modern research has found a lot more which contradicts the fragments he found.As for those pesky \\"Dark Ages,\\" they were not as productive of books and high intellectual culture, which academics love, but they were extremely productive in inventions which enabled farmers to produce more and people to eat more: the deep plow with moldboard, the three-field cropping system, the breeding and use of really big horses to use as draft animals and \\"war horses,\\" chain-mail armor, the high-backed saddle, the stirrup, the crossbow...the era was not really dark at all, but does rather raise the question of why all these crucial innovations had to await the fall of the Roman Empire.I suspect that a couple of books will help you explore these problems: Rodney Stark'sGod's Battalions: The Case for the Crusadesand the same author'sThe Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success.But the main one is Peter Brown'sThe Rise of Western Christendom: Triumph and Diversity, A.D. 200-1000, 2nd Edition (The Making of Europe)."},{"Title":"Mohammed and Charlemagne","review":"This is the first book I have read by Pirenne and I will certainly read the others. It was very illuminating of a particularly difficult period to comprehend.The book is important in that it throws a lot of components not often discussed in the military-dynastic histories that are more readily available on this period, or for that matter on any other. The concept of investigating the economic structures was revolutionary in Pirenne's time, and this is the principal, most important contribution of his dissertation, which must be considered incomplete, as I read in the introduction that his son gave the manuscript to a scholar that was one of Pirenne's best students to polish for publication, and that it was the standard procedure for his father to write every book twice over, the second version being usually significantly changed from the first. I also read the book in French, as I find a lot of foreign works are often censored and adapted when translated into English.I think his research was superb, as it approaches the entire periods discussed from an economic point of view. The period after the fall of the Roman Empire is not, according to Pirenne, as dark as we had previously considered. The Roman system persevered for centuries, it was the invasion of the Mediterranean by the Muslims from the 7th century forward that crushed the Roman legacy and brought forth the \\"Middle\\" Ages. However Pirenne does not at any point clarify that both Christianity and Islam were equally intellectually inferior to the culture they were replacing, which needed renovation and evolution rather than obliteration. At least a chapter should have been dedicated to this important issue, which was not economical, yet surely had an effect on the economy and could have been discussed from that viewpoint, such as for example the issue of interest in finance and its conflict with Christian teaching during this period. Yet I am nevertheless impressed by the amount of information that Pirenne provides to support the preservation of Roman culture and infrastructure in the newly established barbaric kingdoms.My one point of contention, and it is an important point, is that it should be noted that as a westerner and a christian, Pirenne was prejudiced against the muslim, which he tends to color as a barbaric horde of destruction and whom he continuously blames for not following or maintaining the roman cultural models. This is a subtle, yet latent component in the book yet it is not quite accurate as a historical truth. For all his discussion of papyrus and parchment, for example, Pirenne omits that during the entire period of the Middle Ages, Europe's most important library was in Cordoba, starting around in 788, or more than a full generation prior to Charlemagne's coronation. Please see C. Prince, 'The Historical Context of Arabic Translation, Learning, and The Libraries of Medieval Andalusia', Library History, v. 18, July 2002, pp. 73-87 for a most refreshing view on the topic of book production, libraries and paper trade from the 8th century onwards, as well as to the control of quality that existed in Arab copies. Its a well known fact that this library had over 60,000 volumes listed in its 48 volume catalogue while Christendom's two largest libraries at Avignon and the Sorbonne contained at most 2,000 volumes until as late as 1150. More importantly, the preservation of classical texts is their greatest achievement. These texts would have disappeared forever, we can be sure with the blessing of the Christian church, as many others undoubtedly did, had it not been preserved for us by Muslim scholars and libraries.The viewpoint of western cultural centrism is not only obsolete, but a dangerous idiocy that has caused and continues to cause an inaccurate reading of history as well as to fuel and distort the animosity between Christian and Muslim cultures, which was basically then and has been through the centuries that of rival empires. One should keep that in mind when noting that the entire corpus of Aristotle's works were among the treasures that were salvaged from the Arab libraries and that making their way back into western cultural mainstream provided the basis for the Renaissance and the renewal of Modern Europe."},{"Title":"Mohammed and Charlemagne","review":"I agree with the other reviewer that this book is dated in the light of later studies, esp. in archaeology and more critical examinations of historical sources.

Nick opened up a Manhattan restaurant that has just taken off. Currently he is watching a Yankee-Red Sox game at the Stadium when his girlfriend Bree Davis calls the restaurant to see how things are going after a tremendous review in the paper. Though the restaurant is doing great, Nick learns he got a call from his estranged father's accountant that something is wrong with the books of the family business now run by brother Joe, who rumors fly is near bankruptcy.Nick returns to the Bay only to find Joe murdered. Though he knows he should allow the police led by his ex-partner to investigate, Nick refuses to sit on the sidelines. He makes inquiries that upset a lot more people than just the SFPD as he begins to uncover something more sinister and conspiratorial than just some falling out over debts.SQUEEZE PLAY is a great suspense thriller that works on several levels due a strong cast. Nick is the focus of the tale with his ill-accepted investigation, but the secondary characters turn the action-packed plot into a game-winning walk off home run as they provide depth to the story line and the lead protagonist. However, the support crew is not just benchwarmers as they seem so real; they are the fielders that enable R.J.

Different authors study the same programs and come to opposite conclusions. Since they all offer elaborate defenses of their methods, making sense out the analyses becomes a matter of statistical nit-picking. Meanwhile, they don't say much about how or why educational competition works. This book approaches the issue from the opposite direction: it doesn't offer any statistical proof of anything, but it provides a challenging look at the reality of educational competition.What I really liked about this book is that the author doesn't try to prove that school choice does or doesn't work. Instead, he dives into trying to understand how it affects the public schools in the community. Using extensive interviewing, research, and document collection, he offers the deepest look I know of into how school choice competition actually plays out. The reliance on interviews and historical narrative also has the plus of making it much more engaging than the standard analysis of school vouchers. The book also offers some important insights regarding urban schooling and the nature of urban school reform.This is a book that is definitely worth reading for anyone interested in school vouchers, or even those who just want to learn more about school reform or urban schooling."},{"Title":"Revolution at the Margins: The Impact of Competition on Urban School Systems","review":"This book provides an evaluation by an educational and governmental researcher of the impact of several schemes of the 1990's setting up voucher and charter schools - paying poor parents if they withdrew their children from inner-city state schools and enrolled them in the private sector. As previous school reform efforts backed by liberal-leftists had failed children, and as court-propelled desegregation led to White flight, many of America's inner-city schools became so appalling that even Democrat-voting Blacks wanted the opportunity to seek private education - and linked up with Republicans to achieve that goal. Frederick Hess's concern here is with the argument of pro-choice campaigners that the new private schools, far from threatening public schools by creaming off brighter children, would actually stimulate much-needed reforms in the public sector; and his strategy is to interview heads, teachers and administrators in three public authority areas which allowed some degree of parental choice - Milwaukee, Cleveland and the Edgewood district of San Antonio, Texas.Regrettably, Revolution at the Margins says rather more about educational research than about the impact of pro-choice initiatives. Essentially, Hess finds virtually no result at all from competition with the politically well-entrenched public sector. Bureaucrats occasionally mobilized themselves to a little mendacious propaganda (hanging banners outside public schools saying 'High Standards Start Here'), to teaching test-taking strategies to children, and to mounting legal actions to cramp the style of choice schools; but usually there was no action beyond verbal \\"lashing out\\" (for example at the \\"racist and rapacious\\" proponents of choice). Behind and explaining such inertness lie the 'education systems' of the (Black and Hispanic) slums with their low wages for, and high turnover of teachers. An area that *did* risk union wrath by sacking scores of teachers one spring found it had to re-employ them all, in different schools, by the autumn. Since only idealists and incompetents will work for low wages, yet need self-respect, state teachers would simply shrug off the arrival of competition and continue in their own favoured (\\"idiosyncratic\\", says Hess) ways - telling Hess \\"we have too much on our hands to worry about vouchers and charters\\" and \\"you're lucky we're here to provide this service\\" (even when 40% of state teachers had themselves stopped sending their own offspring to state schools). Quite often, because of high pupil turnover in slum schools, teachers had literally no idea that their school was indeed losing pupils to the private sector. In any case, the size of the challenge in the three schemes studied was slight. Hess concludes that only really large choice schemes will prove sufficiently \\"fearsome\\" to make state teachers change; and that, even then, change will be unlikely without background 'institutional reform' needed for the last thirty years but never adopted - notably, giving heads the power to sack weak teachers. State educators are in an impossible position, apparently, after decades of liberal-left misrule. \\"Imagine,\\" Hess writes, \\"a private sector producer whose consumers disagree about what kind of product they want; who depends on the support of both consumers and nonconsumers; whose executives are largely unable to evaluate, hire, fire, reward, or sanction employees; and whose product is hard to judge. Any executive, whether Henry Ford, Jack Welch, or Bill Gates - would struggle in the face of such odds.\\" Thus \\"there was no evidence that competition bulldozed away inefficiencies or forced systemic efforts to reform policy or improve practice, as officials had neither the incentive nor the ability to mount aggressive assaults on organizational culture or procedure.\\"Yet, as if all this were not depressing enough, Hess's method of arriving at his conclusions will make grown men weep. It is not just that Hess's 'research' involves none of the normal listings of subjects interviewed, questions asked, percentages favouring different answers, etc. Hess is content to provide the kind historical record of developments that could be, and probably was culled from local newspapers - supplemented by a few conversations of his own. This method results in pages littered with dollar signs, numbers and capital letters as the various outlays are made, as votes are taken, and as unions express outrage; but even this is not the worst.A specialist volume like this should present, first, a testing of whether choice schools produce better end-of-the-year results for pupils than could be expected from their children's starting IQs; and, secondly, a testing of whether such value-added results occur with increasing frequency in state schools after the arrival of private school competition. How else could one possibly say whether either set of schools had truly been doing a good job? Yet test results are scarcely mentioned in this volume, and value-added calculations not at all - and this despite the book being endorsed on its dust jacket by half-a-dozen worthies from the world of educational research. OK, since Hess believes test scores are largely determined by socio-economic circumstances (and never mentions education professor Arthur Jensen), it might have been less problematic for him to ask the children and their parents if they became *happier* as school choice was expanded; but Hess does not even consider, let alone use this humdrum route. Frankly, one wonders what hope there can be for America's children when even a sympathizer with 'choice', as Hess apparently is, cannot imagine and discuss a reasonable way of evaluating the experiment that has been underway in the cities. Hess is right as far as he goes: \\"So long as school systems are governed by rickety bureaucracies, run by managers bereft of data or tools, staffed by employees who have little motivation beyond the intrinsic, charged with producing ill-defined and ambiguous outcomes, and faced with few penalties for poor performance, efforts at substantive improvement - whether market driven or not - will be stifled.\\" But educational research, too, turns out to stand in similar need of data and re-tooling. One thing is sure: experiments in allowing parental freedom will continue by popular demand so long as educators and educationalists persist in the dismal set of attitudes and practices that this book casually reveals."},{"Title":"Revolution at the Margins: The Impact of Competition on Urban School Systems","review":"Hess explores these issues in a unique and interesting way."},{"Title":"Shall I Knit You a Hat?: A Christmas Yarn","review":"This little story teaches sharing and concern for others.

One might argue that the book is about object-oriented design and not about Oracle \`syntax' but if you want to learn about OO check-out books by Booch, Jacobson, Fowler, Rumbaugh, Wirfs-Brock, etc. If you want to learn about Oracle objects try \\"Oracle8 Design Using UML Object Modeling\\" by Dorsey et. al."},{"Title":"High Performance Oracle8 Object-Oriented Design: Your Complete Guide to Creating Fast, Efficient Database Systems","review":"This was just the book I was looking for! A well written, easy to read, technical book written for Oracle relational technicians and designers who want to advance into the object-relational and object oriented paradigm. Interspersed with elucidating diagrams and SQL syntax, the book gives the reader a high comfort level with the new Oracle 8 constructs such as Varrays, nested tables and methods. The author introduces each contstruct, clearly explains them, and then presents ideas as to how to apply them in business applications. In later chapters, after overall data base design is discussed, chapters are dedicated to method design, a discussion on available design tools, UML, Oracle 8 and data warehousing, SQL3. Once finished, the book leaves the reader with an excellent handle on Oracle 8 and how to design data bases in that environment."},{"Title":"High Performance Oracle8 Object-Oriented Design: Your Complete Guide to Creating Fast, Efficient Database Systems","review":"The topics are explained understandable. Should be especially good for beginners. It is a book that summes up Oracle 8 features, that werent there with Oracle 7. But even when talking about object oriented design the authors talkes about the traditional waterfall phase model... anyway, The book is one of those you read thru to see what's the matter and then deepen the parts you want to know more about with other books. A very good enhancement to this are the Steven Feuerstein books on PL/SQL and Packages. If you should deal with Oracle 8i (with the JVM and Corba/IIOP in the Server and stored procedures possible to write in Java) the book is of no use at all.

A Body/Mind Guide to Courageous Living","review":"Once one has explored a bodywork-oriented fitness discipline -- Pilates, Yoga, Feldenkrais, Tai Chi, etc. -- in detail, you will begin to notice something interesting: there are certain exercises/postures/positions that are difficult where the difficulty has nothing to do with the mechanics of doing the exercise. You've got the strength, the flexibility, and the balance, but you still can't do it. Maybe the difficulties have to do with something that we are -- or were -- afraid of, and the fear is still embodied in our posture or our movement.In our culture, we usually pay little to no attention to such issues. In other words, we have a fear of revealing our fears -- especially to ourselves. This book is about the courage to see those fears and, through awareness, to begin to have some mastery over them.For me, understanding how I hold my fear in body is profound. It is the &quot;juice&quot; which keeps me practicing Pilates. While I most certainly appreciate the increased strength and flexibility I've achieved, this connection is what touches my heart. Courage is exactly what it takes to keep exploring this connection.I suspect a desire to avoid the mind-body connection is also why many people stop pursuing such disciplines. Many instructors are afraid (!) to discuss such things in their classes; they may or may not have a powerful relationship with these concepts themselves. Ultimately, I think ignoring this topic is counterproductive; students will eventually stumble onto it themselves. I also suspect that this is why more women persue these disciplines -- they tend to intutitvely grasp both the existence and the value in exploring this particular mind/body connection.To this end, this book is a great introduction to these concepts. I highly recommend it to anyone who regularly practices any of these disciplines. I also recommend it to anyone interested in gaining mastery of their fears -- this avenue is quite likely to produce profound results.Lavinia writes with great clarity and illustrates her points with many stories from her Feldenkrais practice. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"What Are You Afraid Of? A Body/Mind Guide to Courageous Living","review":"I've only experienced a couple of the exercises in this book and am so glad I got it. This book is great. I was afraid to excersise after a car accident because simple movements hurt. I was deathly afraid of physical therapists and thier torture machines. Thankfully someone recommended Feldenkrais and someone else reccommended this book in particular. I was afraid my life was over but not anymore. One of the excerises in this book is from Anat Baniels joint pain series so I bought Anat Baniels neck pain exercises. Even though I never thought about what I was afraid, I had a lot of fears and still do. I have a lot less now. Lavinia Plonka thank you! Great book! Let your life begin! reviews over!!!!! but on side note, why not get an extra copy and carry it with you, it's compact enough, when you see someone with a no fear t-shirt or big sticker on thier vehicle, give them a copy. They may not look like they need it, but it could be best book they ever owned."},{"Title":"What Are You Afraid Of? A Body/Mind Guide to Courageous Living","review":"Lavinia Plonka's book What Are You Afraid of? is certainly a book for our times. It seems that fear is everywhere, in our political, social, and private lives. I found this book enormously insightful. The author is direct and honest in her approach to acknowledging fear and gaining mastery over it. What I particularly found helpful was the focus on ACTION - do this and help is on the way. Ms. Plonka's extensive background in the Feldenkrais Method and her years as a performer lend credence to the exercises she offers here. The illustrations were a delightful bonus."},{"Title":"What Are You Afraid Of? A Body/Mind Guide to Courageous Living","review":"As an underdog I read a lot of books on fear and on the body/mind connection respectively. This should be the first book I came across which devotes on both, and in particular how correct gestures/postures can help alleviate fear, especially those acquired during early lives. In this respect, the objective set per book title \\"What are you afraid of? A body/mind guide to courageous living\\" had been largely achieved, primarily by the first half of it. Sorry to say that the second half of it had been a little bit over stretched with theories. It would be better if the author can give more of the Feldenkrais Method and/or Yoga in fighting against fear/stress. Taking into consideration of the author's background (she's neither an M.D. nor a psychologist) I must express my heartfelt appreciation of her calibre of writing a book of such high quality. In short, recommended!Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.Checking on your tension spots: Stand quietly with your eyes closed. Imagine a line going down the center of your body. Where is your head in relation to that line? Is your neck in front of behind the line? What about your shoulders? Sometimes one shoulder is in front and one is behind. Is your chest thrust forward of the line, or somewhere behind it? Where is your pelvis? Is your lower back arched? Are your knees relaxed or are they locked? Do you feel the weight on your feet in the middle, front, or back? .....Chances are that if you feel yourself \\"out of line,' yiou are using tension to hold yourself in place. Take a fresh stance. Now notice: Are you really comfortable? pg 16Fear defeats more people than any other one thing in the world. - Ralph Waldo Emerson pg 17Success is never final and faiure is never fatal. It's courage that counts. - Jules Ellinger pg 93He who is afraid of a thing gives it power over him. - Moorish proverb pg 98An inflexible spine undoubtedly creates limitations in changing direction, let alone the ability to move ahead (or anywhere, for that matter!). It compromises one's sense of safety: with limited range of motion, how can you respond effectively to life's stresses? ..... A frozen spine often results in a frozen pelvis. A frozen pelvis can indicate impotence, an inability to act, a lack of freedom. pg 132"},{"Title":"What Are You Afraid Of? A Body/Mind Guide to Courageous Living","review":"Experience, in the hands of the talented and the hard working, begets both experts and expertise (this is the kind of word play which, I think, vibrates with similar excursuses in Lavinia Plonka's 2005 book, WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF? A BODY/MIND GUIDE TO COURAGEOUS LIVING). I salute one of our two daughters-in-law, mother of six sons, as \\"expert\\" in home-schooling. She has done it for 13 or 14 years, cooperated with peer parents, shared teaching duties, joined associations, read and debated books and on and on.Similarly, I tip my hat to Asheville's Lavinia Plonka, expert in \\"somatic education.\\" She has been at it a score more years than our daughter-in-law, has read more books, lectured in more countries. Most of Ms Plonka's hands-on clients, I infer, however, come to her referred by others. For them Lavinia Plonka is often their \\"last best hope\\" to free themselves from pain both physical, emotional and more deeply psychic.Lavinia Plonka's nicely illustrated (by the author herself?) and indexed little book shares with readers cases of students with questions, clients in pain, excerpts from the author's wide reading and obiter dicta on this-worldly theories of wellness and the meaning of life.The book can be skimmed in an hour. That should be enough for you to decide if second and third readings -- taking the time recommended to do the carefully selected \\"exercises\\" -- are in order. I myself have happily opted for second and third readings.Debatably but ably, the author focuses on \\"fear\\" and \\"phobias\\" as the often unperceived underlying causes (or contributing factors) of pains and other problems for which her clients seek her coaching and counsel. We are all born, Ms Plonka asserts, with one innate fear: falling. For most others of our acquired fears and their kin, \\"insecurity, pride, anger, territorialism, to name a few\\" (Introduction), we need search no farther than our parents. Face those fears. Convert them (via aikido-like techniques) from foe to partner, and we shall go far!When suddenly terrorized (a mother bear doesn't want us this close to her cubs; a mugger demands our money, etc.), we instinctively arch our backs and throw up our hands. Next we instinctively bend over and put our hands over our faces to protect our viscera and other vital parts. (Illustrations 1.1 and 1.2.) Many of Ms Plonka's clients had been mastered by fear very early in life and their adult postures still show (prior to mentoring) traces to this day of \\"The Startle Relex\\" or cowering or both.Ms Plonka argues that bodily posture reflects emotions and internal values. It is possible, therefore, to learn what ails us deep inside if we first study our skins, muscles and skeletons while slowly doing Feldenkrais exercises, watching, paying attention to ourselves as we make minute adjustments to relieve our physical distress. The book goes on, exercise by exercise, to give us hope that, mirroring Aikido (\\"Way of Peace\\") techniques, we can draw out via external and combined external/internal exercises our inner pains and replace our fears by love.This book is a notably better than average introduction to \\"somatic education.\\" You soon sense that you are in the presence of a master. I give this book 3.6 stars, rounding up to 4.0. The more that you bring to a first reading of WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF? from eastern wisdom, martial arts, the writings of Moshe Feldenkrais, from familiarity with Alba Emoting Method, etc., the more easily and confidently you will draw closer to the core of the author's \\"wisdom.\\" Coming, however, myself from a different background (Roman Catholic religious and ascetic practices, Greek and Scholastic philosophy), there are some larger \\"framing\\" things that I miss in Ms Plonka's tentatively stated world view.--(1) For normal, healthy, morally adequate people, it seems to me, there is less fear and more of the virtue of (human) prudence than Ms Plonka gives us credit for. When we walk in snow we prudently not fearfully take small steps, plant our feet firmly and look for signs of black ice. Twice daily examination of conscience, as recommended by Saint Ignatius of Loyola, does some of what Ms Plonka advocates and can easily be adapted to do justice to some of her personal insights.--(2) Ms Plonka refers only once to any of the classic philosophers of any era -- Rene Descartes -- and that stereotypically. She does not propose to readers any personal cosmic or overarching systematic philosophy or world religion. We find assertions, linkages (body posture/emotion), stresses on paying attention and on and on: stylistic ploys, it seems to me, reminding of Hebrew Scripture's \\"wisdom\\" literature. Yet it is also fairly obvious to me that Lavinia Plonka does in fact, move, without knowing it or at least acknowledging it, within the modern philosophical framework of academic \\"phenomenology\\" as articulated by Edmund Husserl (1859 - 1938).Bright and creative and expert in teaching and learning as Lavinia Plonka has proven herself, I predict that she will happily delve into Christian asceticism and moral theology as well as Husserl and phenomenology, as soon as someone that she trusts leads her to those fountainheads. And the new book that results will put us all deeper in her debt.-OOO-"},{"Title":"Bicyclecowboy.com","review":"On its TV-news and website, CNN features a story about a crazed eco-activist named Hank who is sitting at a stone quarry outside of Moab, Utah with a stick of dynamite taped around his stomach and a detonator in his hand.

We can follow the process of the five methods as the quantative method."},{"Title":"Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing among Five Traditions","review":"Creswell manages to clearly explain differences and similarities of the five methods. Vocabulary, glossaries, examples and illustrations make each of the methodologies come alive to the reader. It is excellent as a review for someone who is writing their thesis, or for a new graduate student to grasp an understanding of qualitative methods. Creswell includes complete articles that illustrate the principles behind each of the methods. This is a \\"how to\\" and \\"what\\" book. It does not go into the philosophy behind each of the methods or the history of their development. For that perspective, try Denzin and Lincoln's Handbook of Qualitative Research. But when you are clearly defining a research project, it isn't philosophy that helps you! This book is a definite must for anyone interested in understanding or critiquing qualitative methods, or writing a qualitative proposal. Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing among Five Traditions","review":"This book really helped me write my master's thesis. For anyone who may be doing graduate study in the social sciences and is interested in qualitative research, this is a GREAT place to start.My friend suggested this book to me when my thesis adviser told me to get a book on qualitative research as I was trying to design my study of a newspaper and its relationships with strategic publics. In this book Creswell clearly and logically lays out five different qualitative research traditions (1. a biographical life history; 2. a phenomenology; 3. a grounded theory study; 4, an ethnography; and 5. a case study). Creswell guides researchers on the rationale for each method, the design, and corresponding data collection, analysis and narrative report, while giving ample references for further reading in one's chosen tradition. Particularly helpful are the appendices that include example studies of each methodology.I needed other sources to supplement what I learned here, but this book really gave me an excellent foundation with which to proceed. I recommend it to anyone who is trying to design a qualitative study and isn't sure where to start."},{"Title":"Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing among Five Traditions","review":"This is one of John Creswell's best books by far.

I am glad our professor choose this text because when we went through various pieces of the five qualitative designs it gave great examples, detailed lists for guidance, and a great glossary. The studies in the text were very helpful as well. I recommend every masters and doctoral student to add it to their bookshelf, I guarantee you will use it a lot. It is invaluable!!!"},{"Title":"Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing among Five Traditions","review":"Creswell's book effectively covers basic theoretical and practical issues regarding biographies, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, and case studies. I studied this book as a graduate student and now use parts of it in my research methods class. He avoids much of the qualitative jargon that so many other qualitative writers can't seem to avoid, thus making this book accessible to students who are not familiar with qualitative approaches. I especially like the convenient tables that summarize key points and the real-life articles in the appendix, one for each approach.There is plenty of information about qualitative research that is not included in the book. For instance, having personally spent a great deal of time reading and applying phenomenology, I can honestly say that there is much more to this technique (theoretically and practically) than what is discussed in the book. For this reason I do not believe that people can conduct expert qualitative research after reading just Creswell - I am sure that he would agree. Other resources are needed. But everyone has to begin somewhere, and Creswell's book is an excellent start.I would like to see an expanded version of this book; one that discusses each qualitative tradition in greater detail.DaveAfter reading some of the example articles at the back of the book I am of the opinion that these articles are the weak spot for this book. In particular, the ethnography article is a very long and old paper (circa 1972?) about school principals that is more a case study than an ethnography. I think that Creswell could have selected a more recent paper that was a true ethnographic study. Also, the Grounded Theory paper on sexual victimization seems too depressing. The Phenomenological paper on the nurse-patient caring relationship is pretty good, however."},{"Title":"Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing among Five Traditions","review":"this book provides clear, concrete examples of five &quot;traditions&quot; or types of qualitative research.

Don't expect a definitive work, but it's a great place to start. Simple explanations that don't assume you already know something. But as you would expect from a &quot;101&quot; book, some descriptions are a little vague or get a broad brush, particularly the 8i features."},{"Title":"Oracle8i Networking 101","review":"Most computer books are very poorly written. No matter how intelligent you are, it's often more difficult than it should be to understand the material. Sometimes you're left feeling like a dummy.That, of course, is why the original &quot;DOS for Dummies&quot; book became so popular. People with no background in a subject often want an introductory book that is well written and contains the background material you need to understand a subject, as opposed to the typical computer book that is often authored by a computer nerd who has the writing skills of a 12 year old and skips over key concepts because the author somehow just assumes you already know.The new Oracle 101 series of books is an attempt to create something like a &quot;Dummies&quot; series for Oracle (a set of introductory books) but so far most of these books fall on their face because the authors don't understand what makes an introductory book successful.The original DOS for Dummies was successful for one simple reason: It was a good book. The word &quot;Dummies&quot; in the title was a joke. The whole point was that readers were not dummies, that they were intelligent people who were being made to feel like dummies because the available books were so bad.Unfortunately, the author of this book on Oracle networking didn't get the joke. She actually believes that you are a dummy.This book is written as if the author is talking to a grade school student. It isn't merely condecending. It's insulting. The author writes as if she really believes you are mostly incapable of understanding anything unless it's couched in baby talk.I, for one, would like to stand up and say that I don't need to read for a third of a page about a recipe for jello salad in order to understand an explanation of how network software is layered. I already know what &quot;layered&quot; means. And I don't need all the talky, conversational comments: &quot;Did you spot all the references to the listener in that example? Good!&quot;Sometimes an analogy is helpful, but in this book the author has decided to begin nearly every topic with an anlogy, and many are tortured. For example, the discussion of MTS begins with a full page devoted to a discussion of cleaning house. The only point is that it's easier to clean house if you have someone to help you. I hardly need a full page of text to understand that.Moveover, the analogy is completely wrong. The idea of MTS is that one process handles many client tasks. The house cleaning analogy would work if MTS put several processes to work on a single client task, but it doesn't -- it does the reverse.There's nothing wrong with a Dummies book, an introductory level book, or whatever you want to call it. But the whole point is to turn out a quality book, where the author understands that readers: (1) are intelligent, but (2) may lack previous experience with the topic, so (3) background concepts and terms will need to be fully explained.Unfortunately, this book does the opposite. The author doesn't get the &quot;Dummies&quot; joke. She is convinced that you really are a dummy, that you must be talked down to and that the book must be filled with baby talk if you are to understand.I'd suggest you avoid this one, which runs to almost 500 pages, and instead get the O'Reilly book on Net8. The O'Reilly book is half the number of pages yet it still covers the material, it's very well written and it doesn't insult your intelligence. Plus you won't have to wade through a full page discussion about cleaning house, recipies for jello salad, etc."},{"Title":"Oracle8i Networking 101","review":"I found this book to be exactly what I needed when I was searching to expand my networking knowledge.

And since the coffee I made at home was never as good as the coffee I could purchase just about anywhere else I would force myself to drive to a nearby coffee shop no matter how inconvenient or expensive this might be.Since I was devoting a great deal of time and money to this quest I decided to purchase Korby Cummer's The Joy of Coffee thinking that the investment would eventually result in a better home brew. Happily, the plan worked.&quot;Joy&quot; is an incredibly detailed, thorough book which begins with the author traveling to Costa Rica to pick beans and includes descriptions of the various means of roasting, grinding, and and brewing. There is a chapter on Espresso and another chapter examining the health effects of caffeine. The author spends time demystifying coffee terms and compares coffees from around the world. He writes about the advantages and disadvantages of various coffeepots and includes a source guide and a glossary. But the book is not only comprehensive-- the writing is engaging. Mr. Kummer also includes forty tempting recipes. I baked the &quot;marvelous mocha cupcakes&quot; which the author says are &quot;wonderful&quot;-- sorry, but I didn't think they were better than &quot;very good&quot;-- in fairness the comments &quot;scrumptious&quot; and &quot;amazing&quot; were elicited by two of my friends who generously agreed to sample them. They lasted one night. I also baked his &quot;unbeatable biscotti&quot;. They were excellent-- very crispy and light-- they lasted two nights. Naturally, I drink them with coffee I brewed from my new pot-- at home.An excellent companion piece is &quot;Glass Paper Beans&quot; which eloquently describes something we would normally take for granted each day, in this case lingering over a cup of coffee at the local cafe. The author, Leah Hager Cohen, describes what is really involved when we sip our brew while browsing the local paper. She introduces us to the the family who picks the beans, the man who cuts the trees to provide the wood pulp for the newspaper and a woman who works at the glass factory and helps to make the glass that holds the coffee. After reading Ms. Cohen you will never take your daily cup for granted and Mr. Kummer will tell you how to fix that cup in your own home."},{"Title":"The Joy of Coffee: The Essential Guide to Buying, Brewing, and Enjoying - Revised and Updated","review":"\\"The Joy of Coffee\\" by Corby Kummer, 1995, 1997, 2003This is a rather amazing book. Mr. Kummer starts with the growing of the coffee bean, harvesting, and ends up describing the selection of the various beans for blends. The truly interesting part is that there end up being so many beans that are usable, or maybe that is just my reading of it. The beans are so variable coming off the tree, and the processing is so intricate, I was surprised that we actually got some coffee. Another thought was the need for exporting all the quality these countries can. They are so cash poor they have to sell all they can to provide for the economic system. We are sure lucky here to be able to enjoy the fruits of our labors without worrying so much about the money, so far."},{"Title":"The Joy of Coffee: The Essential Guide to Buying, Brewing, and Enjoying - Revised and Updated","review":"I learned a lot from this book about coffee, and it was a very valuable source of information when I recently purchased a new espresso machine."},{"Title":"The Joy of Coffee: The Essential Guide to Buying, Brewing, and Enjoying - Revised and Updated","review":"Well, I can honestly say this book has been a God send for me.

I've finally started going more specialty coffee as I won't even drink supermarket coffee any more.Once I started wanting to know more about coffee, I found this book at a used book store. I've been reading it off and on for a while. It is a plethora of coffee information. If you are a relative newbie, this book will give you basic knowledge of almost every aspect of the world of coffee, from its growth and harvesting to making your own wonderful blends of coffee and espresso.A definite must have book for the coffee rookie turned coffee lover!"},{"Title":"The Joy of Coffee: The Essential Guide to Buying, Brewing, and Enjoying - Revised and Updated","review":"This book is great as a reference. There is lots of info on buying, roasting,grinding, etc. Excellent read for for the specialty coffee enthusiast. There aresome good illustrations, but the emphasis is on information.The book mainly deals with the people who only want fresh ground beans. That'sOK, but for many people coffee is simply a part of life, i.e., a pick-me-up atMcDonalds on the way to work or a big pot when guests come. This often means pre-ground supermarket coffee, or even instant. Not everyone has regular access to agourmet coffee shop. The author could have told how to choose, & how to keepcoffee from staling so rapidly. For instance there is enough air left in a can tostale the coffee. Unless it is going to be used up quickly, it should immediately betransferred to a somthing w/o so much oxygen. A zip lock bag & an air-tight foodcontainer works. Also it IS possible to reseal a brick bag. Use a TWIXIT CLIP BAGSEALER (or something similar i.e. Pampered Chef). True, that won't last forever,but I have used coffee for 3 months with just its own \\"sealers\\" & it was still goodwhen it ran out.A book such as this should be written for the maximum number of people who areinterested. Of course most books on this subject are similar, & I guess that mostof the people who love supermarket coffee will probably not be reading a book likethis anyway. All this aside, I repeat, the info is good. If the reader is a gourmetcoffee enthusiast, this is an excellent book to get."},{"Title":"The Joy of Coffee: The Essential Guide to Buying, Brewing, and Enjoying - Revised and Updated","review":"great book, very informative and well written. information and style come together."},{"Title":"Shame and Body Image: Culture and the Compulsive Eater","review":"this is an excellent book writen by two very smart women sharing the growing experiences of their patients. somewhere between academic/clinical and practical help. i liked the exercises alot - in particular identifing the gender of different parts of your body and self. they were very effective if you used them in or out of a therapy setting."},{"Title":"Chris Ware (Monographics Series)","review":"I am a big fan of the work of Chris Ware, so I thought this book would really give me a greater depth of understanding of his work.What is there is quite good, but it is also very short. Only the first 30 or so pages have text that discusses Ware. The rest of the book features images of Ware's work; the great majority of it has already been published in his semi-regular comic, and is familiar to anyone who buys that regularly.Many of the images try to fit a full huge Ware piece of art, often 11 x 17 inches or so onto the size of this book's page, much smaller, so you can't even read the words or make out the details. Also, the book uses huge white margins, so the images could have easily been made larger and more legible.There are some unusual images of Ware's work, including a remarkable wedding invitation he designed for friends of his. But again, it's rather small, and details are lost.Ware's own hardcover datebook does a better job at looking behind the scenes of Ware's published work.This is by no means a bad book, and it has worth, but I wish it had been longer and designed with a little more care."},{"Title":"Chris Ware (Monographics Series)","review":"This monograph was chock full of finely reproduced Ware art not just stuff from his comics, including some photos of his sculptures I had not seen before. The copy the author included as a comentary on the art helped translate the pathos of Chis Ware's art. I think you will enjoy this monograph if you are a Chis Ware enthusist or just a casual fan."},{"Title":"Chris Ware (Monographics Series)","review":"The good part of this book is the second part displaying Ware's art. It's clear and organized, if small. The images are clear and includes comics covers and commercial work.The bad is the first part with the opening text. It's the worst kind of academic mastrubation: inefficient, unengaging and sidelines the subject in order to display the author's authority. Instead of Ware, the author focuses on comics' historical relationship to fine art. In many places, it succumbs to the \\"so good it's not really comics\\" cliche in tone, if not explicitly. The effort to contextualize Ware within arts history by dismissing mid-20th century comics and cartoons is offensive. It makes me suspect the author is shamed by his interest in comics, and desperate to highbrow validate because of it. I agree with an earlier reviewer that highbrow vs lowbrow is no longer a relevant debate, not in the way it's being used here.Ware's work is brilliant, something truly special, worthy of examination. It deserves a good book. This isn't it. I was lucky and checked this out from the library, which I recommend. Skip all writing. Or skip the book entirely and save your money for the Building Stories collection."},{"Title":"Chris Ware (Monographics Series)","review":"I had hoped this book would have more about Chris Ware, but most of it is the author's boring observations about comic art and his theories about what Ware is drawing. I would much rather read about the subject's childhood, and especially the details of his time in art school and in Austin. Instead there's endless verbiage in the Scott McCloud vein. A few interesting reproductions of Ware creations I hadn't seen before are included, but not much else is worth recommending."},{"Title":"Chris Ware (Monographics Series)","review":"This book focuses on the evolution of comics, where Chris Ware fits into that evolution, and especially Ware's proficiency as a graphic designer. Working with a medium still ignored by most and cast off as a childish one, Raeburn gives us a view of Chris Ware's work from a professional design standpoint, and proves that it is well-deserving of such an analysis."},{"Title":"The Chronicles of the Celts: New Tellings of Their Myths and Legends","review":"Peter Beresford Ellis has taken several Christianized sources for various Celtic myths and retold them as they might have sounded before the Christian influence appeared. If you're looking for translations of Celtic stories, this isn't the book for you; it is decidedly Reconstructionist in nature and not a historical retelling. The author's approach, however, is quite scholarly, and he makes a concerted effort to seperate the different Celtic cultures, each one represented by six distinct myths, which makes it easy to focus on your own family heritage. His writing has a biblical feel, a bit like a formal storyteller. For this reason, I believe The Chronicles of the Celts would be a good addition to the library of parents who are attempting to raise their children with a respect for their ancestry and their ancestor's gods. They are good stories, some of which contain references to sex and violence, but in the same inexplicit way the Bible does. (Remember &quot;And Adam knew Eve...&quot; And &quot;David slew Goliath&quot; ?) Each contains several life lessons. The women are strong and respected, the men are honorable yet with emotion, and the gods aren't petty and cruel. Their formal nature makes them good to read aloud at family celebrations of Celtic Holidays.Note: You may want to learn to pronounce the Gaelic names before reading aloud. Some of them can be tricky the first time, but it's not necessary to enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The Chronicles of the Celts: New Tellings of Their Myths and Legends","review":"Peter Beresford Ellis is obviously a scholar, as he collects together many stories and histories and presents them in a very readable style (though, as another reviewer has said, if you intend to read this aloud you should practice the names a few times in advance).This text is quite different that Lady Gregory's _Of Gods and Fighting Men_, as it is less a retelling of ancient myths than an attempt to show the historical sides of the various families. Still, it is quite filled with legend, and a good read.Share it with your children at bedtime!"},{"Title":"The Chronicles of the Celts: New Tellings of Their Myths and Legends","review":"The book, \\"The Chronicles of the Celts,\\" is in perfect condition. Looks brand new. I'm very pleased. Peter Bereford Ellis is my favorite author on the Ancient Celts.

That we cannot live in peace in our own neighborhoods without the insidious threat of having our family members stolen from their own back yards is bad enough -- that this hideous offence has been repeatedly brought to the attention of the powers that control it, only to be met with apathy and denial, is even worse. I encourage everyone who ever loved an animal, large or small, or who currently lives with a beloved companion animal, to read this book, then to follow the prevention guide found at the end.

Cooper learns something about Jane, Annie learns something about her family, and Tyler wants to get back together with Kate. Cooper's mom is having a bit of trouble with the whold divorce thing, Kate confronts her brother, and Annie gets totally freaked by astrology. Well, I'm sure there are things I've left out, but you should read the book if you want details and answers! Later!"},{"Title":"Circle of Three #12: Written in the Stars","review":"With the start of a new year, Cooper, Annie, and Kate are faced with both new and old challenges. To start off the new year, their wicca class teaches them about astrology, the study of the stars. Copper and Kate think it's cool but Annie is disturbed by it. IS everything just written in the stars? Dose she have any control over her life? But through this study Annie discovers something new and shocking. There may just be another piece of her parents left in the world. Cooper faces a new challenge when she finds out something new about her friend Jane. When she makes a horrible mistake, can Jane ever forgive her? And how will Kate deal when she's given another chance with Tyler. Has she forgiven him yet to love him again? Is she even ready.After the last few books the Circle of Three series has remained, though entertaining, a little less special. But this one has brought the books up to the same level of entertainment that was seen in Blue Moon and the Five Paths (my two favorites). I'm glad to see Isobel Bird is back on track. I can't wait until the next book, And it Harm none, comes out. It looks really good. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Circle of Three #12: Written in the Stars","review":"All the books by this author (I've read 90% of them so far) are excellent. Entertaining and informative. These are much better than the Sweep series in my opinion becuase they actually teach principles of wicca rather than just entertain. Too bad there are only 15 - wish there were more books by this author.I recommend to anyone adult or teen looking into wicca."},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"Ugh, I gave this \\"book\\" one star because you can't give no stars, but that does not for one minute mean I think this piece of schlock excuse for a book has any merit whatsoever. Why do people write companion novels to great classics if they are going to change the author's original premise? Or in this case, crap all over it.Many people compare this novel to \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" and while I have never liked that either, because I feel that Jean Rhys also misrepresented Charlotte Bronte's original intention, at least that book has the distinction of good writing. This one isn't good, in any way. There is simply not enough room to enumerate the faults of this book, but the other reviews have done an admirable job of listing them: Rochester's brutality, the constant insulting of Jane by Adele, the normality of \\"Antoinette\\" (it's always rankled me that Rhys called her that, in the original she is Bertha, why pretty her up by calling her her middle name?) The murderous insanity of Mrs. Fairfax, as kind and benign a creature as was ever invented in fiction, the ludicrous murder mystery later in the book when Bertha's body is found in a shallow grave. And the last hilariously awful plot twist about Celine being pregnant by both the Viscount and Rochester. I mean, maybe, just maybe, a pregnancy by two men is possible if you happen to release two eggs and have sex with two men all at the same time, but really, would you be able to spot the differences in the fraternal twins so exactly as to know who to hit up for child support?????The whole book is so ridiculous, I can't even believe someone published it. Avoid it, taking a nap would be more productive than reading this."},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"Before buying this book. I wish I had. I was disappointed in this book. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite novels, I also loved Wide Sargasso Sea, but this book is nowhere close to being as good. The reason this book failed is that the author tried to write a book that was an extention of Jane Eyre but could also stand alone. The problem with this is that the person most likely to read this book, fans of Jane Eyre, want to read about familiar characters and make connections to the original story, which this book fails to provide. Since this story is written by a different person and at a different time, it is understandable that the feel of the book is different, and I did not expect a book that was exactly like Jane Eyre. However, this book is billed as a companion to Jane Eyre so the author owes it to her readers to make a connection to the original story. Instead the author fails dismally in her attempt to reproduce the original characters. Every character was wrong and did not resemble the originals. The author portrayed Adele as a rebelious, scheming, unhappy girl, whereas in Jane Eyre Adele was happy if not resigned to her lot in life. Even the character of Jane Eyre is not portrayed accurately in this book. Speaking of accuracy, there are a lot of inaccuracies in this book. Like others have mentioned, it's almost as if the writer had never read Jane Eyre. I think the writer chose to ignore certain facts in order to make the original story fit her own. This is a mistake as anyone who has read Jane Eyre will be annoyed by the inconsistencies. The grossest inconsistency being (in my mind) was the supposed murder of Bertha before she fell off the roof. It was made clear in Jane Eyre and earlier in this book that Bertha was seen and heard screaming before she jumped. Finally, I was most disappointed in the cheesy overwrought soap opera ending. Mrs. F as a murdering maniac who is so intent an Ingram/Rochester marriage that she kills the first wife and dangles the current wife over a ledge? Unbelieveable. Even if I had never read Jane Eyre I still could have not enjoyed this book. The dark, garbled plot and all the twists and turns make this a difficult read."},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"Alas, I cannot say anything other regarding this 'hidden' companion to Jane Eyre, than that it is dreadful. Having read several others of Tennant's continuations, I ought to have known better. For once again the author has decided to refocus a well-known book to make it read as she thinks it ought to be seen.The book is mainly told from Adele's point of view, changing as she ages in tone to reflect her new, less childish perspectives. Then there are also several changes to the narrative of other characters: Rochester, Mrs. Fairfax and Grace Poole (of all people!). These made an already wobbly narrative thread, a jolting one. It was Wuthering Heights and not Jane Eyre that was written in this fashion.I also could not help but be confused by several background references made in the text to such things as railway fortunes, Parisian boulevardes and Puccini operas. Were these meant to show the narrative was actually coming from the distance of many years? For none of these things were appropriate to the period setting. Odd and irritating.Then the storyline itself seemed to be trying to out trump Bronte in the melodrama stakes. The whole of the drawn out conclusion with Adele's flight to Paris was too much. Tennant truly did evoke some beautiful, almost lyrical images - but it ill fitted the overall tone of dark melodrama. The whole mystery of Adele's birth being given an extra notch of dark deeds, was far too unbelievable.I felt slightly insulted and definitely thankful that I had read it courtesy of my local library."},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"Having found this book, I thought the premise of a Jane Eyre retelling from Adele's, Rochester's daughter, point of view sounded interesting. The author's name sounded familiar, but I couldn't place her at the time. I was sure I had read one of her books before. If only I had remembered at the time, I would have never picked up this book, much less read it. Anyway, Rochester and Adele alternate the POVs in this novel (we also get narratives from Mrs. Fairfax and others) and it's about Adele's period in France, her somewhat cold and distant relationship with her father-slash-ward and her life in Thornfield Hall. Adele wants her parents to be together and sees Jane Eyre as a threat and an interloper. So she goes out of her way to criticize Jane and make her seem like nothing in Rochester's eyes...Does the plot sound absurd so far? Well, believe me, it gets much, much worse. If you feel at all tempted to pick up this horrible book, I will spare you from spoiler details, but I will nevertheless vent my frustration from having read it and for not remembering the author. (I must warn you that this is more like a rant than a review.) The whole thing with Mrs. Fairfax, such a kind and wonderful character, is beyond ridiculous. Talk about character assassination! Speaking of which, Rochester would never be that horrible to Jane or indeed anyone even if he is brooding and at times callous in Bronte's masterpiece. Adele's treating Jane like dirt is not worth mentioning, let alone get into detail. I will sum it up by saying that this Adele is depicted as a villain in a bad soap opera. The whole idea that Adele would dislike Jane so much is laughable. I could have appreciated Tennant's parallels in terms of feminism from Adele's viewpoint to that of Charlotte Bronte's if it hadn't been for the series of ridiculous plot twists that occur. The author takes so much artistic license it's unbelievable. It would be like taking a copy of Jane Eyre and ripping it to shreds, only that this author chose to do that in writing. I don't expect a sequel written by a different author to be as good as the original, but I do expect the work to at least reflect the original author's vision of the character and plotline, and not the new author's version of it. Take this wonderful example. Celine was pregnant by two men at the same time. Well, at least that's what it sounded like to me based on the author's explanation. Leaps of logic are found here, much like the other novel I had read by this author...Emma Tennant is the author of the atrocious Pemberley, a sequel to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. As said earlier, if only I had remembered before picking up this book. The only good thing that came out of this is that I will most definitely remember Emma Tennant in the future. She is on my black list of authors never to read again."},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"I received this book from a friend of mine who knew that Jane Eyre was one of my favorite books...and it is only out of love for her that I finished it....The idea of story of Jane Eyre being told through Ad&egrave;le's perspective, at first, absolutely delighted me. But I had assumed that Emma Tennant would have at least STUCK TO Charlotte Bronte's story!You start to read it and begin to note the creative liberties and changes that the author made; they start small only startling you a little, making you wonder where the author's twists intend to take you. Then it just becomes ridiculously laughable. LAUGH OUT LOUD laughable!It is a very 'creative' story and an easy read (if your stomach can take it). I only recommend this people who read Jane Eyre a loooooong loooong time ago, and only vaguely recollect events and names....it will put the reader in the same frame of mind that the author was in."},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"I picked this book up because I love Jane Eyre and had a renewed interest after seeing the excellent Masterpiece Theatre version last month. Emma Tennant has written a few sequels to Pride and Prejudice which were terrible, but I thought I'd give her yet another chance. This book was so bad, I didn't even finish it. Too many narrators, characters inconsistent with the source material, idiotic storylines, etc., etc.Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"This poor excuse for a book is an insult to a classic. If Emma Tennant did actually read \\"Jane Eyre,\\" she misinterpreted it horribly. She basically took an excellent, excellent book, ripped it up, spit in it, and put it back together in a way that would send Charlotte Bronte to her window in vindictive ghost form.Mr. Rochester as a raging alcoholic? That made me want to rip my hair out. The man's not perfect, but he would never stoop as low as he did here. Yes, he's detached and exasperated with Adele in \\"Jane Eyre,\\" but by no means would he be capable of such brutality.Mrs. Fairfax as a villian? Where on earth did that come from? \\"Jane Eyre\\" portrayed her clearly as a kindly old woman; Emma Tennant just wanted to Hollywood it up. Nowadays, a character can't just_be_nice - they got to have something to hide. Again, Mrs. Fairfax - the REAL Mrs. Fairfax - would never have behaved in such a manner.The most enraging of complete-180 character distortion is the portrayal of Jane Eyre herself. She's one of my most favorite literary characters ever - aside from Astrid from \\"White Oleander\\" - and to see her the way this amateur writer did made me throw the book against the wall.\\"Adele\\" is no more \\"Jane Eyre\\" than \\"Eragon\\" is to \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"Emma, just rename Pilot the dog \\"Cujo\\" and call it a day."},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"The reviews (professional and amateur) tell you it's bad, but you have no idea how bad it actually is until you read it. Check it out from the library: enjoy the scene where Mrs. Fairfax dangles a pregnant Jane Eyre out a high window (one-handed, from the sound of it) while narrating her diabolical deeds and future plans for at least two pages. Be amazed at the stupid errors (though the more I read the more convinced I became that they're not errors but the author simply ignoring what Bronte wrote): fer instance, Adele was not six months old when Rochester left Celine, as Bronte says; she was seven years old (mathematically impossible for any number of reasons), and apparently in the room while the two of them had kinky sex. Twins cannot have different fathers, and I'm pretty sure even people in the 19th century knew this. (I don't care if you've heard the urban legend about the black and white twins, it ain't true.) The red herrings abound, all of them bad, some jaw-droppingly hilarious. I can't describe them all.

However, plot twists often become confusing, and by the last chapter, we are led to the most implausible surprise-- that Mrs. Fairfax was somehow the evil queen in all this. Nothing in the entire novel prepared us for this, and thus, it felt completely contrived. Perhaps the author was trying to be gothic, but she failed utterly to convince this reader. I felt cheated of the true richness and emotional depth that is \\"Jane Eyre.\\""},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"If you read the book Jane Eyre you will soon understand the moral concept of what I am saying.When I bought this book I was hoping for a sequal. Instead Emma Tennant turned around all of Brontes work in to something awful and stupid. The worst part is they made Mrs. Fairfax the bad guy in this book. In Jane Eyre she was a good old lady servingthe house. But the way emma Tennant wrote the book she changed nearly half of what everything is supposed to be about.Also they rebuilt Thornfield. Confused? Look at the name. It was a place of terror that held to many memories that haunted people."},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"While I liked following the new perspectives of an old favorite, it seemed like Tennant was trying too hard to write as a classic.

Again, a character no one had thought or known about had been rescued and brought to the fore. In the case of Sargasso Sea it was of course the first Mrs Rochester, in Tennant's book, the little french girl, Mr Rochester's daughter is the heroine of a novel that goes hand in hand with Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre.Adele moved me deeply;this is a story with which so many will identify. for adele wants one thing more than anything in the world, and that is the reconciliation of her mother and father. That Celine Varens, actress and trapeze dancer, Parisian to her fingertips, has abandoned her daughter cannot at first be accepted by the child; and in this beautifully written account of her life in France and in the grim confines of Thornfield Hall in Yorkshire, Adele brings us both grief, a sense of a rebellion and finally, happiness.A wonderful book."},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"\\"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story\\" provides a unique perspective of \\"Jane Eyre\\" through the eyes of some of the minor characters in the novel (Adele, Rochester, Grace Poole and Mrs. Fairfax).

There was something about Jane, the quiet, courageous, morally strong and most unlikely of gothic heroines, that struck my fancy. So that it was with some apprehension that I first picked up Emma Tennant's \\"Adele.\\" I hadn't really liked her sequel to \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (\\"Pemberly\\"), and I was a little nervous with what she might have done with \\"Jane Eyre.\\" What a joy then to discover that with \\"Adele,\\" Tennant has combined elements that I really liked from both \\"Jane Eyre\\" and \\"Wide Sargasso Sea,\\" added her own little twist to the story of Jane/Rochester/Adele and what took place at Thornfield, and came with this really superb novel. No mistake about it, Emma Tennant's \\"Adele\\" is a novel to be read and savoured whether or not you are a Bronte or English lit fan.Even though there are five narrative voices in \\"Adele\\" -- Adele's, Rochester's, Jane's Mrs. Fairfax's, and Grace Poole's -- we see things mostly through Adele's eyes. When we first her, she's a young child (of about 8) living in Paris, and reveling in the knowledge that she is the child of the celebrated performance artist, Celine Verans, also one of the most beautiful and most sort after of women. But Adele's world comes crashing down upon her when her mother suddenly decamps with a lover to Italy, leaving her daughter behind. With no one willing to take on the guardianship of a young child, Adele is shipped off to her father's estate (Thornfield) in England, and to live with a man that Adele is somewhat afraid of and distrusts.At Thornfield, however, Adele is no longer treated as the pampered and treasured little girl, but as a hindrance, and is both neglected and ignored. As such she soon stumbles onto the secret of Thornfield: her father's deranged and much abused wife, Antoinette/Bertha. She also learns that her father means to marry the haughty heiress, Blanche Ingram, even as she watches her father romancing her plain and (in her own words) banal governess, Jane Eyre. But for Adele, who yearns to be loved and accepted wholeheartedly, her father should marry no one but her mother. And so she plots to bring her parents together, never dreaming that her actions would set off a course of reactions both unexpected and explosive...\\"Adele\\" was a real joy to read. The authour successfully captures the voices of each of her narrators -- Adele, who is very young and alone, who craves security and love; the mercurial Rochester who is in turns angry, bitter and remorseful (esp of his treatment of Antoinette/Berta); and, of course Jane, the moral center of the entire novel, and who tries to bridge the gap between Adele and Rochester without much initial success. Each voice adds a dimension and complexity to the basic Bronte plot-line and makes the Tennant novel a completely new and engrossing experience. Which voice/narrative, for example, are we to rely on as a reliable source? What is the truth? This is the questions that haunt as one reads \\"Adele.\\" And although with so many narrative voices, all clamouring for attention, one would expect the smooth flow of the story line to have become bogged down, this never ever happened. Under Emma Tennant's skillful hand however, the plot of \\"Adele\\" unfolded seamlessly and effortlessly -- you can tell, I was really drawn into the events that were unfolding before my eyes!For readers that may be quite familiar with Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre\\" & Rhys's \\"Wide Sargasso Sea,\\" and who may feel that there is very little novel or new that anyone can add to this plot-line, I'd really urge them to read this new Emma Tennant novel. \\"Adele\\" proved to be a moving and engrossing read, and one that I was happy to have indulged in."},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"Yuck. This was terrible. First, there were too many narratives from too many people. Second, the original intent of all the characters was totally destroyed. Adele is portrayed as a schemer - even at one point believing she must kill Antoinette (Bertha, I suppose was not a glamourous enough name) because it might reunite her mother with Edward. Mr. Rochester has no redeaming qualities at all - he's an abusive alcoholic. And Jane! She is reduced to a simpleton who is oblivious to the world around her. Adele, who in the original book adored Jane as the only person who showed her kindness, says of Jane that she has a \\"banality of mind.\\" Don't even get me started on Mrs. Fairfax!!!! Then there are the plot lines that are started, but never finished. Like the appearance of a brother somewhere at the end and endless streams of her mother's lovers and friends. I kept reading in the hopes it would improve, but it didn't. I guess I'm just glad that I got this book on the bargain shelf for 1/3 of the price listed. The bookstore obviously knew something I didn't!"},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"First published as \\"Ad&egrave;le: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story\\" in 2002, \\"The French Dancer's Bastard: The Story of Ad&egrave;le from Jane Eyre\\" in 2006 and \\"Thornfield Hall: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story\\" in 2007. It's the same book, either way you look at it. Had it been a particularly good book, it might not have mattered that it has three different titles, but as it happens, it has some problems that cannot be duly overcome.Before I even go into what it's about, I'd say the book is very confused and incoherent. Most of the chapters are from Ad&egrave;les point of view, like you would expect - it's supposed to be about her, after all. But then some chapters are instead from Rochester's perspective, or even Grace Poole's! What is the point of this?!The back of the book makes it sound like it's a coherent story, but it isn't. It keeps jumping in time and first, Ad&egrave;le is in Paris. Then she's at Thornfield. Then she gets chummy with Bertha. Then Jane arrives. Then a few years skip past. And so on, and so on. Things which are major in the original novel just gets brushed over. And that's where we start to encounter the problems this book has. In fact, they start with the introduction, believe it or not. Has Emma Tennant actually read \\"Jane Eyre\\"? At all? She could've at least had the courtesy to check with the original to make sure she got some basic facts of it right!*** BEWARE THE SPOILERS ***The book begins in France, where Ad&egrave;le lives with her mother, and they have lots of friends who are very artisty (artisan, even?), and there's this ugly, awful man who comes to see Ad&egrave;le's mother and then there's an argument between them and a conservatory is smashed. Ad&egrave;le goes to Thornfield, doesn't like it very much and wishes she was back in Paris or at the Mediterranean villa with her mother and, maybe, her Papa as well, but just maybe; and happens upon a French-speaking woman called Antoinette who lives up in the attics, and becomes a friend.Meanwhile, Rochester is courting Blanche Ingram, then jump cut to Jane Eyre arriving as a governess and Ad&egrave;le isn't too impressed by her, but doesn't dislike her very much either. Then Rochester proposes to Jane, which is bad, because how can he not marry her dear mother instead? Whom she has been writing to, but without getting a reply?Ad&egrave;le runs off to Paris to reunite with her mother's friends from her childhood, and she doesn't find C&eacute;line anywhere. Instead, she finds out that she has a twin brother. (Oh the humanity!) And in the end Rochester (who has followed Ad&egrave;le to Paris) takes her home and they all live happily ever after, because maybe C&eacute;line is dead and long gone and that Jane person isn't so bad after all.At that point, I was surprised to discover Ad&egrave;le wasn't the person who set Thornfield alight all those years ago. This book is too similar to the godawfulMrs. Rochester: A Sequel to \\"Jane Eyre\\"in places, and they're both good reads, if they weren't trying to use the characters from \\"Jane Eyre\\", because that's what's letting both of them down extremely. This is confused, doesn't really have much of a plot rather than for the most part, Ad&egrave;le whines over not being in Paris. I enjoyed the French parts to a certain degree. They had a nice French texture to them, but it didn't feel particularly suited from a Jane Eyre perspective.Ad&egrave;le is a haughty brat whom it's difficult to like, and so much goes against the book that I just couldn't like it. It feels as if the author has been reading \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" by Jean Rhys with more fervour than she has the original book by Charlotte Bront, and that's a massive fail, as far as I'm concerned. If you're writing a spin-off get your facts right. And Tennant doesn't.I might not sound as passionately hateful about this as I did with Hilary Bailey's Mrs. Rochester, but this also classes as a crime of fiction. So I'm afraid it's the attics of Thornfield for you, Tennant, where Grace Poole can give you cold baths for the rest of your duration. This book should not have been written.(If you want the whole list of blatant errors that kept grating on me, go to the address listed in brackets after my username above to read my full review.)"},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"Not only is this book horribly written, but it is hard to follow. The author skips around, while changing the original premise of the book, so you are often at a loss about what is going on. It's as if she's trying to tell the \\"real\\" story of what happened in the original book. She throws in various hints at sadism and lesbianism, and I wonder if this was just to create a buzz about a book she herself knew wouldn't make much sense. The characters come off as disgusting, even making Jane a jello-headed twit. Adele is compared to Rochesters insane wife, and you will find it hard to find one sympathetic character. I wasn't expecting much from this book, but it was much much worse than I would have thought. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"Adele has several things going for it: vivid, if occasionally wavering, characters, a strongly imagined altered history for Adele, and a good sense of self. It is not just a weak offspring of Jane Eyre, but unquestionably a novel in its own right.The characterization of Adele is generally believable, and her childhood world of Paris, living with her trapeze-artist mother, is perhaps the highlight of the book. Tennant starts out with a clear, new viewpoint on the famous novel. Occasional slips, like niggling inconsistancies of viewpoint, and Adele's nearly transitionless shifts of emotion towards both her father and her governess, are forgivable in the course of the graceful, engaging story.Sadly, the end of the novel is a complete betrayal of Tennant's careful build-up. The conclusion is melodramatic in the extreme, and seems carelessly tacked-on to the rest of the novel. The subtleties, contradictions, and tenuous connections of the rest of the novel are crudely and unsatisfyingly resloved in a way more reminiscent of the worst Hollywood thrillers than of good literature.This is a truly tragic, because Adele, beyond being a clever and readable re-working of a great novel, has the potential to be a great novel itself. Tennant explores the ideas of identity through Adele's search for her mother, and the scene where Adele confronts her past and future while swinging on the trapeze and walking the highwire is insightful and, simply, beautiful. The guilt both Adele and Mr. Rochester share towards, and even the confusing contradictions of Adele's young character in relation to Antoinette/Bertha, Rochester's first wife, raises interesting questions about the nature of guilt and responsibility. Even Adele's alternating hatred and love for her father, if executed more carefully, could have been illuminating.By hastily resolving her novel with an unbelievable and abrupt happy ending, Tennant not only alienates readers, but also sacrifices the insightful subtlety that could have made her novel truly exceptional.High above the Parisian crowds on her trapeze, Adele thinks she is about to fall. Luckily, she completes her act unharmed. The novel starts, as she does, in graceful arcs through the air, but it ends by plummeting gracelessly to the ground."},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"Brilliant Idea: Write Adele Varen's tale. A+Horrible execution and a Cat One loss of aircraft and crew, just past the fence. F Is For Failed.The start of the narrative, from Adele's childhood in Paris is well done; the exploration of Adele's, Celine's and Rochester's characters is just the sort of story I had been hoping for. Adele being an artistically gifted (and lonely) child, without being formally educated is well done, and her \\"French Defects\\" are largely the result of an early childhood spent as a kid of a showbiz legend, spoiled (then spurned) by Celine and her lovers- and sometimes, \\"customers\\".However, Ms. T hadn't followed the chronology of Jane Eyre well, and the departure from controlled flight begins with Adele's arrival at Thornfield. CB's chronology of important events at Thornfield is totally ignored. Adele had at least three months to be with Jane, prior to Rochester's arrival. By that time, Jane, Adele, and Sophie were effectively mother, daughter, and aunt, respectively, with La Fairfax as dotty control-freak Grandmere. This important relationship was not well developed, as it should have shown Adele and Sophie being reluctantly won over by Super Jane.Sophie is deliberately marginalized, on purpose. The idea of Adele, discovering Antoinette, (not to mention being drugged by Mrs. Alice Fairfax) being hidden from Jane and Sophie would have lasted all of ten seconds. Detective Chief Superintendent Jane Eyre would have nailed La Fairfax and Grace Poole after the next commercial.Threaten Jane's kid, and you would rather have ten thousand Helen Mirren's on your case, backed up by every Brit Super Cop (plus Holmes, Watson, AND Poirot) ever portrayed. Lord Bond, on the direct orders of Queen Victoria, would have been dispatched to liquidate Super Villain Rochester after a chase across the Caribbean, then Europe. Pursuing ship commanded by Admiral Of The Fleet Lord Horatio Hornblower, of course. Jane then happily marries Sir Ross Poldark's grandson (a senior partner at Rothschild's), and Adele is trained as a great actress by Bella Poldark herself.That would have been more believable and fun than what Tennant wrote. Plus, more explosions...The only sequences worth anything in the last half of the book are Adele's discussions with Nadar (well portrayed throughout), Rochester admitting Jane owns his empennage, and the admittedly excellent high-wire act where Adele faces up to herself (guided and saved by Jane's voice). The rest, rebuilding Thornfield, and one of the worst villainess monologues ever, is the final impact with the ground. Even the flight recorders are destroyed on impact. BOOOOOM! No survivors.This *could* have been a great book."},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"I read this w/ high anticipation but both the outlandish storyline and the unusually poor authorship made it a vast disappointment."},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"I remember reading a portion of this novel in a class in which I read Jane Eyre. That excerpt sparked my interest but, when I started reading this novel, that interest was quickly sullied by the bad prose, inattention to detail, and the stupidity of the plot (especially toward the end).

For a much better \\"rewrite\\" of Jane Eyre, read Jean Rhyss' Wide Sargasso Sea."},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"It's an interesting concept, but if you love Jane Eyre, don't read this book. The plot is slightly confusing, but besides that, there are many small details from Jane Eyre that the author has either changed or seemed to miss entirely. I expected a romance, but instead, I found something that trashed the story of Jane and Edward Rochester."},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"Jane Eyre's hidden story, this is not, as most of the events in this book are pretty ludicrous and unrealistic and it's highly unlikely this is what happened behind the scenes. Adele says it rightly at one point in the novel when she remarks that Jane is the one who sees things clearly. The novel is not totally from Adele's point of view, though, often a chapter is devoted to Grace, Mr. Rochester's, or Mrs. Fairfax's thoughts, and it was difficult to decide what was really happening with the characters with so many different viewpoints. Mrs. Fairfax for example thinks Mr. Rochester is really in love with Blanche and wanted to marry her instead of Jane, Adele thinks Mr. Rochester still loves Celine and would want her to come back, Mr. Rochester doesn't help by seeming to think about Celine often before and somewhat after he meets Jane. Grace is just in it for herself and is probably the most honest character in this story.This story just felt confusing and all over the place, and although at first I thought it was an interesting idea to tell the story from Adele's viewpoint, reading this story I realized she was really too young and couldn't have known much about what was happening. And her thoughts do not lend any cohesiveness to the story because she vacillates in her feelings so much. The author did have some interesting ideas and changes to the story of what went on behind Jane's back, and I did like how Adele grows as a character and realizes what a positive influence Jane has been on her life. The tone of the characters was also pretty well done - I didn't have too much of a problem with how the author painted them. The ending however kind of ruined the half-regard I was having for this story though. There was a pretty over the top twist that was truly unbelievable and ridiculous and disappointing since the story seemed headed towards a nice conclusion until it made a complete u-turn for crazy town. This is such an uneven story, that I can only think that die-hard Jane Eyre fans that need to read everything related to the original novel (like myself) would find any reason to read it."},{"Title":"Adele: Jane Eyre's Hidden Story","review":"I purchased and read this book after reading several other negative reviews because I'm stubborn.

It's almost as if the author were hallucinating. . .it just doesn't make much sense a lot of the time. I'm currently reading \\"Jane Eyre's Daughter\\" and enjoying it much more.

Among the seats of learning where he taught are Queen's University in Belfast, and the universities of Oxford, Adelaide, and Leeds.&quot;Old Hall, New Hall&quot; is not a mystery so much as it is a farcical treasure hunt and an even more farcical love story. I have to admit that I sneaked a peek at the book's end to make certain that neither of my two favorite characters ended up with the wrong woman. Innes's young men who graduate from Oxford, aspire to write 'the' Kafkaesque novel, and end up tutoring undergraduates on Higher Literary Forms are bound to be nave about beautiful, amoral treasure-hunters.The narrator, Colin Clout, BA, B Litt., newly appointed to the Faculty of Arts in the Old Hall is assigned an attic office, still crammed with the lumber of previous generations of Jorys, whose descendents now live in the New Hall. He is a decent young man (in spite of his unfinished novel in the style of Kafka) and is definitely not the brains of this story. Those belong to his friend, the librarian, Sadie Sackett, and to a fellow named George Lumb (also a would-be novelist) who is engaged in cataloguing a very neglected library up at New Hall.Libraries are an important part of this story because of the goings-on of two Victorian Jorys, one of whom collected beautiful mistresses, and the other who collected tombs. They were brothers, and it was the elder and heir who happened to have the slight necrophilous bent. According to a series of letters from their sister to her old governess (Innes is a dead-on mimic of spinsterish Victorian correspondents), the two brother-collectors embarked upon a wager as to who could bring home the greatest treasure from abroad.The elder Jory looted a tomb and brought back a treasure of gold and jewelry (and incidentally, the Circassian corpse that was wearing the jewelry). Then the plot darkens. The necrophilous Jory seems to have swapped his treasure for whatever it was that his younger brother brought home to win the wager. Or did he? The modern Jorys, especially one beautiful treasure-hunter named Olivia from the cadet branch of the family, would really like to know whether the swap was made, and incidentally the current hiding place of the looted gold and jewels.The author could not help but involve a legion of eccentric, pompous, and even fake professors in the treasure hunt and their spats and bumblings are a good part of what makes this book sparkle. Innes is wickedly funny when it comes to poking fun at the habits of his donnish colleagues.In fact, Innes is one of the finest, most unjustly neglected authors from the British Golden Age of Mystery. If you haven't already discovered him, &quot;Old Hall, New Hall\\" is a good place to start among his non-Appleby comedies-of-manners. If you'd like to read one of his mysteries, a very literate introduction to Inspector John Appleby, Innes's most famous character, can be found in \\"Hamlet, Revenge!\\""},{"Title":"Old Hall, New Hall","review":"This is listed as an Inspector Appleby Mystery, but there is no Appleby in it. Instead this is Innes's preemption of 'Lucky Jim' -- not as funny as Amis, but very enjoyably satirizing a similar scene."},{"Title":"The Ethical Function of Architecture","review":".This is simply one of the best books I have ever read.On one level it is a critique of contemporary thinking about architecture. In the first part of the book Harries argues that the aesthetic approach to art doesn't do justice to the meaning and power of architecture. In the second part he argues that the semiotic approach to architecture is based on a model of language that cannot fully grasp and illuminate the symbolic dimension of architecture. In the third and fourth parts Harries tries to show that questions of architecture are ultimately questions of dwelling (broadly conceived), that questions of dwelling are irreducibly ethical and political, and that architecture thus has an irreducible ethical and political function.On a deeper level the book is a critique of modern philosophies of art. Harries follows thinkers such as Heidegger, Gadamer, and Agamben in criticizing the aesthetic approach to art (which regards artworks simply as beautiful or interesting objects) and theoretical approaches to art (which regard artworks as the expression or illustration of ideas that can best be grasped and articulated with philosophical concepts). Harries argues that artworks have the power to illuminate the world and to call us back to what really matters, and that art is a (nontheoretical) way of responding to basic questions of human existence (How should we live? What does it mean to be human?)Unlike Heidegger, Gadamer, and Agamben, however, Harries develops his arguments with a great number of specific, concrete examples drawn from the whole history of Western architecture and art. So while the book is philosophically ambitious, it is also exceptionally clear, sober, and down to earth.Finally, I should note that the writing itself is beautiful--it is simple, precise, and conveys a sense of deep concentration and wonder.The Ethical Function of Architecture won the American Institute of Architects 8th Annual International Architecture Book Award for Criticism. But it is about more than architecture. I recommend it very, very highly to anyone interested in Heidegger, phenomenology, aesthetics, ethics, poetry, literary theory, modernity and modernism, and the history and philosophy of art."},{"Title":"The Ethical Function of Architecture","review":"Harries, a professor of philosophy at Yale, has a long-standing interest in architecture. (Disclosure- I took his course on the Philosophy of Architecture while a grad student in the early 80's.) Himself a student of Heidegger, Harries's work in architecture has largely been a reassessment and continuation of Heidegger's thought on technology and dwelling. The book under review is a summary of Harries's thinking on architecture. The \\"ethical function\\" referred to in the title concerns architecture's ability to express the ethos of the society that produces it. Harries effectively demolishes the esthetic and functional approaches to architecture and makes a convincing argument that what distinguishes architecture from mere building is its ethical function."},{"Title":"The Ethical Function of Architecture","review":"this is a 'must' reading for anybody interested in architectural theory and philosophy ... but it goes way beyond, connecting ethics and aesthetics within a contemporary discourse that transcend post-modern, post-structuralist and phenomenologist biases.

Lindsey examines several vital issues heretofore untouched, charting a course for the future of child welfare with remarkable clarity of vision.In this most comprehensive and thoroughly annotated volume, Lindsey traces the transformation of child welfare into child protective services.Lindsey explodes the many myths which have served for so long to perpetuate this transformed system. Chief among them are those most commonly held misperceptions that child welfare programs based on the &quot;residual model&quot; have reduced child fatalities by any measure, and that they have served to increase the welfare of children overall.Lindsey explores in depth the critical decision-making processes involved in making the determination of whether or not to remove a child from his home. He clearly demonstrates that the field of child welfare lacks a scientific knowledge base from which to draw, and that the critical decisions involving the welfare of children and families are inherently unreliable.Rather than offer another book replete with anecdotal &quot;horror stories,&quot; Lindsey offers instead a scholarly work which will serve to greatly enhance the reader's understanding of the history and dynamics of child welfare, and the forces driving its transformation from child welfare into child protective services.Lindsey offers a blueprint for a future which will better serve children. He offers a compelling argument for the criminal justice system to assume responsibility for dealing with the problem of child abuse, such that the child welfare system can return to its role of addressing the overall well-being of a greater number of children.He makes extensive use of charts and graphs, while managing to do so in such a way as not to distract the more casual reader. His use of advanced statistical analysis is explained clearly, for the benefit of all readers. Few books can so magnificently reach out to touch such a potentially diverse audience of readers, reaching the intellect as effectively as it does the heart.This is one of those rare volumes that no student of the child welfare system should be without. Put this book at the top of your list."},{"Title":"The Welfare of Children","review":"Have you ever read a book on a subject with which you have some expertise and wonder if the writer is just making things up as he goes along? This was nearly the experience in reading this book by Duncan Lindsey a UCLA professor.The first problem is that Lindsey takes the shotgun approach to arguing his points against the existing child protective services system. Instead of centering his arguments on a few specific issues and developing his thesis, he tries to address every conceivable aspect of the child welfare system and liberally scatters his thoughts and comments without a strong basis of analysis. The result is a loose confederation of ideas none of which with a firm foundation for acceptance.The second problem is that Lindsey attempts to address issues for which he does not seem to have actual knowledge. His attack on the legal basis of the child protective system, for being a civil model rather than a criminal model, is amateurish (at best). His understanding of the social workers management of the case lacks first hand understanding of the field. I wanted to give some examples to explain my points, but it would result in a much longer review than what I prefer. It must suffice to say that I believe the professor's expertise is apparently more academic and esoteric than real life.A third problem is Lindsey's contradicting himself in various parts of his book. For example, he spends time discussing how children's deaths is increasing, but in another chapter argues that death is but a small area of concern for protecting children. He titles this later chapter as \\"Child abuse, the red herring of child welfare.\\" Therefore, he argues that the current system is not doing enough to protect children from destructive parents, but argues that too much of the same system focuses on a problem that is a small issue in child welfare. So which is it?It is unfortunate that the author did not sacrifice a couple of hundred pages and written a monograph on one of his points. Then he could have provided a document worth quoting and considering. Instead, we have a lengthy diatribe absent developed charges worth remembering."},{"Title":"Principles of Functional Analysis. (Student Edition)","review":"Functional analysis is now a vast subject with many applications and this book gives an introduction to this branch of mathematics that can be understood by advanced undergraduates or beginning graduate students. The book fills a gap between elementary aspects of analysis and those using measure theory. The author motivates the subject matter very well, and therefore gives the reader a deeper appreciation of the basics of functional analysis and operator theory. Because of its high quality of presentation, it is very unfortunate therefore that the book is out of print.In chapter 1, the author introduces the subject by considering a particular differential equation, which he solves by the method of variation of parameters. Generalizing the equation leads him finally to the Volterra integral equation, and by abstracting from the properties of this equation he introduces the notion of a Banach space. Several examples of these spaces are given, and he uses them to introduce Hilbert spaces. Appropriately, a discussion of Fourier series concludes the chapter.The Riesz representation theorem, which shows that every bounded linear functional on a Hilbert space can be represented as an inner product, is introduced immediately in chapter 2. This representation is used to motivate a similar question for Banach spaces, namely whether Banach spaces have any nonzero bounded linear functionals. The Hahn-Banach theorem, discussed in detail, shows there are many such functionals. Since there are so many, it makes sense to speak of the space of all of them, called the dual space, which is a Banach space even though the original space may not be. Several examples of dual spaces are given.The author discusses the space of bounded linear operators between normed linear spaces X and Y in chapter 3, showing that it is a Banach space if Y is. The adjoint of an operator is defined, and the author shows why adjoints are useful. The famous Closed Graph Theorem and its geometric interpretation are discussed in detail. Another fundamental result, the Uniform Boundedness Theorem, is proven.Integral equations are also used to motivate the concept of a compact operator in chapter 4, but first via the operators of finite rank. The compact operators are thus the limit in norm of operators of finite rank, and their adjoints are also compact.One of the most important classes of operators of all, the Fredholm operators, are discussed in chapter 5. The author discusses what can be concluded from their definition and gives other criteria for recognizing when an operator is Fredholm. The index theory of Fredholm operators is covered in this chapter, and this is a theory that has far-reaching implications in other areas of mathematics, such as algebraic topology and K-theory. The author discussed briefly a collection of operators called semi-Fredholm operators, that are defined by relaxing some of the conditions for Fredholm operators are relaxed.Spectral theory, also of enormous importance in operator theory, is discussed in chapter 6. The author proves the spectral mapping theorem, explaining the need for complex Banach spaces in this regard. The author shows how to obtain a formula for the inverse of a bounded operator polynomial. The reader will need a background in complex variables in order to follow his discussion here, which has become known as the &quot;operational calculus&quot;. If the spectrum of the operator is disconnected, the author shows how to obtain the spectral projections of the operator.The theory of unbounded operators, typically not treated in beginning books on operator theory, but very important in applications, is discussed in chapter 7. Unbounded Fredholm operators are defined, and the author shows just how much the bounded results can be carried over to these. The same is done for unbounded semi-Fredholm operators.The author returns to Banach spaces in chapter 8, where he discusses reflexive Banach spaces. He proves that a Banach space is reflexive if its dual is, and shows how &quot;saturated subspaces&quot; characterize reflexive spaces. The very important weak* convergence appears here in the discussion of separable Banach spaces.Chapter 9 is the beginning of &quot;soft analysis&quot; wherein the author discusses Banach algebras. The reader gets his first taste of the intertwining of operator theory, algebra, and analysis in this chapter. The &quot;soft&quot; approach to operator theory is vast and is marked by many brilliant developments.Semigroups, so very important in physical applications, are discussed in chatper 10. The discussion again motivated by a differential equation, the author shows clearly the need for strong continuity in obtaining an infinitesimal generator for a one-parameter semigroup of operators.The author returns to Hilbert spaces in chapter 11, wherein he introduces the highly important class of normal operators. He shows that such operators are norm attaining, and proves when normal compact operators have a complete, orthonormal set of eigenvectors. He applies these considerations to a class of (compact) integral operators and then discusses briefly the theory of hyponormal operators.Another topic not usually included in treatments at this level is the theory of bilinear forms, which is done in chapter 12. Very important in many areas of mathematics, the author shows their utility in the context of dissipative operators. He then goes on to the topic of self-adjoint extensions, showing that every densely defined symmetric linear operator has a self-adjoint extension.Self-adjoint opertaors are then treated in detail in chapter 13, beginning with the theory of orthogonal projections, which are very important in applications like quantum physics. He then proves the spectral resolution theorem for bounded self-adjoint operators.The last chapter of the book details some applications, the first few sections dealing mainly with a particular (unbounded) differential operator. Using two different methods the author calculates the spectrum of this operator. He then does essentially the same analysis for a simple integral operator. Both of these operators appear many times in physical applications."},{"Title":"INVEST WITH A GENIUS","review":"Michael Levy's book &quot;Invest with a Genius&quot; is a compelling read that provides the reader with an understanding of what true wealth actually means to them, and, how that wealth can be attained in a joyous manner.It clarifies the meaning of the terminology associated with the wealth generation process and helps the reader to understand not only who the Genius is, but also, where the Genius can find the information required to attain that true wealth.The book contains a message for novice and experienced investors alike.

Reading this is as if you are a student in his class working through a complicated assignment for the first time.Bottom line - good for learning the basic rules and tools, but perhaps too fundamental for the experienced CI professional."},{"Title":"The city of Gold and Lead","review":"Intriguing even though I have seen the series in TV and knew some details before.Despite not being a native speaker this book was easy to understand for me.The tension keeps growing towards the end of the book.After all I would advise to read the other two books of John Christopher as well."},{"Title":"The city of Gold and Lead","review":"Professionally written, juvenile sci-fi does not get any better than this.It's a follow-up to The White Mountains -- which was good, but left readers hungry to learn more.

The White Mountains, The City of Gold and Lead and The Pool of Fire are absolutely perfect examples of Juvenile fiction. The books teach moral lessons as well as tell a rip roaring good tale.Without giving to much plot away this tale is covers a not too distant future when Aliens who roam the Earth in giant Tripods rule the land. Every person who reaches puberty is capped and there mind is controlled or at least molded by the Tripods.These three books follow a group of runaways and rebels who have never been capped and who desperately want to free Earth and its inhabitants. This band of rebels must find a way to defeat the Aliens without knowing who they are, what there weaknesses are or any worthwhile knowledge. On top of this the \`rebels' have to defeat these space age aliens with technology at roughly 19th century levels.The first book was a mystery unfolding and the third was the one with the most tension and triumph. The one was the most emotional and you feel a real sense of helplessness.These books are even more remarkable as they were written in the late 60's. I first read these books as a cartoon serial in \`Boys Life' in the early 80's. I enjoyed the tale back then and still enjoy the stories now. I highly recommend all these books for kids and or there parents.

What he finds is some exciting information, but he must find out how to escape the CITY OF GOLD AND LEAD. Gold, because that is what everything is made of, but lead because the gravity is so high in the Master's city that every bone and every muscle in Will's body is dragged down.

The descriptions of the city were captivating and the plot was excellent. I couldn't put the book down. I highly reccommend this book."},{"Title":"The city of Gold and Lead","review":"The second book (or third, if you consider the prequel the first book) in John Christopher's massive Tripod series. Continuing where, \\"The White Mountains\\" left off, the book follows the adventures of Will and his fight against the Tripods and their alien masters. The book furthers our knowledge about the invaders of Earth and their personal lives. Will and a fellow uncapped boy are given the chance to enter into the home of the Tripods. Once there, Will finds himself a slave to one of the aliens that live in the city and his companionship with this creature leads to further knowledge. This book also marks the point at which Will learns of the aliens' final solution (referred to here as The Plan) for earth's original inhabitants.I found myself enjoying this book far more than \\"The White Mountains\\" itself. Though the first book in the series was far more action packed and filled with gripping chase and escape sequences, the second book is filled with fascinating descriptions of the Masters and their alien lifestyle. This is the kind of book we've been waiting for. Who are these creatures that fit every human with a silver mesh of a cap, making them docile and compliant? Where are they from? How extensive is their knowledge? And, most importantly, how can they be beaten?Christopher has inserted a clever handicap into this tale that keeps Will from doing anything rash or careless. Neither Will nor his fellow uncapped slave can reveal their true intentions. From the moment they enter the city of gold and lead (so nicknamed for its design and intense gravity) to the moment they are supposed to leave, our heroes mustn't reveal to the Masters that they are uncapped or that a resistance has been planned. The writing in this tale never lingers unduly and the narrative is crisp and swift. Even reluctant readers will breeze through this tale, stopping to marvel at the amazing world the author has created within the boundaries of the city.I'll admit it right now. Until this book I never really noticed the similarities between this series and H.G. Wells' remarkable \\"War of the Worlds\\". Certainly both stories rely on the world being conquered by huge tripods from outer space. In both cases, the aliens responsible for earth's enslavement are unwilling to consider human beings' rights. But the final similarity, and the most striking, is the physical resemblance between the aliens found here in \\"City of Gold and Lead\\" and the Wells classic. Both books contain aliens that have tentacles and can't breathe Earth's air. Has Christopher stolen his ideas and made them palatable to children? Perhaps. If so, I've no real objection to his strategy. Slightly more infuriating is his continued dismissal of women in general. If there are female aliens, we're never told of them. As for the girls sent, like the boys, to the city to work as slaves for the Masters, they are quickly dispatched. Apparently Christopher reasoned that while men can handle physical labor and pain, girls cannot. As such, women are killed and the most beautiful amongst them are placed in glass display cases to be observed. Forget trying to search for any symbolism here. It's obvious that the aliens, in addition to being wholly male, are just as sexist as their human counterpoints. While the first book in the Tripod series had a few weak willed females here and there, this book hasn't a single living woman in it AT ALL. This is fairly weird, even for a boy's adventure novel. So on a level of one to five (one being the least chauvinist and five being the most) I'd place this book squarely at 4.7.Otherwise, I've no objections at all. The book is well paced, well written, and well thought out. All in all, a delightful read that makes one even more eager to read the final chapter in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The city of Gold and Lead","review":"WHAT A GREAT STORY, PERFECTLY WRITTEN...RIGHT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, IT SWEEPS YOU AWAY LIKE ON A MAGIC CARPET RIDE, AND YOU DON'T WANT THE RIDE TO END!!!!...A GREAT AUTHOR....AND AN EXCELLENT SELLER...THEY SENT THE BOOK AT TOP SPEED....AND I WILL BUY FROM THEM AGAIN!!!

Can't wait to read _The Pool of Fire_!"},{"Title":"The city of Gold and Lead","review":"The City of Gold and Lead is an interesting book full of mystery and suspense. It is the third book of the Tripods series written by John Christopher. The other books in this series are When the Tripods Came, The White Mountains, and The Pool of Fire.If you have read The White Mountains you have probably noticed that there are many questions that have been left unanswered. This book will answer many of these questions but will also produce more questions that are left for the last book in this series, The Pool of Fire. After you have read the whole series you will find that all of these books go very well together.What this book is really about is aliens that invade the earth. They are in giant tripods that are currently ruling the world. They give anyone over the age of 14 a cap which makes their minds controlled by the tripods. One problem about the earth, to these aliens, is that the earth's air is poisonous to them. Because of this they have to live in cities built for them, in a tripod, or wearing a mask. Right now only their cities are filled with the air that they can breath, but they plan to eventually do this to the rest of the world which would kill the human race and any other living thing on earth.As you would probably assume, there is a group of people who are fighting against these aliens. They have to defeat them before they take over the whole world. Two people from this group, Will and Fritz, were sent into the City of Gold and Lead to find out more about these aliens, but they have to get out and escape before they are too weak and die.I'll leave the rest of the book for you to figure out. However, I would like to say this is a great book and I highly recommend reading it.

It starts out by having the three main characters, Will, Fritz, and Beanpole, travel to a sort of Olympics to be selected to serve the aliens as slaves in the city of gold and lead. They want to infiltrate the aliens' city to learn information that could help them save the world. Only Will and Fritz are selected to come to the aliens' city. When they feel they must escape, the two boys find a way to get out. They decide that swimming in a river under the city's wall is the best way to exit the city. Fritz tells Will that it would be too risky if both of them go. Fritz forces Will to leave him in the city. Once Will gets under the wall he finds Beanpole waiting for him. In the end, Will and Beanpole make the long journey back to the White Mountains.Critique of The City of Gold and LeadThe City of Gold and Lead, by John Christopher, is a science fiction story about two boys who are trying to save the human race from alien domination. I found that I had a lot of trouble trying to put this book down. As I was reading, I figured out why. It was because I would forget that I was reading and I would think that I was in Will's place. For example, when Will and Fritz were trying to escape from the city, I feared for my life and my friend Fritz's life when Fritz said, &quot;I'm not going to escape. They will suspect something.&quot; I think that this feeling was due to the fact that John Christopher's style of writing brings all of the characters to life. Although this book is not quite in the class of Isaac Asimov's science fiction stories, it is still a great science fiction novel. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an adventurous mind and likes science fiction."},{"Title":"The city of Gold and Lead","review":"In the second installment, the battle to free mankind continues in an exciting new adventure.

What would happen to the main characters: Will, Beanpole, and Henry? Will we ever learn more about the Tripods? And, of course, will the Tripods ever be defeated?&quot;The City of Gold and Lead&quot; answers some of these questions. It explains the Tripods and how they came to dominate the world and enslave mankind. It informs us of the new lives that Will, Beanpole, and Henry have in the White Mountains. It introduces us to the characters of Fritz and Julius who become major figures in the struggle against the Tripods.It also answers the question of the fate of Eloise, the beautiful girl who Will befriended in &quot;The White Mountains.&quot; (It is disappointing that the ONLY female characters of any importance in the entire trilogy are Eloise and her mother, the Comtesse.) Personally, my favorite part of the series was Will's temptation by the good life at the Castle of the Red Tower where he met Eloise. In &quot;The White Mountains&quot; Eloise said goodbye to Will forever because she had been chosen to serve the Tripods in their city and would remain there as a slave for the rest of her life. One of main reasons I felt compelled to read &quot;The City of Gold and Lead&quot; was to find out what happened to Eloise and would she ever be freed from that slavery. The reader will discover the answer to that question at the Pyramid of Beauty in &quot;The City of Gold and Lead.&quot;Although &quot;The City of Gold and Lead&quot; answers many questions left from &quot;The White Mountains,&quot; it also leaves the reader with new questions about the fate of a major character, the conflict with the Tripods, and the future of mankind.

In fact, I was a little sad when I finished it, but the cliffhanger for the next book lifted my spirits.This book was the second book in the series, The Tripods. It began where the last book ended, The White Mountains. Friends Will, Beanpole, Henry, and other people that lived in the white mountains were completing their training to try to get in the games. The games are like the Olympics. The winners of the game would go on and serve the master in the City of Gold and Lead. The City of Gold and Lead is where the tripods live. Tripods are evil machines that take control of your mind using caps. Will, Beanpole, and another boy named Fritz were accepted to go to the games. Henry had to stay back because he was not selected to participate in the games. Both Will and Fritz won in their sports category. They now had to serve the masters because winners were considered strong and fearless. However, the real purpose of a winner serving a master is to gather information on the dreaded Tripods. If by chance the winner escapes, he will be able to take the information back to his land. No one has ever been known to escape. I will not give away any secrets and reveal if Will and Fritz escaped. You will have to read the book to find out.I found the entire book exciting. The characters are very well developed. At the end of each chapter, I was anxious to find out what happened next. The book ended with a spectacular cliffhanger. When I read the last sentence, \\"We would come back,\\" I instantly wanted to read the next book in this series.I recommend this book for ages 12 to 101 years old. This is a great book waiting to be read. After you read this book, you should also read the first book and the preface book.

I remember reading this when I was younger and finding it absolutely fascinating. The end of the book leaves you hanging and wondering what will happen.

She draws from his considerable experience and expertise in Iran: The Bradt Travel Guide to provide the tourist, student, or businessman with guidance on cultural awareness, religious sensitivity, and absolute do's and don'ts as well as a region-by-region guideline to getting around in different areas of Iran with black-and-white maps to follow. An absolute \\"must-read\\" for any male or female visitor to Iran, as familiarity with rules and customs could spare one from an unhappy detention; for example, the Iranian prohibition against cards, gambling and backgammon extends to such things as fuzzy car dice, woman must not walk unescorted at night or they will be presumed prostitutes, and no visitor should eat, drink, or smoke during the daylight hours of the Ramadan religious holidays regardless of their personal faith, else the repercussions to themselves and their sponsors will be severe. Yet Iran: The Bradt Travel Guide is far more than a list of proscriptions and warnings; it is also a tour of the cultural and historical wonders of Iran, a glimpse into the recent transformations of the society, and an in-depth guide of where to go and what to experience. Now in an updated second edition, Iran: The Bradt Travel Guide is a \\"must-have\\" for visitors who want not only to see the sights of this proud nation, but to understand its character as much as possible."},{"Title":"Iran, 2nd : The Bradt Travel Guide (Bradt Travel Guide)","review":"The intrepid visitor to Iran is in for a deeply rewarding experience. This enormous, varied and little-visited country is full of wonders and surprises; it's very safe for travellers and in many ways easier for the visitor than most other destinations in the region. Follow a few simple rules, and you can't go wrong.The choice of guide books, however, is limited at the time of writing to just two: Lonely Planet and Bradt. Of the two, the LP guide is definitely the most useful with the greatest amount of accurate information about where to stay, how to get from A to B and other practicalities high on the priority list for the traveller. It's important to have a guide book for Iran because internet access is difficult and slow, cellphone networks congested and almost impossible to access in the daytime (especially in Tehran) and English not widely understood.The Bradt guide, however, is not without value. It's written by Patricia Baker, an academic with an interest in Islamic art and costume, and the weight of content reflects these specialist cultural interests at the expense of travel practicalities.The first 66 pages are devoted to Iranian history, politics and religion and to basic practicalities like best time to visit, visas, health issues and tour operators. The author tends to discourage independent travel to Iran and recommends an organised tour, as (according to her) Iranian officialdom is more comfortable with groups who can be managed and controlled more easily. I have to say I found travelling independently around Iran quite easy, especially with a positive attitude and the helpful and invariably accurate advice in the LP guide, so do not agree with Ms. Baker on this issue.The second part of the book has a chapter devoted to each of the major cities and regions of the country, and is OK but can be a rather dry read. Often the author recommends only one place to stay in each location, whereas for example the LP guide invariably details many options accurately and so is more useful to the traveller.The four separate colour photo sections are pretty good, but again betray the author's prime interest in the architecture, archaeology and cultural relics which, it needs to be said, in Iran are plentiful and often truly magnificent, especially in Isfahan and Shiraz. However the fun and adventure is somehow missing (yes, you can have both in Iran), and the text is not exactly racy or humorous.So overall, the Bradt Guide might be best for the visitor whose primary interest is in the history, culture and architecture of Iran and who chooses to go on an organised tour where accommodation is booked in advance and taken care of - or if for some reason you don't like the style of LP guides, this is your only option."},{"Title":"Iran, 2nd : The Bradt Travel Guide (Bradt Travel Guide)","review":"This guide is only useful if you're planning to visit the Iran of 2000 years ago. Practical information is non-existant, hardly any reasonable hotels are mentioned and there are few if any travel details. Unlike most Bradt guides it's written for scholars and archeologists and not travellers who need detailed information about this complex country."},{"Title":"Iran, 2nd : The Bradt Travel Guide (Bradt Travel Guide)","review":"This is an excellent travel companion for cultural and historical information on Iran, as well as for tips on out-of-the-beaten-track experiences for the more adventurous and intellectually curious traveler. The book is nicely bound and will take the beatings of travel, and it is small enough to fit in most pockets. Do NOT expect it to provide the best info on where to sleep and eat.

Maigret does not live outside of time. He shows signs of weariness and a desire to reflect back on days of a more vigorous youth as he strolls along the Seine in the book's opening pages. A down-and-out bum has had his skull cracked and been thrown in the river.Maigret is there to investigate. Rescued by two rivermen, the bum survives and Maigret learns much about the man's past - he is, or was, a doctor. Who would try to kill a down-and-outer? Does the man's distant past hold the answer? Or was it something more recent? Can Maigret get to the bottom of it? Well, yes, but can he get the truth out of the perpetrator.Simenon unwinds the tale in a way that compels the reader to rush to the finish; the book is only 147 pages and so the task is not so difficult. Having finished one Maigret tale, the reader wants more of Maigret's compressed psychology."},{"Title":"MAIGRET AND THE BUM","review":"Although not commonly heard of nowadays (in the English speaking world at least) Georges Simenon was a very prolific writer of the detective genre, most famous for his Maigret series (with well over a hundred books stretching from 1931 all the way to 1972!!). Maigret is basically a French response to detectives like Sherlock Holmes. Not as interested in physical evidence and the rational, he seeks to understand the characters behind the cases and their often tragic lives. Maigret has an aspect of humanism and warmth throughout the books, especially for those less fortunate in French society. His cases present an element of uncertainty that is natural when dealing with people and are thus much more realistic than Sherlock Holmes type stories (although less satisfying \\"logically\\").In this particular book Maigret investigates what others would probably have dismissed as a nothing case. The attempted murder of a vagrant fails as he is fished out of the river. Who would want to kill a homeless mand and who cares anyway? But contrary to this common attitude of his environment, Maigret treats this case as one of primary importance. We see Maigret's warmth and humanity as he uncovers the life of Tubib, his family that he left and the circumstances that led to this seemingly petty case.The Maigret novels may not be profound literature but they are extremely well written, compassionate and involving detective stories."},{"Title":"MAIGRET AND THE BUM","review":"A vagrant sleeping under a Paris bridge is brutally attacked and thrown into the Seine. He is rescued by two bargemen and Inspector Maigret is brought in to investigate the attempted murder. Who is the vagrant and why was he attacked? Another classic set up for an Inspector Maigret novel.I recently finished reading \\"Maigret and the Yellow Dog\\" which was written in 1931, near the very beginning of the series. It was very interesting to see how Georges Simenon was beginning to create the character of Jules Maigret. It was a good story but one discovers that Inspector Maigret had not yet become fully realized. In contrast, \\"Maigret and the Bum\\" was written in 1962 and George Simenon had over thrity years of working on the Inspector Maigret character. In this novel, Simenon is much more in control. The writing is more fluid and Maigret's interior world is more developed.Simenon wrote 75 Inspector Maigret novels and over 500 million copies have been sold. \\"Maigret and the Bum\\" is well written but it is not one of his classic, five star Maigret stories. For those who love the series, this is an ejoyable story. For someone new to Inspector Maigret there are better stories in which to become acquainted with the venerable inspector."},{"Title":"MAIGRET AND THE BUM","review":"As the previous reviewer indicates, this book and others in the Maigret series are about humanity, smells, sights and intuition even more than physical clues. Maigret doesn't get his man in this story. But, the book is still a sheer pleasure to read. I couldn't put it down until I had finished it."},{"Title":"MAIGRET AND THE BUM","review":"This is my first Simenon novel and, having spent a pleasant two days in Maigret's company, not likely to be my last. I can only hope that Simenon's other books have the same combination of tight plotting, sharply drawn scenes, unforgettably real characters, and deep psychological insight that were on display in \\"Maigret and the Bum.\\" If so, I'm in for a long and satisfying literary relationship: there are something like a hundred of these Simenon novels.This is a \\"mystery\\" novel where the mystery is a vehicle for a meditation on life and human nature, where the detective stands in for the philosopher. Less a whodunit in the contemporary sense, Maigret parses out the clues in the crime at hand as methodically as Socrates takes apart an opponent's argument. The crime is an attack on a homeless man living under a bridge on the Seine. Why would anyone want to murder a bum? What possible motive could there be that would be worth the risk? As for the victim, well, he refuses to help Maigret identify his attacker, even though Maigret is almost certain he knows who tried to kill him. Why won't he identify his would-be killer? Wouldn't you? Isn't it simple human nature to do so?It's the answers to these questions, these human \\"mysteries\\" that are really what concerns Simenon the most, what constitute the real mysteries at the heart of this novel.Readers who are looking for conventional resolutions, black-and-white judgments, shoot'em ups, and justice always done by novel's end may not be satisfied with the conclusion of \\"Maigret and the Bum,\\" but for those who are okay with ambiguity and enigma, who don't need a mystery tied up with a neat bow at the end, this book will provide you with food for thought--far more satisfying fare than what you're usually served up in genre fiction."},{"Title":"MAIGRET AND THE BUM","review":"A vagrant is knocked on the head and thrown into the Seine, and two bargemen pull him out. Maigret is perplexed. Down-and-outs in Paris mind their own business, and violence among them is rare.Maigret examines the vagrant's sleeping quarters under a bridge and finds books and a medical journal. The other vagrants call the victim \\"doc.\\"How did a learned doctor end up a rag-and-bone man? Why the murderous attack? There's no media interest in this affair and no pressure from above to solve the case. After all, the victim is a bum, and may survive in any case. But Maigret has taken a liking to the doc and won't rest until he knows the truth.Madame Maigret undertakes some unofficial inquiries for her husband in this case. The glimpse we get of the comfortable love between these two is quite delightful."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Dahl is the author of some of the most imaginative works of fiction ever created and this tends to overshadow his personal accomplishments, which are considerable. This book is an autobiography of his early adulthood, starting from the time he traveled to east Africa to work for the Shell Company through the first years of World War II.Dahl was one of the people that left the British Isles to work in and administer a colony in the British Empire. His descriptions of that group of people are amusing and accurate, for they were simultaneously a tough group of people although a bit daffy. Dahl's descriptions of the Major and his wife making several rounds on the deck in the nude every morning followed by the strict rule of everyone formally dressing for dinner were very amusing.Dahl volunteered for the Royal Air Force (R. A. F.), received his initial training in Kenya and flew fighter planes. He crash-landed in North Africa and after his recovery; Dahl was transferred to Greece as the Germans were moving in. It was a hopeless battle, at one time six fighter planes was all the R. A. F. could put in the air against hundreds of German planes. This installment of Dahl's amazing life ends with his flying a plane in the British campaign to take Syria from the forces of Vichy France.Dahl cheated death many times in this book; he was a true war hero of the first magnitude. Some of that was skill, but as he repeatedly admits, luck also had a great deal to do with it. In many ways, his life story is more amazing than his fiction, this is a great book for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"I'm trying to imagine the kind of person who would not enjoy this book, and quite frankly I'm failing. If you can read this review, you will enjoy the book.It tells the story of Roald Dahl from his journey out to Dar-es-Salaam at the age of 18, to start working for Shell, to his being invalided home as a fighter pilot from the Middle East in 1941. Throughout he makes it sound as if it's all a bit of fun, but in reality the odds against his surviving the events in the book must have been 50 to 1.It's all told in a lovely deadpan voice that clearly shows up the utter absurdity what he was going through, from his servant killing a local German with a 17th century antique sword to being one of 15 fighter pilots in all of Greece to take on 1000 Luftwaffe planes. It's to his everlasting credit that he manages to do this in such a straightforward way. Of course, events speak for themselves, but it requires a skillful author to let them do so, and Dahl is more than skillful. This is a work of genius."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"\\"I must learn to fly a Hurricane and then I must take it to Greece and rejoin the squadron.When I got this news I was in Ismailia, a large RAF aerodrome on the Suez Canal. A Flight-Lieutenant said, 'You can have a couple of days to learn how to fly it, then you take it to Greece.''Fly that to Greece?' I said.'Of course.''Where do I stop to refuel?''You don't.' he said. 'You go non-stop.''How long will that take?''About four and a half hours,' he said.Even I knew that a Hurricane had fuel for only one and a half hours' flying, and I pointed that out to the Flight-Lieutenant. 'Don't worry about that,' he said. 'We're fitting extra fuel tanks under the wings.''Do they work?''Sometimes they work,' he said smirking. 'You press a little button and if you're lucky a pump pumps petrol from the wing-tanks into the main tank.''What happens if the pump doesn't work?''You bale out into the Med and swim,' he said.'No,' I said. 'Be serious. Who picks me up?'Nobody.' he said. 'It's a chance you have to take.'\\"- Roald Dahl (GOING SOLO p. 119)In this marvelous autobiographical sequel to BOY: TALES OF CHILDHOOD, Roald Dahl entertains and delights by recalling his experiences just prior to and during WW2 writing of the many adventures he had: traveling by ship from England to Dar-es-Salaam, Tanganyika (aboard the SS Mantola) and observing the bizarre habits of his fellow-British-passengers while on his way to work for the Shell Oil Company there, avoiding certain death from the venom of the Green Mamba, joining the Royal Air Force at the start of the war, learning to fly at an RAF airbase in Nairobi, Kenya, and crashing a Gladiator bi-plane in the Western Desert of Egypt, finally winning his wings and becoming a fighter pilot with the RAF in Africa and Greece, and then surviving dog-fights in the skies above Greece against German ME 109s. While many of Dahl's adventures were harrowing, others were very humorous.I won't spoil the fun for anyone in this brief review by writing too much. Pick up a copy of this wonderful little book and enjoy! You'll just have to take my word for it that you won't be bored or disappointed. Several maps and quite a few photos are included.As another reviewer wrote, it's a shame Mr. Dahl didn't write another autobiographical sketch about his life as a writer of children's books before he died in 1990. That, I'm sure, would have been an absolute pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Another writer once told me that one of the most important elements to be found in a memoir is a \\"likeable\\" narrator. Roald Dahl is perhaps one of the MOST likeable of narrators. Modest to a fault and blessed with a very sly and subtle sense of humor, the story Dahl tells in GOING SOLO, his sequel to BOY, is perhaps one of the most readable memoirs of modern times. His story of the quick and almost informal training he received at a flying school in Africa shortly after Great Britain entered WWII, is hair-raising and nearly impossible to believe, except you do believe, because you trust this man. At six foot six inches tall, Dahl was physically quite unsuited to be a fighter pilot, noting that when seated in the various planes he flew, his knees were nearly under his chin and he had to hunch over to fit beneath the plane's canopy. But fly he did, even after surviving one horrific crash in the desert early on in his career as an RAF pilot. He sustained a very bad concussion (which was to come back to haunt him and finally \\"invalid\\" him out of service nearly two years later) and had his face bashed in. As he explained to his mother in a letter: \\"My nose was bashed in ... and the ear nose and throat man pulled my nose out of the back of my head and shaped it and now it looks just as before except that it's a little bent about ...\\" Dahl went on to fly many combat missions in North Africa and Greece, usually against vastly superior odds, but somehow he managed to survive until the middle of 1941, when the migraine headaches caused by the aforementioned crash made him unfit for further flying. Dahl's nearly laconic and completely unself-conscious manner of writing about the things he did - absolutely heroic things - made me think of Sam Hynes's WWII memoir of his missions in the Pacific theater. Both writers downplay the importance of their roles. They never speak of heroics or derring-do, only about the importance of their comrades, doing the jobs they were trained to do and trying their best to simply stay alive. This was an enormously satisfying, moving and often hilarious tale. After reading these two slim volumes of memoirs by Dahl, I do wish he had written another. I have ordered his slim collection of stories about WWII already. What a wonderful writer - and gentleman - Roald Dahl was. - Tim Bazzett, author of SOLDIER BOY and LOVE, WAR & POLIO"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Excellent life story, adventure. Bought because of its aviation aspect and personal Greek attraction with the Battle of Athens during the last war. Having served on 84 Sqn RAF in Cyprus it was really interesting to review first hand flying activities during these times of conflict. A really nice short story."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Roald Dahl's memories about his time in World War II, many letters to his mother from the war. Secrets he didn't know if could disclose to her and time he spent in the Gypsy House. All of this is in this book.I found this book in my college library in the resources section so I could not even check it out. There may be very few copies of it."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"I've always enjoyed Dahl's children's books, and so I was curious to see what he might write about his own life. To say that his early adult years were exciting might understate the matter a bit. This book opens with Dahl embarking on a ship for East Africa, to start his first job as a representative of the Shell Oil Company, and follows him through his career as a RAF fighter pilot in the Eastern Mediterranean theater during WWII. Many of his tales are so over the top that it would be tempting to believe that he has embelished the stories. But even if he did, the result is an thoroughly enjoyable read, full of adventure and the excitement of youth. We also get a glimpse of the last hurrah of the British Empire, the epic struggle of the second World War, and just the barest idea of the conditions he found in war torn England upon his return. Very entertaining."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"i must say, this book was incredibly hard to put down!having read the previous roald dahl biography \\"boy,\\" i was eager to read this book. i wasn't disappointed at all. i was absolutely fascinated by the things that this man has gone through. i feel like a coward indeed after reading about roald dahl's trip to africa and his terrifying wartime experiences! it's magnetic!this book is written in a very straightforward style, and anyone and everyone should read it, i believe! there is a lot to be learned from this book. it shows the true insanity of war. people lose their minds in the kind of situations described in this book!it has a happy ending, though. this, you can look forward to!"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going Solo, by Roald Dahl is the epic sequel to his early age biography, Boy.In this book, Dahl is a grown man, just graduated out of Repton Boys School and is now working for the Shell Company. This book takes place during World War II, and Dahl starts in East Africa, and ends up in the places that you would least expect.Roald Dahl begins his new job in the small village of Dur es Salaam, Tanzania.Just as he wishes, he drives through the African jungles, delivering oil to people who live quite far from civilization. In Dur es Salaam Dahl encountered one of natures deadliest creatures; the black mamba. This particular snake's venom has no known cure, and its poison will kill its victim in no more then an hour. Dahl got the thrill of saving a person's life, by merely looking, out a window and screaming, \\"Salimu! Salimu! Beware huge snake! Behind You! Quickly quickly!\\" The boy, Salimu, quickly killed the snake off with a pitchfork, but owed his life to Dahl. Roald Dahl had many other adventures in Dur es Salaam, such as having a green mamba in his friend's house and having to call the \`snake man.' And seeing the cook's wife being carried off by a lion, but came back without a scratch!When war was announced, Dahl went off to be a Navy pilot. He leaves the Shell Company, and goes to Iraq, to be trained to be a pilot. Finally, when his training is complete, he is given coordinates of Squadron 80 (the Navy squad he's assigned to). While flying towards his squadron, Dahl realized that he was given the wrong coordinates! Nearly out of fuel, he attempts to land his plane on the bumpy terrain, but crashes, and barely escapes death!Squadron 80's assignment was to patrol Greece, and keep it safe from the Germans. There was only one minor problem; Squadron 80 had fifteen nice, well built Hurricane airplanes, while the German army had hundreds of planes that were the newest models. So no wonder Squadron 80 eventually fled, and Greece was captured by the Germans.He and his remaining squad go to Haifa Egypt, to once again protect it. Due to head injury's from Dahl's big crash, he becomes an invalid pilot, and begins his long journey home.I enjoyed this book, because it kept you on your toes at all times. There was never a moment that I wasn't enthralled in Roald Dahl's exquisite description, that put you right there in a Hurricane, dodging enemy blasts. I rate this book an 8 out of 10 because, even though its action packed, it sometimes gets a bit repetitive. If you enjoyed Boy, and are looking for a book that you won't ever want to put down, then choose Going Solo, and you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"And nowhere near as good as his fiction, GOING SOLO almost seems as though it was written as therapy. It's a professional job, don't get me wrong, but you can almost see Dahl working overtime to make his stories more exciting and gripping than they probably really were. The book begins with young Roald travelling to Tanzania on a boat under orders from Shell Oil, where he hopes to begin a career. Almost instantly the war breaks out and Dahl is ordered to round up the war's first prisoners. Then he's sent to flying school and taught to master a plane in a few months. Were planes simpler to learn back then? Well, for one thing, the RAF was educating its young men at assembly line pace, and the objective was to get up and come down; nothing fancier needed.It's sort of comical, especially because Roald felt himself to be abnormally tall (six and a half feet, a good foot taller than several of his instructors) so he really had to wedge his butt into the tiny Piper seat and fold his long legs like a heron to be able to play the pedals properly. The book peters out after a terrible crash results in awful head injuries, wounds that impacted his whole life way down the pike and narrowed his Swiftian vision into the refined cruelty that sparked his great masterpieces for children.No, I would not say this book is for kids, but on the other hand children love reading about flying, and they enjoy identifying with the \\"fish out of water.\\" Children feel a bond to outsiders of all descriptions, because everyone feels picked on. For Dahl it was a feeling that never went away, no matter how close he came to the stars."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"In this sequel to Boy, Roald Dahl writes about his life as a young adult. After leaving Repton, his boarding school, he signed on with the Shell Oil Company and was sent to East Africa, which is now called Tanzania. While Dahl was serving in Tanzania, World War II happened and he signed up with the Royal Air Force. He chronicles in detail his work for Shell, and his experiences as an RAF pilot.In East Africa, Roald Dahl had a near-fatal encounter with a deadly black mamba, whose poison can kill you in about two seconds. Right after the war broke out Roald's servant, a descendant of warrior tribesman, decided to become a warrior himself and killed a civillian. Roald had to spirit him away before the murder was discovered. And just to show how dangerous flying with the RAF was, one day when Roald returned from a mission his tent-mate told him, \\"I boiled enough tea for two, just in case you happened to come back.\\" He was eventually shot down, but survived. While recuperating in the hospital, he fell in love with his nurse.Going Solo was, like all of Dahl's books, wonderful. I only wish he'd have written a third about his later adulthood. Pity he died before he could do that."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"As a 17 year old boy who spent my childhood in Norway, with roalds books, I was really surprised when I found at that he wrote books for adults as well.

This book continues the story begun in boy, where dahl tells us about his highlights in life, from the point where he worked for Shell until he has finished his service in the RAF, and he returns back to a war raged Brittain .

It is very discreptive it tells everything about his life and is very well done. Before you read this book read Boy tales of a childhood."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going Solo (the sequel to Boy) is a collection of Roald Dahl's most interesting stories of his time in Africa. These include: meeting a man you gives himself dandruff, teaching an African boy to read and write, seeing a lion attack a cook, learning to fly without a teacher, crashing in the African desert, leading a unit of R.A.F. soldiers to stop a caravan of German people from leaving Dar es Salaam, becoming temporarily blind, meeting the girl of his dreams then falling out of love when he sees her and living on a Greek airfield soon before he was grounded. Roald Dahl's style of writing changes each time slightly changes to fit the story. Basically, you get the idea that you have known Roald for years and he is just telling you an amusing story. Going Solo was not as interesting as some of his other fiction stories. For some readers it may not be interesting enough to keep you in the book; but it is not boring, thrills and adventure are always happening. To compare this to Boy would be a little difficult because even though they are the same writer, Boy is about his childhood and is for younger readers. Going Solo is probably for older readers. Even it you do not like one of the chapters the next will bring you back in. So if you want a lot of good anecdotes to read then or if you really liked Boy, you should pick up Going Solo."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"This gem of a book is surprising in many ways. The whimsical cover suggests tongue-in-cheek, and, indeed, there is some of that, but mostly it is a book that sneaks up on you, grabs you, and astonishes. \`Going Solo' is the story of Roald Dahl's World War 2 experiences, and is divided roughly into two main themes. The first part records the experiences he had while he was stationed in East Africa before the war, when excitement meant such things as dealing with green mambas. I know virtually nothing about Africa, but resolved to learn more after reading this part of the book. There are many charming stories here: watch for the one taking place on his voyage out when Dahl discovers that his roommate is simulating dandruff on his dinner jacket with talcum powder!The second half of the book records his RAF exploits, many of which would not be believed had this been a work of fiction. Dahl's descriptions of such things as plane crashes are charmingly low-key and understated, an unusual way to depict danger and hardship, but one that succeeds brilliantly in this book.Adding to the charm of the book are pictures of letters, postcards, photographs, maps and the like - visuals that make the lively text come even more alive. This is one war story women who steer away from the usual blood-and-guts stereotype war novels will absolutely enjoy. It is a touching and interesting portrayal of courage and amazing happenings in the life of a very unassuming gentleman."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"In the book \\"Going Solo\\" Roald Dahl describes every fun and depressing part of his experience as a teenager to adulthood. Its in his hilarious style where no word is boring, and the language is easy to read, lots of photographs took by Roald Dahl himself, and the ending is satisfying.Everyone dislikes going on wars but Roald Dahl enjoyed it. He thought that it was a free travel and it was interesting. The story is about Roald Dahl's first career in Africa (Sudan) working for the Shell Oil company. When the second world war broke up he joined the royal airforce throughout middle east and the coast of Greece. some of the things he gets himself into and out of are incredible...like when he captures the war's first prisoners, or crash-lands in the desert, or flys in the Battle of Athens...the list goes on and on.Throughout the book you follow a period of his life, experiencing both the positives and negatives sides of his adventure. You also get to find out how he begins to build ideas, and these ideas become great children books that are so memorable today.Best parts: all the flying missions, of which Dahl writes so enthusiastically, by a 6'6\\" pilot crammed into the tiny cockpit of a Hurricane.Worst: I cannot believe how the RAF could send so many practically untrained flyers into combat in aircraft they had never even flown beforeGoing Solo was, like all of Dahl's books, wonderful.

If you don't like hearing about blood and injuries, this would not be your kind of book. By Charles, age 9"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going Solo takes place between 1938-1941. The book details the narrator's life as a pilot in the Navy. When the book starts, the narrator tells about his great adventures from Africa to the Mediterranean. One of his many adventures occured, when he almost gets killed by one of the most dangerous snakes in Tanganyika, called the Green Mamba. Then later on in the story he starts his life as a pilot in 1939. dahl's first challenge was trying to learn how to fly a plane. This would usually consist of just the basic's, flying, and landing. After he had learned to master this skill it was on to the next. The narrator tells about the six months he went through constant flight training, in learning how to attack enemies in different situations. Towards the end of his training, Dahl crashes in the middle of the desert and is stranded. With no plane to fly, and his body badly injured, there was nothing he could do but just hope for someone to help him. An hour passed and Roald was put in the nearest hospital. The doctors told him he could never fly again, but Roald refused to accept that. With alot of recuperation he was able to meet up with his squadron and be ready to fly again. As soon as he got to Egypt, his capton leader said he was going up in battle against some of the best German pilots tomorrow morning. What do you think will happen when he has to battle the Germans? You better read this book to find out."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"I read the fantastic book named Going Solo by Roald Dahl. This book was an autobiography of Roald Dahl's life prior to and during World War II. The book explained many of his encounters with the enemy as a pilot for the Royal Air Force in Roald Dahl's personal view. There are an uncountable number of fascinating events that occur when he is a pilot. Some of them include when he receives a life threatening injury, going into a hardcore battle with no experience at fighting enemies, and getting out of a long-lasting dogfight where he was outnumbered 200 to 12. The other half of the book explained his thrilling adventures prior to the war when he worked for the Shell Company. Some of his experiences while working for the Shell Company included chasing a lion, saving a man from a deadly Black Mamba, and sighting a deadly Green Mamba enter his friends house. Every page of the book was full of plot and adventure, and I could not put this book down.In the beginning of the book Roald Dahl is on a ship, which was taking him from England to Africa for a job with the Shell Company. He ended up in a beautiful tropic town named Dar es Salaam, located in Tanzania, which is on the coast of Africa. Once there, he was given a personal \`boy' named Mdisho, which back then was like an unpaid worker. Mdisho and Roald form a very close father-son relationship, Roald being the father and Mdisho being the son. Roald teaches Mdisho many things, while Mdisho goes out and works for him. After a while, Roald decides to join the army as a Pilot Officer. He began his journey in flight training for six months. Then, he was given directions to join up with the 80 Squadron, who were fighting in the middle of the Sahara desert. The directions were incorrect and he ended up crashing and getting a life-threatening injury. Once he recovered, he was to meet up with the 80 Squadron again, who were now located in Greece. He finds himself fighting in Greece with only 12 planes in the whole of Greece. The Germans had thousands of planes located in Greece, so they fought as best they could. Once it was getting too dangerous, the 80 Squadron left and went on to a place named Argos, which was another fifty miles along the coast. After that, they went along to Palestine and Syria, and fought off more Nazis. He then was experiencing major headaches when flying and had to be sent home. This is a brief overview of the book, and as you can see it's full of suspense.This book was an awesome book, because I learned a lot about how life was during World War II through the eyes of a magnificent writer. It was so good that I read it the first day I started reading it. Roald Dahl draws out a scene for you each battle, so you can imagine like you are there with him, in his Hurricane airplane fighting off the Nazis. This book is for the sort of person that enjoys reading fast-paced books and loves to read about history. Also, if you like the author Roald Dahl, I would suggest reading it because it tells a lot about him, and his personal history. If this book sounds interesting to you then I definitely recommend it and suggest you check it out, or maybe you might want to check out the prequel to Going Solo titled Boy."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"I read this in one sitting, so you can see it is pretty interesting. I get the feeling Dahl was a really honest person. His account of how he learned to fly and was dumped right into fighting German airplanes without any fighter pilot training is amazing and rather frightening. He mentions several times the number of young lives lost because of the lack of training and support. One of the grim aspects of war. The accounts of living in Africa, black mambos and lions, pretty strong stuff too."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Como siempre desde hace a&ntilde;os Amazon sigue enviando los libros y los discos con rapidez y eficacia. Me parece incre&iacute;ble que los env&iacute;os sean tan veloces."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"'Going Solo' is the second part of Roald Dahl's sort-of-autobiography, covering Dahl's experiences in Africa and the Mediterranean, initially as part of his work for Shell, and later on as a fighter pilot in the Second World War. Although it is designed to be read by those who have just finished 'Boy', the tone is more serious, and themes such as warfare are somewhat weightier than Great Mouse Plots and chocolate sampling. Whereas 'Boy' can be enjoyed by children of any age, 'Going Solo' is probably best suited to slightly older children, and even adults.The first half of the book picks up right where \`Boy' leaves off, with Dahl beginning his travels out to East Africa. This part of the book is the more light-hearted and closest in style to \`Boy', with its discussion of snake handlers, warrior servants, and especially the eccentric people who inhabit the farthest reaches of the Empire. Dahl's description of the oddballs who travel out on the ship with him (including a man who fakes having dandruff to disguise his wig, an elderly couple who run around the deck without a stitch of clothing on, and a woman who will only eat oranges with a fork) is hilarious.The tone gets more serious with the outbreak of the war, with Dahl forced to round up German civilians fleeing the country, and following this he enlists in the RAF. The remainder of the book focuses on his wartime training and service, in Africa, Greece, and later on in the Middle East. I've always regarded this as the most interesting part of the book, and Dahl does an excellent job of describing what it is like to be a fighter pilot; crashing in the desert, shooting down enemy planes, being strafed, diving and banking to avoid being shot down, and especially the appalling loss of life among his fellow pilots. This part of the book also provides a fascinating insight into parts of WW2 that don't get much publicity, such as the hopeless against-the-odds Grecian campaign. In many ways it's a miracle Dahl and several others survived to fight another day. The final chapter sees Dahl invalidated home, and offers some insights into the Home Front during the war.In all, I found \`Going Solo' to be just as good, and probably better, than \`Boy'. Dahl's humourous and engaging style is still present, but the book covers more serious and (in my opinion) interesting issues than the child-like fascinations of \`Boy'. As I say, it may be more suitable for slightly older children and adolescents, but this is a must-read for fans of Dahl's work, children and adult alike."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"My 10 years old Boy is reading this book and it kept his attencion!he enjoy Dahl sotries but this one seems to be one of the bests for him!The WW2 is the scenario but imagining that you are a pilot there is amazing!excellent book!"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going Solo by Roald Dahl is a fantastic adventurous book about Roald's experience as a WW2 fighter pilot. He talks about his other stories from Hatia and Marigua. His friends like David Coke and other squad mates give him more stories to tell. He tells about his journey to England and how he felt during the stress and pressure of the war. Roald describes this book like pie if you use clear details.Roald Dahl gets sent from Norway to England to enlist in the British air force to fight for the allies in WW2. When Roald flies in air battles it has a lot of action because air battles are always epic. His word choice excels in telling the story. The action comes from the intense and complicated words he uses. Here is an example of him using action in Going Solo: \\"As I swerved through explosions and planes, the bullets looked like orange fiery sticks flying at me.\\"The book also has a suspense cliff-hanger technique that wants you to keep reading. All of Roald's books all have this trait that makes it fun but full of suspense. It feels like it's giving you hunger to play the story out. You can almost imagine it because it is so intense. An example of suspense in Going Solo is \\"The blow to my head smashed my face in. I was blind. Who knows what shall happen to Roald Dahl?Another reason this book is entirely awesome is because this book is written by Roald Dahl. Roald Dahl is a great author and has interesting topics from Friendly Giants, to chocolate factories, medicine to shrink people. He is a great author because he loves to write children's books in a way that grabs the reader's attention. Roald tells autobiographies in every story and loves writing which makes him a clear detail-telling story teller/writer.Going Solo by Roald Dahl is a great story overall. It is action-packed, full of suspense, and is written by a great author, Roald Dahl. It is kind of boring in the beginning, but it progresses when Roald really tells his stories during air battles. His dangers were growing, and accidents were fatal. Roald Dahl talks about how his adventure as a WW2 pilot is really amazing and glorious when he was going solo.-- B. Lee"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"I think this is a great coming of age book and one of the more memorable ones that I have read. I think it would have had even more of an effect on me if I had read it again after I graduated high-school. Come to think of it, this would be an excellent graduation gift. As it is I've used the rice and banana recipe many times. I loved the stories of him in his fighter airplane and I liked the story of the nurse where he fell in love with her voice but when he actually went on a date with her, he found out she wasn't his type. He leaves it as a mystery to why, but someone who doesn't facilitate communication, respect, honesty, and trust in a relationship is a throwback no matter how pretty the person is. I think it's a very important lesson that Roald Dahl introduces. This book is an excellent coming of age story with a responsible, confident healthy protagonist."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"This is the best book I have read in a long time. My third grade son recommended it to me, so I can say it's good for both kids and adults. His stories of his life as a young man working in East Africa and flying for the RAF in WW II are compelling and, as always with Dahl, so well-written. His stories of human encounters with snakes and lions are entertaining. I look forward to sharing this great book with friends. His autobiography \\"Boy\\" about his childhood was also very good and worth reading also."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"This is one of the most interesting and interestingly written books in recent memory. I devoured it,It was a delightful, personal description of Dahl's journey to East Africa, his work there in an outpost of the far flung British Empire -- a world that would never again be seen. He describes with engaging candor his role in how the British \\"muddled through\\" WWII -- just.The Brits would have one believe that all went \\"according\\" to plan -- that the issue was never in doubt -- but Dahl's charming account of how he learned to fly the Tiger Moth for the RAF and how he became an \\"instant\\" Hurricane fighter pilot in Greece were convincing evidence to the contrary.Easy reading!! Highly recommended!!Fritz Steiner"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Very exciting autobiography of his time in Africa working for an oil company, then he joined the RAF as a pilot. Great gift for a pilot or a WWII buff."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Many years ago, I read this book, which thoroughly captivated me. Before earning a worldwide reputation as a writer of exciting and wildly imaginative children's books, Dahl had served as a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. Here he relates his experiences of undergoing flight training in Southern Africa. He conveys with touching clarity the stresses, joys, and pain any pilot trainee experiences in coming to grips with flying. As someone who is fascinated with aviation, I almost felt as if I were in the cockpit with Dahl as he advanced through the various levels of training.Dahl went on to serve with a fighter squadron in Libya, which, in the wake of the German blitzkrieg in the Balkans in April 1941, was later sent to Greece. It proved to be a fruitless undertaking as Dahl's squadron sustained heavy losses and Dahl himself was greviously wounded. This book is a testament to one man's love for flying and his efforts to pick up the pieces and resume a full life again."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"If you see the classic Roald Dahl cover illustration you might think this is an appropriate book for young children. It's definitely a book for 6th or 7th grade and up. Scroll around and you'll find some excellent reviews written by teenagers. I just gave it to my dad who is a WWII buff--he loved it. Adults, particularly those interested in Africa and WWII, will enjoy it so don't think you're going to read a children's book. It's really a classic memoir. The great British actor, Derek Jacobi, has recorded a fantastic unabridged audio version (and a fine one of Dahl's \\"Boy\\")"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"What an entertaining read this proves--not surprisingly--by the author of the children's classic, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. Continuing the autobiographical expose of British boarding schools as revealed in BOY, Dahl opens this meant-for-adults book with a delightfully wacky view of his fellow Englishmen en route to work in Africa. Scornful of the repeated falls from stoic grace by so many of his predecessors, this young Empire Builder is at first shocked by the sight of so many decent chaps who have Gone Native--a result of prolonged absence from the UK and intense heat exposure. Can an idealistic youth rise above heat, humidity and British bravado to maintain his unflappable equanimity, or will he too succumb to the national trend?Most of this book, however, consists of Dahl's serious account of his contribution to the Allied air war in Africa's western desert, followed by a long recuperation from head trauma. Before he returns safely to England, he describes the deadly action in Greece where German planes far outnumbered the intrepid RAF pilots. Interspersed among the reports of the air war are his own b/w photos and letters (self-censored) to his beloved Norwegian mother in England. This account will easily capture the reader's interest as Dahl translates the global struggle by bringing it down to an intensely human level. With his treasured possessions--pilot's Log Book and his 2nd camera--we leave him when he is reunited safely with his mother. A fast read--well worth the effort even if you are not a war buff."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going Solo is the great story that Roald Dahl adventured throughout his young life. Roald Dahl accomplished many things once he was able to do things on his own. Mainly the book is about himself traveling all over Europe and Africa just trying to experience as much as he could. He travels all over the bottom of Europe and works way down and around Africa staying at many non civilized villages and getting to know many natives. At the time he is working for the Shell Oil Company until he finally quits. In East Africa he also is endangered with a near fatal death with a Green Mamba , one of the most deadly snakes. Roald also has a passion for the air force, and ends up joining the RAF. Going Solo is one of the most adventurous books that I have ever read, with the nonstop climax's and so many near death experiences. This is a very descriptive book with so many heroic twist that can keep anyone's attention. Roald Dahl is very famous for most of his work such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but this book is amazing because this all actually happened to writer in real life. The greatest part about the Roald Dahl in Going Solo is that he never gave up, even after a plane crash that he should not have been able to live after. He was told that he would be blind for the rest of his life, but about a month later he started to gain his sight back. I feel that this book is a miracle."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"WOW! Going Solo, by Roald Dahl is an amazing and heart capturing book. Read this book if you love war stories. These stories are serious, funny, and keep you wanting more. I found the book almost impossible to believe during some points in the amazing novel.Dahl's biography tells about his survival in the dated war planes without experience (while outnumbered 100 to 1) and on the ground as commander with no experience again. Dahl uses great language and thought to describe things and to progress the novel with amazing simplicity. To me, simplicity and straight-forwardness makes a book enjoyable (not school like), and pretty easy to read. It is not a \\"piece of cake\\" reading, but it isn't unbelievably hard. His survival in the air of Greece and Africa come down to one thing, instincts. I believe Going Solo shows how most humans would act during a war; very scared, rather excited, nervous, and filled with heart pumping adrenaline. As I read, my eyes read faster than my brain could keep up with. I felt I was flying right next Dahl, watching him struggle to survive the most horrid war of history, World War II. What I also love about Roald Dahl's story is that he has a perfect balance of humor and exploding action. There was never one seriously boring dead place.This is one of the best books I have ever read. I love Going Solo because I always want to read more. Most of the time I do not wish to put it down. These are the types of books I love to read. Astonishingly, the novel feels like a movie. At the last second when all hope seems to be lost, Dahl shows his intelligence by giving you a story you will remember for a long time. That is why I recommend this book.Do not read Going Solo if you hate adventurous, unbelievably true World War II stories. Trust me; read Going Solo if you want a great read with amazing plot.The novel builds and builds with drama and action, then the unfathomable happens...read Going Solo to find a great ending with a great last word."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going SoloGoing Solo by Roald Dahl is an action-packed adventure full of laughs and frights. Dahl uses up-front, to the point explanations that provide detailed and somewhat sudden images of events from his life. The book itself, Going Solo, is based on Dahl's experience in Africa and in the air force. Dahl starts his tale as a young man headed to an African coastal city where he will help in the management of a Shell public relations group. Dahl encounters much more than he bargained for and provides readers with a great bed-time reader. I wouldn't however suggest it for bed-time reading, because you won't be able to put it down.I typically read books that fall under the Fantasy genre because the author has the ability to constantly fill the characters with excitement as opposed to a biography in which the author may only use real events, which are not always as fast-paced. Dahl, however, has had a life that really has very few dull moments. I had no problem keeping the movie in my mind going. He transitioned well from event to event without stopping the action. I was drawn in at first by the experience Dahl had on the ship. He explains that the ship taking him to Africa was occupied by men who were somewhat mentally unstable. His colorful imagery of all his situations and scenes makes for a compelling and intriguing story-line.In addition to detail through words, Dahl has pictures in his book. This is not a critical component of literature, but it allowed me to complete my mental images. His photographs depict people he met and things he encountered. These pictures aided in my idea of the time period and culture of the setting. This book is by no means a picture book, but it has several images throughout the book.The book also drew me in because it was Dahl reflecting on his life. As I read the book I felt as though it was the first time since his war experience that he had looked back on the events. I felt as though he was developing his opinions of his decisions throughout the war as he was writing the book. In a sense, it felt like I was the first person to here his reflection on his life. This display of a relationship between author and reader further demonstrates Dahl's mastery of literature.I would recommend this work to anyone seeking a short-term commitment as far as reading goes. This book can easily be finished within a few devoted days. The book is not a very high reading level, but leaves the door open for deep thought and role-playing. I enjoyed this piece and through it's creativity it compelled me to read another of Dahl's pieces. For those who choose to try this book, I invite you to spend equal time reading and reflecting to get the most out of the book. Enjoy this piece.-Jess13KY"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"tHIS BOOK IS GREAT!!!Roald dahls bio is actually like a story!Instead of writing boring stuff about life, Roald Dahl will make u very intrest and will make want to read moreYou would n't put the book down until you finish itAnd even after finishing, you would dream of it and want to read it againAnother book reccomende is Boy, tales of childhood"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"This thrilling, true-life adventure stands on its own as a great read. In fact, I read it to my 8-year old son before we read &quot;Boy&quot;, and turned to &quot;Boy&quot; only because &quot;Going Solo&quot; is so wonderful. Although the story is filled with action, what makes this book a classic - and one you won't want to put down - is Dahl's magical use of the English language."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"If you want to show your kid or student that an biography is fun to read, well, in \\"Going Solo\\" Roald Dahl describes every fun and depression of his experience as a teenager to adulthood. It is just as fun reading \\"Matilda\\" and \\"The Witches\\". The language is easy to read, lots of photographs took by Roald Dahl himself, and the ending is satisfying.The story is about Roald Dahl's first career in Africa (Sudan) working for the Shell Oil company. When the second world war broke up he joined the royal airforce throughout middle east and the coast of Greece.Throughout the book you follow a period of his life, experiencing both the positives and negatives of his adventure. You also get to find out how he begins to build ideas, and these ideas become great children books that are unforgettable to this day.This is not just a great read for the Roald Dahl fans, but everyone who loves for adventures and wild creativities. Go get it and start reading!"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going Solo Review by Samuel WOne of the characters I most enjoyed was David Coke, pronounced Cook. David is extraordinarily kind even throughout hard times of the war. When Roald Dahl first arrived at the Greece airbase the CO greets Roald with, \\"You can find yourself a bunk in one of the tents. You'll start flying tomorrow like the rest of them.\\" The CO doesn't greet him with, \\"I'm glad you made it,\\" or \\"How are you?\\" David gives Roald a good greeting and trys to help Roald by teaching him tips on combat.An aspect of the book that I liked was that the story is true. The experiences that Roald endured are amazing and surreal. He joins the Greece air force of fifteen, up against hundreds of German fighters, with no combat experience, and alone. It's survival. There story of survival can be scaled to the part after the Battle of Athens when both Roald and David get back to their base. \\"I think were going to get killed,\\" Roald said. \\"So do I, said David. \\"you can have the basin in a moment. I left a bit of water in the jug in case you happen to come back.\\" Both pilots thought they were going to die.I chose to read this book because I knew it was a flying book and it was titled \\"Going Solo.\\" Though I have never been in a fight like that, I felt a slight connection. As does any pilot when they hear the word solo. To some degree the word solo to a pilot is the same as survival. I recommend this book to all adventure seekers."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"This book talks about Roald Dahl when he was young. He took part in the Second World War and this book deals with the time he went flying with the RAF in the war. Everyone dislikes going on wars but Roald Dahl enjoyed it. He thought that it was a free travel and it was interesting. He described all the interesting and exciting events happening to him. After three years of fighting and flying, due to the severe head injuries he had received when his Gladiator crashed in the Western Desert, he must on no account fly a fighter plane again and so went back home. I do not enjoy the story because I do not like wars. Wars are terrible and Roald Dahl described how he helped the others fight and how the others were shot and died. I felt upset when I read this book. I think this book is thick. The plot goes slowly and it makes the story boring."},{"Title":"Martin Luther: The Great Reformer (Heroes of the Faith (Chelsea House))","review":"I picked this up at a Christian book store for half price. This is an abridged book in a series on famous Christians (mostly Protestant). The author, who is clearly sympathetic with Luther's cause, devotes more attention to Luther's personal relationships and political struggle than to his theology. However, this is probably appropriate for the intended audience (the book store located it near the young readers' section). I can't compare the book to others since this is the first I've read on the topic, but I've personally found it to be an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Martin Luther: The Great Reformer (Heroes of the Faith (Chelsea House))","review":"Synopsis: A brief biography of Luther's life. Part of a series of approximately 20 books entitled Heroes of the Faith. It is edited and abridged from a larger work by Dan Harmon.My review: The book has large, direct quotes from other sources, including big chunks of the questioning of Luther at the Diet of Worms in 1521. This is most appropriate since Luther was a well-spoken as well as plain-spoke debater. His text is lively and interesting to read. Even to the modern reader his meaning is quite clear and devoid of all of the flowery Renaissance nonsense that entraps other writers and bores me to distraction.However, the larger text Harmon edited from left out Luther's most famous line: 'My conscience is captive to the Word of God...Here I stand I can do no other.' This is the image of Luther presented in every school book in the world - the solitary monk standing up to the entire church and against all of Europe's kings at the Diet of Worms on a matter of conscience and refusing to blink because, by God (literally), he thinks he is right and is willing to die for that belief. In my mind, this is one of those moments of heroism that everyone should admire, even if you are not a believer. But, the original text left it out!!! The height of his shining moment - gone!!Ironically, that quote is featured on the back of the book - it is in bold print and serves as the headline for the description of the book! AARRGH!My grade: The book is, in general, informative and would serve as a decent introduction to Luther. However, I cannot forgive a biography that leaves out the single most dramatic line from the single most dramatic moment of its subject's life. Imagine a Lincoln biography without the Gettysburg Address, a Martin Luther King, Jr. biography without his 'I Have a Dream' speech or a Julius Caesar biography without 'Vini, vidi, vici.'***Reviewer's note: please read the comment section.

The hero, Derek, loves his fiancee, Janine, so much that instead of letting her die of cancer, he has her frozen.

I have tried many texts that my students bemoaned as too technical, boring, and somniferous. But my students find this text highly readable, understandable and interesting. That's a victory, especially when my students are mostly working HR professionals who drag themselves to class through the clogged freeways of Los Angeles. The least I can offer them is a good textbook; this is it!"},{"Title":"Strategic Compensation: A Human Resource, Third Edition","review":"I have seen many textbooks that are relentlessly boring due to the author's inability to balance technical and nontechnical jargon. But, this book somehow masters the ability to deliver relevant knowlege in an explicit manner. If you really want to know the foundations of compensating and you do not want to be bombarded by irrelevant wordiness, buy this book."},{"Title":"Strategic Compensation: A Human Resource, Third Edition","review":"Compensation is not the most popular course in the undergraduate curriculum, but this text makes it much more attractive. The examples are very easy to follow and the chapters flow well. As an instructor looking for something to make a very important topic more accessible to students, I was delighted to find this text. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Strategic Compensation: A Human Resource, Third Edition","review":"Great buy. Only problem was that it was not the latest version and was missing the last two chapters."},{"Title":"Strategic Compensation: A Human Resource, Third Edition","review":"Richard I. Henderson's steadfast refusal to add value to his classic textbook more or less forced me into adopting this book. I've used Henderson for over fifteen years, but could not continue to have my students backfill the many holes in that old book.This book is better in that respect, but does suffer from a \\"lightness of treatment\\" that I did not have to worry about with Henderson. Henderson was completely comprehensive; this book cannot claim that.But it's a good book, and better than Henderson in its current state."},{"Title":"Principles of engineering economy,","review":"Eugene Grant's textbook offers a sound, theoretically accurate, and mathematically rigorous treatment of the economic analysis of investment projects (capital budgeting). Though a bit more verbose than Harold Bierman Jr's classic work, Eugene Grant provides an abundant quantity of demanding end-of-chapter problems that will turn the diligent student into a capital budgeting expert."},{"Title":"Principles of engineering economy,","review":"This book is good if you already have finance background.

I found the text and the style of writing somehow difficult for someone who knows English as a second language. Although my English is good, I still had some problems. My friends who are not so strong in English had lots of problems and many of them failed to finish the book. All in all, compared to other books from the publisher, the text is difficult and has to be simplified. I hope for the next edition of the book, the publisher and writers would take it into acount."},{"Title":"Five Hundred Years of Printing (Criterion Books hardcover)","review":"Steinberg's contribution to the literature of bookmaking should not be overlooked.

Not good."},{"Title":"Death's Domain: A Discworld Mapp (Discworld Series)","review":"This book/map, which is the fourth map from the Pratchett multiverse, is for the avid reader who has all the books by Terry Pratchett and is desperate enough for more material that he shells out twenty bucks to get more.The writing is excellent, as always, but there are only 23 (quick count) pages of it. The rest of the product (except for the title pages etc.) consists of a large map following the same standard as the three other maps. The problem with it is that it doesn't enhance the reading of the novels in any way at all. The first two maps, Ankh-Morpork and, to a lesser degree, Discworld, added to the fun by letting the reader follow the protagonists' journeys while reading the novels. This map from the domain of one of Discworld's most amusing and easiest recognizable characters does no such thing. It is nice-looking but nothing more. It doesn't really tell me anything more about Discworld than that its author has no intention to starve.What I really would wish is a collection of the text-bits from the maps together with Terry's excellent short stories in one book. That way we could avoid all the empty filling.Ok, here's the full quote: Death: \\"THERE ARE BETTER THINGS IN THE WORLD THAN ALCOHOL, ALBERT\\"Albert: \\"Oh, yes, sir. But alcohol sort of compensates for not getting them.\\""},{"Title":"Death's Domain: A Discworld Mapp (Discworld Series)","review":"Death decided that he needed a place to live, so Death's Domain was born, just nobody is exactly sure precisely where it is. \\"Death, significantly, does not see many crypts or coffins. Most peole die at home, or at sea, or at least out in the fresh air.\\" So therefore there isn't anything terribly gothic or spooky about the house--except that everything is in various shades of the colour black.In the tradition of previous Discworld Mapps this volume contains a large map and a booklet. I honestly found the booklet and the border illustrations the best.I really like Kidby's illustrations of Death and his associates so that is quite enjoyable. Not only are we treated to Death, Susan, and Albert but we see Death of Rats peeking over an edge and his raven in the midst of black roses. And don't forget Binky!The booklet was also quite illuminating, especially the discussions between Albert and Death concerning the golf course and the maze. The character of Death as portrayed by Pratchett has long fascinated me (it is nice to see him in every book) and it is fun to see more of him than before.However, we don't actually see the inside of the house (since it is larger on the inside than the outside). Also, somewhat disappointingly some of the details were too small to properly make out. I would have really enjoyed seeing the tree swing that Death made for Susan, but it is far too small to see anything clearly.Finally I would encourage casual fans to not pick up this volume unless they're really fascinated by Death. Yes it is interesting (and vital to the diehard fan), but it doesn't add too much to the books and doesn't make much sense just on its own."},{"Title":"Death's Domain: A Discworld Mapp (Discworld Series)","review":"I have very mixed feelings about this Mapp. I bought it because it's Discworld, and a serious Discworld fan like me will want to have this in their collection regardless of what rating it gets!Nevertheless, compared to the other Mapps (The Streets of Ankh-Morpork,The Discworld MappandA Tourist Guide to Lancre) it's not quite up to par.True, the Mapp itself is gorgeous and there are some nifty pencil drawings inside the book (some of which can however also be found inThe Art of Discworld). And there is some really funny dialogue between Albert and his master about playing golf...But mostly, this Mapp is rather boring. Unlike the others, it just doesn't add much to the Discworld series.The books describe the INSIDE of Death's house in much detail but the Mapp focuses on the outside of it only - which looks like an areal picture of any old manor and grounds. OK, with less green and more purple/black, but other than that...We now know the exact location of Death's bee hives and where the stables are - but so what? Who really cares? We also learn where Death built Susan's swing but we can't actually see what it looks like, it's just a dot in the trees. The wheat field is just a patch of yellow in the distance. And then there are lots of frankly boring additions that AFAIK have never been mentioned in the books (The Pointy Tree Avenue? The Wood of Silence? The Gazebo? Give me a break...)In short, there is just not much CONTENT. What is shown isn't bad, I just think that a plan and images of the INSIDE should really have been included as well.Yet as it is, the steep price should make many Discworld fans wonder: do I really need this? My recommendation for casual fans is to spend the money on a Discworld novel instead..."},{"Title":"Death's Domain: A Discworld Mapp (Discworld Series)","review":"This thing is like a book, it has a few pages discribing Death's domain. But what's really neat is that is has a huge fold out map of the entire world that Death lives in. It's so cool! It filled up a very good size portion of my wall and is really neat to walk in to see. It's got nice artwrok and everything. Even if you've never read the discworld series it's nice to have.

As with such stories, there is always one in the group who is a constant bellyacher and whiner. This is the author. His point of view is very funny. I could have done without the mention of his drug use and the many typos, but these were minor nuisances. Overall, it is a fun book to read."},{"Title":"Mzungu Mjinga: Swahili for \\"Crazy White Man\\"","review":"Mzungu Mjinga by Edgar award winner Rick Boyer is a modern-day safari memoir. Set the Tanzania wilds, the engaging narrative chronicles one man's first-time adventure into the subculture of the African hunt, from rules, regulations and politics to issues of survival in a sometimes hostile land. Tips for safari success are naturally scattered throughout, such as the importance of sighting one's gun after any plane flight (\\"Who knows what bugger dropped your case on the runway? Or tried to pry it open? All sorts of things can happen to scopes in transit.\\") The picturesque description and excitement of the hunt itself comes alive on the page, in this enthralling excursion that is the next best thing to being there."},{"Title":"Forgotten Star","review":"Woody Leonard's first novel, forgotten star, is a smooth transition from writing plays and music to writing fiction. He offers his readers intrigue as well as romance in this story of why movie actress, Margot Durning, left the glitz and glitter of Hollywood in the 30's to live a secluded life in the dusty, wind-driven, Oklahoma Panhandle. The author weaves us skillfully in well-blended flashbacks, from Sarah and Leigh's present day romance, to Margot and Clay's 1950's love affair. We are drawn bit by bit into why a box-office favorite would leave her world of success to live in almost total isolation. Congratulations Woody, I look forward to reading your second novel."},{"Title":"Forgotten Star","review":"If you're a fan of movie trivia, if the lives of the stars of yester-year fascinate you, you will enjoy this book. This fictional tale of a star who suddenly departs Hollywood and her glamorous life to return to the barren Oklahoma panhandle of her beginnings where she built her own Shangri-La is skillfully written with characters that keep you totally absorbed in the story from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Forgotten Star","review":"Kudos Woody, it is refreshing and magical. No copycat book for you, this story is one that that kept me involved and excited. Many books are so predictable, but you have given us a story that lends anticipation in a sense with mystery and magic all in one. A heartfelt and heart warming story. I hope you don't wait to long to give us your second treat."},{"Title":"Forgotten Star","review":"Being short on time, I planned to browse through the first two chapters to see if I could tell how interesting the novel was before I settled down that evening to began reading. However, after that I could not put the book down. Mr. Leonard keeps you very interested from the first paragraph until the very end. I read each sentence, paragraph and chapter with so much anticipation concerning what I would find out about each character. Needless to say, the book was finished the day I got it! The detail Woody goes into describing the settings, etc. made it all seem real. In fact, I was ready to pick up and go visit the home of &quot;Margot Durning,&quot; that is how real and enthusiastic this book was. Congratulations on a job well done, Woody!"},{"Title":"Forgotten Star","review":"This novel from first time author Woody Leaonard has captured the same quality of story telling found in such titles as 'The Notebook' and 'Message in a Bottle'.

However, this author's talent was systematically derailed by shallow, fundamentally-flawed editing that left the book, FORGOTTEN STAR, a mere shadow of its original intent.The author has a knack for storytelling; this is more than abundant as we read about a Hollywood icon's self-imposed exile, her escape nurtured by benevolent allies in and out of the motion picture industry. The author has considerable knowledge concerning Hollywood's gilded era, along with a gift for description of the bleak northwest Oklahoma landscape--hauntingly beautiful in its natural desolation.Yet, unfortunately, the poor editing gets in the way.To all authors eagerly publising their works via these problematic houses: Be warned. Diligently scan the fruits of your labors--word after solemn word. I highly recommend utilizing a professional editor to clean up your manuscript before it is submitted to any subsidy or POD publisher.

Within these pages unfolds the story of Hollywood star Margot Durning, her life, her love, her legacy!! I really couldn't stop reading this wonderful book! The skill with which Mr. Leonard has developed the story line will make you wonder if Margot Durning really didn't exsist! The heyday of Hollywood, with its glitz and shine is a sharp contrast to the stark beauty the reader finds about the panhandle of Northwest Oklahoma. This book would make an INCREDIBLE movie!! You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Forgotten Star","review":"I was quite excited to discover a book set in the area of the country where I grew up. When I saw the 5 star rating - I couldn't wait for the book to arrive. No words can truly express my disappointment with this book. Mr. Leonard's story has potential, but I had trouble following it due to all of the grammatical errors and typos. The storyline was a good one, but it was impossible to comprehend fully due to the poor editing job. Mr. Leonard might have writing skills, but his decision making skills when it comes to editing leads to the demise of this book. Margot Durning deserves better."},{"Title":"Ambush of the Mountain Man","review":"Don't read this book....unless you're prepared to read the ton of otherbooks in the \\"Smoke Jensen and Preacher\\" series. This author writes a bookbefore breakfast and another just before dinner. They're plentiful andhighly addictive. Suspend belief and enjoy.Smoke Jensen, in particular, shoots or fist fights around a hundredhard cases per book and they all highly deserve the mayhem he delivers.In spite of this high fiction (most famous old West gunfighters onlykilled 3 or 4 men in their entire lives) you'll soldier on with theseries because Smoke Jensen is the stuff heros are made of and thewriting is crisp and moving.Just don't say you weren't warned when you find that you spent your wholesummer (or winter) in a comfy chair with 50 or so of these read booksstrewn around you."},{"Title":"Ambush of the Mountain Man","review":"The book was excellent and so was the service - 0n time and error free.Good Job Vendor!Cheers,...

Their powerful stories touch on changing physical appearances, names, and accents in order to conform to the standards set by white dominance. Once you read this book it will open your eyes to the existing glass ceilings, the unspoken inequalities, and prejudices people are faced with on a daily basis. Through Voices of Pain Voices of Hope Dr. Jerome Rabow explores issues such as superiority amongst white dominance and the ideology of increasing your own value, and position at the expense of those from your won race, and others. His writing is both informative and powerful. Jerome Rabow sheds light on the issues America has been struggling with, and acknowledges the pain of those who have encountered racism. This by far is an exceptional book many can learn and benefit from."},{"Title":"Voices of Pain & Voices of Hope: Students Speak About Racism","review":"This book is hands down, one of the most amazing, inspirational books I've read in a long time. Many college students would benefit from reading this book. Rabow takes a look at institutionalized racism on one of the most premiere campuses in the United States: UCLA. Taken from the wordss of college students themselves, this book is revolutionary and should be read by everyone."},{"Title":"Voices of Pain & Voices of Hope: Students Speak About Racism","review":"This book is an amazing book, and it's filled with lots of good infomation on the class that it's based after along with the movie that has the same name.

The book is very touchy on provoking emotions from the reader. The published stories in the book are very eyeopening and realistic. Sender made the transaction easy to work with."},{"Title":"Voices of Pain & Voices of Hope: Students Speak About Racism","review":"I had the \\"opportunity\\" to take a \\"racism\\" class with Professor Fenelon (forwards page vii and iv) who uses this book as required text.The main theme of the book is that the dominant/privileged \\"white\\" (man usually) yields an ever growing paintbrush that he uses to mask the entire country with his racist dominance. Thus, no matter if you do not believe yourself to participate in some form of racist thinking, no matter your race, the white paint has already enveloped the country--and you as well. He indirectly makes the point that even races other than white use the white paintbrush to demote those who are different in their own race and other races on the hierarchical scale.The book also makes the point that the racist people who are described in the testimonies are actually the spokespersons for the rest of the \\"true white ideology,\\" or are they are the direct effect of corruption by the white ideology. Those who are not as vocal don't necessarily disagree with the comments and beliefs but are only silent because of fear of obtaining the title of \\"racist.\\"Frankly, the book is over the top. The testimonials are all very similar and (sorry if you don't believe me) exaggerated. Is there still racism in America--yes; has the government and the society been actively fighting against discriminatory actions--yes; will racism ever die out--no.The problem I have with this book is that it depicts the white race as being inherently evil. Where all the negative comments made by whites are evidence enough for labeling themselves as victims. There are numerous accounts depicting the dominant white run society negatively effecting children and students and spouses and parents and siblings.....No matter what way you turn it the white man is at fault for someones hurt feelings.The solutionTHe white man needs 1)to overcome denial 2)become aware of privilege 3) the minorities need to stop hating themselves 4) everyone needs to become aware of self involvement."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"There wasn't much of a plot. The author, used commas, just about, everywhere. Made it very difficult to read. It might have been avant-garde when it was introduced in the early 19th century but now, it's just a slow read where nothing happens."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"I read about halfway through this book, and then I gave up. I read James' &quot;Turn of the Screw,&quot; and &quot;Daisy Miller&quot; in high school, and I remember liking the former and thinking the latter was just okay. (I know, I know, it's a major classic by one of America's most celebrated writers, but just because something has merit doesn't mean I like it better.) One of my all time favorite books was James' &quot;Washington Square.&quot; It's hard for me to believe that the same man wrote &quot;Square&quot; and &quot;Maisie.&quot; This book is only for MAJOR Henry James enthusiasts."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"I'd read The Ambassadors, Portrait of a Lady, and a bunch of short stories - and I flipped through two introductions that said that this was perhaps one of James's most succesful works, so I picked it up.What I discovered is that those introduction writers are crazy. This book is incredibly boring. It is, of course, well-written, and there are no parts that I can identify as specifically bad - but it fails to live, it fails to arouse any interest. Despite a surprisingly lurid and eventful plot, with people changing partners all the time, none of the characters ever feel really THERE.Maybe it's because the adults are the genuine focus of the book, with Maisie just the hub around which they spin, and using her perspective was too limiting: James is best when he can fluidly illuminate the consciousness of one character after another, and there's only so much of that you can do through a child's eyes. We get the irony of knowing more about the corrupt adults around Maisie that she does, but this doesn't really allow for a full exploration of anyone.All of this would be tolerable if we at least had a sense of Maisie, if we had a real sense of being inside a child's mind. But the star of this book is by far the least convincing little girl in the history of literature. Which means that her perspective never feels real either. It sinks the whole book.I can't think of another great writer, actually, that would be less suited to depict the world of a child than James: immediacy, physicality, animality are the words that come to mind when I think of the way children live, and they're the last words I would associate with HJ. Tolstoy and Dickens are at one end of the spectrum and he's at another.Don't bother plowing through this one: pretty much everything else is better."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"I am not a Henry James fanatic, as a matter of fact, this is the first work of his that I have read, and with that I must say that this novel is horribly written and completely unrealistic in it's portrayal of the child, Maisie and especially her dialogue. I have been assigned to read this for an english class as an undergrad and I have tolerated many a badly executed idea...but never like this. Boring, boring, and more boring. And as a result, I am comnpletely turned off to James other works. I hear his other works are great.....read those first, you may fair better."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"This is so typical of H. James writing...very, make that incredibly, dense. Wordy beyond belief. At a pace that surely puts me fast asleep after a mere 2 pages. A ridiculous pair of uncaring parents essentially abandon their daughter to whomever comes along. As an amazing coincidence, the divorced parents each take a new spouse only to watch the wife of one have an affair with the husband of the other. If you are really into dialogue that no one has ever spoken in the history of English and willing to devote hours to really obscure language construction, this is the very winner for you."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"This is a brilliant writer at his best. The third person narrative from the child's viewpoint is heart breaking. The style is taut and tense."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"It's his style I can't get my arms around...conceptually interesting, but his writing here flows like a gutter clogged with leaves, only occasionally achieving the fluidity I look for in fine writing. I chose it because it was shorter than some of the more famous ones. Life is too short. I'll sell it back."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"The book opens with a vicious divorce between Beale and Ida Farange. From brief details given, it seemed like a circus of mud-slinging. And at the centre of it all is their little daughter, Maisie. The court decides that she is to split her time between her parents. Six months are spent with her mother; six months with her father. And, through all of this, both of her parents decide to use her as their own personal weapon. Sending her to the other parent with little \\"gems\\" and messages, Maisie cannot help being a carrier pigeon for her parents' continued hostility. As things progress, each of her parents remarry. And, from all appearances, her step-parents love her, care for her, and give her more love than either of her parents. However, being the people that they are, her parents decide to partake in adulterous affairs with other people, and, whether it is full intentional or not, they involve Maisie. All the while, her step-parents are drawn together out of their mutual love for the child. Instead of being an innocent child, Maisie is thrust into an adult world of intrigue, drama, and failed relationships.From the first page to the last, this book is heart rending! It appears as though Maisie was merely an accessory to her parents. She was constantly used as a way to send hurtful and damning messages to each parent, they wanted her as their own information gatherer, and so on. Every horrible thing you can imagine, her parents made her do. And, unless she had some juicy tidbit about the other parent, neither parent was interested in her company, and she was cast off to governesses. When her parents do speak with her concerning other things, she is subjected to horrible psychological abuse.Through all of this, Maisie is struggling with her position in the world, her family, and her role. While she loves Sir Claude and Mrs. Beale--and the idea of them being together--she wants her parents to want her and to be a part of their lives. At every turn, she is cast aside by the people who are supposed to love her the most. When each parent individually asks the child to come with them, it hurt to read that Maisie--in the maturity and knowledge gained from watching her parents' self-destructive and self-involved behavior--knew they didn't really want her but where just reassuring themselves that they did try to put on a show that they wanted her.Honestly, this book is extremely hard to discuss without giving everything away. Suffice it to say, this book obviously spans a number of years, and Maisie grows older as the story goes on. However, while James does not tell the specific passing of time, it is obvious in Maisie's widening of knowledge, her field of vision, and her ability to learn and manipulate the games being played around her that she is aging. While this book follows Maisie, it also seems to be a huge statement from James about parents refusing to take responsibility and the decay of the system of marriage and what people will do/sacrifice in order to keep themselves happy. At the centre of the whirlwind of her parents' divorce and multiple love affairs, Mrs. Wix's batty nature, and Sir Claude and Mrs. Beale's relationship, is a young girl who has been cast aside by her parents and desperately wants someplace, someone to belong to.The finally chapter of this book really brings home the reality that Maisie lives in. Furthermore, it also uses Mrs. Wix as James' mouthpiece to attack the behavior exhibited by both sets of parents and voice his feelings concerning the parental role. And, while I understand Maisie's final choice, I still find myself wishing that Sir Claude had been willing to do as the child had asked."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"Definitely a page turner. I feel that this book was wonderfully constructed by James. This story, told through the eyes of a young girl, really does show her growth. Maisie was a blank slate and was constantly lied to but in the end she attains knowledge that will hopefully benefit her future. Highly recommended and I'm sure you will enjoy another one of James' brilliant work!"},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"I was into Henry James, reading all his books. Not one of his best, but an interesting story any way."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"Doh! I meant Lolita. Well, I think that Maisie is a protyope for Lolita. She adapts to being shifted around by her parents and their various lovers by becoming something of a nymphette herself with Daddy Claude. This is a must read for all of us Nabakov fans. I'm quite sure he read it too."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"This is a well thought effort by James where he tries to introduce a symmetrical relationship between two divorces parents- who each try to use the daughter as a pawn - plus the new partners of each parent. There are four primary characters plus the daughter Maisie and an older housekeeper or nanny Mrs. Wix, and a few minor characters. The book is a bit like a play with a few characters and concentrates on their dialogue.The heart of the story is what does Maisie think of the situation and how does she deal with it. As a character is the information too sophisticated for her - or does the story fit with a girl such as Maisey.That is, can she as a character be expected to understand the situation?Obviously, Henry James put some thought into creating and writing the story and it has a certain mathematical symmetry. Saying that, the prose is sometimes a bit too complicated and the story lacks drama and passion.It is the sort of book that is easy to put down and it is not a page turner.Hence 4 stars."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"I don't regret having read this book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't already into Henry James. The style is hard to understand, apparently because it was dictated, and the subject matter is even more obscure. I don't think Henry James had much experience with children: even assuming that Maisie is twisted by her strange situation, she doesn't talk like any child I know or can imagine. Weird moral undercurrents and jealousy take up most, if not all, of the novel. I wouldn't take claims of this book's modernity too seriously - it's more on the byzantine side. Read The Europeans instead: so much more fun!"},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"Not a huge fan of Henry James. I have to read it for class. But the book came in perfect condition!"},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"Never mind the thickets of subordinate clauses. Henry James could look at ugly situations and use them as a means to explore human nature. Written about a century ago when divorce was rare, the novel deals with a little girl whose value to her appalling parents is as a weapon to use against each other. If that wasn't bad enough, nearly everyone who shows the child some kindness has a reason for doing so other than her welfare. What makes this other than pathetic is Maisie herself. She watches the adult's grim game of musical spouses with utter clarity. She may not understand everything she sees, but she is without illusions. She observes, she watches, she copes. Mrs Wix is appalled by Maisie's acceptance of her stepparent's adultery. What Mrs Wix doesn't understand is that Maisie has no conception of conventional morality. How could she? It certainly makes for an interesting protagonist. Maisie may be a strange little girl, but it is because she has lived a strange little life. Shs is more a miniature woman than a little girl because the twisted adults around her have stolen her childhood. In this, James was prophetic of what we have done to our children since he penned this novel at the dawn of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"What hubris to review a work by such a major novelist as Henry James, even though WHAT MAISIE KNEW may not be one of his major novels! All the same, a review can perhaps be useful in two regards: by commenting on this particular edition, and by suggesting how the novel might appeal to those familiar with other James works but not this one.The Penguin Classics paperback is crisply printed, comfortable in the hand, and well annotated. There is also an excellent essay by Paul Theroux. It gives too much away, I think, to be read as an introduction, but it does make a helpful afterword. If you do read the essay first, which is how it is printed, it may seem that Theroux has revealed virtually the entire plot, but in fact this is not so. James's narrative exposition is unusually swift in this book, and a lot happens very quickly, but his main interest lies in exploring the psychological depths of the situation that he has established; there is a distinct change of gear at roughly the halfway point of the book.As Theroux points out, the novel is generally considered a transitional work between James's earlier style and his later one. Theroux also locates this gear-change at the point where James ceased writing in longhand and started dictating his novels to a stenographer -- a crisis described so well by Colm Toibin in his biographical novel,THE MASTER. The first half of the book shows a leanness of style and also a great sense of humor not often associated with the author. But the book's premise is intrinsically comic: Maisie, a five-year-old girl, observes the doings of the adults around her as she is shipped from household to household in consequence of her parents' divorce, as the parents take lovers and remarry, and then as virtually everybody else in the story takes other lovers. The humor comes from the fact that while Maisie understands so little at first, the adult reader quickly picks up what is going on. The spider symmetries of the expanding web of sex make a formal pattern as clear and intricate as a dance, illuminated by James's dry wit and his beautiful ability to see through childish eyes.Several things change at the half-way point. Maisie becomes old enough to understand a little more. The adults whom she had previously observed from below now become more conscious of her as a potential ally and start using her unscrupulously to further their own ends. Twists of the plot which had at first seemed only amusing now appear as quite nasty turns of the screw, as Maisie's affections and loyalties are forced into the vise. Questions of morality come to the fore, and eventually dominate the action. The narrative tone also changes; although Maisie's knowledge and moral awareness develops considerably, James is forced into using his own voice to describe it, as though Maisie herself has lost the words to follow her own farewell to childhood.The reference above toTHE TURN OF THE SCREWis deliberate, for WHAT MAISIE KNEW (1897) seems almost like a preliminary draft for the more famous story, published in the following year. Yes, there are differences: this is comic rather than tragic, complicit rather than mysterious, and much less hermetic. The child heroine appears to come through with more wisdom and less trauma than the situation might have caused. But the final scene is astonishingly close to the ending of the later story: a struggle for control of a once-innocent child waged between a humble governess and two charismatic figures who exert a powerful hold both on the child and on each other. Only the ending is different, though no less worth waiting for."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"While this novel is a less popular work than some of the author's others, it should not be dismissed as a minor one. James' prose is refreshingly complex - a true balm in these illiterate times - and his narrative bears his distinctive creative style.Maisie is somewhat different in style from James' other works, but this is not a lapse in quality but rather a testament to his versatility as an author - he was not stuck in one particular mould. The choice of subject matter is fairly unique - I don't know of any other novels that deal with these topics in quite the same way. Social mores may have changed since James' time, but the way children are effected by such events remains the same. The story is narrated, but we see the events unfold through the child's eyes. The numerous dialogues between Maisie and her various adults portray brilliantly the veiled manner in which children are spoken to about 'inappropriate' subjects, and the vague scarcity of key details which a child should not be allowed to know is left to the reader to be unraveled. In this unraveling the reader is given a tangible sense of the child's confusion, her struggle to comprehend these unexplained happenings with her lack of definite information. It is James' intention that the reader should share in this confusion - that there should be some struggle to piece together what is occuring out of the direct line of sight. This helps to create a connection between the reader and the little heroine.Some criticize the novel for its consistantly dark tone - but this is hardly a basis on which to assign value to the work (or any work for that matter). Furthermore, what other tone could the novel have? This is after all an exploration of a group of supposed adults behaving very badly indeed towards a helpless child. The moral qualms are not all rooted in the Victorian age, many remain just as topical today as then - which is in itself quite an achievement."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"Everything in this novel evokes childhood's mysteries. It all seems to take place at knee or waist-level, with the brave Maisie (who &quot;throbs&quot; instead of speaks) attemtping to develop a moral code in the middle of a custody battle between parents who are less mature than she.A tough read, but give it time to weave its spell."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"I have not read any other James, except for Daisy Miller over 20 years ago, but picked this up on a friend's recommendation.Yes, you do have to read this book slower than most novels, but it is well worth it. It is a sharp, dark, and devastating satire on how adult use children. Each character that Maisie encounters uses her as a prop to meet their own emotional needs--any affection they give her is purely secondary.Perhaps many people do not like this book because it is so relentlessly dark. As the book goes on and Maisie is more and more aware of by the coldness around her the same behavior that makes the reader snicker in the first chapters becomes painful.If you are looking for a escapist period novel--skip this one. If you want something more probing--this is well worth picking up."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"WHAT MAISIE KNEW is probably the weirdest novel by Henry James. He had already written of seamy themes before this, but now he writes a variation of one of his favorite themes--that of the corruption of the innocent. Maisie is a young female child, perhaps six years old whose parents are getting divorced. In the best of situations divorce hits hard, and this was far from the best. Maisie's parents, Beale and Ida Farange are morally depraved and care not a whit for the welfare of their daughter. Maisie is a good-natured child who wants only to be loved by the parents she loves. Maisie is the prototypical Jamesian innocent about to be plunged into a maelstrom of decay.The terms of the divorce allow Maisie to live with each parent at six month intervals, and this she does. It is what she sees and happens to her that begin to cloud Maisie's moral universe. To begin with when she stays with her father, his friends paw her in ways that smack of sexual abuse. Maisie's mother, Ida, hires a governess, Miss Overmore, to care for Maisie. Soon enough Miss Overmore begins an affair with Maisie's father, Beale, ultimately marrying him. Ida follows suit by marrying her lover, Sir Claude. So now Maisie must adjust to a set of step parents. Claude's interest in his step-daughter verges on the incestuous--indeed later on when Maisie is thirteen, she outright propositions him. Ida hires a new governess, Mrs. Wix, to take the place of the erstwhile Miss Overmore. Mrs. Wix is a decent elderly woman who truly loves Maisie and tries to inculcate in her a moral center of goodness. This sense of goodness is put to the test immediately, when Maisie's remarried parents begin a new dance of musical lovers.As Maisie ages toward young girlhood, she shows signs that she has well learned the lessons of moral depravity that abound. She has no problem adjusting to a series of new adults zipping in and out of her life as parents, step parents, and lovers of parents. Maisie even makes it easy for these newcomers to pull the wool over the eyes of their cuckolded partners by making suggestions to facilitate what is by now a familiar routine or illicit romances. By the end of the novel, a thirteen year old Maisie desires Sir Claude as her own lover. Mrs. Wix, when she hears of this, angrily demands of Maisie what has happened to the sense of moral decorum that she thought was by now firmly instilled in Maisie. The answer, of course, is that the sense of propriety was doomed from the start since Maisie early on learned the difference between words of decorum and deeds of decorum. The Maisie at the end of WHAT MAZIE KNEW suggests that children--or adults for that matter--need a ongoing foundation of goodness to show that the ugliness they may see unfolding around them need not envelop them."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"I read this about 10 years ago, had to write a paper for it in college. I remember the first ~200 pages being excruciating, then the last 40 or so transforming the novel for me (for the positive). It's in the end where the themes really came together for me; it might not be a coincidence this is when Maisie really begins to emerge as an active character. Throughout the novel she passively absorbs the actions of her bourgeois parents, step-parents, their lovers, etc. Then, finally, she tries to apply what she understands, through the filter of her consciousness (and imagination), and becomes a participant in the intrigues and romances floating about her. She doesn't understand it's not her time; the object of her affections is cynical and weak, but not debauched, and in fact she is the aggressor. He tries to guide the burgeoning light of her consciousness as best he can. In the end I thought the novel was a lovely story about a child's encounter with the wall of possibility, the reconcilation of imagination with human limits."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"I think this is the most modern of Henry James' stories. Young Maisie's parents divorce and then seem to spend their lives using her to get a teach other, until they develop other interests. Sadly, the story resonates today - immature, self-centered parents and the children that they create. Henry James' insight into the life of such a child is brilliant."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"Henry James' 1907 WHAT MAISIE KNEW provides deep psychological insight into a young girl's predicament, as a result of her parents' bitter divorce in Edwardian England. Inspired by a friend's comments on the \\"shuttlecock\\" lifestyle of a divorced child in the vicious game of spousal revenge, this novel studies the harmful existence of an innocent victim of a joint custody dispute. Even at the tender age of seven, Maisie realizes the wisdom of playing dumb. Although she reports little back to the opposing sides, Maisie keenly observes and thoughtfully listens to all that occurs in both her uncomfortable biospheres. Eventually she adopts the simple policy of not telling--thus refusing to provide more fuel for animosity on either side.As in THE GOLDEN BOWL--a lengthy novel dealing with the marital and emotional battles among a very limited cast of characters--this shorter work could easily be adapted for the stage, as the chapters fall naturally into Scenes. James' protracted dialogues between Maisie and the impassioned adults who dispute her parenting rights would be delicious to dramatize, although readers would lose the private psychological depth as Maisie copes with increasingly new information. She reconciles her maturing lucid udnerstanding to the empowered adults in her universe with private schemes to protect one or the other parent and later, step-parent.These intense colloquies are designed both to elicit information re events which have occurred offstage, and to stir Maisie to the brink of definitive action--which will directly effect the five adults whom we assume are most interested in her welfare: Beale Farange, Ida Farange, Sir Claude, Miss Overton, and Mrs. Wix. Little Maisie unwittingly serves as a catalyst for adult passion, while she secretly exults in bringing her favorite people together. One of the great literary ironies of this novel springs from the unexpected separations which her warm-hearted meddling precipitates. To her childlike logic, being Free is the most desirable status for formerly married persons--free to love and marry whom they choose--free to make a cherished home for her and to ease their own heartache.Maisie is further isolated from children, even girls her own age; thus she is left to puzzle out the world using only her keen observation of adult interactions. But how can the lonely girl truly develop a sense of morality--at least by Edwardian standards? Is she herself Free to choose her new and permanent step-parents? Does she have the right to demand that the adults who love her make extreme sacrifices--just to retain her presence and loyalty? Does Maisie at 12 know what is best for herself? Which path will she ultimately choose? Her final decision will impact the lives of three far-from-blameless but well-meaning adults. Maise at 12 is too worldy-wise to indulge in Child's Play. This absorbing work is truly Vintage James."},{"Title":"What Maisie knew","review":"Although he never had children, James was interested in and had the skill to penetrate the infantile mind, sometimes in a very peculiar way, as in \\"The Turn of the Screw\\". \\"What Maisie Knew\\" depicts several years in the life of a girl, during and after the bitter and altogether farcical divorce of her parents. The initial agreement (each parent having her for six months), turns out to be a failure. The father is a merciless, egomaniac, philanderer and despicable man, who marries the girl's nanny, a woman of unrevealed intentions. The mother, after numerous adventures, marries a certain Sir Claude, a young man who develops a close relatinship of protection and sympathy with Maisie. But soon the mother is having other affairs. Far from her parents, Maisie grows basically with the new nanny, the old, ignorant, but kind Mrs. Wix, as well as with Sir Claude. After several plot twists, Sir Calude takes the girl to France (something that today would be a scandal and authorities would consider and international crime: abduction of a minor). But somehow, far from being distressed, the parents seem to be glad about getting rid of the child.This novel is, undoubtedyl, strange, and necessarily has to be narrated with a dark-humor undertone, as otherwise it would have to be a lacrimous soap opera. Maisie herself couldn't be other than a strange child, living a very odd life back when divorce and open adultery were rare and socially punished. Indeed, the novel sounds more like the story of, say, the child of a couple of Hollywood celebrities, who seem to be in trouble to remember the name of the person lying by their side most mornings. Maisie grows mature precociously, not so much out of comparison with other kids, but because, although clearly resenting the cold manipulation and bad treatment from her parents, she seems to think that life is like that. Not attending schol, she has practically no \\"normal\\" family around with which to contrast her situation. With certain naturality, she gets used to her changing circumstances, while contemplating from afar the odd behavior of adults.With he exception of Mrs. Wix and, at least in terms of his attitude towards Maisie, Sir Claude, the rest of the characters are monsters of egotism. Under current laws, they would deserve jail. And strangely, Maisie seems to traverse her life with no apparent signs of serious emotional damage.James's literature here is less convoluted and enigmatic than in other (major) pieces, but both dialogue and descriptions are characteristic of his singular style."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],W={key:0},q={key:1};function B(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",D,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",q,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",W,"See more"))],8,C)):p("",!0)])}const H=d(x,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-84e30afe"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/3.md","filePath":"library/3.md"}'),E={name:"library/3.md"},P=Object.assign(E,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(H)]))}});export{G as __pageData,P as default};
