Yet local lore has it that every Texan has two hometowns his own and San Antonio. The Alamo City's charm, colorful surroundings, and diverse cultures combine to make it one of the most interesting places in Texas and the nation. In San Antonio Uncovered, Mark Rybczyk examines some of the city's internationally known legends and lore (including ghost stories) and takes a nostalgic look at landmarks that have disappeared. He also introduces some of the city s characters and unusual features, debunks local myths, and corrects common misconceptions. Rybczyk embraces San Antonio's peculiarities by chronicling the cross-country journey of the World s Largest Boots to their home in front of North Star Mall; the origins of the Frito corn chip and chewing gum; the annual Cornyation of King Anchovy; and Dwight Eisenhower's stint as the football coach at St Mary s University. This completely updated, new edition of San Antonio Uncovered highlights San Antonio as a modern, thriving city with the feel of a small town that sees beauty in the old and fights to save it, even something as seemingly insignificant as an old Humble Oil Station; and its diverse inhabitants as those who appreciate the blending of the old and the new at the Tobin Center and fight to save what s left of the Hot Wells Hotel.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Web_DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Armageddon Or the United States in Prophecy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CLbdtwEACAAJ&dq=Armageddon+Or+the+United+States+in+Prophecy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doll/The","description":"A young girl and her family arrive in an airport in a new country.

In this book, David Delaney explores the historical intersections of race, place, and the law. Drawing on court cases spanning more than a century, he examines the moves and countermoves of attorneys and judges who participated in the geopolitics of slavery and emancipation; in the development of Jim Crow segregation, which effectively created apartheid laws in many cities; and in debates over the \\"doctrine of changed conditions,\\" which challenged the legality of restrictive covenants and private contracts designed to exclude people of color from white neighborhoods.

As a result, the long-marginalized, innermost feelings, needs, and worldviews of Mexico's ten to twenty million indigenous peoples are now being widely revealed to the Western societies with which these peoples coexist. To contribute to this process and serve as a bridge of intercultural communication and understanding, this groundbreaking, three-volume anthology gathers works by the leading generation of writers in thirteen Mexican indigenous languages: Nahuatl, Maya, Tzotzil, Tzeltal, Tojolabal, Tabasco Chontal, Purepecha, Sierra Zapoteco, Isthmus Zapoteco, Mazateco, ?ah?u, Totonaco, and Huichol. Volume Three contains plays by six Mexican indigenous writers. Their plays appear first in their native language, followed by English and Spanish translations. Montemayor and Frischmann have abundantly annotated the Spanish, English, and indigenous-language texts and added glossaries and essays that introduce the work of each playwright and discuss the role of theater within indigenous communities. These supporting materials make the anthology especially accessible and interesting for nonspecialist readers seeking a greater understanding of Mexico's indigenous peoples.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QfYAS_FSyYQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Punch Out The President (and Pals)!","description":"I think if you know what you believe, it makes it a lot easier to answer questions. I can't answer your question.\\" --George W. Bush, October 4, 2000 Have you ever wondered what it would have been like to party with George W. during his freewheeling frat days at Yale? Have you ever noticed the eerie similarities between Vice President Cheney and Austin Powers' Dr. Evil? Have you ever wondered what it would be like to cast Donald Rumsfeld in the role of a chickenhawk-like superhero? Well, wonder no more! With the Punch Out the President! (and Pals) paper doll set, you can experience these playtime scenarios and many, many more! Punch Out the President! includes four honest-to-goodness (okay, perhaps that's not the most appropriate phrase in this case) ten-inch-tall, perforated paper dolls including George W., Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and the ever-animated Attorney General John Ashcroft. (Be warned, readers of faint heart, the dolls-Cheney included-come clad only in their skivvies!) Along with the four horsemen of the ridiculous, the set includes 16 outfits (four for each doll) and loads of clever accessories. Dick Cheney as a long-haired, tree-hugging neo-hippie? Why not?! Rummy as Beat Poet in beret and black turtleneck sweater? Sure! Ashcroft as a dandy art critic? Of course. After all, these outfits are no more ridiculous than the Commander in Chief decked out in his infamous flight suit, right? The possibilities are enormous-and the outfits are hilarious. The emperor may have no clothes, but these guys have closets so full there's hardly any room for the skeletons. And unlike most things in Washington, this play set really works! The outfits and accessories attach to the dolls with fold-down tabs just like the ones we played with as kids. Adding to all this fun is insightful (or more properly, incite-ful) commentary for each outfit, outrageous-but-true quotes, clever quizzes and games, and plenty of other surprises along the way. All-in-all, Punch Out the President is a true and fitting tribute to the D.C. boys club.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kR8UyVwIWmwC&dq=Punch+Out+The+President+(and+Pals)!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sacrifice","description":"The shocking and affecting memoir from a gold-star widow searching for the truth behind her Green Beret husband's death, this book bears witness to the true sacrifices made by military families. When Green Beret Bryan Black was killed in an ambush in Niger in 2017, his wife Michelle saw her worst nightmare become a reality. She was left alone with her grief and with two young sons to raise. But what followed Bryan's death was an even more difficult journey for the young widow. After receiving very few details about the attack that took her husband's life, it was up to Michelle to find answers. It became her mission to learn the truth about that day in Niger--and Sacrifice is the result of that mission. In this heartbreaking and revelatory memoir, Michelle uses exclusive interviews with the survivors of her husband's unit, research into the military leadership and accountability, and her own unique vantage point as a gold-star widow to tell a previously unknown story. Sacrifice is both an honest, emotional look inside a military marriage and a searing investigation of the people and decisions at the heart of the US military.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NixdEAAAQBAJ&dq=Sacrifice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Take the war to Washington","description":"An in-depth account of the Civil War people and events that left their mark on the city at the heart of the Union, shaping its historic legacy.

In this \\"orbit of danger,\\" where rugged space frontiersmen risked their necks in a sea of swirling rock, teen-age Peter Clay and his father were faced with the possibility of having their small claim to Asteroid mining rights wiped out. In the shaky system of justice that had grown up between Mars and Jupiter to protect the individual miner, the Ama (Asteroid Miners' Association) played an important part. It policed the Belt, spotted claim jumpers and was expected to aid any individual unlucky enough to get lost or disabled. When events led the Clays to suspect the Ama of invalidating claims for criminal purposes, they could only look to themselves and the sketchy Martian-sponsored government for help. From the moment the Clays heard a miner signaling for help from a tiny asteroid until they, with a group of honest men and women, band together to protect their claim from the Ama's marauding ships, action and suspense color every page of this unusual story. How Peter Clay unraveled a maze of false clues; his narrow brush with desperate men who had a mining empire within their grasp; the details of life on the Asteroid frontier create, in MYSTERY OF THE THIRD MINE, a vivid world of drama and danger unique in the annals of science fiction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iqmKDAEACAAJ&dq=Mystery+of+the+third+mine+(A+Science+fiction+novel)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TWENTY THREE YEARS: STUDY OF THE PROPHETIC CAREER OF MUHAMMAD","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Admiral Harold R.

But sometimes she wishes she had died, because the lightning strike left her with an unusual talent: she can find dead people - and that's not always comfortable. Everyone wants to know how she does it: it's a little like hearing a bee droning inside her head, or maybe the pop of a Geiger counter, a persistent, irregular noise that increases in strength as she gets closer. It's almost electric: a buzzing all through her body, and the fresher the corpse, the more intense the buzz. Harper and her brother Tolliver make their living from finding the dead, for desperate parents, worried friends ... and police departments who have nowhere else to look. They may not believe in her abilities, but sometimes the proof is just too much for even the most sceptical of police chiefs to deny. But it's not always easy for someone like Harper, for the dead *want* to be found - and too often, finding the body doesn't bring closure; it opens a whole new can of worms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w-wN3kdRltMC&dq=Grave+Sight+(Harper+Connelly+Mysteries,+Book+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Kissing Golf: The Keep It Simple (Stupid) Instructional Method","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yCeqPAAACAAJ&dq=Kissing+Golf:+The+Keep+It+Simple+(Stupid)+Instructional+Method&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poor people, (The Modern library of the world's best books)","description":"With their call for \\"simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! , for self-honesty, and for harmony with nature, the writings of Henry David Thoreau are perhaps the most influential philosophical works in all American literature.

Written almost thirty years later, Brave New World Revisited is a re-evaluation of his predictions based on the changes he had witnessed in the meantime. In this twelve-part essay, Huxley argues that society is moving toward his dystopian vision even faster than he had originally assumed, and provides his own suggestions on how to bring an end to this decadent decline. Brave New World Revisited condemns symptoms of modern life such as overpopulation, propaganda and extreme government control while providing a staunch defence of individualism. Despite being published over fifty years ago, the problems identified in Brave New World Revisited are still startlingly relevant, lending a chilling creditability to Aldous Huxley s unsettling predictions.

We are born face readers knowing to seek out human features and faces from the moment our eyes open. We all have the intuitive ability to read and interpret the feelings and expressions of those around us. In Read the Face, master face reader Eric Standop unlocks the power of this innate human ability, sharing his own journey to become a face reading master, along with stories that illustrate the power of this unique language. Using a combination of three different schools of face reading, along with a scientific accuracy to detect the most fleeting microexpressions, Standop is able to read personality, character, emotions, and even the state of a person s health all from simply glancing at their face. The book is divided into sections focusing on specific ways that face reading can offer insight, such as Health, Love, Communication, Work and Success. The stories are accompanied by detailed black and white illustrations of faces, allowing readers to observe the same features that Standop interpreted. The final section of the book outlines the meanings of dozens of facial features and face shapes, so that readers can recognize their own innate intuitive powers and develop them. Read the Face is a guide to using the ancient art and science of face reading to go beyond the surface and create the boldest life possible.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UNKJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Map of Misreading (Galaxy Books, 623)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ln0KAQAAMAAJ&dq=A+Map+of+Misreading+(Galaxy+Books,+623)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simplicity: Finding Peace by Uncluttering Your Life","description":"\\" ...

His radically new approach to the foundations of arithmetic, based on fresh definitions of the terms 'zero', 'one' and 'successor', revolutionized our understanding of mathematics. And his important insights into the nature of language and meaning provided the framework for Russell, Wittgenstein and twentieth-century linguistic analysis. In this superb survey of his evolving ideas, Anthony Kenny explains and assesses the full range of Frege's work and reveals why it still forms an ideal introduction to modern analytic philosophy. Even after seventy years, he concludes, Frege remains an absolutely central figure, one of those rare thinkers who wrote 'prose which is accessible and attractive on first acquaintance and yet which repays rereading over a lifetime'.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

The kernel is Linux--in the case of the Linux operating system, it's the only bit of software to which the term \\"Linux\\" applies. The kernel handles all the requests or completed I/O operations and determines which programs will share its processing time, and in what order. Responsible for the sophisticated memory management of the whole system, the Linux kernel is the force behind the legendary Linux efficiency. The new edition of Understanding the Linux Kernel takes you on a guided tour through the most significant data structures, many algorithms, and programming tricks used in the kernel. Probing beyond the superficial features, the authors offer valuable insights to people who want to know how things really work inside their machine. Relevant segments of code are dissected and discussed line by line. The book covers more than just the functioning of the code, it explains the theoretical underpinnings for why Linux does things the way it does. The new edition of the book has been updated to cover version 2.4 of the kernel, which is quite different from version 2.2: the virtual memory system is entirely new, support for multiprocessor systems is improved, and whole new classes of hardware devices have been added. The authors explore each new feature in detail. Other topics in the book include: Memory management including file buffering, process swapping, and Direct memory Access (DMA) The Virtual Filesystem and the Second Extended Filesystem Process creation and scheduling Signals, interrupts, and the essential interfaces to device drivers Timing Synchronization in the kernel Interprocess Communication (IPC) Program execution Understanding the Linux Kernel, Second Edition will acquaint you with all the inner workings of Linux, but is more than just an academic exercise. You'll learn what conditions bring out Linux's best performance, and you'll see how it meets the challenge of providing good system response during process scheduling, file access, and memory management in a wide variety of environments. If knowledge is power, then this book will help you make the most of your Linux system.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9yIEji1UheIC&dq=Understanding+the+Linux+Kernel+(2nd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SECOND TO NONE : A pictorial history of Hornchurch Aerodrome through two world wars and beyond, 1915 - 1962","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ulz0jgEACAAJ&dq=SECOND+TO+NONE+:+A+pictorial+history+of+Hornchurch+Aerodrome+through+two+world+wars+and+beyond,+1915+-+1962&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins","description":"A Secret So Colossal It Will Decide Who Wins the War...May, 1944: The world holds its breath as the Allies prepare to launch their all-important invasion of Europe.

Fortunately, Frank gets over himself, the weather clears up, Scotty's dealer, Misha, delivers the goods, and the boys are off to the races. And that's when the real fun begins. After a night of partying, they come home to find the cops waiting for them. Misha has apparently been murdered and guess who was the last person to see him alive? Turns out his wheeling and dealing had gotten him in trouble with a lot of people--including the Russian mob. And those guys don't play around. Suddenly, Scotty's missing not just one but two boyfriends. And as the streets of Nola come alive in a hot human frenzy of sequins, music, dancing, and the sweat of thousands of revelers ready to throw caution and clothing to the wind, Scotty is in a desperate race to save the men he sometimes loves and keep Fat Tuesday from being the last day any of them ever see. . . \\"When Herren introduced young, well-muscled former New Orleans bar dancer Scotty Bradley, he gave crime fiction one of its most engaging gay heroes.\\" --Booklist Greg Herren is a personal trainer and writer who calls New Orleans home.

It has remained in print for over seventy years. Five years later, Barker published his own account of their affair in the novel The Dead Seagull.

Paranormal superstar and internationally bestselling author Kelley Armstrong's second Otherworld omnibus includes Dime Store Magic and Industrial Magic, along with two short stories, Wedding Bell Hell & Case of the Half-Demon Spy. DIME STORE MAGIC: Paige Winterbourne was always either too young or too rebellious to succeed her mother as leader of one of the world's most powerful elite organizations--the American Coven of Witches. Now that she is twenty-three and her mother is dead, the Elders can no longer deny her. But even Paige's wildest antics can't hold a candle to those of her new charge--an orphan who is all too willing to use her budding powers for evil...and evil is all too willing to claim her. It's an initiation into adulthood, womanhood, and the brutal side of magic that Paige will have to do everything within her power to make sure they both survive. INDUSTRIAL MAGIC: Paige broke with the elite, ultraconservative American Coven of Witches and her goal is to start a new Coven for a new generation. But while she pitches her vision to uptight thirty-something witches in business suits, a more urgent matter commands her attention: someone is murdering the teenage offspring of the underworld's most influential Cabals--a circle of families that makes the mob look like amateurs. WEDDING BELL HELL: This story picks up three weeks before Paige and Lucas get married--and if you thought planning a wedding was complicated as a mere human, imagine being a witch marrying a sorcerer. CASE OF THE HALF-DEMON SPY: This story takes place when Paige and Adam were still in their early teens. Bored after being told to wait outside at a Council Meeting, they try to pass the time eavesdropping...until a stranger turns up, turns out to be an Exaudio demon, and things get really serious.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ss-13B6S9xUC&dq=Savannah+Spell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Survive the Night","description":"THE INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER One of New York Times Book Review's \\"summer reads guaranteed to make your heart thump and your skin crawl\\"; An Amazon Best of the Month Pick; Named a must-read summer book by The Washington Post, USA Today, Vulture, BuzzFeed, Forbes, Entertainment Weekly, CNN, New York Post, Good Housekeeping, E!, PopSugar, CrimeReads, Thrillist, and BookRiot. It s November 1991. Nirvana's in the tape deck, George H. W. Bush is in the White House, and movie-obsessed college student Charlie Jordan is in a car with a man who might be a serial killer. Josh Baxter, the man behind the wheel, is a virtual stranger to Charlie. They met at the campus ride board, each looking to share the long drive home to Ohio. Both have good reasons for wanting to get away. For Charlie, it s guilt and grief over the shocking murder of her best friend, who became the third victim of the man known as the Campus Killer. For Josh, it s to help care for his sick father or so he says. The longer she sits in the passenger seat, the more Charlie notices there s something suspicious about Josh, from the holes in his story about his father to how he doesn t want her to see inside the trunk. As they travel an empty, twisty highway in the dead of night, an increasingly anxious Charlie begins to think she s sharing a car with the Campus Killer. Is Josh truly dangerous? Or is Charlie s jittery mistrust merely a figment of her movie-fueled imagination? One thing is certain Charlie has nowhere to run and no way to call for help. Trapped in a terrifying game of cat and mouse played out on pitch-black roads and in neon-lit parking lots, Charlie knows the only way to win is to survive the night.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mvtvEAAAQBAJ&dq=Survive+the+Night&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Killer Clown of King's County (Bone Chillers)","description":"Clowns aren't kid stuff anymore when they make things disappear into thin air.

In some ways, it is the perfect introduction to Misess thought, a collection of hundreds of attention grabbing quotations that provide a fast and accessible presentation of the range of his ideas. The content is Mises in a way that you have never encountered him before: pithy words arranged subject by subject. Each page exudes energy and wisdom. After we sent it to Bettina Bien Greaves, she wrote us to say: \\"A thrilling project, a thorough job, and a marvelous result. The Quotable Mises performs a great service.\\" Just consider these quotations from Mises that are included: The issue is always the same: the government or the market. There is no third solution. If history could teach us anything, it would be that private property is inextricably linked with civilization. What distinguishes civilized man from a barbarian must be acquired by every individual a new. Go into the home of the average American family and you will see for whom the wheels of the machines are turning. Those who are asking for more government interference are asking ultimately for more compulsion and less freedom. Governments become liberal only when forced to by the citizens. Both force and money are impotent against ideas. The comparatively greater prosperity of the United States is an outcome of the fact that the New Deal did not come in 1900 or 1910, but only in 1933. The worst and most dangerous form of absolutist rule is that of an intolerant majority. War prosperity is like the prosperity that an earthquake or a plague brings. The earthquake means good business for construction workers, and cholera improves the business of physicians, pharmacists, and undertakers, but no one has for that reason yet sought to celebrate earthquakes and cholera as stimulators of the productive forces in the general interest. Economics deals with real man, weak and subject to error as he is, not with ideal beings omniscient and perfect as only gods could be. The biggest struggle in putting the book together was not in finding enough quotes but in limiting the number. The editor tried to provide a representative list of topics and subjects that Mises is most famous for, such as socialism, bureaucracy, interventionism, money, government, and war. But he also included many subject areas for which Mises is not often quoted, including arts, fate, health, instinct, martyrdom, religion, and youth. Most economists dont write enough memorable material in an entire lifetime to fill 20 pages. But Mises was different. He was brilliant, brave, and tenacious. He could also write. He wanted to reach all people, not just specialists. This serves as an introduction and guide to his thought, or even a kind of concordance, all in his own words. Mostly it is a means for putting Misess ideas in even greater circulation. After all it was Mises who said: \\"In the long run even the most despotic governments with all their brutality and cruelty are no match for ideas. Eventually the ideology that has won the support of the majority will prevail and cut the ground from under the tyrants feet. Then the oppressed many will rise in rebellion and overthrow their masters.\\" This is the Mises book for Everyman, for yourself and every thoughtful man and woman you know.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5QW6oAEACAAJ&dq=The+Quotable+Mises&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Basic Italian","description":"This language-learning system offers the chance to quickly and efficiently develop the practical Italian needed for travel. 2 CDs with 90 minutes of material feature phrases and sentences spoken first in English and then in Italian, followed by a pause for repetition.

There is therefore nobody better to compile a reference atlas of the clinical anatomy of the foot, pastern and fetlock, correlated with images obtained by radiography, diagnostic ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Advanced imaging techniques require in depth knowledge of anatomy for accurate interpretation and especially when using magnetic resonance imaging this must be a 3-dimensional concept of anatomy. This book provides a unique contribution and is an invaluable reference text. The image quality is extraordinarily high and the multiple views of each area of the distal limb provide an extremely detailed evaluation. Each part opens with a characteristically superb anatomical drawing by the author. Each spread of pages deals with a single dissection viewed by means of colour photographs, labelled black and white equivalents, plus x-rays, ultrasound and MRI scans as required.

Under Commodore Edward Preble, the Navy came of age fighting the scourge of the time, the infamous Barbary Pirates. Intrepid Sailors chronicles the Navy s campaign to subdue the pirate leader of Tripoli, who declared war on the United States in 1801. After two failed campaigns, Preble took command of the U.S. squadron in the Mediterranean and served notice to world the U.S. Navy would be a force with which to reckon. Among the ships in Preble s flotilla was a non-descript little ketch. Once a French supply boat, the ketch served Tripoli until the U.S. squadron captured her in 1803. Upon her capture, Preble incorporated the little boat into his force, re-naming her the Intrepid. She was the first ship in the United States Navy to bear the name of Intrepid and would play a central role in some of the primary feats of  Preble s Boys.  The exploits of the officers and sailors in this campaign are the stuff of legend. In culling myth from fact, Reid went back to original sources, using the words of the men in the campaign to tell their story. Whether it is Decatur leading the daring raid to burn the captured frigate Philadelphia or the escape attempts of American prisoners in Tripoli, Intrepid Sailors brings to life a story many Americans once widely knew but that today has become little more than footnote. Unlike other books on the topic, however, Intrepid Sailors delves into the development of officers and sailors under Preble. Most were half the age of their commander and few had major combat experience. Under Preble, these men forged a legacy of professionalism to which the Navy still adheres. The book also examines one of the most famous friendships in American and Navy history  that of Decatur and Somers. Their thirst for glory and utter devotion to making the U.S. Navy a permanent, respected force inspired all around them but that quest for immortality never caused a breach in their friendship. Instead, that friendship grew stronger, providing even more inspiration. Intrepid Sailors offers a rare insight into the lives of men who today loom larger-than-life and who continue to inspire each new class of naval officer. Stephen Decatur, Richard Somers, Charles Stewart, James Lawrence, Edward Preble and a pantheon of early U.S. Navy heroes all come to life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DfzFh1VNtugC&dq=Intrepid+Coitions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great Spy Race","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rZ8BzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Great+Spy+Race&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Night Moves","description":"Written in taut, mesmerizing, often hilarious scenes drawn from 2004 through 2009, Night Moves captures the fierce friendships and small moments that form us all.

In Read the Face, master face reader Eric Standop unlocks the power of this innate human ability, sharing his own journey to become a face reading master, along with stories that illustrate the power of this unique language. Using a combination of three different schools of face reading, along with a scientific accuracy to detect the most fleeting microexpressions, Standop is able to read personality, character, emotions, and even the state of a person s health all from simply glancing at their face. The book is divided into sections focusing on specific ways that face reading can offer insight, such as Health, Love, Communication, Work and Success. The stories are accompanied by detailed black and white illustrations of faces, allowing readers to observe the same features that Standop interpreted. The final section of the book outlines the meanings of dozens of facial features and face shapes, so that readers can recognize their own innate intuitive powers and develop them.

Why terror at her election? Because that will launch the country toward a totalitarian government. We no longer can believe that our elected officials are patriots. They are more acclimated to power and less concerned about the people and the country's history. The book is a departure from the others. It came to mind when watching a TV discussion group talking about whether Hillary would run for President in 2004. I was terrified that she would run and win. I then thought about it and decided I had some excellent reasons why she would not run in 2004 but would wait until 2008. The book goes into depth concerning the dangers to the Country of electing Hillary. My first three books: There Are No Bad Kids, \\"Never Underestimate the Arrogance or Stupidity of Government and High On Life were all published by 1st Books Library. The first was written as a result of a traumatic experience in our lives and the second describes what I believe created that trauma. \\"High On Life\\" creates a completely different atmosphere.

Teachers have the power to shape lives, and in turn, shape the world where we live, as the famous thinkers in this fascinating collection will attest. Author Randy Howe gathered quotations from poets, writers, politicians, scholars, and many others -teachers all-to help put into words the many unspoken thoughts and emotions that his profession evokes. A good teacher is a passionate teacher, writes Howe, and teaching is an art form. With reflections from everyone from Aesop to Martin Luther King, Jr., and Margaret Mead to Barbara Kingsolver, these inspirational and informative words of wisdom discuss everything from the importance of teaching and learning, to the need to think outside the box, to dealing with discipline and classroom management. By turns thought-provoking and laughter-invoking, this collection should be on the bookshelf of every teacher, young and old alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qKifKDLZeiMC&dq=The+Quotable+Teacher&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Ice Man (Frozen in Time, Group 1)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Most Passionate Revenge (Presents Passion) (Presents, 2137)","description":"Cover -- Half-title -- Title -- Copyright -- Dedication -- Contents -- Preface -- 1 Youth and Media -- 2 Then and Now -- 3 Themes and Theoretical Perspectives -- 4 Infants, Toddlers, and Preschoolers -- 5 Children -- 6 Adolescents -- 7 Media and Violence -- 8 Media and Emotions -- 9 Advertising and Commercialism -- 10 Media and Sex -- 11 Media and Education -- 12 Digital Games -- 13 Social Media -- 14 Media and Parenting -- 15 The End -- Notes -- Acknowledgments -- Index -- A -- B -- C -- D -- E -- F -- G -- H -- I -- J -- K -- L -- M -- N -- O -- P -- Q -- R -- S -- T -- U -- V -- W -- X -- Y -- Z","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AkuRDgAAQBAJ&dq=Most+Passionate+Revenge+(Presents+Passion)+(Presents,+2137)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conversation: How Talk Can Change Our Lives","description":"Approaches the subject of conversation in a sophisticated, thought-provoking manner, explaining what kind of talk charmed and excited people in the past, why conversation is different today and what it could be like in the future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_1D0wAEACAAJ&dq=Conversation:+How+Talk+Can+Change+Our+Lives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","description":"A lot has happened in the world of digital design since the first edition of this title was published, but one thing remains true: There is an ever-growing number of people attempting to design everything from newsletters to advertisements with no formal training.

A new set of rules took its place laws that could only be called magic. Ninety-nine percent of humanity has simply vanished. Cities lie abandoned.

He wanders the southeastern United States, scavenging, lying low. Learning. One day he makes an unexpected friend: a smartassed unicorn with serious attitude.

Drawing on contemporary documents, personal interviews, memoirs, and a vast quantity of new material, Stanley Kutler shows how President Nixon s obstruction of justice from the White House capped a pattern of abuse that marked his entire tenure in office. He makes clear how the drama of Watergate is rooted not only in the tumultuous events and social tensions of the 1960s but also in the personality and history of Richard Nixon. Kutler examines Nixon s confrontations with the institutions he feared and resented the Congress, the federal agencies, the news media, the Washington establishment and how they mobilized to topple the President. He considers the arguments of Nixon s defenders, who insisted that Watergate was a minor affair, and the contention that the President did nothing worse than his predecessors had done. He offers compelling portraits of the President s men H. R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, John Mitchell, Charles Colson, John Dean; of his adversaries Judge John Sirica, the U.S. Attorneys, Special Prosecutors Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski; and of the legislators who would stand in judgment Sam Ervin and Peter Rodino. In the course of his engrossing narrative, Stanley Kutler illuminates the constitutional crisis brought on by Watergate. He shows how Watergate diminished the moral level of American political life, and illustrates its continuing detrimental impact on the credibility, authority, and prestige of the Presidency in particular and the government in general. His book underlines for the American electorate the significance of Watergate for the future of our political ethics and the maintenance of our constitutional system, as well as for the place of Richard Nixon in American history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TQw5AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quizzical Look at the Rock Era","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YZjvAAAACAAJ&dq=Quizzical+Look+at+the+Rock+Era&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Angel of Terror","description":" Angel of Terror  is a tale of the femme fatale, a vast family fortune and the lengths people will go for money.

This book explores the wide variety of maternal effects that have evolved in plants and animals as mechanisms of adaptation to temporally and spatially heterogeneous environments. Topics range from the evolutionary implications of maternal effects to the assessment and measurement of maternal effects. Four detailed case studies are also included.

Griffith's The Battle for Guadalcanal. Launched on August 7, 1942, to protect Allied control of the strategic South Pacific islands, the Guadalcanal operation was the most costly American offensive of World War II in the history of the U.S. Navy up to that time. Griffith, who fought with Edson's Raiders on Guadalcanal, describes in gritty detail the vicious close-range fighting, the valiant defense of the Henderson Field airstrip, and the dramatic naval engagements that led, in February 1943, to an American victory. Drawing on American and Japanese sources, Griffith delineates the strategic decisions that shaped the conflict as well as the determination and endurance of combatants on both sides. A breathtaking narrative of military action anchored by a historian's objectivity, The Battle for Guadalcanal is a story of raw courage, desperate measures, and ultimate triumph.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q4L7QjcnzJkC&dq=Fighting+on+Guadalcanal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Follow That Blonde","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Revolution 1776","description":"The successful 1776 revolt against British rule in North America has been hailed almost universally as a great step forward for humanity. But the Africans then living in the colonies overwhelmingly sided with the British. In this trailblazing book, Gerald Horne shows that in the prelude to 1776, the abolition of slavery seemed all but inevitable in London, delighting Africans as much as it outraged slaveholders, and sparking the colonial revolt. Prior to 1776, anti-slavery sentiments were deepening throughout Britain and in the Caribbean, rebellious Africans were in revolt. For European colonists in America, the major threat to their security was a foreign invasion combined with an insurrection of the enslaved. It was a real and threatening possibility that London would impose abolition throughout the colonies a possibility the founding fathers feared would bring slave rebellions to their shores. To forestall it, they went to war. The so-called Revolutionary War, Horne writes, was in part a counter-revolution, a conservative movement that the founding fathers fought in order to preserve their right to enslave others. The Counter-Revolution of 1776 brings us to a radical new understanding of the traditional heroic creation myth of the United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NYjtCwAAQBAJ&dq=Revolution+1776&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Field Guide to Mushrooms","description":"Covers 725 species, with full-color photographs, descriptions, identification keys, notes on folklore, and advice on edibility","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tsTbzYxTGcsC&dq=The+Field+Guide+to+Mushrooms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sGI1AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Rake's Journey","description":"Gwyneth swooned and then she slapped Major Giles Fitzalen-Hill.

The theory, which has immediate hardware applications, also concerns highly abstractmathematical concepts. This text explains the basic circuits in a refreshingly practical way thatwill appeal to undergraduate electrical engineering students as well as to engineers and techniciansworking in industry.Arazi's truly commonsense approach provides a solid grounding in the subject,explaining principles intuitively from a hardware perspective. He fully covers error correctiontechniques, from basic parity check and single error correction cyclic codes to burst errorcorrecting codes and convolutional codes. All this he presents before introducing Galois fieldtheory - the basic algebraic treatment and theoretical basis of the subject, which usually appearsin the opening chapters of standard textbooks. One entire chapter is devoted to specific practicalissues, such as Reed-Solomon codes (used in compact disc equipment), and maximum length sequences(used in various fields of communications). The basic circuits explained throughout the book areredrawn and analyzed from a theoretical point of view for readers who are interested in tackling themathematics at a more advanced level.Benjamin Arazi is an Associate Professor in the Department ofElectrical and Computer Engineering at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.

R.A.V. Ollman. Hustler-Falwell. Reno-ACLU. Nebraska Press Association. These names are synonymous with contemporary First Amendment litigation. To explore these landmark cases more deeply, author Joseph Russomanno interviewed the people at the core of these and other influential First Amendment cases, and he presents their stories here in a personal, in-depth oral history of First Amendment law. Previously unavailable in other literature, these stories go beyond the \\"what\\" of the cases and answer the \\"why\\" and \\"how\\" of ten major cases from the latter part of the 20th century. Through their own words and photographs, plaintiffs, defendants, and their attorneys describe what it was like to be involved in the development of these historic First Amendment cases. The issues addressed in these landmark cases cover crucial aspects of the First Amendment: freedom of expression, hate speech, libel, privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, promises of confidentiality to news sources, free press-fair trial, commercial speech, broadcast and cable television regulation, and new media. These narratives recount the events that initiated the court cases and follow the lead players through the various stages of the U.S. legal system. Excerpts of the court decisions are included at the conclusion of each chapter, and sidebars explain key terms, issues, and names that come up in the process. The cases highlighted here were often difficult and controversial--cases which, on their surface, raise questions about both the participants and their lawyers. A cross burner and a pornographer ask to be protected by the First Amendment; a measure intended to protect children from exposure to lewd content on the Internet is questioned. Through the words of the participants in these cases, the meaning, depth, and reach of the First Amendment becomes clear and demonstrates how the law functions to protect the rights of all individuals. This unique chronicle will appeal to those studying First Amendment law, including mass communication, law, journalism, and political science scholars, and to lawyers, journalists, and political scientists with an interest in this area. The volume is also intended to serve as a supplemental text in a mass communication law course or as a text in advanced First Amendment theory course and political science courses exploring the law, decisions, and processes of the U. S. Supreme Court.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S54AAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","description":"An abandoned Southwark warehouse burns next door to a women's shelter for victims of spousal abuse.

Now it promises to captivate audiences around the globe. Ikal is a student at the poorest village school on the Indonesian island of Belitong, where graduating from sixth grade is considered a remarkable achievement. His school is under constant threat of closure. In fact, Ikal and his friends a group nicknamed the Rainbow Troops face threats from every angle: skeptical government officials, greedy corporations hardly distinguishable from the colonialism they've replaced, deepening poverty and crumbling infrastructure, and their own low self-confidence. But the students also have hope, which comes in the form of two extraordinary teachers, and Ikal's education in and out of the classroom is an uplifting one. We root for him and his friends as they defy the island's powerful tin mine officials. We meet his first love, the unseen girl who sells chalk from behind a shop screen, whose pretty hands capture Ikal's heart. We cheer for Lintang, the class's barefoot math genius, as he bests the students of the mining corporation's school in an academic challenge.

The hymnal elements in the New Testament are among the earliest of all strands, some of them composed within a decade of the death of Jesus. From the third century onwards it was their custom to light the lamps of the house when dusk fell, and sing a hymn, for the onset of evening marked the new liturgical day in the earliest centuries. This collection of some of the most charming of the hymns of the Early Church presents the original Greek and Latin verse with a facing translation and a pronunciation guide for the Byzantine Greek. They range from simple chants such as the Phos Hilaron, comparing Christ to the \\"cheerful light\\" of a lamp, to sophisticated pieces by some of the great rhetoricians such as Gregory Nazianzen, Ambrose, Synesios, and Romanos. This is a book that will delight both academic and church readerships.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mkv7DwAAQBAJ&dq=At+the+Lighting+of+the+Lamps:+Hymns+of+the+Ancient+Church&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Porsche 911 Red Book: 1965-1999","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rrbNzgEACAAJ&dq=Porsche+911+Red+Book:+1965-1999&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Way It Is","description":"A candid and eye-opening inside look at the final decades of Sinatra's life told by his longtime manager and friend, Eliot Weisman. By the time Weisman met Sinatra in 1976, he was already the Voice, a man who held sway over popular music and pop culture for forty years, who had risen to the greatest heights of fame and plumbed the depths of failure, all the while surviving with the trademark swagger that women pined for and men wanted to emulate. Passionate and generous on his best days, sullen and unpredictable on his worst, Sinatra invited Weisman into his inner circle, an honor that the budding celebrity manager never took for granted. Even when he was caught up in a legal net designed to snare Sinatra, Weisman went to prison rather than being coerced into telling prosecutors what they wanted to hear. With Weisman's help, Sinatra orchestrated in his final decades some of the most memorable moments of his career. There was the Duets album, which was Sinatra's top seller, the massive tours, such as Together Again, which featured a short-lived reunion of the Rat Pack--until Dean Martin, having little interest in reliving the glory days, couldn't handle it anymore--and the Ultimate Event Tour, which brought Liza Minelli and Sammy Davis Jr. on board and refreshed the much-needed lining of both their pocketbooks. Weisman also worked with many other acts, including Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme, and an ungrateful Don Rickles, whom Weisman helped get out from under the mob's thumb. Over their years together, Weisman became a confidant to the man who trusted few, and he came to know Sinatra's world intimately: his wife, Barbara, who socialized with princesses and presidents and tried to close Sinatra off from his rough and tough friends such as Jilly Rizzo; Nancy Jr., who was closest to her dad; Tina, who aggressively battled for her and her siblings' rights to the Sinatra legacy and was most like her father; and Frank Jr., the child with the most fraught relationship with the legendary entertainer. Ultimately Weisman, who had become the executor of Sinatra's estate, was left alone to navigate the infighting and hatred between those born to the name and the wife who acquired it, when a mystery woman showed up and threatened to throw the family's future into jeopardy. Laden with surprising, moving, and revealing stories, The Way It Was also shows a side of Sinatra few knew. As a lion in winter, he was struggling with the challenges that come with old age, as well as memory loss, depression, and antidepressents. Weisman was by his side through it all, witness to a man who had towering confidence, staggering fearlessness, and a rarely seen vulnerability that became more apparent as his final days approached.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r14RDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Paints Rocks and Surf (Volume 150)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WQM9AAAAMAAJ&dq=How+to+Paints+Rocks+and+Surf+(Volume+150)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Friendly Fire on Holy Grounds: The Stockpile Conspiracy","description":"To intelligently analyze President John F.

Formed in 1942 by the expansion of Infantry Regiment (motorized) Grossdeutschland, the new division quickly earned its reputation on the Eastern Front of being the elite of the German Army. Twice the size of most other divisions, it was an immensely powerful and hard-hitting mechanized formation that cut a large swath through the Red Army, whether in the attack or on the defense. Its carefully selected officer and non-commissioned officer corps ensured that no matter what the odds, the division would always give a good account of itself in battle and would possess an esprit de corps enjoyed by few other comparable divisions, including those of the Waffen-SS. The thousands of volunteers from every land and province in Germany who fought and died while serving in the ranks of Panzergrenadier Division Grossdeutschland represented a cross-section of German society, a radical departure from the manner in which most German divisions of the era were created. Now for the first time, the faces of these men, at rest and in battle, can be seen through the images gleaned from hundreds of photographs taken by the division's war correspondents or Kriegsberichter. This outstanding selection of photographs, which until recently remained unseen for decades in a European archive, have been recovered and painstakingly researched by authors Remy Spezzano and Thomas McGuirl. Together with the assistance of the division's Veterans' association, they identified hundreds of men, living and dead, as well as dozens of combat vehicles, items of equipment, and specificengagements the division took part in from April 1942 to September 1944. Accompanied by a detailed narrative that ties each of the photos within the context of the war on the Eastern Front, God, Honor, Fatherland represents a milestone in the study of the war in the East and shows the face of the German soldier as he has never been shown before.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aroOAAAACAAJ&dq=GOD,+HONOR,+FATHERLAND:+A+Photo+History+of+Panzergrenadier+Division+%22Grossdeutschland%22+on+the+Eastern+Front+1942-1944&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let's Have a Gay!

Stabenow's evocation of this wilderness, combined with her talent for bringing characters to life and creating knuckle-whitening suspense, has made her \\"one of the strongest voices in crime fiction.\\" (Seattle Times). Now in Midnight Come Again, all these elements come together for Stabenow's most compelling Kate Shugak novel to date. Kate, a former investigator for the Anchorage D.A. and now a P.I. for hire, is missing after a winter spent in mourning. Alaska State Trooper Jim Chopin, Kate's best friend, needs her to help him work a new case. He discovers her hiding out in Bering, a small fishing village on Alaska's western coast, living and working under an assumed name-- working hard, as eighteen-hour workdays seem to be her only justification for getting up in the morning. But before they can even discuss Kate's last several months, or what Jim is doing looking for her in Bering, they're up to their eyes in Jim's case, which is suddenly more complicated-- and more dangerous-- than they suspected. A magnificent crime novel about life in America's last wilderness, the heart-wrenching grief that goes with love, and murder, Midnight Come Again is Dana Stabenow's best novel to date.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CSJFGLjJF30C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Architectural Guidebook to Brooklyn","description":"From cobblestones, churches, and row houses to fishing boats and tree-lined streets, Brooklyn boasts enriching public spaces and beautiful landscapes.

D. and cannot be said to have terminated till the ninth. This long process shaped Europe into its present form, and it must be grasped in its broad outlines in order to understand the framework of modern Europe. There are two ways in which the subject may be treated, two points of view from which the sequence of changes which broke up the Roman Empire may be regarded. We may look at the process, in the earliest and most important stage, from the point of view of the Empire which was being dismembered or from that of the barbarians who were dismembering it. We may stand in Rome and watch the strangers sweeping over her provinces; or we may stand east of the Rhine and north of the Danube, amid the forests of Germany, and follow the fortunes of the men who issued thence, winning new habitations and entering on a new life. Both methods have been followed by modern writers. Gibbon and many others have told the story from the side of the Roman Empire, but all the principal barbarian peoples - not only those who founded permanent states, but even those who formed only transient kingdoms - have had each its special historian. One naturally falls into the habit of contemplating these events from the Roman side because the early part of the story has come down to us in records which were written from the Roman side. We must, however, try to see things from both points of view...","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2Ld4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Human Thing","description":"Captain Jillian D'Lange is a woman with a promising future...until she gets caught in an explosion meant for someone else.

He became a chronicler, a historian, a storyteller who turns the extremes of the war in the Pacific the terror, the camaraderie, the banal and the extraordinary into terms we mortals can grasp.  Tom Hanks NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER In The Wall Street Journal, Victor Davis Hanson named With the Old Breed one of the top five books on epic twentieth-century battles. Studs Terkel interviewed the author for his definitive oral history, The Good War. Now E. B. Sledge s acclaimed first-person account of fighting at Peleliu and Okinawa returns to thrill, edify, and inspire a new generation. An Alabama boy steeped in American history and enamored of such heroes as George Washington and Daniel Boone, Eugene B. Sledge became part of the war s famous 1st Marine Division 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. Even after intense training, he was shocked to be thrown into the battle of Peleliu, where  the world was a nightmare of flashes, explosions, and snapping bullets.  By the time Sledge hit the hell of Okinawa, he was a combat vet, still filled with fear but no longer with panic. Based on notes Sledge secretly kept in a copy of the New Testament, With the Old Breed captures with utter simplicity and searing honesty the experience of a soldier in the fierce Pacific Theater. Here is what saved, threatened, and changed his life. Here, too, is the story of how he learned to hate and kill and came to love his fellow man.  In all the literature on the Second World War, there is not a more honest, realistic or moving memoir than Eugene Sledge s. This is the real deal, the real war: unvarnished, brutal, without a shred of sentimentality or false patriotism, a profound primer on what it actually was like to be in that war. It is a classic that will outlive all the armchair generals  safe accounts of not the  good war  but the worst war ever.

So, when Ryota suddenly announces he wants to become a Zen monk, the surprised father imagines he'll outgrow it. In this Akutagawa Prize-winning semi-autobiographical novel, author Kiyohiro Miura explores a parent's conflicting emotions: pride at the noble path his son has chosen clashes with sadness over losing a child.

Michael Battle offers an alternative look at Revelation in this new work, seeing it instead as a hopeful call to bring heaven on earth. Battle explores the problematic imagery found in Revelation before showing how similar problems play out in our contemporary world. Battle sees Revelation as a guide that shows us that we can live out God's call for heaven on earth by living in community with one another, as exhibited through the writings of Martin Luther King Jr., Desmond Tutu, Rowan Williams, and Ubuntu theology. He writes,  I seek to imagine in my particular Christian context how a view of heaven need not lead to culture wars and further excuses for oppressing others. Heaven, as envisioned by John of Patmos, has much greater purpose.a","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BzJfDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Six-gun doctor; (A Bantam book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z8E3HQAACAAJ&dq=Six-gun+doctor%3B+(A+Bantam+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cobalt (Alyson Classics Library)","description":"In this 1982 gay murder mystery by the author of Vermilion, summer in Provincetown is a nonstop party until it stops dead.

Possible uses of the notion of minimalism in the field of humancomputer interaction design are examined both from a theoretical and empirical viewpoint, giving a range of results. Minimalism defines a radical and potentially useful perspective for design analysis. The empirical examples show that it has also proven to be a useful tool for generating and modifying concrete design techniques.

Why don't they ask the wife?\\" And so she tells the story \\"the way it was,\\" including their early days, William's rise to success as a playwright, and his involvement in the treason that threatened the life of Queen Elizabeth I. Anne and Will's marriage is tested by distance and his fame, but when Will's boyhood friend, the handsome and arrogant Richard Quiney, is murdered in the garden of the Shakespeare home in Stratford-upon-Avon and Will himself is accused of the crime, the family faces their most trying time yet. Among their circle of friends and family, plenty of people had reason to wish Richard dead, but it wasn't until Anne turned \\"detective\\" that the case was finally solved. A delightful tour of Elizabethan England makes Murder in Stratford a must-read for all fans of the Bard. Audrey Peterson fell in love with England when, as Professor of English at California State University at Long Beach, she traveled there to pursue research for scholarly publication, so it is no surprise that all of her mystery novels are set in England.

Such attainment can happen, as shown here, by means of knowing the One Mind, the cosmic All-Consciousness, without recourse to the postures, breathings, and other techniques associated with the lower yogas. The original text for this volume belongs to the Bardo Th?dol series of treatises concerning various ways of achieving transcendence, a series that figures into the Tantric school of the Mah=ay=ana. Authorship of this particular volume is attributed to the legendary Padma-Sambhava, who journeyed from India to Tibet in the 8th century, as the story goes, at the invitation of a Tibetan king. Padma-Sambhava's text per se is preceded by an account of the great guru's own life and secret doctrines. It is followed by the testamentary teachings of the Guru Phadampa Sangay, which are meant to augment the thought of the other gurus discussed herein. Still more useful supplementary material will be found in the book's introductory remarks, by its editor Evans-Wentz and by the eminent psychoanalyst C. G. Jung. The former presents a 100-page General Introduction that explains several key names and notions (such as Nirv=ana, for starters) with the lucidity, ease, and sagacity that are this scholar's hallmark; the latter offers a Psychological Commentary that weighs the differences between Eastern and Western modes of thought before equating the \\"collective unconscious\\" with the Enlightened Mind of the Buddhist. As with the other three volumes in the late Evans-Wentz's critically acclaimed Tibetan series, all four of which are being published by Oxford in new editions, this book also features a new Foreword by Donald S. Lopez.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D61iSASAJYsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Siege of Rabaul","description":"Details the ordeal of abandoned Japanese units in Rabaul on New Britain Island.

This beautiful and devastating debut heralds the arrival of a major new voice in fiction. Ephram Jennings has never forgotten the beautiful girl with the long braids running through the piney woods of Liberty, their small East Texas town. Young Ruby Bell,  the kind of pretty it hurt to look at,  has suffered beyond imagining, so as soon as she can, she flees suffocating Liberty for the bright pull of 1950s New York. Ruby quickly winds her way into the ripe center of the city the darkened piano bars and hidden alleyways of the Village all the while hoping for a glimpse of the red hair and green eyes of her mother. When a telegram from her cousin forces her to return home, thirty-year-old Ruby finds herself reliving the devastating violence of her girlhood. With the terrifying realization that she might not be strong enough to fight her way back out again, Ruby struggles to survive her memories of the town s dark past. Meanwhile, Ephram must choose between loyalty to the sister who raised him and the chance for a life with the woman he has loved since he was a boy. Full of life, exquisitely written, and suffused with the pastoral beauty of the rural South, Ruby is a transcendent novel of passion and courage. This wondrous page-turner rushes through the red dust and gossip of Main Street, to the pit fire where men swill bootleg outside Bloom s Juke, to Celia Jennings s kitchen, where a cake is being made, yolk by yolk, that Ephram will use to try to begin again with Ruby.

ME/CFS can cause significant impairment and disability. Despite substantial efforts by researchers to better understand ME/CFS, there is no known cause or effective treatment. Diagnosing the disease remains a challenge, and patients often struggle with their illness for years before an identification is made. Some health care providers have been skeptical about the serious physiological - rather than psychological - nature of the illness. Once diagnosed, patients often complain of receiving hostility from their health care provider as well as being subjected to treatment strategies that exacerbate their symptoms. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome proposes new diagnostic clinical criteria for ME/CFS and a new term for the illness - systemic exertion intolerance disease(SEID). According to this report, the term myalgic encephalomyelitis does not accurately describe this illness, and the term chronic fatigue syndrome can result in trivialization and stigmatization for patients afflicted with this illness. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome stresses that SEID is a medical - not a psychiatric or psychological - illness. This report lists the major symptoms of SEID and recommends a diagnostic process.One of the report's most important conclusions is that a thorough history, physical examination, and targeted work-up are necessary and often sufficient for diagnosis. The new criteria will allow a large percentage of undiagnosed patients to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate care. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome will be a valuable resource to promote the prompt diagnosis of patients with this complex, multisystem, and often devastating disorder; enhance public understanding; and provide a firm foundation for future improvements in diagnosis and treatment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EXH2BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aboriginal Woman Sacred and Profane (Routledge Classic Ethnographies)","description":"First published in 1939 by Routledge, this classic ethnography portrays the aboriginal woman as she really is - a complex social personality with her own prerogatives, duties, problems, beliefs, rituals and point of view.

It is a story fueled on pot fumes and blues, borrowing and distorting the rigid conventions of the traditional western. Indians, cowboys, and outlaws are as interchangeable as their outfits; men strike poses from Gunsmoke, and horses are traded for Trans-Ams. Pidgin, the half-blood protagonist, inhabits a world of illusion of aliens, ghosts, telekinesis, and water-pistol violence where television offers redemption, and \\"the Indian always gets it up the ass.\\" Having escaped the porn factories of Utah, Pidgin heads for Clovis, NM to bury his father, Cline. But the body is stolen at the funeral, and Pidgin must recover it. With the aid of car thief Charlie Ward, he criscrosses a wasted New Mexico, straying through bars, junkyards, and rodeos, evading the cops, and tearing through barriers \\"Dukestyle.\\" \\"Charlie Ward slid his thin leather belt from his jeans and held it out the window, whipping the cutlass faster, faster, his dyed black hair unbraiding in the fifty mile per hour wind, and they never stopped for gas.\\" Along the way, Pidgin escapes a giant coyote, survives a showdown with Custer, and encounters the remnants of the Goliard Tribe a group of radicals to which Cline belonged. Pidgin's search allows him to reconcile the death of his father with five hundred years of colonial myth-making, and will eventually place him in a position to rewrite history. Jones tells his tale in lean, poetic prose. He paints a bleak, fever-burnt west a land of strip-joints, strip-malls, and all you can eat beef-fed-beef stalls, where the inhabitants speak a raw, disposable lingo. His vision is dark yet frighteningly recognizable. In the tradition of Gerald Vizenor's Griever, The Fast Red Road A Plainsong blazes a trail through the puppets and mirrors of myth, meeting the unexpected at every turn, and proving that the past the texture of the road can and must be changed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OAwKuEBrkysC&dq=The+Fast+Red+Road:+A+Plainsong&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Empire Earth 2 (Prima Official Game Guide) (v. 2)","description":"Lists the most significant writings on computer games, including works that cover recent advances in gaming and the substantial academic research that goes into devising and improving computer games.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iH_FmamDQ8AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WORLDS OF PAIN Life in the working-Class Family","description":"The classic that is widely acknowledged to be the most valuable and insightful book ever written on the dynamics of working-class family life by a renowned sociologist, psychotherapist, and bestselling author.One of the most devastating critiques of contemporary American life that I have read.--Michael B.

How do cultural icons reproduce and transform a sense of national identity? How does national identity vary across time and space, how is it contested, and what has been the impact of globalization upon national identity and culture?This book examines how national identity is represented, performed, spatialized and materialized through popular culture and in everyday life. National identity is revealed to be inherent in the things we often take for granted - from landscapes and eating habits, to tourism, cinema and music. Our specific experience of car ownership and motoring can enhance a sense of belonging, whilst Hollywood blockbusters and national exhibitions provide contexts for the ongoing, and often contested, process of national identity formation. These and a wealth of other cultural forms and practices are explored, with examples drawn from Scotland, the UK as a whole, India and Mauritius. This book addresses the considerable neglect of popular cultures in recent studies of nationalism and contributes to debates on the relationship between  high' and  low' culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UsXrDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Indo-Malay Martial Art: Pencak Silat Pertempuran","description":"An Indo-Malay Martial Art: Pencak Silat Pertempuran is the first book to address this particular style of Pencak Silat and detail some of its physical manifestations, theories, and principles.

However, this study offers fresh literary, redactional, and historical evidence to suggest that Luke recast Jesus' saying in order to describe something much more glorious--the deliverance of the elect. Examination of the material elsewhere in Luke-Acts corroborates Luke's expectation of an ethereal reunion, and suggests that this hope constitutes the most characteristic feature of Lukan eschatology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mhmdCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All the Colors of Darkness","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Chinese Export Porcelain, Standard Patterns and Forms, 1780-1880: Standard Patterns and Forms","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=54QeMwEACAAJ&dq=Chinese+Export+Porcelain,+Standard+Patterns+and+Forms,+1780-1880:+Standard+Patterns+and+Forms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Starting with Alice","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Thomas Cranmer, A Life (winner of the 1996 Whitebeard Biography award)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mystery of the Crying Ghost: (a Chloe Wendleton Mystery)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Meeting the Needs of Students of ALL Abilities: How Leaders Go Beyond Inclusion","description":"Provides an introduction for schools to shift their special learning programs to inclusive services.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IGUunzckrfkC&dq=Meeting+the+Needs+of+Students+of+ALL+Abilities:+How+Leaders+Go+Beyond+Inclusion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"INNOCENT","description":"We started making smoothies in 1999.

We all \\"do deception\\", often with the intention to protect ourselves and the relationships we depend on. The Dance of Deceptionunravels the ways (and whys) that women show the false and hide the real -- even to our own selves. We see how relationships are affected by lying and faking, by silence and pretending and by brave -- but misguided -- efforts to tell the truth. Truth-telling is at the heart of what is most central in women's lives. It is at the foundation of authenticity and creativity, intimacy and joy. Yet in the name of \\"honesty\\", we can bludgeon each other. We can approach a difficult issue with such a poor sense of timing and tact that we can actually shut down the lines of communication rather than widening the path of truth-telling. Sometimes Lerner's advice takes a surprising turn -- for example, when she asks us to engage in a bold act of pretending in order to discover something \\"more real\\"; or when she tells us not to parachute down on our family to bring up a \\"hot issue\\" without laying the necessary groundwork first. Whether the subject is affairs, family secrets, sexual faking or the challenge of \\"being oneself\\", Lerner helps us to discover, speak and live our own truths.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AyxlELxyr4kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Green and Burning Tree: On the Writing and Enjoyment of Children's Books","description":"For adults with special interests in children's literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nSTnPgAACAAJ&dq=The+Green+and+Burning+Tree:+On+the+Writing+and+Enjoyment+of+Children%27s+Books&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","description":"The first book in a series, 'he Last Kingdom' is set in England during the reign of King Alfred.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wuC-TSRyAe0C&dq=The+Last+Kingdom+(The+Saxon+Chronicles+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eastland: Legacy of the Titanic","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Divorce Without Court: A Guide to Mediation & Collaborative Divorce","description":"Avoid the expense and stress of divorce court Ending a marriage is always difficult, but you don t have to be financially or emotionally overwhelmed.

A decade later, despite having been an avowed opponent of the death penalty, Edison threw his laboratory resources and reputation behind the creation of a very different sort of device--the electric chair. Deftly exploring this startling chapter in American history, Edison & the Electric Chair delivers both a vivid portrait of a nation on the cusp of modernity and a provocative new examination of Edison himself. Edison championed the electric chair for reasons that remain controversial to this day. Was Edison genuinely concerned about the suffering of the condemned? Was he waging a campaign to smear his rival George Westinghouse's alternating current and boost his own system? Or was he warning the public of real dangers posed by the high-voltage alternating wires that looped above hundreds of America's streets? Plumbing the fascinating history of electricity, Mark Essig explores America's love of technology and its fascination with violent death, capturing an era when the public was mesmerized and terrified by an invisible force that produced blazing light, powered streetcars, carried telephone conversations--and killed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mAwVz2-CeX8C&dq=Edison+and+the+Electric+Chair&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Craig Claibornes Gourmet Diet","description":"A haute cuisine diet incorporating two hundred outstanding gourmet recipes presents dozens of carefully planned meals featuring low-salt, low-fat, and beefless dishes created by Claiborne with master chef Pierre Franey","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iIfDQgAACAAJ&dq=Craig+Claibornes+Gourmet+Diet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The life of Michelangelo Buonarroti: Based on studies in the archives of the Buonarroti family at Florence","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qHQkAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Power Thought Sticky Cards","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YpAbAwAACAAJ&dq=Power+Thought+Sticky+Cards&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Termite Hill","description":"Fighting their way through Soviet MiGs and SAMs, Lt.

In many cases, religious resources and motives serve as crucial variables explaining the emergence of entire social movements. Despite the crucial role of religion in most societies, this religious activism remains largely uninvestigated. Disruptive Religion intends to fill this void by analyzing contemporary social movements which are driven by people and organizations of faith.

The iconic Brit pop band The Stone Roses became an overnight sensation when their 1989 eponymous album went double platinum. It was a recording that is still often listed as one of the best albums ever made. Its chiming guitar riffs, anthemic melodies, and Smiths-like pop sensibility elevated The Stone Roses to a cult-like status in the UK and put them on the map in the U.S. But theirs is a story of unfulfilled success: their star imploded as their sophomore effort took years to complete and the band broke up acrimoniously in 1996. Sixteen years later, they reunited and have been playing sold out gigs, thrilling fans around the globe, and working on new material. In 2013, they nabbed the coveted headline spot at the Coachella Festival. With one hundred interviews of key figures, forty rare photographs, and exclusive insider material including how they created their music, The Stone Roses charts the band's rise from the backwaters of Manchester to becoming the stars of the \\"Madchester\\" scene to their successful comeback years later. Going beyond the myths to depict a band that defined Brit pop, Simon Spence illustrates their incandescent talent and jaw-dropping success while contextualizing them in the 90s music scene. This is the definitive story of The Stone Roses.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BhgXPZliqpcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Was a 98-Lb Duckli","description":"A thirteen-year-old who suffers from several \\"beauty problems\\" improves her self-image after a brief summer romance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ETZItAEACAAJ&dq=I+Was+a+98-Lb+Duckli&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dana and the Sun","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VOALAQAAMAAJ&dq=Dana+and+the+Sun&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Make Multi-Blade Folding Knives","description":"This richly illustrated, step-by-step book teaches knifemakers how to craft multiple-blade folding knives.

He emphasizes, too, the differences in nature and intensity of the Viking impact on the societies that were slowly developing into the historic kingdoms of England and Scotland, and the more complex political structures of Wales and Ireland. Throughout the book, the effects of the Scandinavian invasions on Britain are set within the wider European context.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PlkmEAAAQBAJ&dq=Vikings+in+Britain+(Historical+Association+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arguing With Scripture: The Rhetoric of Quotations in the Letters of Paul","description":"Drawing on recent discussions of quotations in the fields of rhetorics, linguistics, and literary studies, Stanley argues that Paul's explicit appeals to Jewish Scriptures must be analyzed as rhetorical devices that seek to influence the thoughts, feelings, and actions of a first-century audience, an approach that requires a different set of questions and methods than scholars have typically used in their studies of Paul's quotations. Key questions include why Paul quoted words of Scripture to support some of his arguments and not others; how quotations help to advance the developing arguments of Paul's letters; and how a mostly illiterate first-century audience from a variety of backgrounds might have viewed these sudden intrusions of material from a Jewish religious text. Answering these questions requires paying careful attention to the affective and poetic dimensions as well as the intellectual aspects of the original audience's encounter with the Holy Scriptures of Israel. Christopher Stanley is Professor of Theology at St. Bonaventure University. He is the author of Paul and the Language of Scripture as well as numerous articles on the social, literary, and rhetorical context of Paul's letters.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BRk6cv4C9NIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO","description":"Pinocchio, The Tale of a Puppet follows the adventures of a talking wooden puppet whose nose grew longer whenever he told a lie and who wanted more than anything else to become a real boy.As carpenter Master Antonio begins to carve a block of pinewood into a leg for his table the log shouts out, \\"Don't strike me too hard!\\" Frightened by the talking log, Master Cherry does not know what to do until his neighbor Geppetto drops by looking for a piece of wood to build a marionette.

All three became involved in a rebellious conspiracy against the nation that had a centuries-old claim to Texas.

The book deals with events which brought the author into this blight. It was the hour of Germany s deepest humiliation, when Napolean has dismembered the old German Empire and French soldiers occupied almost the whole of Germony. The books narrates how Hitler was arrested with several of his comrades and imprisoned in the fortress of Landsberg on the river Lech.

The Second volume of MEIN KAMPF was written after release of Hitler from prison and it was published after the French had left the Ruhr, the tramp of the invading armies still echoed in German ears and the terrible ravages had plunged the country into a state of social and economic Chaos.

These works focus on lived experiences, shared spaces and the ethnic identity through which this distinctive culture is lived in the United States of America and Canada, both of which have long been home to significant and vibrant Portuguese communities that arrived roughly in the same waves of migration. In this book, you will find a range of texts full of passion, wit, and poise, even as they wrestle with a sense of loss about the passing of the torch from generation to generation, the attempts at integration into the mainstream, and the often overlooked third space or otherness often felt by Portuguese-Canadians and Portuguese-Americans. There are also stories about the power gained from the preservation of cultural practices that promote a strong sense of self and strengthen family and community ties, and also the awareness that success can come from understanding one's legacy. We would like to emphasize that even though this anthology was compiled from the perspective of the Portuguese Diaspora to North America, the result goes beyond that community and reflects larger complexities of articulations in Canadian and American everyday life and identity that will resonate with people of any ancestry in these countries. Among the many writers included are Katherine Vaz, George Monteiro, Irene Marques, Anthony Barcellos, August Mark Vaz, Millicent Borges Accardi, Sam Pereira, Darrell Kastin and Frank X. Gaspar. Each of them offers a unique view on the heterogeneity, intricateness, and vibrancy of experiences of the Portuguese Diasporas in Canada and the United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rgW7jgEACAAJ&dq=In+Xanadu+-+Quest+(CSA+Travelling+Companion)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Red and Rover: A Boy, A Dog, A Time, A Feeling","description":"Red and Rover is about every boy who loves a dog, and every dog who loves a boy.

While visiting Russia in his twenties, Rainer Maria Rilke, one of the twentieth century's greatest poets, was moved by a spirituality he encountered there. Inspired, Rilke returned to Germany and put down on paper what he felt were spontaneously received prayers. Rilke's Book of Hours is the invigorating vision of spiritual practice for the secular world, and a work that seems remarkably prescient today, one hundred years after it was written. Rilke's Book of Hours shares with the reader a new kind of intimacy with God, or the divine a reciprocal relationship between the divine and the ordinary in which God needs us as much as we need God. Rilke influenced generations of writers with his Letters to a Young Poet, and now Rilke's Book of Hours tells us that our role in the world is to love it and thereby love God into being. These fresh translations rendered by Joanna Macy, a mystic and spiritual teacher, and Anita Barrows, a skilled poet, capture Rilke's spirit as no one has done before.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=99Uo01-ptl4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","description":"Inspired by her childhood summers in Cornwall, the author produced one of the masterworks of English literature.

Yet Christmas is made familiar all over again by showing it to be a family story.

Prejudice he faced as a Jew created in him an abiding empathy with the downtrodden, and his World War I military service and subsequent Red Cross work deepened his sensitivity to injustice. Alexander Leidholdt's new biography maps the battlefield of intolerance and civil rights violations on which Jaff  fired his journalistic salvos and explores the complexities of a man who was poised to become a national spokesman for a better South. Jaff  worked ceaselessly to advance racial understanding, successfully lobbying locally for black parks and beaches, black police, and a black college. A high point of Leidholdt's book is the account of Jaff 's attacks on mob justice, a stirring record of one writer's response to what he saw as inexcusable moral sluggishness in civil authorities. For his campaign urging Virginia lawmakers to adopt stiff antilynching legislation, he earned the 1929 Pulitzer Prize for distinguished editorial writing. Achieving a poignant balance between Jaff 's significant professional accomplishments and the private pains he bore -- including anti-Semitism, a mentally unstable wife, and an estranged son -- this superb study demonstrates how Jaff 's difficulties limited him as an active liberal reformer but also fueled his prescient and impassioned warnings against Hitler's rise to power in the early thirties. Drawing extensively from primary source material, much of it previously unexamined, Editor for Justice makes an important contribution to journalism and to southern, Jewish, and black history. Readers will treasure the depiction of an extraordinary champion of human rights.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EwbdAFMKmAgC&dq=Mark+Ethridge:+The+Life+and+Times+of+a+Great+Newspaperman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Iron Cross: A History, 1813-1957","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E0ysQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Iron+Cross:+A+History,+1813-1957&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sevendust Animosity Authentic Guitar Tab Edition","description":"This album-matching folio from Atlanta-based Sevendust, one of the top-selling bands in the hard rock genre, not only features authentic guitar TAB arrangements of their 13 newest songs, but it also includes four pages of full-color, interior art of the band!

But we may not recognize more subtle manifestations of anger, such as being uncomfortable with loose ends, acting impatiently, or being overly critical. That is anger, too. And, as is so often the case, angry folks don't seem to realize that the behavior causing them problems at home or at work actually stems from unrecognized and unresolved pain and emotional injuries from the past. Is all this negative emotion inevitable, or are there choices about how to respond, choices that can improve personal relationships as well as emotional health? The Anger Trap is a landmark book that strips away the myths and misconceptions about anger and reveals how you can learn to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy anger so that you may choose or help someone else to choose a better, more spiritually enlightened path. The Anger Trap examines the root causes of anger and can help you realize your patterns and break the destructive cycles of criticism, frustration, and irritation that hurt you and others around you. Drawing insight from timeless spiritual wisdom as well as cutting-edge research, Dr. Carter offers practical techniques to free you from anger, its hidden insecurities, fears, and selfishness and thereby improve the quality of your home and workplace life. The book clearly illustrates how the change process works and The Anger Trap is filled with real-life examples of the ways people have come to terms with their anger by applying the concepts Dr. Carter outlines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Si86LwAACAAJ&dq=The+Anger+Trap:+Free+Yourself+from+the+Frustrations+that+Sabotage+Your+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Common Sense Dressage: An Illustrated Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0CogRAAACAAJ&dq=Common+Sense+Dressage:+An+Illustrated+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leaps and Boundaries: The Prayer Book in the 21st Century","description":"Ten experts in worship and liturgical reform imagine the possibilities for new liturgy.

It also established its author, Henry Williamson, as a writer of considerable stature. Altogether he wrote over fifty books, including his first work, The Flax of Dream tetralogy, and Salar the Salmon, while the series of his later years, A Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight, was published to widespread acclaim. Born in Brockley, Henry Williamson spent his early life in south-east London, and it was during his explorations of the Kent countryside that his love of nature was first inspired. He was a soldier in the First World War, fighting on the Western Front and participating in the Christmas Truce; it is on this period of his life that the Chronicle novels of the 1950s draw, his descriptions of life in the trenches considered by many to be the finest of their kind. After the war, with life in his family proving difficult, and his first novel accepted, he made the decisive move to Devon ('all my eggs are in my one basket of literature') and set out to make a living as a full-time writer. From this period sprang his Village tales, and other natural history writings, which depict accurately and with feeling the countryside and people with which he was surrounded. During the Second World War he went to live as a farmer in Norfolk, but he found farming interfered too much with his writing, and after the war he returned to Devon. The book also discusses his relationships with women and with his children. Always searching for the love that would make him complete, Henry's domestic arrangements were constantly fraught. His first marriage to Loetitia Hibbert, though they had six children, was coloured by his extra-marital liaisons, especially his long affair with Ann Thomas, who bore him a daughter. For a while he was happy in his second marriage which gave him the stability with which to write the great work of his later years, A Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qJ9bAAAAMAAJ&dq=Henry+Williamson:+Tarka+and+the+Last+Romantic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Factors in the sex life of twenty-two hundred women, (Publications of the Bureau of social hygiene)","description":"Original ed. issued in series: Publications of the Bureau of Social Hygiene.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CBweAAAAMAAJ&dq=Factors+in+the+sex+life+of+twenty-two+hundred+women,+(Publications+of+the+Bureau+of+social+hygiene)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Era Of Reconstruction, 1865-1877","description":"A review of the controversial period in America which followed the Civil War examining the political situation in the South","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vM9vDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Era+Of+Reconstruction,+1865-1877&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Other God: Dualist Religions from Antiquity to the Cathar Heresy (Yale Nota Bene)","description":"This fascinating book explores the evolution of religious dualism, the doctrine that man and cosmos are constant battlegrounds between forces of good and evil.

Integrating political, cultural, and religious history, Yuri Stoyanov illuminates the dualist religious systems, recreating in vivid detail the diverse worlds of their striking ideas and beliefs, their convoluted mythologies and symbolism.

Unfortunately, right now the Andromeda is the linchpin in a precarious negotiation between the Drago-Kazov Pride and the Human Interplanetary Alliance, which seeks to free Earth and other old-school planets from the Nietzschean yoke. But the HIA may also be allied with the pure-human-supremacist Knights of Genetic Purity, who, in their evangelical fervor, have become every bit as fanatical as the genetically engineered devil they oppose. If the HIA allies with the Genites, the Milky Way will see yet another Human-Nietzschean bloodbath. Captain Dylan Hunt has survived one already and will do just about anything to prevent another such debacle. Dylan can't count on Seamus Harper, the only unmodified human in his crew, who is na?vely susceptible to the appeal of the Genite cause. He needs every level-headed crewmate he's got, and Beka, for all her emotional Sturm und Drang, is the best pilot in three galaxies. But Beka can't resist the chance---however remote---to find her long-lost mother. Years before, Magdalena Valentine went on a quest . . . the same one Beka has made her own. A quest to find the advanced technology of the lost Vedran race. A technology so powerful it lets the Vedrans hide their solar system in the fabric of the Slipstream itself; so powerful it could destroy the universe as we know it. This quest is where it all must lead---where, if you ask a certain purple alien, it was always, inevitably, destined to lead. Now only Dylan Hunt can stop Beka Valentine from activating the Vedran device. And he may have to kill her to do it. That is, if Tyr Anasazi doesn't kill him first. Or the Knights of Genetic Purity. Or the Human Interstellar Alliance . . . led by one Seamus Harper. The fate of the universe hinges on what Dylan Hunt and his crew do next!

In this volume Lawrence J. McCaffrey presents a coherent view of the evolution of Irish nationalism since 1800 and the impact of the Irish Question on British culture, politics, and institutions. The emotional nexus of the Irish Question was the religious issue, but McCaffrey believes that nationalism emerged from the attempt of the Irish Protestant minority, supported by Britain, to maintain religious, political, economic, and social ascendancy over a deprived and resentful majority. Although British concessions to Irish agitation removed many grievances granting to Ireland virtual religious equality, along with substantial social, economic, and political reforms nationalism, often frustrated in its attempts to secure reform and freedom, assumed an increasingly rigid position. Nationalists were not willing to settle for less than self-government, and as constitutional methods failed to achieve this goal, violence seemed the only other alternative. The bitter dissensions created by the Irish Question left permanent marks upon British politics and institutions. The efforts of two Prime Ministers, Peel and Gladstone, to resolve the conflict split their parties, thus contributing to political confusion and instability. But the Irish nationalistBritish Liberal alliance achieved improvement in the condition of Ireland and speeded advancement of democracy in Britain. And the attempt of British politicians to deal with the economic and social aspects of the Irish Question undermined laissez faire and encouraged the progress of the welfare state in both islands. On the other hand, the challenge of Irish nationalism sustained and stimulated the no-Popery roots of British nativism, making it an influential factor in politics until early in the twentieth century. The Irish Question, McCaffrey believes, has particular relevance in our contemporary world of emerging nations, wars of liberation, and tensions between majorities and minorities. Ireland offers an early example of the dreams of cultural nationalists becoming realities and of the sobering fact that ideological revolutionaries often make poor practical politicians.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AUwgEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hustler Magazine March 1998","description":"Envelope 5: Australian Playboy Sept 1998 (2 copies); Australian Penthouse March 1999; Naughty Sydney 13 #24 23 Apr 1999; The Picture #546 Feb 24 1999; The Picture #548 March 10 1999; Spice Girls poster magazine n.d.; People (with Pix) Feb 10 1998; People (with Pix) Apr 26 1999 -- Envelope 6: Australian Playboy Nov 1995; Australian Playboy Aug 1996; Australian Playboy Sep 1996; Australian Playboy Oct 1997 -- Envelope 7: Australian Playboy Feb 1997; Australian Playboy Feb 1996; Australian Playboy May 1998; Australian Penthouse March 1998 -- Envelope 8: Australian Penthouse Feb 1996; Australian Penthouse Apr 1996; Australian Penthouse July 1997; Australian Penthouse Aug 1998 -- Envelope 9: Australian Penthouse Aug 1996; ; Australian Penthouse July 1998; Australian Penthouse Feb 1998; Australian Penthouse March 1996 -- Envelope 10: Australian Hustler 3 #4 1998; Australian Penthouse Sept 1997; People with Pix 18 Feb 1998; The Picture no. 493 18 Feb 1998; Picture Sextra No. 53 n.d.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WKVujwEACAAJ&dq=Hustler+Magazine+March+1998&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Queen of the South","description":"The international bestseller that inspired the must-watch drama on USA Network starring Alice Braga as Teresa Mendoza.

His imagery is an intriguing blend of the objective and the subjective, the formal and the allegorical. It is complex, rich in illusion, yet it remains photography. First and foremost, it is the sheer visual elan, the sublime beauty with which he has transcribed these mysterious views of rock, canyon and mountain that draws us into contemplation of their more subtle virtues. This is landscape photography that enchants; its space is deep space, surrounding and thrilling us. It is a delight to see, in David Parker's large but not daunting images, photographs that wear their size easily. They were conceived on a large scale, and the size to which they have been enlarged is correct conceptually, technically and aesthetically.

Ed Pedi has spent 20+ years in the business, honing his techniques and establishing himself as an award winning photographer. In this book, Pedi presents 60 of his finest images, detailing the setting and the technical aspects of the shoot. Each image is also accompanied by set-up shots and or diagrams. This collection provides a concise overview of the art of family portrait photography. Family portrait photography can mean many different things. From individual portraits of babies and children, to various groupings of family members all the way to 100 people family -reunion group portraits, there are many things a professional shooter needs to be prepared for. In fact, many shoots will include multiple setups with a changing roster of family members in different poses and settings. Being able to deftly maneuver all of this and keep everyone and everything under control and on task can seem quite daunting. Pedi breaks all of this down into simple and easy to enact tips and lessons. While skill and artistry are key to creating memorable portraits, actually selling prints is just as important to running a successful business. Photographing each family member and the children separately increases options for greater sales with multiple pictures to choose form. In a similar vein, larger groups (like the group of 28 that Pedi details in the book) can be photographed in multiple breakdowns. In the book he explains a number of these breakdowns, each which works as a way to increase sales from one session. Another key to long term success as a portrait photographer is the repeat client. Imagine photographing a child every few years, from newborn to high school graduation. Many families will have their family portraits taken every few years as their children grow or more children are born. Repeat clients are more than just clients, they are relationships built between the photographer and the families. These relationships allow families to trust the photographer, not just for the standard family portrait but for special occasions like graduations, family reunions or seasonal portraits. Crafting a portrait that clients will love is more than just simple posing. Lighting plays a huge role. Oftentimes, with large groups it is necessary to shoot outdoors. The author provides a number of creative lighting techniques for dealing with everything from the single child portrait to large outdoor setups. The author provides the metering lighting setups he used for many of his shots, taking special consideration for photographing large groups or shooting outdoors. Also important is composition and many times, the use of props. Pedi always has a number of potted plants and artificial rocks with him to use to spruce up a scene. Flowers can be used to subtly add color to the portrait or fill in dead space, while the rocks can be used as posing or seating objects. In this book Pedi provides examples from his 20+ years in the industry of how to create the emotional portraits that clients want. Not only will they want multiple photos from one shoot, they will want to hire you again and again for their ongoing portrait needs. Creating a relationship with your clients not only makes everyone more comfortable during a shoot but lets them know that they can trust you and expect a certain level of quality each time they need a photographer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1t-9BQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond Apollo","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Disorderly Conduct: Visions of Gender in Victorian America","description":"Essays look at feminist history, female friendships, Davy Crockett, sex roles, the feminine cycle, hysteria, abortion, and androgyny in nineteenth-century America","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SIlUkXxS67oC&dq=Disorderly+Conduct:+Visions+of+Gender+in+Victorian+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","description":"Adored by its fans, deplored by its critics, Oprah's Book Club has been at the center of arguments about cultural authority and literary taste since it began in 1996.

Kathleen Rooney combines extensive research with a dynamic voice to reveal the club's far-reaching cultural impact and its role as crucible for the clash between \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" literary taste.

New material includes an extensive look at the James Frey scandal and Oprah's turn to contemporary fiction, including The Road and Middlesex.

In this lucid and groundbreaking work, Eric Paras reveals that our understanding of the philosophy of Michel Foucault must be radically revised. Foucault's critical axes of power and knowledge -which purposefully eradicated the concept of free will- reappear as targets in his later work. Paras demonstrates the logic that led Foucault to move from a microphysics of power to an aesthetics of individual experience. He is the first to show a transformation that not only placed Foucault in opposition to the archaeological and genealogical positions for which he is renowned, but aligned him with some of his fiercest antagonists. Foucault 2.0 draws on the full range of the philosopher's writing and of the work of contemporaries who influenced, and sometimes vehemently opposed, his ideas. To fill the gaps in Foucault's published writings that have so far limited our conception of the arc of his thought, Paras analyzes the largely untapped trove of lectures Foucault delivered to teeming Paris audiences as Professor of the College de France for more than a decade. At the same time, Foucault 2.0 highlights the background against which Foucault carried out his most foundational work: the unrest of 1968, the prison reform movement of the early 1970s, and the Iranian Revolution of 1979. Carefully assembling the fragments of a thinker who remains but half-understood, Eric Paras has composed a seminal book, essential reading for novices and initiates alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gfe_DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kids' Guide to the National Parks of California and Oregon - Written by Kids for Kids* - *but parents might learn something too","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WcQKAAAACAAJ&dq=Kids%27+Guide+to+the+National+Parks+of+California+and+Oregon+-+Written+by+Kids+for+Kids*+-+*but+parents+might+learn+something+too&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spiritual Traveler: New York City : The Guide to Sacred Spaces and Peaceful Places","description":"A guide to sacred sites and sacred spaces in New York City, written from a multi-faith and multicultural point of view.

On a dark midwinter s night in an ancient inn on the river Thames, an extraordinary event takes place. The regulars are telling stories to while away the dark hours, when the door bursts open on a grievously wounded stranger. In his arms is the lifeless body of a small child. Hours later, the girl stirs, takes a breath and returns to life. Is it a miracle? Is it magic? Or can science provide an explanation? These questions have many answers, some of them quite dark indeed. Those who dwell on the river bank apply all their ingenuity to solving the puzzle of the girl who died and lived again, yet as the days pass the mystery only deepens. The child herself is mute and unable to answer the essential questions: Who is she? Where did she come from? And to whom does she belong? But answers proliferate nonetheless. Three families are keen to claim her. A wealthy young mother knows the girl is her kidnapped daughter, missing for two years. A farming family reeling from the discovery of their son s secret liaison stand ready to welcome their granddaughter. The parson s housekeeper, humble and isolated, sees in the child the image of her younger sister. But the return of a lost child is not without complications and no matter how heartbreaking the past losses, no matter how precious the child herself, this girl cannot be everyone s. Each family has mysteries of its own, and many secrets must be revealed before the girl s identity can be known.

During the initial defensive fighting, the division held its sector for two weeks against the full weight of the Soviet 3rd Tank Army; a remarkable feat in itself. After the city fell, the Leibstandarte withdrew to a new defensive position and protected the important supply rail centre at Krasnograd while the Das Reich and Totenkopf divisions executed the first phase of the counterattack. When the 3rd Tank Army began its move south to block the advance of these two SS divisions, Leibstandarte carried out raids and interdictory strikes that disrupted the Soviet realignment and weakened the army's fighting power. Having rejoined the SS Panzerkorps, after taking part in the destruction of the Kegitschevka pocket, the Leibstandarte led the way back to the city of Kharkov. Dynamic young officers such as Kurt Meyer, Max Wunsche and Jochen Peiper personally led attack columns that struck deep into the city, eventually forcing the Russian troops to abandon Kharkov.From these photographs, it is clear why, after enduring the losses necessary to retake the city, these renamed the enormous Red Square as Platz der Leibstandarte.

Trader, trapper, scout, brigadier general of New Mexico Volunteers, and many other things besides, he has appealed to the public imagination as no other frontiersman has. Many biographies and who versions of his  autobiography  have been published. Yet much of the legend still remains to be separated from the facts, declares the author of this new biography.  I am an admirer of Carson,  says Mr. Carter,  and have no wish deliberately to debunk him, but I am interested in correcting the statements of uncritical hero worship many by many writers.  Kit is allowed to speak for himself, as far as possible, through an exact transcription of his dictated reminiscences made from the manuscript in the Newberry Library, Chicago. Persons and places are clearly identified, and Kit s slips of memory are corrected in the definitive annotation of his account. One hundred years of speculation about the identity of the man who transcribed Carson s story is ended. Mr. Carter has established positive identification, based on carefully assembled facts. A new assessment of Kit s character and reputation is included, as well as an annotated account of the last years of his life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xWUEBm3DLbAC&dq=Dear+old+Kit%3B:+The+historical+Christopher+Carson,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","description":"Ave Maria faces unexpected tests of her faith, conscience, and understanding as her daughter confronts adulthood, her friends in Big Stone Gap deal with major life changes of their own, and her husband sets out to reinvent his life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qy1dY4-5-nwC&dq=Milk+Glass+Moon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Bookkeeping and Accounting","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pvp_rgEACAAJ&dq=Schaum%27s+Outline+of+Theory+and+Problems+of+Bookkeeping+and+Accounting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legacy: A Search for the Origins of Civilization","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Living WHI: Writings on Race, 2000-2005","description":"Living White brings together Robert S. Griffin's writing on race during the 2000-2005 period. Included are excerpts from his two books published during this time, The Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds: An Up-Close Portrait of White Nationalist William Pierce and One Sheaf, One Vine: Racially Conscious White Americans Talk About Race. Also here, in total or in large part, are eleven published articles, one unpublished article, and a speech. In addition, there is a published article about Professor Griffin, and a published interview in which he was the subject. Last, there are excerpts from two earlier books of his that relate to the story he is telling in this book. The writings are ordered chronologically for the most part and the author provides commentaries to accompany them. This gives Living White a narrative line and lends an autobiographical quality to it. In large measure, Living White is Dr. Griffin's own story over these past few years as it relates to race. Living White is about white people, and it is for white people. Its focus is on the personal, in contrast to the public, dimensions of the racial challenges that whites confront at this time in their history. This book isn't an analysis of race in America or elsewhere. It isn't about public policy or politics or organizational activity. It isn't about how the outside world is doing but how individual white people are doing. This book will support readers in living more honorable lives as white men and women.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sQAMmAEACAAJ&dq=Living+WHI:+Writings+on+Race,+2000-2005&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"10 Days to Faster Reading","description":"Jump-Start Your Reading Skills!

In his new role as caretaker of The Society for the Preservation of the Legacy of Dr. Charles Morgan, this restive man, in service to an absent master, at last finds his calling. The peculiar institution over which he presides is dedicated to the annihilation of hierarchy: peerless antiquities commune happily with the ignored, the discarded, the undervalued and the valueless. What transpires as the caretaker assumes dominion over this reliquary of voiceless objects and over its visitors is told in a manner at once obsessive and matter-of-fact, and in language both cocooning and expansive. A wry and haunting tale, The Caretaker, like the interplanetary crystal that is one of the museum s treasures, is rare, glistening, and of a compacted inwardness.

But one such planet responds to the Andromeda's friendly advances with an all-out attack that cripples the Andromeda. Fleeing on the limited power that the ship can muster, Hunt, Beka Valentine and the rest of the crew seek a resupply depot, but none is near enough for them to reach before repairs, except for an abandoned station, uninhabited since the collapse of the empire. When Hunt, systems analyst Seamus Harper, and Andromeda's AI Rommie get into the station, they find it's not quite uninhabited. Strange presences assail them. Something very dark, evil, and entirely unknown. And while they try to get what they need without being killed by whatever is lurking on the station, something is attacking the Andromeda itself.

Pepper becomes friends with her neighbors, Avivah Rosen, a military police captain, and Benny Kirkpatrick, a green beret. They all have problems with the Army.

With typically understated lyricism, William Langewiesche explores this ocean world and the enterprises--licit and illicit--that flourish in the privacy afforded by its horizons. But its efficiencies are accompanied by global problems--shipwrecks and pollution, the hard lives and deaths of the crews of the gargantuan ships, and the growth of two pathogens: a modern and sophisticated strain of piracy and its close cousin, the maritime form of the new stateless terrorism. This is the outlaw sea that Langewiesche brings startlingly into view.

The authors detail the applications of molecular genetic methods to the study of neural induction, neuronal phenotypes and processes, and the formation of specific patterns of connections. They analyze the new information generated through modern techniques for identifying, cloning, deleting and introducing specific genes, for labeling neuronal or glial precursors, and for imaging individual neurons or parts of neurons. Other chapters focus on the increasing use of a variety of model organisms: fruit flies, nematode worms, zebra fish, xenopus frogs, chicks, and mice. The improved conservation of DNA and protein sequences, and the availability of gene and protein databases have made it possible to rapidly identify gene homologues in organisms sometimes separated by hundreds of millions of years of evolution. This volume features several chapters co-authored by investigators one of whom works on vertebrates and the other on invertebrates. They demonstrate clearly that although the nervous systems of a fruit fly and a mouse, for example, are quite different in appearance and organization, many of the same molecular players and cellular processes are involved in their assembly. Molecular and Cellular Approaches to Neural Development will be of great practical interest to researchers, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in developmental, cell and molecular biology, genetics, and neuroscience.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZChr2WMbqzcC&dq=Molecular+and+Cellular+Approaches+to+Neural+Development&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Into Battle","description":"For the first time in softcover, this is the greatly expanded second edition of Paddy Griffith's challenging work on battlefield tactics. The first edition (1981) took a critical look at the accepted wisdom of historians who interpreted battlefield events primarily by reference to firepower. It showed that Wellington's infantry had won by their mobility rather than their musketry, that the bayonet did not become obsolete in the nineteenth century as is often claimed, and that the tank never supplanted the infantryman in the twentieth. Now, a decade later, the author has been able to fill out many parts of his analysis and has extended it into the near future. The Napoleonic section includes a new analysis of firepower and fortification, notably at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815. Additional discussions of the tactics of the American Civil War have been included. The evolution of small-unit tactics in the First World War is next considered, then the problem of making an armored breakthrough in the Second World War. Following is a discussion of the limitations of both the helicopter and firepower in Vietnam. The author points to some of the lessons learned by the U.S. military and the doctrine which resulted from that experience. Concluding is a glimpse at the strangely empty battlefield landscape that might be expected in any future high technology conflict. When it first appeared, Forward Into Battle broke new ground in the study of tactics. This updated edition proves no less stimulating to both the military historian and the student of contemporary military affairs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wb0lmAEACAAJ&dq=Into+Battle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Me?

It begins with a thorough discussion of the underlying physical concepts of electricity, circuits, and complex power that serves as a foundation for more advanced material. Readers are then introduced to the main components of electric power systems, including generators, motors and other appliances, and transmission and distribution equipment such as power lines, transformers, and circuit breakers. The author explains how a whole power system is managed and coordinated, analyzed mathematically, and kept stable and reliable. Recognizing the economic and environmental implications of electric energy production and public concern over disruptions of service, this book exposes the challenges of producing and delivering electricity to help inform public policy decisions. Its discussions of complex concepts such as reactive power balance, load flow, and stability analysis, for example, offer deep insight into the complexity of electric grid operation and demonstrate how and why physics constrains economics and politics. Although this survival guide includes mathematical equations and formulas, it discusses their meaning in plain English and does not assume any prior familiarity with particular notations or technical jargon.

In response to the increased pressure on teachers to develop high levels of reading and writing proficiency for ALL students, renowned authors Dick Allington and Pat Cunningham continue their commitment to foster expert teaching in every classroom. The Third Edition of Schools That Work builds from this emphasis on developing the expertise of classroom teachers to a dynamic analysis of systematic school reform that encompasses virtually all areas of elementary school organization and planning. With its goal of turning readers into educated, informed decision-makers, Allington and Cunningham provide a clear and concise introduction that offers a strong focus on the basic theories of school reform and includes an organizational framework to accomplish this goal. Often praised as the most accessible, readable and practical book, while grounded in proven practices and current research, Schools That Work describes the critical features of school organization plans at the elementary level (e.g., professional roles, organization of time, curriculum, student assessment, professional development, and parental involvement) that can support or impede developing more effective educational settings.

Beyond this underlying threat to food safety, physical contaminants can impact the element most essential to an organization s success  consumer confidence and trust in the producer and its brand. Preventing Foreign Material Contamination of Foods describes the business implications of non-conforming products as it provides processors with conceptual strategies that can be implemented to detect, eliminate, and prevent physical contamination in common commodities utilized within food processing. The text offers a comprehensive contemporary discussion and ready professional reference on the contamination of food products with foreign material (from both product related and product non-related sources). Recent and past regulatory enforcement actions and case studies provide the reader with clear real world examples of how producers have successfully and unsuccessfully handled issues related to foreign material contamination. Numerous tables and illustrations assist in developing HACCP plans, or when evaluating the validity of existing plans as an internal/external auditor. Statistical sampling concepts are presented in combination with industry standard test methods in a visual manner that is easily understandable.

So it was with some suspicion that the shy, sweet, San Francisco heiress woke one morning with a tall, dark, dangerously handsome husband she couldn't recall marrying. Lydia had lost her memory, and was desperate to discover if there was truly a love to remember. For as she looked at Nathan Hunter's lean, muscular frame, she longed to abandon herself to the sensual stranger, and believe if only for a little while that the possessive passion in his smoky gray eyes was really for her. Business and pleasure weren't supposed to mix, but in this case Nathan Hunter was willing to make an exception. After all, it was in his best interests to keep his new bride's mind off the secrets of her past and her hatred for him. Keeping focused on his goals proved difficult as Lydia's sweet surrender wove a seductive spell around Nathan's heart, arousing emotions he had thought forever buried. But past transgressions have a way of catching up to the future. When Nathan's former friend and rival, Brigham More, seemingly returns from the dead, he stands to ruin Lydia and Nathan by unleashing an unspeakable secret.

Satler shows how Wright explored a new architectural dimension, the space in which we live. Focusing on the Larkin Building (1904) and Unity Temple (1907), works that Wright considered important but that have received little attention, Satler delineates the social nature of space. She provides an analytic framework through which to understand Wright's buildings and his writings, revealing how the history of such works and cultural landscapes offer a basis for making social, political, and spatial choices about the future. Wright's specific architectural works provide a framework for constructing social histories of places and people because his designs represent a natural way to build and to live within a larger social landscape.

Why should Christians study subjects that have little bearing on their future careers and ministry? In a style reminiscent of the work of Arthur Holmes and Harry Blamires, veteran professor of philosophy Clifford Williams addresses these issues and more in this succinct and accessible examination of the life of the mind. Christians cultivating the life of the mind actively pursue situations and discussions that require experimentation, reflection, and perseverance. They are interested in the acquisition of knowledge that is both unrelated and directly related to their faith. Williams answers common Christian objections to such activities, describes the virtues of the person who engages in the life of the mind, and asserts that the life of the mind is justifiably a Christian calling. The Life of the Mind is directed toward college students contemplating the importance of college and intellectual activity in general, but it will be enjoyed by all committed to developing a Christian mind.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lJrbHaaQR5EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thanks For The Memories ...

Its authoritative research has great relevance to the current debate on drug legalization. ? Prolific authors Robert Masters and Jean Houston are pioneer figures in the field of transpersonal psychology and founders of the Human Potentials Movement. The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience was published in 1966, just as the first legal restrictions on the use of psychedelic substances were being enacted. Unfortunately, the authors' pioneering work on the effects of LSD on the human psyche, which was viewed by its participants as possibly heralding a revolution in the study of the mind, was among the casualties of this interdiction. As a result, the promising results to which their studies attested were never fully explored. Nevertheless, their 15 years of research represents a sober and authoritative appraisal of what remains one of the most controversial developments in the study of the human psyche. Avoiding the wild excesses taken by both sides on this issue, this book is unique for the light it sheds on the possibilities and the limitations of psychedelic drugs, as well as on the techniques for working with them. With drug legalization an increasingly important issue, The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience provides a welcome and much needed contrast to the current hysteria that surrounds this topic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YoFYPwAACAAJ&dq=The+varieties+of+psychedelic+experience,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hallmarks of Felinity: A 9 Chickweed Lane Book","description":"Cats have long been a favorite subject of cartoonists.

Readers will grin with recognition at each of these humorously illustrated hallmarks. The result is a delightful field guide to a cat's moods, motivations, and behaviors.

She explores how both paradigms constrain women, but also how they are simultaneously enacted and subverted in the 'performances' women play in their daily lives. Performing Femininity will be a provocative read for the student of feminist thought and for those researchers looking at innovative ways to produce and present their research.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KUd3AAAAQBAJ&dq=Performing+Femininity:+Rewriting+Gender+Identity+(Ethnographic+Alternatives)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Barbarians: Warriors and Wars of the Dark Ages","description":"Describes the wars, weapons, and cultures of the Huns, Goths, Vandals, Franks, Moors, Magyars, Vikings, and Mongols, and examines their influence on European history","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MPfbAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Barbarians:+Warriors+and+Wars+of+the+Dark+Ages&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"UFO-Abductions : A Dangerous Game","description":"Some say they have been abducted and subjected to terrifying physical examinations. Others claim that young children have been kidnapped and returned only after the removal of flesh samples. Still others allege that women have been kidnapped and impregnated, the unborn children later removed for a vast cross-breeding experiment. These crimes against humanity are not perpetuated by an international terrorist organization. The \\"abductees\\" assert that they have been kidnapped by extraterrestrial beings. UFO abduction claims have spawned a veritable cottage industry, providing the fodder for an explosion of magazine articles, television interviews, newspaper features, bestselling books, and movies. Somewhere beyond all the tumult lies the truth. Dedicated to \\"those who will needlessly bear mental scars because of the foolish fantasies of a few,\\" UFO Abductions lifts the shroud of mystery from the invisible epidemic of UFO abduction claims. Philip J. Klass, an internationally recognized skeptical authority on the subject of UFO reports, traces the history of these claims, from the celebrated Betty and Barney Hill case in 1966 to the extraordinary tales which are surfacing today. His response to these claims and the answers he provides are both absorbing and factual - a fascinating glimpse into an American subculture obsessed with visitors from outer space.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Dv0aAQAAMAAJ&dq=UFO-Abductions+:+A+Dangerous+Game&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Was a P-51 Fighter Pilot in WWII: A Collection of Hard-to-Find Stories About Aviation in The Piston-Powered Era, 1903-1945","description":"SOME OF THE 150 STORIES IN THIS BOOK:  What WWII was all about   How the German Luftwaffe began and ended   Adolph Hitler's Nazi party and the Waffen SS   8th Air Force raids over Europe   P-51 Mustang battles with Me-109   1093's Cleveland Air Races   Wright Brother's flight in 1903   WWI Bi-planes in France   P-40s in the Flying Tigers   D-Day and P-47 Thunderbolts   Winter War in Finland   Barbarossa and airplane battles   Zeros in Southeast Asia   P-39 Airacobras fight for Russia   War-Booty in WWII   Hitler robs art treasures   How P-51 Mustangs stopped the Luftwaffe   How the Nazi Gestapo operated   The author's personal observations of WWII This book is dedicated to Orville and Wilbur Wright who discovered flight in 1903 You may purchase this book ISBN 0-595-28235-0 from www.iuniverse.com","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MEylhjM_3aUC&dq=I+Was+a+P-51+Fighter+Pilot+in+WWII:+A+Collection+of+Hard-to-Find+Stories+About+Aviation+in+The+Piston-Powered+Era,+1903-1945&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Kissing","description":"A kiss is just a kiss...or is it?

Their parents beautiful, despondent Anna; fearsome and admired Alex are deaf too. Alex, a scrap-metal collector and sometime prophet, opposes any attempts to integrate with the world of the hearing; to escape its destructive influence, the girls are educated at home. Deafness is no disability, their father says, but an alternative way of life, preferable by far to that of the strident, hypocritical hearing. Lili and Dori grow up semi-feral, living in a world they have created together. Lili writes down everything that happens, just the facts. And Dori, the reader, follows her. On the block where the girls spend their childhood, the family is united against a hostile and alien world. They watch the hearing like they would fish in an aquarium. But when the outside world intrudes, the cracks that begin to form will span the rest of their lives. Separated from the family that ingrained in them a sense of uniqueness and alienation, Lili and Dori must relearn how to live, and how to tell their own stories. Sly, surprising, and as sharp-fanged as its protagonists, Yaara Shehori's Aquarium is a stunning debut that interrogates the practices of storytelling and storyhearing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WjV9zQEACAAJ&dq=Aquarium&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Four Steps to True Wealth","description":"BOOK REVIEW Alec Franklor- Spirit of Change  March/April 2004 \\"True wealth is achieved when all aspects of life (material, emotional and spiritual) coalesce harmoniously...it has little to do with what is possessed.\\" In his book  Four Steps to True Wealth , Christopher T. Wood assists us in making financial planning a part of the actualization of one s life purpose. In taking us through the steps of recognizing what is important in our own lives, Wood shows us that how we feel about money may be creating road blocks to the actualization of personal and financial goals. Wood, a Financial Life Advisor, explains the classic methods of wealth accumulation and gives advice on how to weight your portfolio based on your unique goals. While enough information is given to begin investing on your own, advice is also given on finding competent professional assistance. What makes Wood s book unique in the world of financial planning is his adherence to the \\"social contract: the ability to receive material wealth in exchange for an active role in giving back to the positive evolution of society.\\" He advocates that there is nothing in the nature of most goods and services that makes them bad. In this way, he postulates that money is not the root of all evil, but the love of money that causes problems. Wood places his financial advice in the context of how American society has arrived at the current definition of wealth and the history behind our current financial market. In addition he critiques corporate and investor greed and notes class inequities created by society s inappropriate accum-ulation of wealth. Although a holistic perspective to financial decision-making, Wood refrains from talking about socially responsible investing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u0H7NwAACAAJ&dq=Four+Steps+to+True+Wealth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","description":"In this #1 New York Times bestseller, Catherine Crier, a former judge and one of television's most popular legal analysts, offers a riveting and authoritative account of one of the most memorable crime dramas of our time: the murder of Laci Peterson at the hands of her husband, Scott, on Christmas Eve 2002.

Reissued for the 40th anniversary of the original publication--with a new introduction from the author--Salman Rushdie's widely acclaimed novel is a masterpiece in literature. Saleem Sinai is born at the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, the very moment of India s independence. Greeted by fireworks displays, cheering crowds, and Prime Minister Nehru himself, Saleem grows up to learn the ominous consequences of this coincidence. His every act is mirrored and magnified in events that sway the course of national affairs; his health and well-being are inextricably bound to those of his nation; his life is inseparable, at times indistinguishable, from the history of his country. Perhaps most remarkable are the telepathic powers linking him with India s 1,000 other  midnight s children,  all born in that initial hour and endowed with magical gifts. This novel is at once a fascinating family saga and an astonishing evocation of a vast land and its peoplea brilliant incarnation of the universal human comedy.

In this charming account, writer and scholar Valerie Paradiz reveals the true story of how the fairy tales came to be. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, collectors and editors of more than 200 folk stories, were major German intellects of the nineteenth century, contemporaries of Goethe and Schiller. But as Paradiz reveals here, the romantic image of the two brothers traveling the countryside, transcribing tales told to them by peasants, is a far cry from the truth. In fact, more than half the fairy tales the Grimm brothers collected were actually contributed by their educated female friends from the bourgeois and aristocratic classes. While German folkloric scholars-all of them male-fancied themselves the keepers of the cultural flame, it was a handful of women who ensured that millions would know the stories of Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella by heart. Set against the backdrop of the chaotic Napoleonic wars and the years of high German romanticism, Clever Maids chronicles one of the most fascinating literary collaborations in European history and brilliantly captures the intellectual spirit of the men and women of the age. Even more, it illuminates the ways in which the Grimm tales, with their mythic portrayals of courage, sacrifice, and betrayal, still speak so powerfully to us today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IlI2QDnJIOcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","description":"Herman Melville s masterpiece, one of the greatest works of imagination in literary history Over a century and a half after its publication, Moby-Dick still stands as an indisputable literary classic. It is the story of an eerily compelling madman pursuing an unholy war against a creature as vast and dangerous and unknowable as the sea itself. But more than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopedia of whaling lore and legend, Moby-Dick is a haunting, mesmerizing, and important social commentary populated with several of the most unforgettable and enduring characters in literature. Never losing its cultural presence, Melville s nautical epic has inspired many films over the years, including the film adaptation of Nathaniel Philbrick s In the Heart of the Sea, starring Chris Hemsworth, Cillian Murphy, Ben Whishaw, and Brendan Gleeson, and directed by Ron Howard. Written with wonderfully redemptive humor, Moby-Dick is a profound and timeless inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception. This Penguin Classics deluxe edition features a foreword by Nathaniel Philbrick and cover art by Tony Millionaire. This edition prints the Northwestern-Newberry edition of Melville's text, approved by the Center for Scholarly Editions and the Center for Editions of American Authors of the MLA. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

While demonstrating the moderation for which his approach to the Bible became proverbial, Theodoret here instructs his readers to see in the dreams and visions of Daniel the pattern of prediction and fulfillment that guarantees for an Antiochene the authenticity of true prophecy. This commentary, with Greek text and English translation on facing pages, will be valuable to biblical and patristic scholars, theologians, and church historians.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KzyDvbSnLtsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vote!","description":"Using a campaign for mayor as an example, shows the steps involved in an election, from the candidate's speeches and rallies, to the voting booth where every vote counts, to the announcement of the winner.

Along with a clever plot, well-drawn characters make us want to continue reading a novel or finish watching a movie. In Creating Characters, Dwight V. Swain shows how writers can invent interesting characters and improve them so that they move a story along.  The core of character,  he says in chapter 1,  lies in each individual story person s ability to care about something; to feel implicitly or explicitly, that something is important.  Building on that foundation the capacity to care Swain takes the would-be writer step-by-step through the fundamentals of finding and developing  characters who turn you on.  This basic but thought-provoking how-to is a valuable tool for both the novice and the seasoned writer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Nn--PW9KluMC&dq=Creating+Characters:+How+to+Build+Story+People&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pardon Me, But That's a Really Stupid Sign!","description":"Laugh at 136 actual signs, ads and product labels that are so stupid you'll shake your head in disbelief.

In four interrelated essays, Adam Phillips arrives at startling new insights into issues that preoccupied Freud, showing in the process that far from having lost its relevance, psychoanalysis is still one of our most incisive tools for the exploration of the human psyche and its possibilities. Phillips transforms the genre of the essay into an instrument for intellectual investigation of the most absorbing kind.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hdf6lFL36zEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Amazing Adventures from Zoom's Academy: The Capture of the Crimson Cape","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"1,000 More Jokes for Kids","description":"Gathers jokes about cats, insects, parents, fishermen, farmers, dogs, doctors, and teachers, and includes riddles and party tricks.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nJzoAAAACAAJ&dq=1,000+More+Jokes+for+Kids&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Have You Ever Wondered?: The Origins of Our Colloquial Heritage","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Shelley: The Pursuit","description":"Shelley: The Pursuit is the book with which Richard Holmes the finest literary biographer of our day made his name.

Hotchner traveled together from New York to Paris to Spain, fished the waters off Cuba, hunted in Idaho, ran with the bulls in Pamplona and once Hotchner even masqueraded as a matador and Hemingway's manager in an actual bullfight. Everywhere they went, they talked. For fourteen years, Hotchner and Hemingway shared their thoughts and as Hemingway reminisced about his childhood, recalled the Paris literary scene of the twenties, and recounted the real events that lay behind his fiction, Hotchner took it all down. His notes on the many occasions he spent with his friend Papa in Venice and Rome, in Key West, on the Riviera, and in Ketchum, Idaho, where Hemingway died by his own hand in 1961 provide the material for this utterly profound, and truthfully compassionate best-selling memoir about the Nobel and Pulitzer Prize-winning author.

The Renaissance and the age of discovery introduced Europeans to exotic cultures, mores, manners, and ideas. Along with the cross-cultural exchange of Old and New World, East and West, came new foodstuffs, preparations, and flavors. That kitchen revolution led to the development of new utensils and table manners. Some of the impact is still felt and tasted today. Giovanni Rebora has crafted an elegant and accessible history filled with fascinating information and illustrations. He discusses the availability of resources, how people kept from starving in the winter, how they farmed, how tastes developed and changed, what the lower classes ate, and what the aristocracy enjoyed. The book is divided into brief chapters covering the history of bread, soups, stuffed pastas, the use of salt, cheese, meat, fish, fruits and vegetables, the arrival of butter, the quest for sugar, new world foods, setting the table, and beverages, including wine and tea. A special appendix, \\"A Meal with Columbus,\\" includes a mini-anthology of recipes from the countries where he lived: Italy, Portugal, Spain, and England.

It explores the nature of her confrontation with the popular novelists of her time, and demonstrates how her challenge to them transformed fiction. It is evident from letters and other sources, as well as the novels themselves, that the Austen family developed a strong scepticism about contemporary notions of the proper content and purpose of fiction. Austen's own writing can be seen as a conscious demonstration of these disagreements. In thus identifying her literary motivation, this book (moving away from the questions of ideology which have so dominated Austen studies in this century) offers a unifying critique of the novels and helps to explain their unequalled durability with the reading public.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0i77XuS-0_AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World of Hartz, Book 1","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Medicinal Plants and Herbs: Of Eastern and Central North America (Peterson Field Guides)","description":"A reference to the medicinal plants and herbs of Eastern and Central North American includes specific remedies for asthma, headaches, colds, stomachaches, depression, and many other common ailments.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f4qql6V8a38C&dq=A+Field+Guide+to+Medicinal+Plants+and+Herbs:+Of+Eastern+and+Central+North+America+(Peterson+Field+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deruta: A Tradition of Italian Ceramics","description":"The world can never get enough of wonderful Italy and all things Italian.

Has biography in fact accelerated its decent into bad taste? Carl Rollyson's lively and anecdotal investigation of writing about the lives of others is skeptical that much has changed over the past few hundred years. His inquiry into the history of the art of biography, in which he examines his own practices as well as those of biographers from Samuel Johnson to Richard Ellmann, Jeffrey Meyers, and many others, casts considerable doubt on the indictments handed down by Oates, Malcolm, & Co. By its very nature, Mr. Rollyson argues, biography is a problematic and controversial genre - it invites the burglar, and justifiably so, especially in the case of literary heroes. That contemporary critics believe biography has gone astray only reveals their ignorance of history and their hostility to the biographical enterprise itself. A Higher Form of Cannibalism? explores the nexus between scholarship and biography, and demonstrates how the similarities of method between Leon Edel and Kitty Kelly outweigh the differences. The gap between the scholarly and the popular, the \\"authorized\\" and the \\"unauthorized,\\" may not be as wide as most people suppose.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OdUZAAAAYAAJ&dq=A+Higher+Form+of+Cannibalism%3F:+Adventures+in+the+Art+and+Politics+of+Biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"English & Communication for Colleges","description":"To this groundbreaking work, originally published by the Oxford University Press in the 1980s, the author has added a new preface and two appendices, one of which consists of extracts from Calvin's Commentaries.

Kendall maintains that what became known as English Calvinism was largely the thought of Beza, not Calvin. His book is an important clarification of Calvin's position in relation to those who have been regarded as his followers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DaVLAwAAQBAJ&dq=English&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Politics of Child Abuse","description":"Child abuse policy in the United States contains dangerous contradictions, which have only intensified as the public slowly accepted it as a middle class problem. One contradiction is the rapidly expanding child abuse industry (made up of enterprising psychotherapists and attorneys) which is consuming enormous resources, while thousands of poor children are seriously injured or killed, many while being \\"protected\\" by public agencies. This \\"rediscovery\\" has also led to the frenzied pursuit of offenders, resulting in the sacrifice of some innocent people. Moreover, the media's focus on the sensational details of high-visibility sexual abuse cases has helped to trivialize, if not commercialize, the child abuse problem. As such, child abuse has gone from a social problem to a social spectacle. By the 1980s the child welfare system had become a virtual \\"nonsystem,\\" marked by a staggering turnover of staff, unmanageable caseloads, a severe shortage of funding, and caseloads composed of highly dysfunctional families (many with drug-related problems). To make room for these families, public agencies rationed services by increasingly screening-out child abuse reports which contained little likelihood of serious bodily harm. In The Politics of Child Abuse in America, the authors argue that child abuse must be viewed as a public safety problem. This redefinition would make it congruent with other family-based social trends, including the crackdown on domestic violence. Children must have the same legal protection currently extended to physically and sexually abused women. This can be done by creating a \\"Children's Authority,\\" which would have the overall charge for protecting children. Specifically, Children's Authorities would have the responsibility for providing the six main functions of child protection: investigation, enforcement, placement services, prevention and education, family support, and research and development. Offering a unique perspective on the cold reality of this crisis, The Politics of Child Abuse in America will be a provocative work for social workers and human service personnel, as well as the general reader concerned with this timely issue.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B70rt3SyhtkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Visual Language , the Hidden Medium of Communication (Design Fundamentals)","description":"This book takes readers on a journey of self-discovery, revealing the channels of expression for all visual messages across the design spectrum.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-m5QAAAAMAAJ&dq=Visual+Language+,+the+Hidden+Medium+of+Communication+(Design+Fundamentals)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Supply-Side Revolution: An Insider's Account of Policymaking in Washington","description":"This is the story of a revolution in economic policy from its origin in Congressman Jack Kemp's office in the summer of 1975 through the first thirty months of the Reagan Administration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y2ymAAAAIAAJ&dq=Supply-Side+Revolution:+An+Insider%27s+Account+of+Policymaking+in+Washington&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The spider and the fly: Are you caught in an abusive relationship?","description":"Reveals the signs and symptoms of verbal, physical, and sexual abuse, and tells how to end abusive relationships","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C3jZAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+spider+and+the+fly:+Are+you+caught+in+an+abusive+relationship%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The modern witchcraft spellbook","description":"Hundreds of spells for the modern-day witch!

In her debut book, Bonneau gives readers the facts to motivate them to do better, the simple (and usually free) fixes to ease them into wasting less--you can, for example, banish plastic wrap by simply inverting a plate over your leftovers--and, finally, the recipes and strategies to turn them into more sustainable, money-saving cooks. Rescue a loaf from the landfill by making Mexican Hot Chocolate Bread Pudding, or revive some sad greens to make a pesto. Save five bucks (and the plastic tub) at the supermarket with Yes Whey, You Can Make Ricotta Cheese, then use the cheese in a galette and the leftover whey to make sourdough tortillas. With 75 vegan and vegetarian recipes for cooking with scraps, creating fermented staples, and using up all your groceries before they become waste--including end-of-recipe tips on what to do with your ingredients next--Bonneau lays out an attainable vision of a zero-waste kitchen.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xw36DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","description":"Every woman was once a little girl and every lilttle girl holds in her heart her most precious dreams.

His notoriously angular music is at once defiantly modernist and deeply indebted to the traditions, medieval and modern, of English music. Birtwistle composes for ensembles of every size and shape but is perhaps best known for his music for the opera stage. His opera Gawain, possibly his most famous work, is fully characteristic in its marriage of a modernist musical language and a mythic subject. Accessible to anyone with an interest in modern music, this book uncovers the sources of Birtwistle's art and presents a critical account of his musical, dramatic, and aesthetic preoccupations through an exploration of such topics as theater, myth, ritual, pastoral, pulse, and line. It places Birtwistle in a broad cultural context, examining the composers and painters who have influenced his work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2ESs5bbzfEcC&dq=Harrison+Birtwistle:+Man,+Mind,+Music&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mother Love","description":"Mothers are irreplaceable.

In Expensive People, Oates takes a provocative and suspenseful look at the roiling secrets of America s affluent suburbs. Set in the late 1960s, this first-person confession is narrated by Richard Everett, a precocious and obese boy who sees himself as a minor character in the alarming drama unfolding around him. Fascinated by yet alienated from his attractive, self-absorbed parents and the privileged world they inhabit, Richard incisively analyzes his own mismanaged childhood, his pretentious private schooling, his  successful-executive  father, and his elusive mother. In an act of defiance and desperation, eleven-year-old Richard strikes out in a way that presages the violence of ever-younger Americans in the turbulent decades to come. A National Book Award finalist, Expensive People is a stunning combination of social satire and gothic horror.  You cannot put this novel away after you have opened it,  said The Detroit News.  This is that kind of bookhypnotic, fascinating, and electrifying.  Expensive People is the second novel in the Wonderland Quartet.

Why did a top White House official decide to come clean and accept a prison sentence during Watergate? Why did a finance executive turn down millions out of respect for her employer? Why are some willing to risk their futures to uphold principles? What gives us the strength to stand up for what we believe? As these questions suggest, the topic of moral courage is front and center in today's culture. Enron, Arthur Andersen, the U.S. Olympic Committee, abusive priests, cheating students, domestic violence -- all these remind us that taking ethical stands should be a higher priority in our culture. Why, when people discern wrongdoing, are they sometimes unready, unable, or unwilling to act? In a book rich with examples, Rushworth Kidder reveals that moral courage is the bridge between talking ethics and doing ethics. Defining it as a readiness to endure danger for the sake of principle, he explains that the courage to act is found at the intersection of three elements: action based on core values, awareness of the risks, and a willingness to endure necessary hardship. By exploring how moral courage spurs us to strive for core values, he demonstrates the benefits of ethical action to the individual and to society -- and the severe consequences that can result from remaining morally dormant. Moral Courage puts indispensable concepts and tools into our hands, equipping us to respond to the increasingly complicated moral challenges we face at work, at home, and in our communities. It enables us to make clear, confident decisions by exploring some litmus-test questions: Is the benefit worth the risk? Am I motivated by my desire to uphold my beliefs or just to impose them on others? Will my actions create collateral damage among those with no stake in the outcome? While physical courage may no longer be a necessary survival skill or an essential rite of passage out of childhood, few would dispute the growing need for moral courage as the true gauge of maturity. Treating this subject not as an esoteric branch of philosophy but as a practical necessity for modern life, Kidder deftly leads us to a clear understanding of what moral courage is, what it does, and how to get it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oZpSy-FjSlUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pennsylvania mountain stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LHviQAAACAAJ&dq=Pennsylvania+mountain+stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Robert Koga - The Man Behind the Legend","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Wizard of Oz & Who he Was","description":"Dorothy is transported over the rainbow in this picture book adaptation of the classic movie,The Wizard of Oz.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yeypAAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Wizard+of+Oz&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line","description":"The man the Detroit Free Press calls \\"a blue collar Tom Wolfe\\" delivers a full-barreled blast of truth and gritty reality in Rivethead, a no-holds-barred journey through the belly of the American industrial beast.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9Wj3naXSPlwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zoology: An Introduction to the Animal Kingdom: A Golden Guide","description":"An introduction to the science of animal life, the book explores the major animal groups, discusses how the animal body works to maintain and replicate itself, and how animals are fitted into their environments.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8zCzW1zyzCQC&dq=Zoology:+An+Introduction+to+the+Animal+Kingdom:+A+Golden+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ogden Nash Pocket Book; (#251)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ykGOSwAACAAJ&dq=The+Ogden+Nash+Pocket+Book%3B+(&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psychedelic Prayers","description":"Leary's only book of meditative poetry.

Paul suggests that the reason detective fiction has won legions of readers may be that \\"the writer of detective fiction, without conscious intent, appeals directly to those moral and spiritual roots of society unconsciously affirmed and endorsed by the readers.\\" Because detective stories deal with crime and punishment they cannot help dealing implicitly with theological issues, such as the reality of good and evil, the recognition that humankind has the potential for both, the nature of evidence (truth and error), the significance of our existence in a rational order and hence the reality of truth, and the value of the individual in a civilized society. Paul argues that the genre traces its true beginning to the Enlightenment and documents two related but different reactions to the theological issues involved: first, a line of writers who are generally positive in relation to their cultural setting, such as Edgar Allan Poe, Wilkie Collins, Conan Doyle; and second, a reactionary strain, critical of the prevailing culture, that begins in William Godwin s Caleb Williams and continues through the anti-heroic writers like Ars ne Lupin to Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, and John MacDonald.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0cXoZWdEjJwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of Pirates: Blood and Thunder on the High Seas","description":"The modern image of the pirate is derived from Captain Charles Johnson's accounts of the cut-throats who sailed under the Jolly Roger.

She shows how the region's strategic location between North America and India made it a convenient way-station for expatriate Indian revolutionaries who hoped to smuggle arms and people into India and thus to overthrow British rule, whilst German consuls and agents entered into partnerships with both Indian and Vietnamese revolutionaries to undermine Allied authority and coordinate anti-British and anti-French operations.

Daniel Defoe was just five at the time of the plague, but he later called on his own memories, as well as his writing experience, to create this vivid chronicle of the epidemic and its victims. A Journal (1722) follows Defoe's fictional narrator as he traces the devastating progress of the plague through the streets of London. Here we see a city transformed: some of its streets suspiciously empty, some with crosses on their doors overwhelmingly full of the sounds and smells of human suffering. And every living citizen he meets has a horrifying story that demands to be heard.

Devastatingly handsome, broad-shouldered and clean-cut, Rock Hudson was the ultimate movie star. The embodiment of romantic masculinity in American film throughout the  50s and  60s, Hudson reigned supreme as the king of Hollywood. As an Oscar-nominated leading man, Hudson won acclaim for his performances in glossy melodramas (Magnificent Obsession), western epics (Giant) and blockbuster bedroom farces (Pillow Talk). In the  70s and  80s, Hudson successfully transitioned to television; his long-running series McMillan & Wife and a recurring role on Dynasty introduced him to a whole new generation of fans. The icon worshipped by moviegoers and beloved by his colleagues appeared to have it all. Yet beneath the suave and commanding star persona, there was an insecure, deeply conflicted, and all too vulnerable human being. Growing up poor in Winnetka, Illinois, Hudson was abandoned by his biological father, abused by an alcoholic stepfather, and controlled by his domineering mother. Despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles, Hudson was determined to become an actor at all costs. After signing with the powerful but predatory agent Henry Willson, the young hopeful was transformed from a clumsy, tongue-tied truck driver into Universal Studio s resident Adonis. In a more conservative era, Hudson s wholesome, straight arrow screen image was at odds with his closeted homosexuality. As a result of his gay relationships and clandestine affairs, Hudson was continually threatened with public exposure, not only by scandal sheets like Confidential but by a number of his own partners. For years, Hudson dodged questions concerning his private life, but in 1985 the public learned that the actor was battling AIDS. The disclosure that such a revered public figure had contracted the illness focused worldwide attention on the epidemic. Drawing on more than 100 interviews with co-stars, family members and former companions, All That Heaven Allows finally delivers a complete and nuanced portrait of one of the most fascinating stars in cinema history. Author Mark Griffin provides new details concerning Hudson s troubled relationships with wife Phyllis Gates and boyfriend Marc Christian. And here, for the first time, is an in-depth exploration of Hudson s classic films, including Written on the Wind, A Farewell to Arms, and the cult favorite Seconds. With unprecedented access to private journals, personal correspondence, and production files, Griffin pays homage to the idol whose life and death had a lasting impact on American culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FxZPDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"KidsSongs Sleepyheads with Book (Kidsongs)","description":"Includes 20 songs drawn from a variety of sources, both contemporary and classic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k7lGZ0gJnVQC&dq=KidsSongs+Sleepyheads+with+Book+(Kidsongs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"556 Aromatherapy Formulas for Mind & Body","description":"A guide to using the aromas and oils of plants in baths, candles, saunas, massages, mist sprays and in creating deodorants, mouthwashes, skin care creams and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S6nnwAEACAAJ&dq=556+Aromatherapy+Formulas+for+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Spiritual Rock Gardening","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The English Nobility in the Late Middle Ages","description":"First Published in 2004.

During the past two centuries, the quest for knowledge about asteroids has involved eminent scientists and amateur astronomers, patient research and sudden intuition, advanced technology and the simplest of telescopes, newspaper headlines and Cold War secrets. Today, researchers have named and identified the mineral composition of these objects. They range in size from 33 feet to 580 miles wide and most are found in a belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Covering all aspects of asteroid investigation, Curtis Peebles shows how ideas about the orbiting boulders have evolved. He describes how such phenomena as the Moon's craters and dinosaur extinction were gradually, and by some scientists grudgingly, accepted as the results of asteroid impacts. He tells how a band of icy asteroids rimming the solar system, first proposed as a theory in the 1940s, was ignored for more than forty years until renewed interest and technological breakthroughs confirmed the existence of the Kuiper Belt. Peebles also chronicles the discovery of Shoemaker-Levy 9, a comet with twenty-two nuclei that crashed into Jupiter in 1994, releasing many times the energy of the world's nuclear arsenal. Showing how asteroid research is increasingly collaborative, the book provides insights into the evolution of scientific ideas and the ebb and flow of scientific debate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RbDkCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nightwork","description":"#1 New York Times bestselling author Nora Roberts introduces an unforgettable thief in an unputdownable new novel...

The Cold War has ended; yet Americans face daunting social and economic problems and are increasingly divided about how to address them. In this perceptive psychological portrait of Clinton and his presidency, expert Stanley Renshon investigates whether Clinton has demonstrated the requisite qualities of judgment, vision, character, and skill to meet the challenges he faces, domestically and internationally, and whether he merits another term. Renshon incisively analyzes Clinton's sweeping ambitions, his enormous confidence in himself and his goals, and his success in convincing people that he genuinely cares about them. He reveals a Bill Clinton whose capacity for political success is often undermined by the very traits for which many praise him. His unusually high self-confidence, for instance, leads him to believe that he can accomplish what others have not, that he can, for instance, reconcile polar opposites such as liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans. Remarkably persistent throughout Clinton's career are certain character traits which have defined him to the public--his tendency to make promises he can't keep, his ability to win people over in person, his sudden blind rages. Renshon traces the development of Clinton's character from his early family experiences to his highly successful adolescence and long political career. He illustrates how each step along the way--Clinton's inconsistent experiences as an adored but disregarded child, his attempt to avoid the draft and the consequences of doing so, his marriage to Hillary Rodham whose own psychology has both helped and hurt him, and his tenure as governor during which his character first became a political issue--is crucial to understanding his erratic and controversial presidency. Renshon explores the nature of the Clinton marriage as a political partnership and looks at Hillary Clinton as an associate president. High Hopes gives us a new understanding of why a man with so many talents has become a president whose performance has not measured up to his promise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8X8VCgAAQBAJ&dq=Going+South:+Jewish+Women+in+the+Civil+Rights+Movement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mallcity14","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Discover Educational Toys for Children","description":"This book supplies all the information you need to find quality educational products for children.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7PbJ_gSaXwEC&dq=Discover+Educational+Toys+for+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Riddle of the Sphinx","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Adam!

Besides leading to gallbladder diseases and gallstone attacks in at least 20 million Americans each year, in many cases, liver bile duct congestion sets the stage for even more serious, seemingly unrelated, conditions, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Most adults living in the industrialized world, and especially those suffering a chronic illness, such as irritable bowel syndrome, heart disease, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, cancer, or diabetes, have in fact hundreds if not thousands of gallstones (mainly clumps of hardened bile that escape detection for they are invisible to x-rays, ultrasound, and CT scans) blocking the bile ducts of their liver. This book provides a thorough understanding of the liver and its complex functions, what causes gallstones in the liver and gallbladder, and why these stones can be held responsible for the most common diseases so prevalent in the world today. It provides the reader with the knowledge needed to recognize these stones and gives the necessary, do-it-yourself instructions to painlessly remove them in the comfort of one's home. Packed with images, the book also gives practical guidelines on how to prevent new gallstones in both the liver and gallbladder. The liver and gallbladder flush (cleanse) has led to extraordinary improvements in health and wellness among millions of people who have already given themselves the precious gift of a strong, clean, revitalized liver. Besides providing the practical procedures to cleanse the liver, gallbladder, kidneys, and intestines, Moritz explains in great detail the origin of all types of common diseases and how to prevent or reverse them naturally. The book is packed with precious, time-tested approaches designed to return the body to a permanent state of balance and vitality; it includes a complete program of healthcare, which is primarily based on the ancient medical system of Ayurveda and the vast amount of experience Andreas Moritz has gained in the field of health restoration during the past 30 years.

Spanning five central decades of the twentieth century (1934-1974), 'Walkabout' was integral to Australia s sense of itself as a nation. By advocating travel both vicarious and actual 'Walkabout' encouraged settler Australians to broaden their image of the nation and its place in the Pacific region. In this way, 'Walkabout' explicitly aimed to make its readers feel at home in their country, as well as including a diverse picture of Aboriginal and Pacific cultures. Given its wide availability and distribution, together with its accessible and entertaining content, 'Walkabout' changed how Australia was perceived, and the magazine is recalled with nostalgic fondness by most if not all of its former readers. Drawing on interdisciplinary scholarship, 'Travelling Home' engages with key questions in literary, cultural, and Australian studies about national identity and modernity. The book s diverse topics demonstrate how 'Walkabout' canvassed subtle and shifting fields of representation; as a result, this analysis produces complex and nuanced readings of Australian literary and cultural history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sfw1DgAAQBAJ&dq=Contributing+Factor%24:+How+to+Be+a+Regular+Contributor+to+Magazines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Queen of Hearts: Tales of Middle-aged Passion","description":"Three poignant and humorous stories on the realities of finding and failing at love in mid-life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uLMMAAAACAAJ&dq=Queen+of+Hearts:+Tales+of+Middle-aged+Passion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Witchcraft: A Complete Guide","description":"Provides information on creating a sacred space, promoting good energy, and creating incantations, potions, and charms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MD9CDgAAQBAJ&dq=Witchcraft:+A+Complete+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wall Street & the Bolshevik Revolution","description":"Journalist Doug Henwood, \\"scourge of the New York stock exchange\\", dissects the world's greatest financial centre, laying open the intricacies of how, and in whose interest, the financial market works. 100 graphs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Us23wAEACAAJ&dq=Wall+Street&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond the Blue Mountains Hb","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GUYiAAAAMAAJ&dq=Beyond+the+Blue+Mountains+Hb&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE TEXAN","description":"In this breathtaking novel, New York Times bestselling author Joan Johnston weaves a beguiling tale of two feuding families the Blackthornes and the Creeds and of two extraordinary people: loner Owen Blackthorne and beautiful, headstrong Bayleigh Creed, irresistibly drawn to each other despite the desperate odds against their love.

How have infectious diseases changed through time?

For several hours, the U.S. embassy in Saigon itself came under siege by Viet Cong soldiers. Militarily, the offensive was a failure, as the North Vietnamese Army and its guerrilla allies in the south suffered devastating losses. Politically, however, it proved to be a crucial turning point in America's involvement in Southeast Asia and public opinion of the war. In this classic work of military history and war reportage long considered the definitive history of Tet and its aftermath Don Oberdorfer moves back and forth between the war and the home front to document the lasting importance of this military action. Based on his own observations as a correspondent for the Washington Post and interviews with hundreds of people who were caught up in the struggle, Tet! remains an essential contribution to our understanding of the Vietnam War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r6lQ-430NL0C&dq=Tet!:+The+Turning+Point+in+the+Vietnam+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terry and the Pirates (1940-1941) Volume 7 (7)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zd0uAQAAIAAJ&dq=Terry+and+the+Pirates+(1940-1941)+Volume+7+(7)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pioneer Twins","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aenkzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Pioneer+Twins&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Human Target (1 of 4)","description":"Christopher Chance now has 11 days to solve his own murder.

As in the Scopes trial, two encompassing world views clashed in an event of passionate drama. Steven M. Wise, trial lawyer and legal historian, has uncovered layer upon layer of fascinating revelations in a case which threatened, according to slave owners, to bring the economy of the British Empire to a crashing halt. In a gripping narrative of Somerset's trial-and of the slave trials that led up to it-he sets the stage for the unexpected decision by the famously conservative judge, Lord Mansfield, which would lead to the abolition of slavery, both in England and the United States, and the end of the African slave trade.The characters in this great historical moment go beyond a screenwriter's dream: Somerset's novice attorneys arguing their first case; the fervent British abolitionist Granville Sharp, a cross between Ralph Nader and William Lloyd Garrison, who had brought case after case to court in an attempt to abolish slavery; the master's two-faced and skillful lawyer, who had recently argued before Mansfield that slavery could not exist in England; and finally, the greatest judge of his time, Lord Mansfield, whose own mulatto grand-niece, Dido Belle, was his slave.As the case drew to a close Lord Mansfield spoke these stirring words that continue to resound more than two centuries later: \\"Let Justice be done, though the Heavens may fall.\\"A Merloyd Lawrence Book","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ch2wswEACAAJ&dq=Though+The+Heavens+May+Fall:+The+Landmark+Trial+That+Led+To+The+End+Of+Human+Slavery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Romanian Poems (Green Integer) (Romanian Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy, 4th Ed.","description":"Contains English translations of Descartes' 1637 treatise Discourse on the Method for Conducting One's Reason Well and for Searching for Truth in the Sciences and a subsequent development of the ideas contained in it, Meditations on First Philosophy, first published in 1641.

And in the three years since that fateful day, he has come to a sobering realization: Our once-noble news media -- and network TV news in particular -- have abdicated their responsibility to the American people, and endangered us in the process. As Fenton points out, much of the United States still depends on the networks for most of its information about the world. But after the fall of the Soviet Union, the networks gutted their news-gathering operations -- just as the old Cold War status quo was shattering -- leaving behind an unstable and violent new world order. Once a public service, the network news was commandeered by its corporate parents as a cash cow. In-depth reporting on critical issues was replaced with saturation coverage of sensationalistic crime stories and simpleminded \\"news you can use.\\" Even as genocide spread through Africa -- and Islamic terror festered in the Middle East -- international reporting disappeared almost entirely from the airwaves. And Americans were left uninformed, unable to judge the accuracy of politically biased stories (on both sides of the spectrum), and utterly unprepared for the war on terror about to descend on their doorstep. In Bad News, Tom Fenton offers a fiery indictment of just how far \\"the news\\" has fallen. As a frequent voice in the wilderness himself -- who fought in vain to interest CBS in an Osama bin Laden interview in the 1990s -- Fenton reveals a news-gathering environment gutted by corporate bottom-lining bottom-feeders, staffed by dilatory producers and executives (who dismissed important stories as depressing or obscure), and dangerously dependent on images and information gathered by third-party sources. In hard-hitting interviews with Dan Rather, Peter Jennings, and Tom Brokaw, he exposes how even the anchors themselves believed they were outlandishly compensated -- while quality coverage was being slashed. And he charges that the news media must lose its entertainment-industry mindset and reestablish its role as a keeper of the public trust. \\"This is not just a book,\\" writes Fenton. \\"This is the beginning of a campaign to galvanize America. We need more and better news. Our lives depend on it.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tCr1wAEACAAJ&dq=Bad+News+:+The+Decline+of+Reporting,+the+Business+of+News,+and+the+Danger+to+Us+All&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clues for the Clueless (Dogbert N' Dilbert's Humour at Work)","description":"Original cartoons from the Dilbert strip","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2kURAAAACAAJ&dq=Clues+for+the+Clueless+(Dogbert+N%27+Dilbert%27s+Humour+at+Work)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Behavioral Genetics: A Primer (A Series of books in psychology)","description":"An overview of both animal and human behavioural genetics and discussions of controversial topics.

In these eight lectures, given during the Great War as thousands of young men were being killed in battle, Rudolf Steiner - the great initiate of the twentieth century - describes the dramatic reality of the spiritual worlds encountered by human beings after death. He speaks of the joys and sufferings experienced in those worlds by people of different character; the vision of the 'ideal human being' that souls experience; the cosmic 'midnight hour'; the processes leading to rebirth in the world of the senses; the deeper causes behind such phenomena as materialism and criminality; and why, in the flesh, we lose our instinctive perception of the spiritual worlds. Steiner describes how knowledge of the spiritual realms, as well as the life beyond death and before birth, can be built on the foundations of modern science. Indeed, he speaks of mankind's involvement in science and its many achievements as necessary steps on the path towards a modern spirituality and true understanding of the soul, and describes in detail some of the methods by which direct perception of the worlds of soul and spirit can be developed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ziFFDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The original Louis Maggio system for brass","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WjePvgAACAAJ&dq=The+original+Louis+Maggio+system+for+brass&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Swamp","description":"Lavish parties. Committee chairmanships for sale. Pay-to-play corruption. Backroom arm-twisting. Votes on major legislation going to the highest bidder. Welcome to Washington, D.C., the swamp that President Donald Trump was elected to drain. Congressman Ken Buck is blowing the whistle on the real-life House of Cards in our nation's capital. Elected in 2014 as president of one of the largest Republican freshman classes ever to enter Congress, Buck immediately realized why nothing gets done in Congress, and it isn't because of political gridlock in fact, Republicans and Democrats work together all too well to fleece taxpayers and plunge America deeper into debt. \\"It is an insular process directed by power-hungry party elites who live like kings and govern like bullies,\\" Buck reports. Buck has witnessed first-hand how the unwritten rules of Congress continually prioritize short-term political gain over lasting, principled leadership. When Buck tangled with Washington power brokers like former Speaker John Boehner, he faced petty retaliation. When he insisted Republicans keep their word to voters, he was berated on the House floor by his own party leaders. When other members of Congress dared to do what they believed to be right for America instead of what the party bosses commanded, Buck saw them stripped of committee positions and even denied dining room privileges by the petty beltway bullies. In Drain the Swamp, Buck names names and tells incredible true stories about what really happened behind closed doors in Congress during legislative battles that have ensued over the last two years including budget, continuing resolutions, omnibus, trade promotion authority, Iran, and more. If the Trump administration is going to bring real change to Washington, it first needs to get the whole story from deep inside the swamp.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JmQjvgAACAAJ&dq=The+Swamp&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"War, Peace, And The Social Order (Foundations of Social Inquiry)","description":"War, Peace, and the Social Order is based on the premise that both war and peace are understandable patterns of human interaction, and that both are explicable using the knowledge of the social sciences.

The current administration represents change, for sure, Steven Malanga argues - a momentous transformation of the fundamental structure of American politics. A self-interested coalition of public-sector unions and government-financed community activists (like the young Barack Obama) has become our era's characteristic political machine. In Shakedown, Mr. Malanga shows how this machine's single-minded goal is always bigger government and more public spending. The bill, he says, is now coming due for the relentless rise of this new political powerhouse. He chronicles how public-sector unions and the corrupt political hacks beholden to them have all but bankrupted once-rich states like California and New Jersey. He details the campaigns to undermine the successful and popular 1990s welfare reform and to revitalize the failed, wasteful War on Poverty programs that funnel taxpayer money to the advocacy groups that are integral cogs in the new political machine. And he provides a comprehensive summary of how these same advocacy groups spent decades helping undermine mortgage standards in the name of helping the poor - in the process enriching themselves and enabling the housing meltdown. As Americans anxiously ponder the future direction of their government and their economy, Shakedown explores the questions of who got us in this mess and why we need change - constructive change - more than ever.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EjpYS_i9ksoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sharamitaro","description":"Brendys, the simple son of a Horsemaster, finds himself the inheritor of a great token of power and a destiny of which he wants no part--that of the Bearer of the Flame.

The Tools addresses the most common complaint patients have about psychotherapy: the interminable wait for change to begin. Barry Michels, an LA-based therapist, was frustrated by his inability to bring his patients faster relief from the issues that plagued them. He found a mentor in Phil Stutz, a psychiatrist who years before devised a methodology that arose from a similar disenchantment. The traditional therapeutic model sets its sights on the past, but Stutz and Michels employ an arsenal of tools--exercises that access the power of the unconscious and effectively meet the most persistent problems people face--and the results are electrifying. Stutz and Michels are much sought-after--a recent profile in The New Yorker touted them as an \\"open secret\\" in Hollywood--and treat a high-powered and creative clientele. Their first work, The Tools transcends the typical self-help genre because of its paradigm-changing material, the credibility of its authors, and the instant appeal and empowerment of its message.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sHCN-EVwW3cC&dq=The+Tools&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biblical Mormonism: Responding to evangelical criticism of LDS theology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J8lyxQEACAAJ&dq=Biblical+Mormonism:+Responding+to+evangelical+criticism+of+LDS+theology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","description":"The story of a beautiful woman born in the American southwest long before Columbus whose blue eyes marked her as a witch and set her apart from the Indian tribe that raised her.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cn22ngEACAAJ&dq=She+Who+Remembers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kent County, Michigan: Marriage and Death Newspaper Notices : Newspaper Notices from Michigan Newspapers at the Michigan Historical Collections, Bentley Historical Library,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DobhAAAAMAAJ&dq=Kent+County,+Michigan:+Marriage+and+Death+Newspaper+Notices+:+Newspaper+Notices+from+Michigan+Newspapers+at+the+Michigan+Historical+Collections,+Bentley+Historical+Library,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chris Drury","description":"Chris Drury walks - and works - in the wild landscapes of the world. Over the last twenty years, he has developed an impressive and highly personal repertoire of sculptural responses to the natural environment. This book is the first to explore the work of this highly inventive English artist. Drury's experiences of places or journeys around the globe are expressed in two kinds of sculpture: cairns or shelters, sometimes filled with fire, which are built in remote and often beautiful locations, and meticulously worked baskets and exquisitely formed \\"bundles\\" - of bone, wood, leaf, grass, feather, stone - which are created later from materials picked up along the way. Thus, a basket made of heather, wool, and stone recalls a shelter made of heather branches, and is, in turn, echoed ten years later by a dewpond in Sussex, England, cut into a maze of intersecting channels. A cairn built in a canyon in New Mexico is followed, in time, by etched and bound elk bones from a mountain-lion kill there. Kay Syrad's introduction analyzes Chris Drury's sculpture in the context of late-twentieth-century environmental art, providing valuable insights into the artist's motivations. Drury's own commentaries, together with the highly evocative photographs of his work, convey his passionate exploration of humanity's relationship to nature, as well as his appreciation of the natural world as one in which people have their place and have made their mark.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9NlPAAAAMAAJ&dq=Chris+Drury&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chamorro-English Dictionary (PALI language texts)","description":"The Chamorro-English Dictionary provides an alphabetical listing of as many Chamorro words as could be collected, spelled according to the principles adopted by the Marianas Orthography Committee in February 1971.

But by daybreak, their plan had been shot to hell. One of them was in the hospital. One was in jail. One was dead. And one got away with it. Arden Maxwell, the daughter of the man who disappeared all those years ago presumably with the money, after murdering his accomplice has never reconciled with her father's abandonment of her and her sister. After countless personal setbacks she decides to return to her family home near mysterious Caddo Lake, and finally get answers to the many questions that torment her.

Welcome to Richard Lederer's beguiling celebration of language -- of our ability to utter, write, and receive words. No purists need stop here. Mr. Lederer is no linguistic sheriff organizing posses to hunt down and string up language offenders. Instead, join him \\"In Praise of English,\\" and discover why the tongue described in Shakespeare's day as \\"of small reatch\\" has become the most widely spoken language in history: English never rejects a word because of race, creed, or national origin. Did you know that jukebox comes from Gullah and canoe from Haitian Creole? Many of our greatest writers have invented words and bequeathed new expressions to our eveyday conversations. Can you imagine making up almost ten percent of our written vocabulary? Scholars now know that William Shakespeare did just that! He also points out the pitfalls and pratfalls of English. If a man mans a station, what does a woman do? In the \\"The Department of Redundancy Department,\\" \\"Is English Prejudiced?\\" and other essays, Richard Lederer urges us not to abandon that which makes us human: the capacity to distinguish, discriminate, compare, and evaluate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aakq9i5kUWMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yvain; or, The Knight with the Lion","description":"A twelfth-century poem by the creator of the Arthurian romance describes the courageous exploits and triumphs of a brave lord who tries to win back his deserted wife's love","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hSbwAAAAQBAJ&dq=Yvain%3B+or,+The+Knight+with+the+Lion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Other Brother","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"On Writing Science Fiction: The Editors Strike Back","description":"Provides information on how to write science fiction: including information on plots, characters, background, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vf8EAAAACAAJ&dq=On+Writing+Science+Fiction:+The+Editors+Strike+Back&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Die Without a Lawyer: A Practical Guide to Creating an Estate Plan Without Paying Legal Fees","description":"Clement guides readers through steps necessary to put affairs in order and maximize inheritance passed on to loved ones through simple, easy-to-understand advice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gyQayeaXyvIC&dq=How+to+Die+Without+a+Lawyer:+A+Practical+Guide+to+Creating+an+Estate+Plan+Without+Paying+Legal+Fees&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","description":"\\"Lucy Honeychurch is a young middle-class English girl.

Slate A Penguin Classic Kristin Lavransdatter interweaves political, social, and religious history with the daily aspects of family life to create a colorful, richly detailed tapestry of Norway during the fourteenth-century. The trilogy, however, is more than a journey into the past. Undset's own life her familiarity with Norse sagas and folklore and with a wide range of medieval literature, her experiences as a daughter, wife, and mother, and her deep religious faith profoundly influenced her writing. Her grasp of the connections between past and present and of human nature itself, combined with the extraordinary quality of her writing, sets her works far above the genre of \\"historical novels.\\" This new translation by Tina Nunnally the first English version since Charles Archer's translation in the 1920s captures Undset's strengths as a stylist. Nunnally, an award-winning translator, retains the natural dialog and lyrical flow of the original Norwegian, with its echoes of Old Norse legends, while deftly avoiding the stilted language and false archaisms of Archer's translation. In addition, she restores key passages left out of that edition. Undset's ability to present a meticulously accurate historical portrait without sacrificing the poetry and narrative drive of masterful storytelling was particularly significant in her homeland. Granted independence in 1905 after five hundred years of foreign domination, Norway was eager to reclaim its national history and culture. Kristin Lavransdatter became a touchstone for Undset's contemporaries, and continues to be widely read by Norwegians today. In the more than 75 years since it was first published, it has also become a favorite throughout the world. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aIpPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Kristin+Lavransdatter+III+the+Cross&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Timeless Secrets of Health and Rejuvenation","description":"Flying in the face of mainstream medicine and society's many health myths, this text reveals the most common but rarely recognized reasons behind illness and aging and provides remedies for continuous vibrant health.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MgeMZ19K1bEC&dq=Timeless+Secrets+of+Health+and+Rejuvenation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Off-Hollywood Movies: A Film Lover's Guide","description":"This indispensable guide rates and reviews hundreds of old and new film treasures with an entertaining synopsis, concise critique, one- to five-star rating, credits, subject category, running time, date, and more for each title.

His radical new approach, that he sometimes calls  self-help in a shot glass  is easy, real, and to the point. He helps people make changes to their lives so that personal growth happens organically, just by living. Let s face it, therapy is a luxury. Few of us have the time or money to devote to going to an office every week. With anecdotes illustrating principles in action (in relatable and sometimes irreverent fashion) and stand-alone practices and exercises, Kim gives readers the tools and directions to focus on what's right with them instead of what's wrong. When John Kim was going through the end of a relationship, he began blogging as The Angry Therapist, documenting his personal journey post-divorce. Traditional therapists avoid transparency, but Kim preferred the language of \\"me too\\" as opposed to \\"you should.\\" He blogged about his own shortcomings, revelations, views on relationships, and the world. He spoke a different therapeutic language  open, raw, and at times subversive   and people responded.

Fans who once were content to merely watch baseball were stimulated into wanting to think baseball as well. McCarver brings to the booth a combination of twenty-one years of major league service and nearly twenty more in broadcasting. There is nobody better at explaining the game than McCarver, and it is a rare game in which the viewer does not learn something new and unusual. Now he is putting down on paper all he knows about the sport, producing this unique perspective on how America's pastime should be played and watched. With his unmistakable wit and storytelling verve, McCarver succinctly explains the fundamentals and proper mechanics of baseball at the level necessary for success in the major leagues. Once the skills have been learned, the viewer can devise smart strategies, getting into the heads of the players, coaches, and managers: When should a player or manager be conservative or aggressive; what factors change as the count goes deeper; how do you set up an effective running game, and how can a defense try to sabotage it? This book is a gold mine for all fans, from brain surgeons and rocket scientists to beginners who want to start with the basics. (Even major leaguers will be able to pick up some pointers.)

Toklas. Gertrude Stein was a distinctly unique talent who penned many novels, essays, and poems. And on one occasion, during a bout of writer s block, she decided to play with the popular genre of mystery fiction. The book that resulted, Blood on the Dining-Room Floor, is not your typical whodunit, just as Stein was not your typical author. With elements of her trademark avant-garde style, the story revolves around the mysterious passing of Madame Pernollet, who is found dead in the courtyard of a hotel owned by her husband. Incorporating some autobiographical details from events at her own French country house, Stein invites the reader to play detective and offers a glimpse into one of the early twentieth century s most interesting and challenging literary minds.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SR7UDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"At the Gates of the East","description":"Traders, Pushers, Soldiers, Spies. A pivot for India s Act-East policy. The gateway to a future of immense possibilities from hydrocarbons to regional trade over land and water that could create a new Silk Route. A bulwark against China. A cradle of climate change dynamics and migration.  Northeast  India, the appellation with which India s far-east is known, is all this and more. Alongside hope and aspiration, it is also home to immense ethnic and communal tension, and a decades-old Naga conflict and the high-profile peace process that involves four gateway states Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam and several million people. It s among the most militarized zones in the world. It s a playground of corruption and engineered violence. Only real peace, and calm in both Myanmar and Bangladesh, will unlock this Eastern gate. A keen observer and frequent chronicler of the region, Sudeep Chakravarti has for several years offered exclusive insights into the Machiavellian Chanakyan world of the Naga and other conflicts and various attempts to resolve these. He now melds the skills of a journalist, analyst, historian and ethnographer to offer inside stories and a ringside view to the tortuous, no-holds-barred attempts at resolving conflict. Employing a  dispatches  style of storytelling, and interviews with rebel leaders, politicians, bureaucrats, policymakers, security specialists and operatives, gunrunners,  narcos , peace negotiators and community leaders, Chakravarti s narrative provides a definitive guide to the transition from war to peace, even as he keeps a firm gaze on the future. The Eastern Gate is a tour de force that captures this story of our times.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e11PEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Keep Your Car Mechanic Honest","description":"This guide doesn't train the reader to be a mechanic - it teaches him or her how to deal with one and not get taken for a ride.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ANYiIQAACAAJ&dq=How+to+Keep+Your+Car+Mechanic+Honest&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building Europe: The Cultural Politics of European Integration","description":"The development of the European Union has been one of the most profound advances in European politics and society this century. Yet the institutions of Europe and the 'Eurocrats' who work in them have constantly attracted negative publicity, culminating in the mass resignation of the European Commissioners in March 1999. In this revealing study, Cris Shore scrutinises the process of European integration using the techniques of anthropology, and drawing on thought from across the social sciences. Using the findings of numerous interviews with EU employees, he reveals that there is not just a subculture of corruption within the institutions of Europe, but that their problems are largely a result of the way the EU itself is constituted and run. He argues that European integration has largely failed in bringing about anything but an ever-closer integration of the technical, political and financial elites of Europe - at the expense of its ordinary citizens. This critical anthropology of European integration is essential reading for anyone with an interest in the culture and politics of the EU.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ffv9AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","description":"Revisits the legend of the werewolf in a novel set in decaying ancient Rome, where a beautiful young woman with supernatural powers finds herself surrounded by intrigue and threats to her life","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IlLZwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Silver+Wolf&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All My Friends Are Superheroes","description":"All Tom's friends really are superheroes.

Written by the world's leading authority on Celtic culture Druidism was one of the greatest and most exalting adventures of the human spirit, attempting to reconcile the unreconcilable, the individual and the collective, creator and created, good and evil, day and night, past and future, and life and death. Because of the oral nature of Celtic civilization our understanding of its spiritual truths and rituals is necessarily incomplete. Yet evidence exists that can provide the modern reader with a better understanding of the doctrine that took druidic apprentices 20 years to learn in the remote forests of the British Isles and Gaul. Using the descriptions of the druids and their beliefs provided by the historians and chroniclers of classic antiquity--as well as those recorded by the insular Celts themselves when compelled, under Christianity's influence, to utilize writing to preserve their ancestral traditions--Jean Markale painstakingly pieces together all that is known for certain about them. The druids were more than simply the priests of the Celtic people; their influence extended to all aspects of Celtic life. The Druids covers everything concerning the Celtic religious domain, intellectual speculations, cultural or magical practices, various beliefs, and the so-called profane sciences that have come down from the Celtic priesthood.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CejpHAAACAAJ&dq=Druids&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The case of the innocent victims","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-bvDxwEACAAJ&dq=The+case+of+the+innocent+victims&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRONTIER, THE","description":"This is a new, updated edition of the great metaphysical classic, first published in 1963, which began a whole new trend in popular thinking & is even more applicable to humanity than ever.

Do you want a success that of your childhood hero? Do you want to lead people in your social or spiritual motive? Superficially, Nothing Succeeds than Success revolves around these questions. However, rather than answering them and giving an evergreen formula of success, it simply says: \\"You decide\\". It goes one step ahead by provoking the introspection nerve of the reader. It emphasizes on personalizing one's success in order to gain a psychologically authoritative control over it. It does so, as the quest for success does not start with you. It starts with I the I for Introspection: Why do I want to succeed? How do I define success? Whom do I consider to be inspirational? How do I look at his stuff? The urge for an evergreen success formula makes us think of successful people's success and define our own. In this never ending quest for success, the book categorizes successful people whose kind of success we dream to imitate. With each category of successful people, it makes us talk to our various states of mind to put it into plain words: our most obvious rational and emotional responses when we think of a given success and the achiever. At every conclusive stage, it suggests an ideal approach of mind. No, it does not relate it to the end result that we identify plainly as success or failure. It helps us keep on the track of success journey the journey which is vulnerable to a premature STOP by red-signals of self-analysis that results from what we commonly recognize as inspirational stuff. Pondering on finer pros and cons of such self-analysis, attacking the cons to cure the evils of lack of success', it concludes with a highly contradictory purpose-neutral approach that is recommended not only for success, but for life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NXG-wAEACAAJ&dq=Nothing+Succeeds+than+Success:+An+Approach+to+Inspiration+and+Success&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beauty Before Comfort: The Story of an American Original","description":"In a heartwarming, incisive memoir, the author chronicles the story of her grandmother, Aneita Jean Blair, and her life in Chester, West Virginia, a blue-collar factory town, during the 1920s, the Great Depression, and the Second World War.

In 1988 the University of Arkansas Press published Billy Collins s The Apple That Astonished Paris, his  first real book of poems,  as he describes it in a new, delightful preface written expressly for this new printing to help celebrate both the Press s twenty-fifth anniversary and this book, one of the Press s all-time best sellers. In his usual witty and dry style, Collins writes,  I gathered together what I considered my best poems and threw them in the mail.  After  what seemed like a very long time  Press director Miller Williams, a poet as well, returned the poems to him in the  familiar self-addressed, stamped envelope.  He told Collins that there was good work here but that there was work to be done before he d have a real collection he and the Press could be proud of:  Williams s words were more encouragement than I had ever gotten before and more than enough to inspire me to begin taking my writing more seriously than I had before.  This collection includes some of Collins s most anthologized poems, including  Introduction to Poetry,   Another Reason Why I Don t Keep a Gun in the House,  and  Advice to Writers.  Its success over the years is testament to Collins s talent as one of our best poets, and as he writes in the preface,  this new edition . . . is a credit to the sustained vibrancy of the University of Arkansas Press and, I suspect, to the abiding spirit of its former director, my first editorial father.

Emblazoned with the nude figures of a man and a woman, etched representations of our human form, the Pioneer generation of probes were aptly named. Launched into the inky depths of space, they were more than mere machines, they were humanity's first emissaries into deep space. And the pictorial inscriptions that adorned the crafts embodied the hopes and dreams of everyone involved in the Pioneer program. They were our humble attempt to communicate with the extraterrestrial intelligent life we imagined the probes might encounter -- they were our message in a bottle. Perhaps the most efficient, reliable, and cost effective program to come out of NASA, the Pioneer missions are a shining example of how a small and talented group of people can, against all odds, pull something off that has never been done before. Indeed, more than thirty years after its launch in 1972, Pioneer 10 is still cruising into interstellar space, sending back data as it courses through the galaxy while Pioneer 6, in solar orbit, is more than 35 years old and humankind's oldest functioning spacecraft. But despite their enduring contributions, the Pioneer project remains a footnote in space history, little more than a humble prologue to its inheritors. The Depths of Space recounts the long overdue history of Pioneer both as a scientific and technological achievement and as the story of the exceptional people who made the program possible. This tight narrative captures the black-coffee buzz of full-throttle, deadline-driven production, the sharp, intense thrill of discovery, the pang of anxiety that accompanies looming danger and ultimate loss, and the satisfaction and pride of creating an enduring legacy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3eekqPQMlycC&dq=The+Depths+of+Space:+The+Story+of+the+Pioneer+Planetary+Probes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best of Edison Science Teaching Kits","description":"A collection of science projects and experiments covering such areas as energy, the environment, magnetism, electricity and other miscellaneous subjects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uMLBxQEACAAJ&dq=The+Best+of+Edison+Science+Teaching+Kits&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alaska (America the Beautiful, Second)","description":"America the Beautiful: Alaska & Hawaii is the second in a series of grayscale coloring books showcasing America.

Another possibility, which is also especially suited for in-service teachers of high school geometry, is to survey the the fundamentals of absolute geometry (Chapters 1 -20) very quickly and begin earnest study with the theory of parallels and isometries (Chapters 21 -30). The text is self-contained, except that the elementary calculus is assumed for some parts of the material on advanced hyperbolic geometry (Chapters 31 -34). There are over 650 exercises, 30 of which are 10-part true-or-false questions. A rigorous ruler-and-protractor axiomatic development of the Euclidean and hyperbolic planes, including the classification of the isometries of these planes, is balanced by the discussion about this development. Models, such as Taxicab Geometry, are used exten sively to illustrate theory. Historical aspects and alternatives to the selected axioms are prominent. The classical axiom systems of Euclid and Hilbert are discussed, as are axiom systems for three and four-dimensional absolute geometry and Pieri's system based on rigid motions.

This book attempts to help clarify and explain why Mexican real estate, when using the proper safeguards, can be a terrific, secure investment. It will also explore the purchasing mistakes of the past, summarize several of the attractive new locations that are luring foreign dollars and explain why Mexico is so eager to welcome second home buyers from outside its borders. The worst thing a potential purchaser can do is to remain ignorant of the law and procedures involved in the conveyance of real estate in a foreign country. As we state several times in this book, Mexico is not the perceived \\"Wild West\\" where anything goes and the prevailing Mexican attitude is \\"trust me, no problema.\\" It is inherently important for non-Mexican buyers to understand that Mexico has formality of law with authorized regulation of real estate development procedures at all levels. This process is coupled with a statutory government framework for the legal conveyance of real property. Great personal wealth has been attained through real estate ownership, but for most of us, it has been limited to investment in a primary residence. Although Mexican real estate also can be a viable investment venue, Americans have had a great deal more trepidation considering properties \\"south of the border.\\" And for good reason--considering the history of some acquisitions. Given today's investment climate, however, Mexico provides an attractive, alternative arena for potential investment. Real estate in Mexico should have a similar appreciation \\"upside\\" as does real estate in a U.S. development--coupled with the advantage of use and enjoyment of the property as a vacation residence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=70HIteyQWIgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","description":"The Jefferson Bible, or The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth as it is formally titled, was a book constructed by Thomas Jefferson in the latter years of his life by cutting and pasting numerous sections from various Bibles as extractions of the doctrine of Jesus.
