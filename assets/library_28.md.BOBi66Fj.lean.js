I enjoyed it and learned a lot. Java NIO is good book, but this is much better and simpler."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"This is a great book, honestly I have using a lot of its know-how on my job.My advise is that all reader should know the decorator pattern to understand better the class structure, and I hope in the next version add some information about it."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"Not a fan of O'Reilly books, but this one stands out because of excellent NIO coverage and topical examples. It beats the the \\"Java NIO\\" book from O'Reilly hands down. Overall I'd say this book is geared for those who want to implement but covers enough detail that it probably even soothes the more 'academic' out there (those who talk a good show but do not build real-world software).Some highlights:- You'll find good coverage of cryptographic I/O aimed at practical implementation.- Excellent NIO coverage (including basic network servers in sync and async patterns)- ZIP and JAR information including dynamic class loading- Serial, USB and Bluetooth chapters (caveat: I don't use these but read them out of curiousity)- Detailed coverage of readers/writers- And obviously good coverage of the basic java.io/net packages.As of Septemebr 2006 I find the book topical and current (even had some examples of future Java 6 code). To give you an idea of the detail offered here, there is a whole chapter (37 pages) of information on File access alone including pitfalls of cross-platform implementation. Not reading/writing files...just the trappings of opening and accessing files and directories using particular patterns, URLs, etc. The actual I/O is covered in similar depth in other chapters.I'd also like to say that I highly appreciate examples that are concise and independant. There is nothing more frustrating than flipping to the middle of a book (what we all do anyway) and going through an example...only to find out that the author is using opaque references to classes and methods he/she developed on their own in five earlier chapters (bouncycastle APIs in Java Cryto for example). This pretty much makes quick-reference difficult to impossible and this book thankfully avoids it in spades.I give it five starts because it'll be well used in several projects and because it is readable and accessible to both novice and advanced developers alike."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"Great tutorial-like introduction to the Java I/O classes. Not a reference but very useful. A must buy if you want to boost your coding productivity. Plus it has the only discussion of Java-based serial and parallel port I/O that I've seen. One or two small rough spots but well worth the $'s."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"This is an excellent book.After jumping around and reading about a third of it, I was already recommending to some of the newer Java programmers around me to pick it up and get a solid understanding of proper I/O use in Java. I very much recommend this as any Java programmer's second book. Right after learning the language itself, this book should be read followed closely by other O'Reilly titles such as Java Threads and Java Network Programming. Those three books will give an in-depth understanding of the core Java API's for any new Java programmer, and will be of use to you no matter how you are using Java.Even after three years as a Java developer, I have learned from this book. The author often presents algorithms in clear steps and follows those clear steps with a correct implementation. Because of this clear presentation, the chapter on compression left me for the first time with an understanding of not only how to use the java.util.zip.* classes but how they work. What I learned there in one reading is immediately applicable to what I am working on now. The sections on Files is full of tips on how to use them in a cross platform fashion. Every new Java programmer needs to read that chapter before their applications actually get used.I was also impressed that several I/O classes missing in the standard library which I have only recently developed myself were presented as well. The StreamCopier and the TeeOutputStream are extremely useful classes that should be incorporated in some fashion into the base API. I wish I had them a long time ago. (A hint: you can also use the TeeOutputStream as a 'Traitor' to peek at your I/O while your program is running and without affecting its execution.) If I have any complaint about this book, it is that there are not more of these types of utilities presented for use by the advanced Java programmer. However, I haven't finished the book yet, so they may still be hidden there."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"The first edition of Java I/O is now seven years old, and it is definitely time for a second edition considering all that has transpired. Note that the second edition was released in May 2006, so all reviews older than that are referring to the first edition. In this second edition there are basically eight entirely new chapters added to the original seventeen. It is probably worth the price of an upgrade especially if you are interested in Java I/O as it pertains to devices. I review this second edition in the context of comparing it to the first edition.Chapters 1 through 5 are virtually the same.Chapter six, \\"Filter Streams\\", has had one section - Print Streams - removed and had another section on the ProgressMonitorInputStream class added. ProgressMonitorInputStream is a unique filter stream hiding in the javax.swing package that displays progress bars that indicate how much of a stream has been read and how much remains to be read, and this book shows how to use it when reading unusually large files. The section on Print Streams that was removed from chapter six now has an entire chapter dedicated to it. This is because, starting in Java 5, the familiar PrintStream class has become a lot more powerful and interesting. Besides basic console output, it now provides extensive capabilities for formatting numbers and dates in a straightforward and easy fashion.The chapters on data streams, streams in memory, and compressing streams are virtually unchanged from the first edition. However, the \\"Jar Files\\" section from the \\"compressing streams\\" chapter has been removed and now has an entire chapter dedicated to it. In this chapter, among other topics, the author explains the Pack200 compression format and evangelizes the increasingly popular technique of hiding noncode resources like images and data files inside JAR files. The two chapters on cryptographic streams and object serialization are basically the same as before, except that one section has been added on the JavaDoc in the serialization chapter.The next section of the book, on New I/O, is completely new material and is comprised of three chapters. The java.nio packages provide nonblocking and memory-mapped I/O, and chapters 14 through 16 cover these powerful new abilities in depth. The new I/O model is based on channels and buffers instead of streams. This model doesn't replace traditional stream-based I/O for many uses. However, it is significantly faster in one important use case: servers that process many simultaneous clients.The next two sections of the book, \\"The File System\\" and \\"Text\\", pretty much mimic chapters 12 through 16 of the first edition.The final section of the book, \\"Devices\\", has almost completely new material. Some of the most exciting developments since the first edition have occurred in the world of small devices,in both peripherals such as GPS receivers that connect to a host computer and devices such as Palm Pilots that are themselves increasingly powerful computers. Treatment of both of these has been dramatically expanded in this edition. For those readers working with serial and parallel port devices, the Java Communications API chapter has been upgraded to version 3.0. However, in 2006 more and more devices use faster USB ports instead. Consequently, Chapter 23 covers the new Java USB API in depth. For smaller devices that can't quite run full Java but need to perform I/O nonetheless, J2ME offers the Generic Connection Framework (GCF). Chapter 24 covers this alternative to the traditional I/O framework. Finally, Chapter 25 uses the GCF to communicate over one of the newest I/O buses, the Bluetooth API used for wireless communications with a variety of peripherals.I was very pleased with the first edition of this book, and I have an even higher recommendation for this second edition. There are clear descriptions of how to use the Java I/O classes as well as well-commented code examples for everything. However, if you are just recently coming from a C or C++ programming perspective, the Java I/O model is so different that it will likely be a shock no matter how good the teacher is, and Mr. Harold is an excellent one.

Other books never really explained what was going on to the extent that I could ever trust myself to write I/O code without having a book open.This book clearly explains the theory and practice of Java I/O, and all the various features. It's the second most valuable Java book I own (Java in a Nutshell being the most frequently used). The book has led me to trying out facilities (such as compression and number formatting) that I otherwise shunned because of poor descriptions."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"The basis of Java is to make hard things easy and easy things impossible. And among one of these impossibilites is standard I/O.After having tried almost every single I/O class in Java and having been only able to get FileReader and FileWriter to work successfully, I decided to buy this book. I was afraid that I would get it and it would be so technical that only people who wear pocket protectors as their standard gear would be able to read it, but this was not a problem. Mr. Harrold was perfectly willing to lay everything out just as clearly as was physically possible, while at the same time still giving an equal amount of importance to examples.Other reviewers seem to have viewed this as a weakness in the book, but personally, I would say that having an extra 50% percent of stuff you will never need is better than only having half of what is necessary to accomplish anything.Due to my having bought this book, in the last month I have gone from basic file reading and writing, building my own file reader with a readLine() method of my own make since Sun's is buggy, to internet connections to having most recently written a proxy that logs all events that go on in my internet browser by concurrently handling six I/O operations(an in from the internet to two outs to my browser and log file, and an in from my browser to the two outs of the internet and my log file.) And I say this not to boast my prowess, but to show you just how valuable this book is to anyone who will be doing any Java programming that involves I/O."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"I'm a C++ programmer that has given himself a crash-course in Java for a project at work. If I had this book earlier, I would have gotten things done a lot faster. Every programmer should be familiar with input and output streams, but how many can say they know the in's and out's of Java's cryptographic streams and piped streams? If asked, could you tell the difference between a BufferedWriter and a PrintWriter? I had to use three books to accumulate the knowledge I could have gained by just reading this one book. If you are a beginning or intermediate Java programmer, don't assume you know everything about Java I/O and what it can do; check out the pearls of wisdom in this book. Needless to say, now I'm writing much better I/O-related Java code because of it, and I believe you will too."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"First of all, this is not a reference, it explains the organization behind the I/O Library. If you are looking for a reference book to locate answers in under a minute this ISN'T the book for you, instead get 'Java in a Nutshell'. Second of all, this book helps you to learn the I/O classes by constructing a program that you modify throughout the book. If that will annoy you, don't get this book. Overall, I think this is a great book! It was well worth the investment. I had previously encountered I/O documentation in more broadly scoped Java books such as, Beginning Java, in other words not much detail. This book, however, blew me away with its detail, but it is presented in a very down to earth manner. In other words, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand what's going on. This book will take you from the top of the I/O class hierarchy and move you down into the specialized sub-classes. All the while explaining to you what each of the classes does and like I said before, a lot of supporting details. Best of all, this book helps you understand I/O by showing you how Sun logically organized the I/O Library. By the time you've finished the book it's much easier to understand how all of the classes come together to offer powerful I/O support. Before I read this book when I looked at the inheritance tree for the I/O Library my reponse was like &quot;you've got to be kidding me! I'll never be able to get all of this down!&quot;. But after finishing this book I am in no way intimidated or confused by the I/O classes. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"For many programmers who started off using the command line as their primary I/O source, the Java system is a bit unusual. The simple, straightforward style of C is completely different than the various classes in Java. After reading through this book and delving into a few examples, Java's I/O classes became much clearer. The class structure makes a lot of sense, separating formatting from actual reading and writing, and allows for a great deal of flexibility. Although the author maligns the old command line style, much of the java.io package is based on streams and pipes from the Unix paradigm. This somewhat flippant disregard for the command line is my only major beef with the book. Otherwise, I found it to be very readable and handled all of the topics well."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"Frankly, EVERY Java program deals with I/O in some form or another. Yet no topic could have been ignored, or trivialised in so many books. Finally, here is a good book that is concise, to the point and yet very lucid.Whether you are a Java novice or a guru, this is a 'must have' book on your shelf."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"Thorough guide to the java.(n)io API. Less useful as a cookbook as the organization of the book follows the API rather than focusing on specific tasks (e.g. how to best copy a file). Could have done without some of the cool chapters such as the one on J2ME (better treated in other books), or the one that describes hooking up a temperature sensor via USB, or a GPS via Bluetooth (publish these projects in a blog). Could also cut the rants about how outdated command line applications are, and I don't think the Swing-based file browser application that's built up throughout the book adds much. On the other hand I'd rather have more on performance considerations and error handling strategies!"},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"I've read many different Java books but most of them covered just the basics of Java I/O. I really got this book because I was interested in working with packet protocols in Java. The book covers many topics very clearily and I recommend it very highly. I enjoyed this book so much, I purchased Harold's other book &quot;Java Network Programming&quot;."},{"Title":"Costume Design: Techniques of Modern Masters","review":"I have searched for this book in hardback form and I am so glad it is back as a paperback. The conversations with the designers are invigorating and enlightening for all of us in the design business. It is also a constant source for excellence in costume renderings. I find myself going back to the pages over and over again for refinement and inspiration in my own rendering techniques. A must have for every costume designer!"},{"Title":"Costume Design: Techniques of Modern Masters","review":"While this book is absolutely gorgeous, it isn't a book *about* costume rendering. It's not a how-to book, but I'll add that it's a wonderful book for inspiration. The text portion (that I find is often skipped over in favor of looking at the pretty pictures) is worth a read as well, since it goes into some detail on various costumers' processes. Good book, but not an essential read for costume students."},{"Title":"Costume Design: Techniques of Modern Masters","review":"This is a great book that I bought when I was starting out in costuming. I found it to be a fun read for those who are interested in costume design. It isn't really a resourse book, but if you love costuming or design, it has wonderful interviews with famous costume designers that I found interesting and inspiring. For those times of the year that I wonder why I am still in the costume business (October) this is a great book to rekindle my love for design and theatre. The renderings are beautiful. For designers who do renderings, these would be good to refer to, to see different styles of presentation."},{"Title":"Costume Design: Techniques of Modern Masters","review":"As a student in costume design, I found this book to be of great interest and indeed help in gaining a deeper understanding of the challenges facing costume designers.The writing documents interviews of 18 professionals who tell about their lives and careers, the joys and difficulties of costume designing and the odd tip for aspiring studentsThe designer's sketches are plentiful and in glorious colour and while the book would not suit as a text book for costume design methodology it is an excellent source of inspiration."},{"Title":"Costume Design: Techniques of Modern Masters","review":"This book is filled with sketches from some of the best costume designers alive! The chance to see the different sketching styles and read their interviews is a rare opportunity. The book scratches the surface, giving only few pages to each designer, but I felt that the wide scope of the book was a positive balance to that. Each designer represented is interviewed for several pages and offer their unique perspective on costume design.Every costume design student should own this book and Lynn Pecktal needs to get working on the sequel!"},{"Title":"Costume Design: Techniques of Modern Masters","review":"I absolutely love this book it is so inspiring and every interview provides a new outlook on costuming.

Well worth the price."},{"Title":"Elementary Platen Presswork","review":"As a printer with a C & P platten press (1912 new series letterpress), I was having trouble locking up forms and getting good impressions. This book, Elementary Platen Presswork, really explained the process so I could do it correctly. It describes in basic terms the step-by-step process for all aspects of letterpress printing. For me, it explained in simple terms what I did not understand, and my printing is markedly improved with this classic book which was first published many years ago by Ralph W. Polk, an expert in teaching letterpress when it is a vocation, and not a avocation."},{"Title":"Elementary Platen Presswork","review":"My copy of this book goes back to my father's print shop in a spare bedroom of a house in Amarillo, TX, where, as a newborn infant, I first heard the clatter of the press. That's six and a half decades ago. Much of the information in this book is, for me, a repeat of the many things my father taught me about printing, back in the days before everyone was offset & laserjet. I consider this book (and its companion volume, \\"The Practice of Printing\\") as absolute necessities for anyone who's thinking of setting up a letterpress shop.I don't know how many young people I've met starting off in letterpress printing without the least bit of training, fighting with simple things like locking up a form and makeready. To every one of them I have recommended a good couple hours a day reading -- yes, reading -- this book and its companion volume. Every single thing you need to know as a printer is in this book. Every single thing: from rollers to impression, adjustment and lubrication, feeding and clean up. It's all here.If you're looking for a book to help you set up shop, you must start with this book. If you're experienced even by decades in letterpress, this book is a good source of reference and something you absolutely must introduce to newcomers if only to pass on what you know.Country simple and straight out, no letterpress printer should be without this book!"},{"Title":"Elementary Platen Presswork","review":"Presswork is a new hobby and this book is wonderful. Even though it was written 1931 all the information is still relevant today. The step by step picture tutorials are great and the detailed information on the different presses is a real help to someone just starting out. While I have no desire to print pictures this topic is covered in depth as well which I am sure would help many people.This book doesn't every minute detail of presswork, that comes with experience, it will however get you started on a fun path of creativity and possible a business if so inclined."},{"Title":"Cheap Thrills New York: Great NYC Meals for Under $15 (Cheap Thrills series)","review":"This is a restaurant guide for those of you looking for really good food with a wide variety of ethnic cuisine and without the ridiculously pompous nature of your typical five-star. If you go out to eat for the snooty service and to drop a bunch of money, don't buy this book. However, if your focus is on the quality and variety of the food you are eating, with fancy service as a secondary concern, this is the book for you. That is not to say the restaurants in this book lack decent service....Many have excellent service and swanky locals. Some may also have dismal decor and downright cranky staff (read hole-in-the-wall). But they all have great food in common. One of the great things about New York is experiencing the wide variety of flavors and cooking styles available in this melting pot. You won't find me in New York without this book close by."},{"Title":"Linux System Administration White Papers: A Compilation of Technical Documents for System Administrators","review":"Great material, especially for administrators who are fairly new to Linux (and, let's face it, there are a lot of us out there). You can get the material online, but the book is great as a reference manual while you're at a terminal session."},{"Title":"Lanterns on the levee: Recollections of a planter's son","review":"This is one of those books that is almost impossible to objectively review. The writing is elegant and evocative of an era in the South that died almost in tandem with Mr. Percy and yet I find some parts of it so arrogant and condescending that I feel myself grinding my teeth. You see, I am descended from those Mississippi hill people Percy so despised and, even after all this time, I can almost see the languid gaze and soft, drawling voice. My people came to the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta after the Flood of '27 and we build and earned what we got without the benefit of the massive slave labor that built Mr. Percy's fortune.But this is a book review and I'll put aside old feelings to say that this is a literary gem that brings to life a way of life on which so many stereotypes of the South are built. And Will Percy is amazingly honest in his descriptions of his society. However, a society this simple and yet this complex takes more than just one book to grasp.Thus, I also recommend \\"Rising Tide\\" by John Barry and \\"The Most Southern Place on Earth: The Mississippi Delta and the Roots of Regional Identity\\" by James Cobb to balance your view of this time and place in history.Bottom line: This is a wonderful, beautifully written story that is refreshingly candid with none of the defensiveness and politically correct breast beating of many of the works of southern writers of recent years."},{"Title":"Lanterns on the levee: Recollections of a planter's son","review":"Elegantly written with a cadence all its own, William Alexander Percy's memoir provides an unreconstructed view of another time. Percy's sense of the dying southern aristocracy and the corresponding decline of his place in the South represents a vivid picture of life on the Delta for the large planter class. Percy's South required his life to be governed by a sense of noblesse oblige, but through his eyes one can watch this notion slowly wither away. For the unprepared, beware, Percy does not lack for ego, but this might be expected from one who felt the position he held required him to heed to a higher code. If you enjoy true southern literature then you will find this memoir highly satisfying."},{"Title":"Lanterns on the levee: Recollections of a planter's son","review":"Percy's approach to life can be summed up by a quote from the book: \\"It is a very nice world-that is, if you remember that while morals are all-important between the Lord and His creatures, what counts between one creature and another is good manners.\\" Percy's book is a rare member of that most elusive category of books - the autobiography of true literary quality. Percy's touch is honest without being journalistic; poetic without appearing over-embroidered; and in his own eccentric person he provides the subject matter which is required to make such a work interesting. He steps out of the late 19th/early 20th century Mississippi delta as a character that could not have existed anywhere else. Affected, genteel, kind, elitist, romantic and with a view of race more in keeping with British Imperial \\"white man's burden\\" line of thought than anything American in origin - Percy the character remains fascinating even as the modern reader disagrees with his positions. A clearly and well told tale of an extinct breed (the gentrified southern aristocrat), a lost land (the Mississippi delta of the turn of the 20th century), and a buried epoch (the pre desegregation era). An excellent book - well worth reading not only to better understand a particular aspect of American history but for the pleasure of reading a well written book, regardless of the subject matter."},{"Title":"Lanterns on the levee: Recollections of a planter's son","review":"It is true that this book attempts to explain the South, in both its physical and social aspects, from the point of view of the \\"landed gentry.\\" However, a more accurate description of \\"Lanterns on the Levee\\" is that of an autobiography of William A. Percy, in which he reflects upon his life and the interesting times in which he lived. I found this book very inciteful into the mind of a southerner, and believe that Mr. Percy did a fine job of bringing his broad experiences with different cultures and social climates into this book, and using these to produce a cogent analysis of his homeland. Though not completely objective (and often bigoted by today's standards), I think that Mr. Percy did his best to \\"tell it as he saw it,\\" and often admits his biases as a precursor to his analysis. The book is very poetic and philosophical in places, and includes both the subjective and emotional sentiments that one must understand in order to come to terms with \\"a southerner's love for the south.\\" Additionally, I feel that Mr. Percy (especially in his last few chapters) provides the reader with thought-provoking and highly articulate observations about life, time, and human-nature. I think this book is excellent, and believe it to be a \\"must read\\" for anybody with an open-minded interest in the Missisippi Delta region, or the South in general."},{"Title":"Lanterns on the levee: Recollections of a planter's son","review":"I needed an unabridged dictionary, and a dictionary of cultural literacy to get through this book. Well worth the trouble. Percy's command of the English language is unparalleled. After reading this book, you too will be envious of his education. If you like the book Rising Tide, about the Mississippi flood of 1927, then get this book. I have given this book to more friends than any other book."},{"Title":"Lanterns on the levee: Recollections of a planter's son","review":"This is about Southern life, but I think it goes beyond that. I think Percy tries to go beyond the sterotypes of the South that are so commonly held by those who do not live in the South so that the South can be better understood. In doing that, I think he speaks of those sterotypes in a way that makes me, at least, realize that much of our thinking (not just about the South), but especially about modern life, is clouded by sterotypes, too. It is as if we so easily accept stereotypes in so many aspects of our lives (and I think Percy felt the same way) that few of us really understand ourselves, how we think or how we live. Finally, he is an excellent writer and a great story teller. Taken altogether, I think it is a true gem of American literature. It is one of those books I truly love to discover. Bravo, William Alexander Percy!"},{"Title":"Lanterns on the levee: Recollections of a planter's son","review":"To read this book is to truly appreciate the best the Southern aristocracy had to offer us. Mr. Percy writes of a world very different from ours, and in many ways better. As his own world slipped away from him, he wrote, as no one has, of what was in it worth preserving."},{"Title":"Lanterns on the levee: Recollections of a planter's son","review":"There have been several excellent reviews of this book. I agree with most of them. This book is worth reading even if only as an exercise in literary appreciation. There was once a time, Camelot I suppose, when people actually did think and speak with poise, elegance and most impressively, wit. I value the works of D. K. Chesterton for the same reasons. Percy certainly fits that mold.I, like Nolan Bond (see his review), am also descended from those red-neck hill people that Percy puts firmly on the bottom of the social ladder. I am old enough to know that they possessed many of the same values and qualities he did though without the aristocratic poise. My Dad, Grand-father and Great Grand father would have been tolerated by his family but never quite accepted as equals. However, what Percy does is so solidly evoke the admirable qualities of a life which is intent upon transcending the vulgar, that even his elitism is charming. His remembrances of his father are so vivid and so superior to the statement of his own life, that I can admire his dad even where I just chuckle at Percy himself.But you have to let that go. It is the wit that makes the book worth buying. The capacity to use the language as it ought to be used, understated when most deadly, evocative when most descriptive, charming throughout, which makes one yearn to have one more real conversation before death and boredom actually prevail.Percy is without illusion about himself. He is fearless in his appreciation of those qualities transmitted to himself as well as in his own failure to rise to the nobility they require. He never matches his dad, in his own eyes or otherwise. But along the way, he reminds us that poverty is not impediment to quality, and that true freedom begins with an internal conviction. Percy does not hesitate to consider that some men are superior to others - in that he was free of certain bonds which enslave us. He was thereby able to transcend all cultures and be at home, and appreciative, in them all.It is a life worth living, even if it wasn't always comfortable."},{"Title":"Lanterns on the levee: Recollections of a planter's son","review":"Noble, refined, and distinctly tragic in sentiment, this book captures the proud soul of William Percy in eloquent prose. A man, in love with a vision of what is best in the world, in love with what is best in his fellow men, in love with what is best in his home emerges from these pages. He stands defiant in defense of the vision, despite all its imperfections, confident that its beauty outshines its faults. The book stands not only as a proud memorial to a noble vision that has passed into history, but a testimony to the beauty of the human spirit that continues to animate men to strive for nobility of life and the security virtues."},{"Title":"Lanterns on the levee: Recollections of a planter's son","review":"I've known the name Will Percy all my life. One of the largest grave markers in the Greenville cemetery bears the name PERCY. My father, George Robinson, was often invited to the estate to play tennis with the Percy boys. He fit in well because he, too, was orphaned at an early age. People of all ages and classes loved the levee. On hot summer evenings, it was a place to catch a cool breeze coming in off the river. When I was less than a year old, the levee gave up and the river came into Greenville.Will Percy's prose is beautiful, and his ability to tell a story delightful. This is truly the way life was in the early days, with all the charms and prejudices of the times. The book must be read with an open mind for what it is; a well-crafted glimpse of a slice of life. It was never intended to be a statement of mores. \\"Lanterns on the Levee\\" is so descriptive, you can almost hear the sound of the river boats and smell the rich soil of the Delta as you read. I'm so glad the book is still in print!"},{"Title":"Lanterns on the levee: Recollections of a planter's son","review":"Percy's autobiogrpahy offers excellent insights into the heart and mind of those of his class (as close to an agricultural elite as this country has ever produced. But the best of this book is offered unconsciously, by accident or indirection.If you're only going to read one book about the South, or about this elite, read John Barry's Rising Tide, a truly brilliant and magnificently-- almost breathtakingly-- written book. There you gte all of Percy's story plus more perspective and deeper understanding-- indeed, RT may even give you a deeper understanding of Percy than his autobuiography does.If you're going to read 2 books on the South, then read RT and Mind of the South by Cash. Cash focuses more on the mindset of the rednecks, while Percy is very much an aristocrat. To a certain extent the Percy and Cash books complement each other. In fact, to Percy the word &quot;anglo-saxon&quot; was an insult. He considered himself descended from the Norman conquerors of the Anglo-saxons, and saw them as serfs. That little insight comes from Rising Tide."},{"Title":"Lanterns on the levee: Recollections of a planter's son","review":"Lanterns On The Levee - Recollections Of A Planter's SonPercy certainly reflects the 'Southern' aristocratic view. Carving the wilderness to a way of life. The Percy vision manifested itself in the plantations of Greenville & the monster riverport on 'Ole man river.'But it goes to their very soul. The idiosyncrasies make it a great read, just for the flavor."},{"Title":"Lanterns on the levee: Recollections of a planter's son","review":"A modern reader may at first react to this beautiful book as if he had stumbled across the mummy of an antediluvian nobleman, complete with mummy wrappings in hieroglyphics that tell of life in the good old days before the Hittites came. But the Delta is not that of the Nile but of the Mississippi, and the Flood is not that of Noah but of 1927. The peasants are not the fellahin but the sharecroppers. This is the thrice-vanished world of the mint julep and the veranda, of Vardaman and Bilbo, of the Klan repulsed, the Belgians rescued, and Sewanee remembered. The style is not merely magnificent but perfect. The anecdotes are priceless. The tone is condescending without being aware of itself. The story of a besieged aristocracy in the midst of the wrangle between the Negro and the Redneck is gripping, although perhaps one could have wished that Percy might not have been quite so hostile to the latter. On page 99 of the Louisiana State edition, Percy quotes at length from a magnificent poem (\\"I dreamed last night of a dome of beaten gold...\\") and then calmly fails to identify the poet, as if it didn't matter. It was Stephen Phillips. There is a whole hilarious (except to the liberals) chapter on Fode, but the one thing that Percy doesn't say is that Fode was his boyfriend, along with some other black boys. Percy quotes none of his own poetry and tells you nothing about his homosexuality. He says nothing about his first (white) boyfriend, Harold Bruff. This silence is typical of the period. There is an introduction by Walker Percy that fails to convey the ingratitude that the latter felt towards his rescuer after the death of Walker's mother."},{"Title":"Lanterns on the levee: Recollections of a planter's son","review":"I was disappointed that Percy's nephew felt the need to apologize for his uncle's comments about black people.Of course Percy wouldn't be considered politically correct today, and he was certainly a racist in the context that he saw blacks as inferior, but that's the beauty of the book; it gives an unvarnished look into the way upper class white Delta people saw the world that surrounded them.I have just finished writing a book about a 1940s sheriff in South Texas and found Lanterns on the Levee invaluable in helping me understand the Jim Crow era."},{"Title":"Lanterns on the levee: Recollections of a planter's son","review":"&#34;Recollections of a Planter's Son&#34; says it all, really. Born in 1885, William Alexander Percy's identity seemed to be based mainly on being the offspring of quality folks; his own life and times seem small potatoes in comparison. He contrasts the grand values of the aristocrat against tawdry modern &#34;survival values&#34;, which makes for fascinating reading: &#34;As a class I suppose the Southern aristocrat is extinct, but what that class despised as vulgar and treasured as excellent is still despised and treasured by individuals scattered thickly from one end of the South to the other...their distinguishing characteristic probably is that their hearts are set, not on the virtues which make surviving possible, but on those which make it worthwhile.&#34; Peopled with interesting characters, and brimming with charming anecdotes, Percy's book also lays some heavy truths on you: &#34;The good die when they should live; the evil live when they should die; heroes perish and cowards escape; noble efforts do not succeed because they are noble, and wickedness is not consumed in its own nature.&#34; But, most of all, he confronts the reader with his brutally honest take on racial relations between blacks and whites. Whether you agree with him or not, you have to give him props for being brave enough to present his viewpoint. On the one hand, I could see where he was coming from; he felt a lingering noblesse oblige toward black people. On the other hand, he got on my nerves whining about the sympathy and pity white men who live among black people deserve, because of &#34;the moral climate in which the well-meaning, puzzled, exasperated Southern white man, day in and day out, pursues his foggy way in his dealings with the Southern Negro.&#34; If black people were a &#34;problem&#34;, it was one of white people's own making. It was amusing to read of Percy's chagrin when the black people in his life made a fool of him, or proved too slippery for his understanding or control. His thinking was that black people were children needing to be led, and their tragic flaw was distrust of leadership, black or white. This child of a Master seemed to be perpetually surprised at the distrust of slavery's children. I suspect a lot of his noblesse oblige was really guilt feelings, and he was hurt when black people scorned his olive branch. He was kind of like a male Mildred Pierce with a drawl. He almost wails Shakespeare's immortal line: &#34;How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child!&#34; Read it and see what you think."},{"Title":"Lanterns on the levee: Recollections of a planter's son","review":"This well-written life was interesting to me for what it had to say about the position of some liberal aristocratic Southern whites in relation to the cotton economy in the first half of the 20th century, and in their struggles to keep down the Ku Klux Klan and retain black field labor when blacks were naturally heading north. It also tells an important part of the story of the terrible Mississippi flood of 1927, that put huge parts of the Mississippi delta under water, forcing whites and blacks onto the levees to save themselves and their livestock from drowning. After the flood, at least around Percy's home town of Greenville, the blacks were then conscripted (i.e., put back in slavery) to force them to fight the flood and then, the plan was, to make sure they didn't flee north and would return to cotton work instead. It's a pretty sickening story and one that reminds Americans that racial slavery essentially continued in this country far into the 20th century. Think about the fact that the Mississippi of 1964 was only about 35 years removed from the events of 1927 and you have some idea of what the civil rights movement of the 1960s was still up against in at least one state."},{"Title":"Lanterns on the levee: Recollections of a planter's son","review":"I didn't know this was going to be a one man biography....had expected more detail of Mississippi and the south over this period of time."},{"Title":"Lanterns on the levee: Recollections of a planter's son","review":"I've heard great things about this book, but it simply doesn't live up to the reviews.

Do not speak badly of anyone. Do not tell anyone you have problems - problems are what others will bring to you; you are the queen. If you have trouble, act happy. Now you have to walk behind me. That is how it is done on Yaqui. Oh, and one more thing. When I get up in the morning? I want you to make the bed first thing. Then cook my breakfast - two eggs over easy. One tortilla. \\"This is how Anselmo Valencia, a headman of the Yaqui Pasqua reservation, proposed his Anglo wife-to-be. The book is basically a compilation of Heather Valencia's more or less disastrous relationships with men up to the Yaqui chief that she meets at a deer dance in the Pasqua village. Valencia reveals a pattern of being controlled throughout her life by assorted husbands, medicine men, football stars etc trying to force her into adopting THEIR lifestyle, interests, values and passions. The Yaqui chieftain, clearly a remarkable and influential guy, is no different, only more canny and confident in making her fit into his universe. But, in contrast to others, he also gives something in return.Perhaps to compensate for the constrictedness of daily life, Valencia shifts into the dreaming universe and art-making. The book chronicles her experiences in which dreaming seemlessly morphs into reality, with characters from one merging into the other. We learn about unknown women who 'teach' her about dreaming in this dreaming domain; many of these women would eventually turn out to be Yaquis from the Pasqua reservation. This part resembles earlier works of Castaneda and Lynne Andrews and as in Castaneda, the reader is tempted sometimes to suspend her/his disbelief.This book also shows Heather's resourcefulness, toughness and ability to manifest her many talents, including painting and community work. Depictions of Native Americans in this book seem real, certainly more real than cartoonish characters from Andrews' books. There are a number of interesting details about Yaqui deer dancing, customs, etc. and astute and valuable descriptions of Indian perception, healing traditions, singing. Those were the parts that interested me the most: the impressions of an adopted outsider of Yaqui customs and behavior."},{"Title":"Queen of Dreams","review":"I am glad I found this book, or it found me.

If you want to know more about the world that we spend so much time in and it's connection to our waking world, read this book.The first reviewer entirely missed the point of the book, only scratching the surface of a deeper understanding, and in so missed a chance to learn about their dreams and about themselves."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"As an admirer of her music I found the book interesting. However, it is so poorly written that it makes it difficult to read. I would recommend it on audiotape because it seems to have been written exactly as it was spoken. It's like reading a speech."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"To her credit, Grace Slick doesn't try to paint herself as particularly likeable or mature. Her book is poorly written, as if by a 16-year old. What also struck me as odd is how the book says relatively little about the music that was the focus of Ms. Slick's life. It spends a lot of time talking about the various excesses that her fame allowed her to indulge in. These topics might be interesting to teens, or to hardcore Airplane fans, but for anyone else there are much better books to buy and read."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"I have always liked Grace Slick and thought she was humorous and in-your-face. Although I'm not a big fan of Starship, I always liked Jefferson Airplane and would like to read a little more about them since I was like 5 years old during their heyday and didn't get to experience it first hand. With those two things in mind I eagerly picked up a copy of Grace Slick's autobiography and found it to be pretty meh. I almost gave it one star but made it two, because I basically like the subject and would like to read another, better book on her, with all the pithy quotes and a little more (excuse the expression) meat on the bones.This book is a pretty rambly memoir rather than anything coherent. My favorite parts were Slick's stories of her wacky school years and the outrageous things she did to shock the then-Establishment. For the Airplane years, more details would have been nice, although I believe Grace says she doesn't remember a lot of what went on due to being high much of the time. Strangely, she seems quite able to remember everybody she slept with, including the members of her own band. I realize this was the 60s and that's how people behaved then but there's a lot more to Grace than the fact that she boffed her band mates and other eminent musicians like Jim Morrison.There are also long diatribes by Grace on 1) how she wishes she lived in a much earlier, less technologically complicated and therefore more peaceful era with more human contact, conveniently forgetting that many disturbing things like wars, famines, plagues, mobs and other unquiet, unpleasant things happened back then as well; and 2) how older people do not belong on a rock and roll stage because they physically look bad and rock is for young people. Regarding this last, I appreciate that not all rock musicians want to keep touring and performing live into their middle and older age, that Grace has found other things to do (such as her art and her activist causes), and that the constant scrutiny of a performer's appearance and whether they're looking older is likely NOT fun especially for women. I also know a lot of middle aged people who basically agree with Grace and prefer to sit home and listen to a record rather than go out and get on a stage or even jump up and down in front of one. However, the flip side is that there are also a lot of older musicians who can still put on a helluva show, draw crowds who enjoy it regardless of whether Way Cool Junior has lines on his face, and that there are also a lot of older rock fans who still like to go to shows and rock out and don't feel like they're \\"too old\\" to have fun once they get past 30 or 35. Grace has made a lot of strong statements about liberation in many contexts so I was very surprised to see her espousing an agist view across the board rather than just saying, \\"eh, I performed when I was younger, it was all right then but I'm not really into it now and I'm on to different things\\" rather than making statements about how rock should exclude ALL old people. Not everybody cares that much about continuing to look 20 and sexy or whether the rockstar playing guitar looks 20 or 50 as long as he can still bang out the tunes. Sorry Grace but your general statements on this issue rather than just keeping it personal to yourself really helped to turn me off to the book."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"Grace Slick writes like she lives-straight from the hip. She doesn't pull any punches and writes with total integrity about her life. I enjoy learning as much as possible about the bands that evolved out of the San Francisco scene during the '60s and she adds her own unique perspective. I can't say I agree about her ideas on old age but c'est la vie. Life in a '60s era rock 'n' roll band was tempestuous, unpredictable and very creative. Lots of unusual experiences and relationships."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"I found the constantly shifting timelines in the narrative a little confusing.

This is a lesson on how to live and get the most out of the lives we are lucky to be blessed with. The best line is about Jim Morrison (about how through all the drugs, he could still f**k through the fog). The honesty here is unlike most autobiographies, especially where she laments on the drawbacks of recording a solo album when the process is so much better with the already assembled band that made her a star."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"I read the book in two days and while it contained a few items of interest, I was disappointed in the lack of detail in many areas. I would have been really interested to hear Grace Slick talk about the Haight Ashbury days, how the Airplane dealt with the record company business, or the sessions and live appearances that led to some of their great songs. One would think that a woman whose songs were inspired by the likes of Lewis Carroll and James Joyce would have a deeper perspective than this book shows, but maybe not. I think a lot of the blame has to go to Andrea Cagan who most likely told her to make sure to tell her sexual experiences with famous rock stars if nothing else. In any case the editing should have been a lot better; the book is kind of a rambling mess. But for fans of Grace and the Airplane and '60s rock music in general, it's still an interesting read for all its faults."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"Grace Slick was always one of the more quotable rock stars. Even well past the point where Rolling Stone would even consider giving one of her records (solo or with Jefferson Whatever...) anything remotely like a positive review, they'd still run little blurbs on her from time to time, usually with one or two \\"outrageous\\" quotes.She could be counted on for that. Funny, sarcastic, but also endearingly self-deprecating, her take on the world in general and the absurdities of rock stardom in particular were always worth a look. Once when asked about all the attention she received as the sole female member of a six-\\"man\\" band, she pooh-poohed it all by saying, \\"Well, if you had five cows and a pig, you'd look at the pig, right?\\" Well, yeah, although Grace was scarcely a pig, and I don't know about how her bandmates may have felt about being called cows, but you get the idea.Often described by people as an \\"ice queen\\"--at least by people who had never heard of Nico--Grace was actually pretty down to earth and anything but self-serious. On the other hand, her penchant for wisecracking and sheer outrageousness often detracted from her more reflective, artsy side. Her own compositions, with their often elliptical lyrics and exotic arrangements, hinted at an artistic ambition that was very real--if never fully realized. Still \\"rejoyce,\\" \\"Two Heads\\" and \\"Hyperdrive\\" remain real dazzlers, suggesting that if Grace had been less given to epataying the old bourgeoisie (and ribbing the counter-culture too, much to her credit) she might have pulled off something even more remarkable than what she (with and without her various bands) actually did achieve.The book is, for the most part, a fun breezy read, the funny, quotable, outrageous Grace. No, it's not all it might have been, but it was pretty much what I expected. This is one of those odd books, where you suspect that the narrator's apparent \\"frankness\\" actually serves as a kind of defense. Don't let's dig too deep, God forbid. One can read between the lines a bit, especially in the brief early chapters that describe her childhood and adolescence, and maybe conclude that there are some conflicts there above and beyond what she's willing to reveal. And well, that's OK. Really, most of us are not THAT nosey. But the tone is an odd juxtaposition of self-disclosure and self-protectiveness. \\"Odd\\"--but not really all that surprising. Honesty--or as we said in the 60s, \\"righteousness\\"--was a counter-cultural value, but you couldn't get too \\"corny\\" about the whole thing either.I could have done without another re-hashing of the \\"plot to dose Nixon\\" co-starring Abbie Hoffman. Despite Grace's protestations to the contrary, I don't believe she ever intended to get any further than the White House gate--you don't bring Hoffman as your escort if you really want to get in and wreak a little psychedelic havoc on the President of the United States. It's a wild tale, but it was more theater and self-mythologizing than anything else.Nor do I particularly care about the Jim Morrison episode (the strawberry jam session). It seemed like a pretty meaningless encounter for both participants, but someone (co-writer Andrea Cagan, perhaps?) must have thought it merited a chapter of its own. It's disappointing that this kind of tale-telling is given more focus than on the music itself. In one revealing passage, Slick talks about her compulsion to be as well rehearsed as possible. That kind of professionalism may seem antithetical to \\"hippie\\" ideals of spontaneity and improvisation. But that was one of the little contradictions that made Slick a compelling figure to begin with. Too bad that same level of care didn't really make it into the autobiography.Now that it's available as a paperback (or as a remaindered cloth-bound edition), the book is well worth picking up--for curiousity seekers as well as fans. Enough of the quotable Grace is there. The mysterioso, orphic Grace is missing in action though. Too bad in a way."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"I have loved Grace Slick for such a long time that when this memoir first came out, I immediately bought it and read it with much glee. It is just what I expected from her and I am not disappointed at all. In fact, I am a little surprised, but not really shocked, that many did not give it better ratings. I wanted to learn more about Grace and her viewpoints and she was more than generous with her humour, wit and outlook. Honest too. What I love about Grace is the way she followed her own outlook on things. She side-stepped being defined by others and really didn't care too much about what others thought of her. In this.... she will have my love and admiration forever. True...... she didn't go deep into the personalities of the 60's icons much. She didn't give much insight into her songs and what they meant. What true artist does? But, she IS a hoot - and I bought the book because she is such a character. In fact..... I was so enamoured with this book that I wrote her publisher to say how much I enjoyed it. A few months later, I received an 8X10 signed glossy in the mail from her - postage due of course. I laughed. \\"That's my Grace\\" I thought.If you people out there can put your egos and expectations on the shelf and read this expose from a true 60's San Francisco survivor, I think you will find many things to like. Leave your morality, your preconceived notions and your judgemental placards at the door. After all, this is Grace's world - not yours. And, thank-you Grace for all those great tunes. I still listen. And thanks for just being yourself."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"I'm glad Grace wrote this autobiography; she truly is a unique woman and her book attests to it. &quot;Somebody to Love?&quot; is an easy and fast read filled with humor, wit, and honesty. Even though Grace is best known as a rock diva of the 1960's I like that she writes in equal portion about the 70's and 80's as well as the 60's. (Her entire life isn't centered around Jefferson Airplane and the 60's.) Reading this book, it's as if she has written it to you personally; it's like she's just come over to your house and plops down on the sofa, kicks up her heels on the coffee table, and tells you her life story. Grace is not only outrageous, but intelligent as well. She's nobody's fool and she'll let you know it. She has attitude and chutzpah, and that's what I love about her. What's more, Grace is candid in her autobiography with everything, good and bad.I learned a few things about her that I never knew, such as her fling with Jim Morrison (what heterosexual woman in her right mind wouldn't have wanted a fling with Morrison?), her bout with alcoholism, and her childhood (it was surprisingly normal).Grace has had her share of ups and downs, and through it all she remains true to herself and others. Although she knocks her age and body, I think she looks fantastic! And her smile still says it all. She is a testament of perseverance. Grace, you go girl!!"},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"As an avid reader of all things dealing with the music industry, both artistic and business oriented, I have seen many different ways of describing the turbulent lifestyles of the stars. While I know some people criticize this book for not going into enough depth regarding the recording process, or the business relationships the band was involved in, I think these people are being a little unfair to Grace. Let's face it, people intimately involved in situations are usually the least likely to give you an in-depth analysis of that situation. Consider the following: Parent: What did you do in school today? Child: Nothing.An outside observer could likely make a huge list of all of the child's accomplishments, and talk about the development of social skills, intelligence, and creativity. But to the child, it was just another day spent trying not to get picked on by the bully.What does strike me about this book is how unfazed by her success Grace has managed to be. While too many stars from that era still pretend they are still IN that era (see also, her bandmates!) she is much more in tough with reality. This book seems to focus, in its own way, on how that came to be. I loved it.And it is a really quick read too."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"Bad review title aside, I really had a lot of misconceptions about the former female vocalist of Jefferson Airplane/Starship until deciding to read this book. I know that some autobiographies can be very disappointing, or you know far more than you ever wanted to know ad nauseum about some entertainers. Grace tells you exactly what you'd expect, and then some without overdoing it. It's a fun read all about her wild, free-spirited past, and her ability to move on with her life without having any regrets about it. She reveals a strong person who is funny, tells it like it is, and is bluntly honest if often self-deprecating. If she wasn't readers would probably come to dispise her attitude as so many who read Bebe Buell's book did.Written in a conversational style as if she is sitting down in the same room talking to you, it is a comfy and candid read that never ceases to entertain and, quite honestly, is very surprising in that she can remember so much about her younger days! I guess she had her act more together than the press ever gave her credit for, plus she has gotten past all that to being a bright, funny, mature woman who has her act tightly together, so look who's having the last laugh. Right on, Grace!"},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"Grace Slick has been renowned as the acid queen, and the original rock beauty. This book is straight from the recollections of Grace herself, and it is probably not what the fans exactly expected. More of an oral biography, which jumps from one time period of her life to a completely different time within each chapter, Grace reminisces on her thoughts and feelings about her childhood, the tumultuous 60s, and her faults of the 70s. I enjoyed this book because Grace told no lies, and really has forgotten most of her past, or was too high at the time to recall. This goes back to what Grace has always claimed, that in the 60s, if you can remember it, then you probably weren't there. It is a reminder that the 60s are not really a time that we really would like to relive, which shoots down a lot of false preconceptions that the world was undergoing a wave of love, and all times were high and happy. Overall, if you are a die-hard Slick fan, this book is not a complete chronological story like other books that have been written about characters like the deceased: Morrison, Hendrix, and Joplin, but is a book worth the time."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"Grace Slick is a great musical figure who came out the convergence of San Francisco rock and roll of the 60's. The Airplane led the peak, for a spell, of the Haight-Ashbury sound tidal wave that included the Greatful Dead, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Quicksilver Messenger Service and Country Joe and the Fish. Acid Heads attending concerts at Avalon or Fillmore would time their trips to be peaking just as the Airplane took the stage. That is the Grace Slick many of us remember. In the book we hear about Slick's various sexual encounters with other Rock Stars and members of the Airplane and accounts of who is the best endowed. Her account of her almost first and only Lesbian encounter was especially revealing. Slick is candid at times about a lot of things and a little confusing at the same time. We also read about her life-long opulent life style and her elegant homes in St. Francis Woods -SF, Seacliff -SF, Marin County, and in Southern Cal. The account of the loss to fire of the Marin house was especially tragic and moving. Slick's account at Woodstock was well done but the Airplane did not play like they could have to be included in the Woodstock movie - they did not have a dynamic set as did Santana, Hendrix, The Who, Crosby, Stills, and Nash and others. Especially interesting is Slick's decision to retire as a rock and roll champ as age has set in - she did not like the feel of being a middle aged rock star. Fortunately she could afford to do it. If anything Slick's book will be added to the category on San Francisco History and will be of some value to scholars researching life in San Francisco in the 60's - they may find some of the things Slick talks about very interesting indeed."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"The incomparable Grace Slick lets loose with an in-your-face frank, raunchy, intelligent, extremely funny, and riveting account of life as THE psychedelic rock goddess and queen of the San Francisco hippie movement. Gargantuan doses of sex, drugs, rock, and cop clashes mix well with Slick's wonderful flair for putting the reader right there - front row center...and that's some mighty interesting/intense places to be. Great anecdotes and portraits of Woodstock, Altamont, Abbie Hoffman (and THAT plan to drop Pres. Nixon acid at a White House tea party!!!) Morrison, Hendrix, Janis, The Grateful Dead, and even Jill St. John! In addition to presenting the music and ideals of an era, it's also a fascinating account of a VERY strong woman coming into her own, adapting her priorities, and shifting focus as she ages. Treat yourself to an incredible slice of life!!!"},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"Fantastic, fun, and witty. This book is a fast read, full of short and enjoyable stories and anecdotes. Even the &quot;lessons of life&quot; were comical yet educational.

I am a HUGE fan of Grace Slick and the Jefferson Airplane. She has always been my favorite singer, and I have always believed her to be the most interesting, quotable, unique individual to have come from the 60's era. She is truly an icon and a great talent who influenced many, and I am sure that many fans looked forward to this read. Overall, I have to agree with several other's who expected more. I believe that while Grace attacks the book with some of her typical cynacism, sarcasm and wit, I believe that her book basically covers aspects of her life that she believes to be the most pertinent (her upbringing, influences, loves, music, most notable Airplane moments, her daughter...), and even the chapters in which she discusses these parts of her life seem to be rather skimmed. Grace Slick was at the forefront of an era that influenced and impacted many...she was a part of music and social history that I am sure so many, whether they were alive or not, would be interested in knowing from one who lived through it...but as Grace so pointedly reminds and quotes, and I paraphrase, she can barely remember most of what went on herself! Regardless, her memories are basically watered-down versions of certain or specific aspects (and I repeat) of her own upbringing, her joining a band (The Great Society...and it is a bit odd that although she was legally married to Jerry Slick until the early 1970's, he basically disappears from the scene altogether!), her becoming part of a great band, poignant moments in both Grace and the band's history (personal and professional)...yet it does seem to be go by quite quickly and condensed...I finished the book in a day. Also, there are a few black and white photos peppered throughout the book, including a few glimpses of Grace's artwork. I would have liked to learn more about this interesting individual, and perhaps there is so much history it would or could fill volumes, so this is the result...a mildly interesting, yet brief peek into the life and times of one of rock n' roll's few female legends. Because Grace Slick is who she is, I give her book three stars; if she was anyone else, the book would have probably received one star!"},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"In this autobiography, Grace Slick formerly of Jefferson Airplane, gives an full account of her life in the rock and roll spotlite. She gives up the goods on lots of interesting and famous personalities in one of the most exciting times in rock and roll history.Although sometimes a bit irritatingly egocentric, Ms. Slick has so many interesting tidbits to disclose that it's easy to forgive her overabundance of self-love.An interesting, entertaining and often funny book, just wish it had focused more on the 60's."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"Upon purchasing this book I was hoping to discover some real insight of the early, San Francisco 60's music scene as observed by an insider. Sure we got to read about Grace's early family life, her penchant for drama and dressing up, college days, many affairs, marriages and relationships. Yet, something was missing....what were her REAL thoughts and emotions as she went through these times? Some things were left unexplained...why so close with the Grateful Dead in the early days @ the Fillmore West and then nada-zip....no more mention of them. What happened to that relationship? Was it because the Airplane/Starship membership sold out to BIG MONEY? Same thing with her personal relationships...no real insight as to what really happened or how she felt. As I read on, I kept hoping for a &quot;real&quot; connection to Grace and perhaps a sharing of her soul &amp; innermost thoughts as she traversed several musical eras. Instead, I was left with the feeling that the book was a &quot;slap-dash&quot; attempt (maybe under a publisher's deadline?) @ trying to tell a monumental story that was reduced to disjointed chapters that were hard to follow. At books end, I still like Grace and find her amusing &amp; candid, but sure would have enjoyed a more intimate tale. The highlight of the book was just a paragraph or 2 devoted to Janis Joplin. That was the closest the book came to what I had hoped for.....&quot;Janis felt like an old soul, a wisecracking grandmother whom everybody loved to visit.&quot;"},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"Review of audiocassette -- Grace Slick is unbelievably self-absorbed and unforgivably boring. For example, do we really care that she was a blond when she was eight years old? I listened to this on a long drive one evening and kept waiting for the tape to get better but it never did. It's a miracle that it didn't put me to sleep and cause me to drive off the road! Grace reads her self-indulgent musings in a wooden voice without a trace of real insight or even humor. After listening to this tape, I didn't know a lot more about Jefferson Airplane or Starship or the sixties or even Grace Slick -- I just knew that I wanted my money back."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"Let's face it,this is probably the best autobiography that Grace Slick was gonna come up with.The maxim,&quot;If you remember the 60's,you weren't really there&quot; is probably truer for Grace Slick than anybody else.Frankly,I'm amazed that she can recall as much as she does!(Don't get me wrong,I love Grace.)I had this review printed earlier,but it was removed for some reason."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"I grew up during those times,loved the music and still do.

I loved every page."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"An autobiographical plane ride through the highlights, success, and rock bottom moments of Grace Slick's life and her musical career with Jefferson Airplane/Starship. Grace pulls no punches as she describes her relationships, substance use and abuse , and her musical experiences, while adding a clever dose of humor and insight. Grace provides a candid view of her artistic inspiration through her early appreciation of literature and drama in a memoir that flows quickly and covers all the topics - Woodstock, Monterey, Altamont, and tours with the Doors, Rolling Stones, etc. Grace tells it like it was during a time of musical revolution, experimentation, and frequent excess. Chapters in the book are rather short, however, and often leave the reader looking for more on interesting, colorful subjects with so much nostalgic potential. Interestingly, Grace Slick proves in this memoir that she is, and wasn't, just &quot;Spacey Gracey,&quot; as many consider her. A great deal of the book &quot;Somebody To Love&quot; demonstrates a true sense of her creativity, wisdom, and intellect, while refusing to deviate from the hard-edged, outspoken style for which she is famous. Grace also seems to have found her purpose and her peace, and the book overall is a rollicking jaunt through some serious rock and roll times from a music legend who added so much to the experience."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"This book is like a series of tangents. It must have been nerve-wracking for Andrea Cagan to sit and listen to all this. The thing reads like Grace was hopped up on caffeine throughout. Her export of information to the pages is eratic; for example, no clear statement of her ancestry, but she makes a comment about her parent's \\"Edwardian Background\\" (does she mean they were from Britain? Two Brits who graduated from U of W in Seattle and had babies in Chicago and the Bay Area?) and suddenly, several lines down, mid-paragraph drops this: that her folks had neither the Italian or Jewish cultural/social stamp. So, what does this particular non-sequitur mean? Where her folks Italian and Jewish? In another part of the book she says part of her mother's clan came over on the Mayflower. Italian Jewish Separatists? In another bio source, her dad's side is described as Norwegian-Scandinavian- Grace makes no mention of that either. She does make it clear that she has nothing but disdain (and apparently still nothing but) for her folk's middle-class, quesi-elitist background (father worked hard, got ahead in a career as a white collar worker with a respected firm, was able to keep his family in nice homes and circumstances his whole life) well, at least Grace didn't have to grow up in a ghetto or impoverished farm like Ottis Redding or somebody like that. And in this vein, she can really sound like a 58-year old brat. She also still harbors the tired cliche political views of her time, like we live in an \\"F-'d up\\" country, she refers to Nixon as Tricky-Dick, etc. And reveals that back in high school and college, she slept through American history classes. Well, that figures! \`Cause it shows in her book! And oh, we are treated to the description of how she ended up in bed with Jim Morrison and Airplane bassist Jack Cassidy: like we really need that as revelatory material, anyone who knows anything about this broad already knows before picking up this book that Grace was the most promiscuous Rock babe this side of Angie Bowie. She also seems to love to drop names- and in silly, pretentious ways; like she claims to have been listening to the Miles Davis album Sketches of Spain four dozen consecutive times before writing her song \\"White Rabbit,\\" this just smacks to me of status-glomming in this age of yuppies refering to their jazz album collection like they'd refer to the Mercedes and BMW sitting in their garage.The illustration package does make the book worth the price of admission- some good vintage photos and a few samples of Grace's own cooky often spooky art work."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"Let's face it,this was probably the best autobiography that Grace was gonna come up with.The maxim,&quot;If you remember the 60's,you weren't really there&quot;is probably truer for Grace Slick than just about anybody else.Frankly,it's amazing she can recall as much as she does!(Don't get me wrong,I love Grace.)The book does begin to bog down once she leaves the 60's.(Unless you're really more interested in Jefferson Starship instead of Jefferson Airplane.If so,God help you!)"},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"Not a rehashing of the same old 60's stories we hear over and over.

To me, I don't think there's a better female vocalist than her. Just my opinion here. I wanted to know more about her and what makes her tick so what better way than to read her autobiography?Grace is an honest woman at least in her book, she isn't afraid to tell how she feels about everything from the government to sex to the guys in the band. It's a very fun read, and I looked forward to reading it each night after I went to bed. You become aware after a little reading that there's a hell of a lot more to Grace Slick than just her beautiful voice and goregous looks. She is a very intelligent woman has her own ideas about everything and doesn't just follow the crowd. If she thinks something is stupid, emabarassing she won't do it.I came away from the book feeling like Grace was my next door neighbor. I also felt like I had a heart to heart talk with her for hours. I think she's a great woman, totally beautiful with a voice to match. I really liked this book. If you feel like I do and would like to get to know Gracie a little better buy this book. There's nothing boring in it at all. A very good read, and written by a woman with a great vocabulary as well. If you are just curios about her buy the book."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"This is a good book if you just want to read about what grace Slick did outside of Airplane and why she decided to do it. It isnt one of those books which documents every single date of release of album and what happened within the record company and how it was marketed in the nation etc.... Those books are good but to me this is a nice change to very complicated books, and although she does write the book in an informal manner, it makes it better as it sort of seems right to talk about stuff away from the band in the tone she uses. this book is mainly sex, drugs, and a bit of rock and roll. Still very funny and good sense of humour though. Just depends what style of book you are after."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"I enjoyed reading this book but was kind of disappointed that it didn't go into much detail and kind of jumps around.

I love the part where she talks about Jim Morrison, reminds me of a sexual encounter with Ben (Syd Barrett, Pink Floyd) in a infamous book called &quot;Groupie&quot;. The descriptions of the things from her childhood, I seem to have gone through the same things if a little less weird.I also loved her seriousness concerning politics and her song &quot;Panda&quot;, I also love Pandas I collect anything to do with them. So to find she also likes them is uncanny.The way she worked through the Jefferson Airplane members, excellent. The descriptions.

In this book she's really a hoot and damn honest.

What a funny, vibrant woman and what a great read."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"Grace was in a perfect position to write &quot;the&quot; book on being a princess of the Haight-Ashbury. She could have strung together the key events and artistic achievements that lead to forming the movement and music that will be remembered as watershed events of the latter 20th century. After all, she was there and she was debatably the best known &quot;star&quot; of the early San Francisco scene. Certainly the only woman able to be a &quot;fly on the wall&quot; as she balled her way through most of the big name musicians of the hippy era. But she blows it with this book. Turning it into a rant on drug abuse and &quot;were'nt I cool&quot; memorys of AA meetings and pathetic 12 step program aquaintences among her celebrity fucks. Any of us who were there in the Haight in '66 and '67 deserve a better re-telling of the early blissfull days hangin out at the Drugstore Cafe and parties at the Deads house. Or how about the records? Grace could discuss the making of albums that changed all of us and became anthems for a generation. But she uses the sessions to describe how she stroked her own ego by dumping on one guy in the band and slinking into bed with another. The fabulous history is wasted as a backgroud for juvenile and petty mating games."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"A good book - light and entertaining. I enjoyed it a lot; though, I must confess, after I started the chapters about the Jefferson Starship period I kind of lost interest. I was more interested in the 60s Woodstock adventure . . . having not lived through it myself I found Grace's stories really personal and and it gave me a good idea of what times must have been like then. Made me sorry I missed it!I recommend this book if you're looking for a first-hand account of the evolution of the 60s told by someone who is really down-to-earth. You can't help but love Grace!The book was full of little inside moments too, such as the meaning behind &quot;Our House&quot; by Crosby, Stills, and Nash. It made the songs seem more real to me after I heard stories of the people who had written them.Pick it up sometime and browse through it - you'll find some great inside scoop; read the whole thing, however, and you may find your mind wandering a little."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"Where did Grace find this &quot;writer&quot; to co-author her biography? What could have been a terrific and insightful look at one of rock and roll's greatest and most rebellious icons instead reads like entries from a diary. Poorly sequenced and unimagitively written, this book suffers from an obviously inexperienced co-author who has a pre-occupation with Slick's sexual trysts and demonstrates little interest in nor knowledge of her music-making.

A fascinating if glossed over look at one of rock and rolls true voices.For those hoping for an indepth look into the woman and her times, this is not the book. For those interested in a light hearted chat with Grace about the same the book is fun and lively.As a fan of her music and poetry I have eagerly awaited this piece. I suppose it is hard to write about ones self with a steady eye, but Grace gives us the high lites in more ways than one.Her delirious look at her time is worth the price, and the 50's pictures are the best.In rare moments there are glimpses of heart and soul ravaged by a certain desperation, yet she is truly the person she had alsways been. No icon, just a fine singer who lived and experienced life as she wanted it to be.I hope that when she has adjusted to being 60 and really looks at her life more keenly perhaps then she will give us that real look. At this point I give the book an 87, because you can dance to it!Thanx for the peek, Grace!"},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"Grace Slick's memoir is an unvarnished look at the rock star life of one of the music's toughest babes. But it's a bit too '60s for its own good. Slick was either too lazy when she wrote this, or too out of it back in the '60s when it all happened to remember much, but she doesn't describe enough of what it was like to be a member of one of psychedelia's most important bands. Her flippant personality comes through, but one wants more about the relationships that permeated the Airplane and its watered-down successor bands, Jefferson Starship and Starship. Still, what's here is a quaint look back."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"My first impression of this memoir was that it was not being written to \\"uncover the truth\\" or gab about childhood corruptions, analyze thyself, or be another countless celebrity to write a raggedy account of their variably extraordinary life. Her personality seems to be able to laugh off the melodramas that might scar the average whiner into countless chapters on self-pity.She seems to save the in-depth insight on herself for her later, current years, witch was a bit disapointing. I would have liked to read more about the raunchy Grace of 60s, how she dealt with fame, her insights on the era, and just...HER in general, aside from the accounts of LSD trips, various one-night stands (some quite interesting). However, I can acknowledge that much of that era is probably blurred in her memory as a bunch of crazy acid trips and flashing bright lights.She was a wild thing, no doubt, but she reccounts her various arrests and drug abuse with a coldness--the only element of self-depracation--and doesn't attempt to justify it. It could have been better, yes, but it lived up to everything it intended to be, which is respecable. Overall, a fun and quick read. I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"The first two thirds of the book are pretty good, although it's obvious that she keeps many secrets untold. Not as much detail about her early life as I would have liked. It's obvious that she has lead a very interesting life, but I got the impression that she's not ready to tell the whole story yet. The final third of the book can be skipped unless you want to hear about her political (extremely left) views, which more or less reads like any other left wing ranting."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"Grace Slick, although long retired from the Rock and Roll scene has come up at age 59 with an interesting look at her life, loves, music, and being part of the dynamic Jefferson Airplane. After 1967 the Airplane emerged out the Haight-Ashbury as the leading edge of the San Francisco Sound that included the Dead, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Country Joe and the Fish, and Big Brother and the Holding Company. Grace was viewed as the Acid Queen by psychedelic revelers who would time their peaking to commence with the Airplane set at San Francisco's Fillmore or Avalon Ballroom's. The memoir will have some historical value as an example of life and activities in San Francisco during the 60's and 70's. Some of her memories definately will become Rock and Roll trivia items now that they are in print - some of them are x-rated for sure and not for the timid reader. I guess you will have to read the book to find out more about it."},{"Title":"Somebody to Love A Rock-and-Roll Memoir.","review":"Having long been a fan of Grace Slick, I was thrilled to find that she'd written her autobiography. It's all here, from her early childhood interest in the arts to forming the band the Great Society with her then husband, Jerry Slick, to being asked by Jack Casady-bassist for Jefferson Airplane if she'd be interested in joining the band as their lead singer. She more or less said &quot;why not&quot; and it was the beginning of a long &amp; illustrious career in rock. It's fun reading about all the rock stars she hung out with, particularly Jerry Garcia &amp; The Grateful Dead, The Doors(including a one-night stand with the Lizard King himself, Jim Morrison)&amp; other great Bay Area bands. Filled with a self-deprecating sense of humor, she writes of eventually becoming romantically involved with Airplane's resident genius, Paul Kantner, then giving birth to their daughter China.

(Innovators in Education)is the first book that became available at my local library, so this is the one I read first. Holt soundly condemns methods used in public schools at the time (methods that have improved very little since then!) and I found myself agreeing with the majority of his opinions.He doesn't just argue against these methods, though. He also provides some alternatives. This book is packed full of great ideas for helping (not making!) children to follow their natural learning inclinations. I particularly love the way he explained certain Maths concepts. Not being mathematically minded myself, this is perhaps the first time in my life that I have fully understood some of these concepts!This book is a must-read for anyone embarking on the homeschool journey, but I also recommend it to parents, grandparents, teachers and anyone else who cares for the children in their life."},{"Title":"What Do I Do Monday?","review":"Any and all of John Holt's books are to be treasured. Way back in the fifties I read them eagerly when my first son was in primary school! First I read \\"How Children Fail\\", then \\"How Children Learn\\" and others whose names I have not retained. They all deal with the kind of issues that made and make school learning hell or at least boring for really bright children, and they resonated with my soul and encouraged me to do better for my own son -- now nearly 60 and an amazing original and independent thinker leading a deeply satisfying life. For goodness sake, try it; you'll like it!!"},{"Title":"What Do I Do Monday?","review":"I had heard great things about John Holt and was really disappointed in this book. Maybe part of it was that after reading about Charlotte Mason and reading books by John Gatto, it didn't seem so revolutionary to me. But Holt quoted psychologist Robert Liang extensively in this book, which to me seems like the most outdated psychobabble (granted this book was written quite awhile ago), saying if you make ____ mistake with your kids they may turn out schizophrenic!He then continues on with different teaching techniques, which is also surprising since the unschooling movement generally refer to him as the source of their inspiration, but say you should not \\"teach\\" children, letting them learn as they become motivated to do so. So if you're looking for unschooling information you won't find it here. It also has odd references like to a school in which teachers express anger to the students to make things \\"real\\" and children seem to be allowed to hit each other sometimes."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"I agree with the reader from Illinois...sure, it's not the best piece of work in the world, but you can see her talent and how she and her writing matured, making her one of the most popular authors. The story itself is very good, and the character development impressed me. It is somewhat predictable, but what do you expect from an aspiring 17 year old author?I actually saw the TV movie first (that aired in 1997), and I enjoyed that so much that I wanted to read the book. I've been looking for the movie ever since, and finally just found it on video after searching for 3 years. (Drop me an email if you haven't found it yet...its hard to find) I would recommend both the book and the movie to anyone who enjoyed Alcott's &quot;Little Women&quot; and/or LM Montogmery's &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; series."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"For a young lady at seventeen, I was impressed by the writing which obviously developed more as she grew up. This book was charming and it deserves five stars for the well character development and the plot which took me so far into the lives of everyone involved. As for the plot, I was astonished how much I was taken into each of the lives and empathized for the protagonists. The love and desire Lord Percy possessed for Edith was not only noble, but it encouraged me that there are still those who seek righteousness and purity. The story was simply delightful and I like to think Miss Alcott enjoyed the writing very much uplifting pure and innocent love. Bravo to the youth writer and to those who love sweet stories of true love or of classic writings, this is a charming romance to read."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Alcott's first novel is a tale of the greatest love one human being can show another--that of friendship, respect, and honor. I find Lord Percy and Edith model characters of the way men and women should treat each other (both sexes). Excellent picker-upper-of-a-story, too. How can you not helped but be inspired by their examples, especially in contrast to Lady Ida and Lord Arlington. 5-stars in my book--it's a keeper!"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"This novel was a great find for Alcott fans. The very concept of a novel being discovered and published after the author's death is astounding! Here were get the opportunity to read the first work of the author of Little Women and a preview of LW. The moral concepts, within the fibre of this story, are very much the same. This is well written and I believe that readers will begin to care about what will happen to the main charactor, Edith Adelon. This story has all of the components of a great romance novel: impossible love, secrets, a villainess and a sweet ending. A must read for any Alcott fan!"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"According to a note on the text in the Penguin Classics edition, &quot;The Inheritance&quot; was written by Louisa May Alcott when she was only 17 years old. This novel tells the story of Edith Adelon, an Italian orphan who lives with the aristocratic Hamilton family. This is a sentimental, romantic story about love, treachery, and a family secret. Class stratification is a significant theme.Yes, the characters are fairly shallow, the plot is predictable, and the dialogue is often very stiff and corny. But I found &quot;The Inheritance&quot; quite charming and enjoyable. The mild suspense leads ultimately to a satisfying conclusion. Along the way are some memorable scenes, such as a sequence involving the creation of historical tableaux.The Penguin Classics edition includes an excellent, substantial introduction by Joel Myerson and Daniel Shealy. They discuss Alcott's remarkable life and career and place &quot;The Inheritance&quot; in literary and cultural context."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"This book is one of the best I've read!

Since it is her first book out in a century, I think its an important book for any Alcott readers library. IF you are familiar with Alcott than you will be able to tell that this is one of her earliest works - it is not as refined, but it still holds the warmth that give her characters life. I'm so glad that this story was found in the archives and was published after years of dust."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"I don't know why so many people put this book down! Well of course it's not as good as her other works... she was 17!! But I like to write stories too, and the amazing talent she had at 17 already surpasses mine as a college student! Quit reading it on the same level as the other books Louisa has written, and just enjoy the youthful simplicity of a budding talent! It's a great, simple, quick-reading story that people who are able to put their egos aside and get off their high horses can appreciate."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"I am not a great fan of Mrs. Alcott, but when I began reading this book, I was immeditaly hooked. The plot was so interesting and something happened in each chapter--and whatever happened always had to do with Edith--wheather it was Lady Ida cursing her or Lord Percy admiring her--it always had to do with her. This book had a romantic feel to it, and it wasn't how I would have expected it to be. The romantic part was kept hush-hush amongst the charecters--but the irony of it was everyone knew about it. I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new summer book. It's great!"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Louisa May Alcott did it all, from dark thrillers and tragedies to the laid-back family of \\"Little Women.\\" But it's not surprising that Alcott practically buried her first novel, \\"The Inheritance,\\" which she wrote at the age of seventeen -- a gooey, cliched romance with a sickly-sweet heroine and a Tall Dark Handsome Man with a Tragic Past.Edith Adelon is a penniless Italian orphan who lives on a rambling estate belonging to the wealthy, aristocratic Hamiltons. She was brought there at an early age to be the companion to daughter Amy. Edith's humility and goodness make her a favorite in that place, except to a relative of Lady Hamilton's, Ida Clare. Ida is not wealthy, though she is an aristocrat, and (by the standards of the day) is aging to old-maid-hood.Things change drastically with the arrival of Lord Percy, a pal of Amy's brother Arthur. Despite Percy's broken heart, he begins to fall in love with Edith -- except Ida is determined to have him for herself. Around the time Edith nobly rejects her suitor (because they aren't on the same social level), a series of thefts are committed -- and she is the main suspect.It's not hard to see why Alcott buried this novel in a trunk -- by the time she was a serious writer, it would have been painful to have people read this book. It's drips with gooey sentimentality and quite a few romantic cliches of the time -- the secret legacy, the rigid class system (where lowly peasants adore the nobility), the tragic secrets, the nasty nemesis who never does anything really evil, and the backdrops that are uniformly beautiful and majestic.While Alcott's writing at this point was also quite cliched, it's also quite pretty. Assuming that you don't start rolling your eyes at the idea of a moonlit half-castle-half-mansion surrounded by green fields and a lake, that is. But once a bit of disbelief is suspended, the writing does seem quite lovely. The dialogue, however, is ridiculously ornate and self-deprecating.Unfortunately, Alcott stumbles all over herself when she writes the characters -- Edith is a revoltingly sweet wilting lily, as well as being one of those people whose humility becomes almost a personality defect. She has no flaws, just virtues -- she's beautiful, swoons, and sings like an angel. She even takes soup to the sick. Lord Percy is not much better -- virtuous, sensitive, tragic, and utterly dull. And the flat supporting characters all serve merely to gush about how sweet and lovely Edith is, except for the tepidly malicious Ida.Though it was later remade into a solid TV movie, \\"The Inheritance\\" is one of those very few Louisa May Alcott stories that deserves to have stayed buried. It has none of the charm of \\"Little Women,\\" nor the cliched but well-written thrills of \\"Long Fatal Love Chase.\\" Revoltingly sweet and cliched, this reads almost like a parody of the romantic genre."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote this sugary book when she was only seventeen, and you can really tell from the writing. Her heroine Edith is beautiful, noble, humble, a perfect musician and singer, and everyone worships her; ditto with the hero, who has been nursing a broken heart until he sees Edith.The plot is very predictable and kind of boring. Basically the bad girl called Ida is trying to wreck Edith's life so she can marry the hero, and everyone finds out the truth about Edith's parentage. Lots of syrupy speeches and gooey looks and oh-so-noble pale men with wilting lily women. It's all very cliched, as if Alcott had to get the romantic novels of the day out of her system. I love Louisa May's fiction so much, but this was a youthful dud.On a small side note, there was a really wonderful version of this movie out in the late 90s, which only sort of resembles the book, and it's on DVD here on amazon! So check that out instead."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Edith Adelon is an orphan that was taken in by a rich family. She lives as both a servant and a member of the family. She meets Lord Percy, and they fall in love with each other, but a jealous Lady Ida tries her hardest to keep them from being together. It isn't what is considered typical Alcott; it is a love story, taut with drama and betrayal. It is simplistically written and sketchy, but it is still written with the Alcott charm. I enjoyed it very much, but I don't rate it as one of my books to recommend."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Written nearly 20 years before &quot;Little Women&quot;, when Louisa May Alcott was only 17-years-old at the time, &quot;The Inheritance&quot; is supposedly her first novel, although it was never published until five years ago in 1997 (and was later made into a TV movie the same year). The two editors (Joel Myerson and Daniel Shealy) briefly talk about Louisa's literary accomplishments in the afterward of this book, remarking on what a rare find &quot;The Inheritance&quot; is, as well as it being a steppingstone in her writing career. It is notable since it is her first novel, but I wouldn't consider it her best work. However, I've only read one other book by Miss Alcott: &quot;A Long Fatal Love Chase&quot;. That one I liked much better, because it was more adventurous and suspenseful than &quot;The Inheritance&quot;, even though it still followed the same romantic path.This sentimental 19th century romance novel is set in the rich English countryside. It follows the Hamilton family (the stoical mother: Lady Hamilton; the obedient son: Arthur; the naive 16-year-old daughter: Amy; and the envious cousin: Lady Ida) and Lord Percy, a friend of Arthur's, as they all fawn over beautiful Edith Avelon, an orphaned Italian young woman who had been brought to England from Italy when she was ten. Ever since, Edith has been a playmate and governess for Amy, but recently she's become the love interest of Lord Percy, to Lady Ida's dismay. Already devoted to the Hamiltons, Edith will soon learn of a secret that will further bind her to the family.Probably the most unappealing thing about this book is Edith. She's so nauseatingly good, she seems unreal; she could have been a nun. She's extremely loyal to everybody, even her enemies (Lady Ida, for instance); she's kindhearted toward the sick and elderly; she's a beautiful singer; she's incredibly attractive, self-denying, gentle, pure... Gag. The one good feature about this book, though, is its brevity; it's just under 200 pages. It's worth a try if you're a Louisa May Alcott fan or really into 19th century romantic literature."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"I just have to set the record straight; I am a huge fan of nineteenth century fiction. Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters, and Dickens are the staples of my overflowing bookshelf. Therefore, I had to give Alcott's book three stars just because of the Romanticism and stunning descriptions that pervade the story. Alcott proves herself a budding author and literary spirit through this, her earliest work. Now, with the praise out of the way, I can get into the reason I wrote this review. I found the character of Edith so sickeningly good and sweet and holy and pious yada yada yada that I grew to despise the heroine. She was terribly spineless and so afraid of dislike from her contemporaries that she backed down from situations, preferring to sit in her room and cry. In fact, there were always tears \\"shining in her lovely eyes.\\" UGH!!!The characters were so stereotypical. Lord Percy was good and noble (and decidedly dull), the quintessential hero for his perfect lady love; Edith. Lady Ida was the jealous spinster desperately seeking for a husband who, suprise suprise, eventually repents her jealous ways in the forgiving arms of Edith. Amy was naieve and bubbling over with enthusiasm that eventually became nauseating, and the rest of the characters aren't even worth mentioning, they all eventually better themselves through the pure heart of Edith.This book isn't bad, on the contrary, if you enjoy nineteenth century romanticism it makes for a quick read. The characters and unoriginality of the plot leave much to be desired, but, for, Alcott's seventeen year old attempt, it makes for an enjoyable hour's read."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"I don't own this book, I have never read it, but I know Ms Alcott is a wonderful writer. But who is Joel Myerson?"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"There was a very good video of this (much better than the book) shown on TV several years ago.

However, it was easy reading and contained good character descriptions and believable circumstances. Anyone who agrees (or disagrees) and would like to help me review this book for school, please e-mail your thoughts."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"The Inheritance, by Lousia May Alcott, tells the life of an orphan who's never known her family. The beautiful and pure Edith Adelon is an Italian orphan living with the rich aristocrats the Hamilton's. This beautiful orphan is the nicest and most humble out of the characters, and is disliked by the not-so-pretty cousin, sort of like a Cinderella story. But how could such a beautiful and talented young girl be so boring?Nineteenth century stories are all about, beautiful young girls looking for a marriage of wealth, and handsome young men (there are never any non good-looking ones). Edith lives with the beautiful Amy, her equally handsome brother Arthur, the mean but still beautiful cousin Ida, and Lady Hamiliton. Edith is the friend and governess of the beautiful Amy. But, her position quickly changes when Edith saves Amy's life when she was hanging off a cliff. The heroic event won her a true place into the Hamilton Household.One thing that really got on my nerves was Edith. How could someone be so perfect, beautiful, talented, and loyal to even her worst enemy? Sure, it's a book of course, but how could someone be the epitome of perfection and still get the guy? She is kind-hearted to the sickly and has an amazing voice. Her personality is so perfect, and quickly becomes one of the characters that you can't stand. No wonder why Lady Ida was so jealous, I would be too! Edith then becomes the love interest of the honorable Lord Percy and makes Lady Ida incredibly envious. Even the married Lord Arlington has a crush on Edith. Lord Arlington proposes twice to Edith, but she says \\"No\\" each time.But somehow, a mysterious stranger gives her a package that tells Edith her true heritage. She's not a poor orphan at all! The elder Arthur Hamilton, Arthur's older brother, secretly married Edith's mom, and in fact Edith is of nobility! She's a descendant of the Hamilton's! It was such a random part of the book to have such a wonderful thing play into Edith's life. It wasn't strategically or carefully placed into the book, it was like Louisa May Alcott wasn't able to find a place to put that part in her book. But of course, like in any Cinderella story, Edith's family doesn't believe her and thinks Edith is a thief. Stealing a necklace that shows Edith her true Heritage. Wow, this is so repetitive to every story I've read before. \\"To be so bitterly deceived in one whom we have loved and cherished from a child, one whom we thought so innocent and true.\\" It's so weird to find that now after how much they loved her and she's so pure, they can't believe her?Wow, one hundred and fifty years after the book was written it was finally released. I've read Little Women, and The Inheritance, is nowhere near the greatness of it. But, of course, there is always a bad book in every collection. I would prefer watching the television movie instead of reading the book anyday.Good thing the book wasn't very long, I don't know how long I would last reading about the perfectly beautiful Edith. Sure its cute, but it has as much cuteness as a five-year-old. The dialogue was also extremely cheesy, and truthfully, I would not recommend this book to anyone except my nine-year-old cousin."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"This isn't the first Louisa May Alcott book that I've ever read, but it made me a little sick from sugar-shock. Everyone loves each other and money isn't very important to the characters with the exception of one person. I picked out this book because the title seemed quite interesting, but it was about Edith's absolutely pure heart for a good part of the story. Alcott did well for her first book, but not up to par. It reminds me of many other cute romances published today and I must say it isn't timeless. She wrote about English Lords and lived in New England! I've always heard that authors should write what they know, but Alcott didn't. Alcott, thankfully matured in writing over the years and I am grateful as a lover of American Literature."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Absolutely awful. Discounting the author's age and experience, discounting too the style of writing and plotting of the time, still absolutely awful. Only read it if you are a true Alcott fan, or there is a gun to your head."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"This book was very interesting and unique, maybe because it was written quite a while ago, or maybe because Alcott was meant to be a writer. The only thing that annoyed me, just a bit, was how Edith, the main character, was practically perfect. Other whys it was incredibly easy to read and understand. Young adults should be reading more books like this instead of books like Twilight or The Hunger Games or even Vampire Diaries. I mean, would you or your kid be able to write as well as this author can, when she or he is just 17?"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"I loved this story. It was the triumph of virtue over viciousness. Not only that but it was a really good romance novel. The excitement of chastity is truly seen in this book. I was very thankful after reading it because, it was a new one besides Jane Austin,Sigrid Undset,or Elizabeth Gatskell that I came across that was clean and I could recommend it to other woman who are serious about their christian walk.I happened to come across this book at a library. I had only thought she wrote little woman and little men and I hadn't read either of them so I didn't know her writing or perceptiveness yet.I was impressed and have collected all of her other books since.Her fairy stories which are not well known are perfect to read to the young homeschooler or anyone who likes being outside with the awakening of their childhood imagination."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"I had been searching for this book for a long time. My mom just happened upon a very nice copy at our local Goodwill store. I read the book in a day and am completely satisfied. Alcott always has such a way of making me fall in love with her characters and making my heart twist with despair at their despair. Her main character in The Inheritance, Edith, has qualities that I myself wish I had. The story has many examples of sacrifice and such devotion, that are very touching. This is a book worthy of a place on my shelf for years to come and one I can't wait to share with my own children someday."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"The second of Alcott's \\"darker\\" novels that I have read. This was not nearly as dark as \\"A Long Fatal Love Chase\\". A much shorter book the characters are still very well drawn, the plot is a little less complex but not in anyway that detracts from enjoying the book. I am definately finding myself preferring this side of her pen.Edith Adelon is an Italian orphan that has been taken in by a noble English family as the companion for the daughter. Her goodness and purity attract all except the haughty cousin of the family, Lady Ida--who is jealous of Edith's beauty and talents and the love that she inspires in those around her. Lord Percy is a friend of the family and is attracted to all things good and kind--he himself being an exemplary figure of kindness (sacrificing the love he felt for a woman so his younger brother could marry her).Everything comes to a head in one very dramatic scene and is very interestingly played out. It sort of made me think of Cinderella in a way. A quick but enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"This was a very enjoyable story to listen to. I enjoyed hearing it read by Kate Burton. Her intonnation and ability to switch her voice between English and American accents was very effective."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"I really enjoyed Little Women so when I heard of a newly discovered Louisa May Alcott novel I decided to pick it up asnd read. For people who enjoy rading Ms. Alcott's books this is a good novel. It can be very black and white at times but, it has a interesting heroine. It has all the elements of gothic literature - a long hid secret, a run down building, etc.For the beginning of her writing adventure, she wrote this at 17!, it has staying power. A good fast enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"This book was actually quite intriguing. It has only been the second novel by Louisa May Alcott that I have read; the first being Little Women.

It is very easy to read."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"It's such a heart-warming, touching novel. I was extremely touched while reading it for the first time and I could not put it down. It's one novel I can read over and over again without getting tired of it. :)"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"While The Inheritance may not be favored over Little Women, it is still worthy of high praise. Considering that this is the first work of Louisa May Alcott, I consider the writing and storyline excellent(I know I would not have done so well in my ripe ol' teens). I will also admit I'm a sucker for a love story, and this one reads blessedly short and easy. The 'Cinderella' theme makes this a fairy tale adults can enjoy while reading it to their children.If you are looking for a short, well-written bit of romance to bring some culture into your life, I highly recommend The Inheritance as the book to do it."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"This book was good, but it was a little TOO perfect and predictable. The main character was just so sweet and perfect and pretty, and everyone loved her so much except for one person, the family's cousin who was jealous of her. The main character is a poor Italian orphan who has been adopted by a rich family because they felt bad for her. Lord Percy, the family's friend, meets her and falls in love with her, but he knows that she will never marry a man above her rank. Towards the end, the main character realizes that her father was actually a rich man who was related to a relative of her adoptive family, which entitles her to lots of money.Despite the unrealistic perfectness of the main character, this book is a very enjoyable read. If nothing else, check it out at the library, but I plan to buy it when I get the money."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Hi all. I've read many of these reviews of the movie \\"The Inheritance\\" before deciding to speak my piece. First of all, The Inheritance is a late-1800s story of a poor Italian orphan, Edith Adelon, raised as the companion to the Hamilton family's daughter Amy. Over the years, she has gained their trust and affection. A while into the bool, two visitors arrive to the area: Lord Percy, \\"tall, dark, and handsome\\", and Lord Frederick Arlington. The story twists as both men attach themselves to the quiet but frank and kind Edith. She herself is charmed by one's attentions, but distance herself, realizing their stations are so far apart.I read the book before watching the film, and was charmed by the quiet romance, if encased in a somewhat foreseeable plot and stereotype characters. Anyways, I write with one main point. Many comments have stated the flimsiness of the story- a perfect, gorgeous, and noble heroine, a gentleman of impeccable grace and dignity and piercing eyes, a jealous and proud man-chaser, and a vulgar, flirtatious jerk(I mentally searched for a more classical term). And these commentators have a somewhat valid point.My lone response to this point is simple, not earth-crumbling or brilliant. Do you read the forwards or introductions to novels? I sometimes do. And what I learned from the forward to The Inheritance was that Louisa May Alcott wrote this little story at age seventeen. That's right. Grade eleven or twelve today. How many kids that age do you know today who write something that has been republished for a hundred and fifty years, and made into a film?So I'm content to remain reading and watching this little classic for years, to take it in all of its simple beauty, and to enjoy it for what it is- if not a masterpiece, at least the work of a master."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"What a spectacular book! I can't believe Louisa May Alcott wrote this at the age of seventeen. Without becoming unrealistic, the characters in The Inheritance embody all the generous, graceful, and gallant qualities that make our hearts skip a beat. Take a step back in time with this wonderful book; you won't be sorry you did!"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"The Inheritance is a book that is amazing, romantic, and altogether wonderful. I just picked it up today, and I finished it in less than a half hour. It's THAT good.The Inheritance pushed me into a totally different world. I was awed to see the incredible events in this book. It's about a shy, beautiful governess named Edith with an unknown inheritance and endless talents. She helps people in need, plays different instruments, and has a beautiful singing voice. She charms many people--especially men--and is loved by all. Unfortunately, \\"all\\" doesn't mean \\"everyone\\". There is a jealous, proud character named Lady Ida, the cousin of the girl Edith governesses, and she despises Edith. While Edith unconsciously falls in love with handsome and kind Lord Percy, she must fight off an unsuitable suitor, a terrible relation threatening her, befriend a page boy who is a thieving gambler, and still remain her humble and sweet nature. Somehow, after being accused of the page boy's theft and still remaining kind and stable, she accomplishes these things and makes this book a true winner."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"I bought this book after I saw the DVD version of \\"The Inheritance\\". If you do not like virtue, idealism, sweetness, nobility, and selflessness contrasted with utter maliciousness, don't buy the book. It was fun to see what Alcott could write at the age of seventeen and to observe the effects of what was popular at the time upon her own first attempt at a novel. Enjoy it for what it is without expecting maturity or perfection as a writer. Compare it to the fun of reading Jane Austin's first attempts at novels--\\"Love and Freindship,\\" for example."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"This book was absolutely wonderful. I loved following the life of Evie, and I laughed, cried and rejoiced at everything she experienced. I was very glad to see how it ended (no I will not spoil it), and even was glad to find out that there is really such a thing as true love! No matter your age, you will enjoy the heartwarming story of a young Heiress who doesn't know anything of life other than serving her loving cousins, uncle and aunt.. and not even knowing she is REALLY family!"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Influenced by the melodrama of the contemporary theater and the popular gothic novels of the time, Louisa May Alcott weaves a tale far removed from the reality of her everyday life in Boston. With a charm reminiscent of Jane Austen's novels, The Inheritance sets love and courtesy against depravity and dishonor--and with the help of a secret inheritance, allows virtue to prevail."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"This is Louisa May Alcott's very first book, written 20 years before Little Women. it reminds me a lot of Jane Austen's first novella, Love and Friendship. I think Alcott was very much influenced by the sentimental genre because The Inheritance is very much a sentimental kind of text.What is the sentimental genre, you ask? It's a genre of novel very popular in the eighteenth century that focuses on sentiment and sensibility. It often focuses on the \\"underdog\\" characters, mostly orphans. Oh my, the orphans. I've come across some that focus on criminal but the orphan is by far the most popular, especially in English sentimental texts. American sentimental literature focuses a lot (and I mean A LOT) on seduction. Susanna Rowson's novel, Charlotte Temple (1792) is perhaps the most famous sentimental novel about seduction. Hannah Webster Foster's The Coquette is a close second. The sentimental genre evolved into \\"domestic fiction\\" and the conduct novel in the nineteenth century. Conduct novels were often meant for young women to read because people feared novels in general. They were afraid women reading seduction novels would succumb to seduction themselves. Conduct novels helped rally the rise of the novel because they attempted to debunk that myth. Women could and often did read without running off with the first rake who nodded in their general direction. Fiction could teach as well as entertain.I've seen a few one and two star reviews of this book calling it garbage. I think if we can recognize that Alcott is imitating a very specific and very popular genre for the time-period, the text itself becomes a bit better.With that being said, the story was surprisingly well crafted for being Alcott's first foray into fiction. It's about a wealthy family who takes in an Italian orphan named Edith, who grows up with the family and is young Amy's companion and teacher. Edith is modest, sensible, smart, beautiful, and good-hearted. Cousin Ida hates her. When Lord Percy comes to visit the family and is instantly smitten by Edith's charm and beauty. [Don't be alarmed or stop reading here. This is a convention of the genre]. Ida vows to bring Edith down. Why should Edith get all the attention when Ida is clearly higher born? Like the description says, a secret inheritance allows virtue to prevail. I think you can get the picture here.I think I might have enjoyed this novel a little more than others because of my scholarly interest in the sentimental. Yes, there are \\"convenient\\" plot-points but that's not the point. The real reason the sentimental is so important is because at the heart of each novel there is a message. Alcott's message is about greed, wealth, and loyalty. A few of her characters are shells: Amy and her brother, most notably. Ida is a stereotype but the story does need a villain. I found that Edith and Lord Percy are the most \\"full\\" characters. They have deeper motivations and feelings than the others.There is drama and romance and betrayal, but there is also a happy ending that solidifies Alcott's message about greed, wealth, and loyalty. Greed never wins. A loyal friend is worth more than any amount of money. A person can be more wealthy than they seem. Though basic lessons, Alcott presents them well. Though The Inheritance by Louisa May Alcott is not her best work, it is, nonetheless, important when considering Alcott's body of work. It may seem trivial that she started out in the sentimental genre, but I think it lays a great foundation for the rest of her writing career."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"\\"The Inheritance\\" was apparently written by Louisa May Alcott in 1849, when she was just seventeen years old. It was not finally published until 1997, and likely reflects the young Alcott's taste in romances and sentimental novels. It offers an early window on her significant and still forming talent. The plot flows easily, and there are foreshadowings of characters who will appear in more mature form in later novels. Altogether, \\"The Inheritance\\" is a entirely respectable effort for a young author still learning her craft.The story itself centers on Miss Edith Adelon, a young, beautiful, and virtuous Italian woman, of obscure birth and poor circumstances. She is the paid companion of the wealthy young Amy Hamilton, and shares the impressive Hamilton estate with Amy's brother Arthur, Lady Hamilton, and Lady Hamilton's niece, Lady Ida. At the beginning of the narrative, the lonely humanitarian Lord Percy is visiting, along with a Lord Arlington.The unfortunate Edith will excite the unwelcome lust of the uncouth Lord Arlington, and the vicious envy of Lady Ida, who sees her as competition for the soulful Lord Percy. Her real love interest will seem impossibly out of reach, while a series of clever plot twists will test Edith to her very limits.\\"The Inheritance\\" is highly recommended as an entertaining novel in its own right and as an early example of Louisa may Alcott's very considerable talent."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Pure love, selfless virtue, the highest honor and respect dwelling among jealousy, vengeful pride, deceit, bitterness, and brash passion--this is the setting for a beautiful story set in the lonely nineteenth century English countryside. The humble orphan Edith and the gentle, honorable Lord Percy awed me as two characters who best illustrate friendship and sacrificial love. Their silent strength reminds me of that Bible verse, &quot;a soft answer turns away wrath.&quot; Although The Inheritance is slightly too perfect and too cliched, this mystery-love story presents a picture of true nobility-unselfish consideration of others, which is too little seen nowadays."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"It was more like a movie than anything else; each time I put the book down I was afraid I'd miss a really good part. For her first novel, I'd say that LMA did a good job, though her later writings are much better. I wouldn't suggest this book for an introduction to LMA, unless you promise to read some of her later writings also. This is a must-read (and must-have!) for all LMA fans, and a collection of her novels isn't complete with out it."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"in this book mrs.

I strongly recomend it!"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"If you're a hopeless romantic like me, you'll find &quot;The Inheritance&quot; to be adorably cute and sweet. You're heart will go pitter-pat with excitement and you'll throughly enjoy it. If, however, you're like my sister and more for the realistic, down-to-earth, no-happy-endings type of romance or not romantic at all, you'll most likely be disappointed, so don't even read it because you'll only find it silly and frivolous. I personally LOVED it."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"A friend, who along with me is a great fan of romances, handed me this book during school, telling me it was a fablous book. She had seen the movie, and had gotten the book afterwards. As I read this, I found it intresting, but a little slow. It is a very predictible book, but what really got me is the character development. That was the best part of the whole book! This book is worthwhile, but I have read better."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"The beauty of this book is that it can be read by all. It is set in an English country manor. It is about weatlh, honor, and birthright. The main character Edith is one the reader will want to be like. It was written in 1849 and believed to be Loiusa May Alcott's first piece of work. I have read it with some of my sixth graders and discussed it with them. Adults and young adults will love it"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"The Inheritance is a wonderful story in which Edith Adelon learns the true story of birth. Discovering such truths however is only as useful as she will make it. This book tells of her reactions and choices.This was Louisa May Alcott's first novel. It shows her newness, but also shows her potential. (I believe that this potential is fulfilled in her later novels: Little Women, and Little Men.)I enjoyed this book immensely. It proved to be a very romantic fantasy. Edith's character is beautifully and articulately written. The innocence Alcott has given her is priceless. Something that seems almost too good to be true, but proves that it is in the end.The other characters in the book are also very interesting. They are all very life like in their qualities. As I read the book, I gave them all the images of people I know, or have known in my life. That is how realistic Alcott made the characters in this book. I was able to create the images of real people in my mind as I read the book.Lady Ida's haughtiness irritated me so much. At times, I truly wished I could have yelled at her for being so rude and spiteful towards Edith. Then there was Amy. She was innocent herself, but in a sense that she could not see the whole truth of everything that happened around her. Her innocence was more of an ignorance, but, not in necessarily in a bad way. Edith's innocence was pure. It was innocence in the fact that she thought well of everyone around her. In her eyes, not a person she knew could do any harm. There is also Lord Percy. He is truly a gentleman. Finally there is Arlington, Amy's brother. Arlington may mean well, but he too, like his sister, can be blind to the emotions of those around him.My favorite quote from the book is: &quot;...'She has refused the wealth and rank I offered her and would not listen to me. Love, some other image, has a place within her heart. Whose is it, Percy? Tell me that.' \`I cannot read the secrets of her heart, Arlington, but I trust whoever may be cherished there will prove worthy of the love of one so beautiful and sinless.' (found on page 101) I believe that this quote shows the character of Edith and the kindness of Lord Percy."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"It's not a bad book, it's just that it's...typical. And not typical Alcott: typical 1800s romance. Edith is passive, good, and beautiful - the triple whammy of the melodramatic heroine. All the classic trappings are here - from the conniving rival to the lost inheritance (hence the title.) But if you can stomach all that, it's not a bad book. Alcott, even at this young age, is an engaging writer. And yes, one can see the buds of her later writing style - with an emphasis on family and self-sacrifice. It simply surprised me that Alcott - no conformist herself - would write such a stereotypical character as Edith. The value of this book is mainly because Alcott wrote it - not because it's a memorable book in its own right. I finished this book in one swallow. Too bad there wasn't more to chew..."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"After the recent publication and success of the long lost &quot;The Long Fatal Love Chase&quot;, researchers have been energetic in their unearthing of more &quot;undiscovered/unpublished&quot; Alcott manuscripts. I have read and enjoyed the rather sensational and lurid &quot;Love Chase&quot; but it was interesting pulp fiction! The same cannot be said for the first novel Alcott wrote and never published. &quot;The Inheritance&quot; is a sentimental Victorian love story that traces the fortunes of one Edith Adelon as she eeks out a living on the charity of the wealthy Hamiltons. Chance throws the very eligible Lord Percy into her life as well as the temptress, Lady Ida who tries to wreck her opportunity at love and respectable marriage. The true identity of Edith's birth is introduced rather sloppily and then she lives happily ever after with her true love. It is rather fortunate that Alcott did not attempt to pen &quot;Little Women&quot; at this stage and the maturity she demonstrated in that work would have done wonders on this novella"},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"Great summer read for teens! There is a movie that adds and deletes characters but does not change the overall premise. I highly recommend watching the DVD also. Read the biography on Ms. Alcott to see who her contemporaries were! Her life was quite interesting too. What a story to write for a 17-year-old girl."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"This was the first real book that I ever read but somewhere along the way I lost my copy. When I saw this I thought, 'Yes!' And I couldn't be happier. It's a very simple book but beautifully written. What they don't show is what the book looks like underneath the cover. I was very pleasantly surprised to discover the book was more beautiful without it! It's a wonderful addition to my collection and will look perfect on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Inheritance","review":"It was a good book. Loved the story and the way it was written. Will pick it up and read it again."},{"Title":"HTML Master Reference","review":"This reference is certainly one of the best available. The author includes a CD with examples from the book, however the sample pages are very juvenile and difficult to look at. These pages are almost insulting to a professional Web designer.

Not only does it cover HTML, but it also covers Cascading Style Sheets, DHTML, XML and MathML.

However, If you are willing to learn the terms and parts of plant anatomy, this guide is fairly easy to use, particularly for genus level identification. The one frustrating part of this book is that the index only refers to scientific names. So going back and forth between scientific and common can be a bit of a hassle."},{"Title":"Keys to Woody Plants","review":"This is a good book for identifying the trees at Ives Road Fen Preserve in Southeast Michigan in the winter. I agree with the previous reviewer in his comments on it being technical and not for the casual observer. It gets five stars for a botanist, two stars for a rank amateur. I give it four stars overall because it does well what it is intended to do."},{"Title":"Com+ and the Battle for the Middle Tier","review":"If you don't like the book because of favoring MS technologies and COM+, you got to love the Starbucks reference. The book gives you good insight of COM+ (MTS), good evaluation of differences between COM+, CORBA and EJB, not an adequate amount of information on CORBA and EJB details. In short, COM+ will do 98% that EJB does, with much less hassle ... the question is will you (ever) need those 2%?"},{"Title":"Com+ and the Battle for the Middle Tier","review":"The total overview that plugs you right in takes place in first four chapters. After that if you are technically ready to delve into threads, processes, stubs, transaction boundaries, asynchronous code, stateless components and more, this will be super intro to middle tier components.

He will give you material you could find elsewhere if you have the time to do your own research. Of course, then you'd learn something and that is not the point of this book. The point is to give you something to say back to that pesky CORBA guys or JAVA person who seems to think locking your company into a proprietary software scheme might prove costly down the road.This book is an evangelical endorsement of Bill's response to IP technologies threating his PC franchise.Everyone in software development knows that Microsoft buys most of their products from smaller companies and then maintains and enhances them in-house. Products that they develop in-house generally are underachievers and either way it takes three major versions before their stuff is deployable outside a lab.I don't see how MS can hope to penetrate the backend of corporate America with this offering but expect COM+ to improve radically over the next two years.Are there CORBA and JAVA bigots who write hit pieces on COM+ architectures? My experience says yes. Systems architecture is sometimes more debate that engineering. I originally looked at this book hoping to learn something new about COM+ or C#. I should have just kept hacking on product manuals instead.This book is almost as exciting as the MOM vs RPC debate a decade ago. .NET should be a bigger success than Apple's Lisa judging from the product quality I've seen to date. I hope this book ends up on every COM+ advocate's desk.They are really afraid of Java in Redmond. When I met with the COM+/C# developers 2-3 years ago they had 100's of Java books around their offices.

For example, the comparison between COM and other frameworks is completely biased. The book doesn't deal with the following issues: 1. Object-Relational automated mapping tools 2. The problematic nature of a component specification dictated by a single vendor 3. The problematic nature of committing to COM, especially due to Microsoft's anti trust legal issue and the strong ties between COM and NT technology.I liked the Don Box COM books Effective Com and Essential COM much better.Overall rating: OK"},{"Title":"Com+ and the Battle for the Middle Tier","review":"When I first started reading this, I thought it was a comedy. Imagine comparing eCommerce to Starbucks operations! But, then I figured out, Roger was so confident in his grasp of all the technical concepts, that he did not need to be worried about how non-technical it appeared to his readers. You don't write the way he does unless you have great depth of understanding of the issues. He gives psuedo-code examples of every issue. His analysis of CORBA, Enterprise JavaBeans, and COM+ (MTS) is fair and insightful, allowing the reader to see the similarities as well as the differences. This is indispensable if you want to make a choice now about how to program web stuff. You don't want to start out making database connections from your client just to get the boss off your back, if that approach won't handle any more than a few concurrent users, no matter how quickly you can get the site up. You need to know why with some COM platforms you don't need to worry about threads, and pooling. Unfortunately, if you listen to the vendors of the platforms, you won't find this information, until too late.

Mr. Sessions has done an excellent job of answering these questions, but don't buy this book expecting it to explain the mechanincs of applying COM+.

My criteria for good are:--readable -- yes, very.--not written to be propaganda. Many books about m'soft stuff start out with \\"this is the most important advance in computer science since von Neumann\\" or some such breathless rubbish. This book starts out by saying the author was skeptical about his subject matter but found real value.--opinionated. The author IS opinionated. But he discloses his biases and justifies them. That's so much easier to read and absorb than gray and neutral writing. It DOESN'T mean the reader has to agree with the author.--demystifying. The author cuts through the bafflement that M'soft's marketing department has created by their lousy choices of rapidly changing terminology, and shows the strengths of the m'soft component model. I have been unable to cut through that bafflement on my own, so I'm grateful.Worth reading!"},{"Title":"Com+ and the Battle for the Middle Tier","review":"You wouldn't think of it by reading the title, but this book is actually quite crazy.

There are enough jokes here to make you laugh out loud, and enough bad jokes to make you laugh just the same. And, you get a unique viewpoint on all things COM. Roger Sessions says some on-the-money one-liners throughout the book, but you'll notice alot to disagree with. For example I found his remark that &quot;no one has ever figured out how to make use of inheritance in OOP&quot; way out to lunch.I recommend this book as a refresher companion to all those dreary COM manuals out there.

I read it this weekend and will now be able to intelligently discuss the topic. Sessions gives some good reasons for using what he calls COMWare, which consists of COM+, CORBA, and EJB. His guidelines for effective use of COM+ will save us many hours of frustration, I am sure.However, I would not call his assesment of COM+ unbiased as others have here. Just read Part III, &quot;Competition&quot; to verify this. He brings out some valid points, like why entity beans are probably not what you want.

Manisha Roy also offers an update in the back of the book that chronicals the many changes that have happened since she first published the book some twenty years ago. The book gives a timeless glimpse into the private world of Bengali women. Subject range: Sociology/Women's Studies/Anthropology/Indian Cultural Studies, some photos. Highly reccomended!"},{"Title":"Bengali women","review":"This book provides a fascinating glimpse into the lives of traditional (upper-middle class) Bengali women and their families. Roy presents a thorough analysis of the dynamics of extended family life in West Bengal. She begins with an exploration of the special bonds that develop between father and daughter, then moves on to how schooling and classic literature play a role in developing a young woman's idyllic view of married life. Later she contrasts that ideal with the reality of being a stranger competing with one's mother-in-law for the attentions of one's husband, and how this is tempered with the birth of children, especially sons. Finally, she discusses middle age and the later years, when the children have grown and women seek companionship from their sons or religious personages.

Roy presents a thorough analysis of the dynamics of extended family life in West Bengal. She begins with an exploration of the special bonds that develop between father and daughter, then moves on to how schooling and classic literature play a role in developing a young woman's idyllic view of married life. Later she contrasts that ideal with the reality of being a stranger competing with one's mother-in-law for the attentions of one's husband, and how this is tempered with the birth of children, especially sons. Finally, she discusses middle age and the later years, when the children have grown and women seek companionship from their sons or religious personages.

The reissue of this classic work, written right after WWII to vindicate the man who had done the most to give birth to the Soviet experiment and had been written out of its history by Stalin and his henchmen, is welcome. We are allowed to remember what we would rather forget, that despite our difficulties with Boshevism it did seek to right the wrong of Tsarism, one of the most backward, brutal, and desensitizing systems of oppression known to European man up to that time. Trotsky was unquestionably a genius, a hero, and of course also a man of weaknesses and ego who set the Soviet Union on a path which he could easily justify but which could also be used for more narrow and nefarious purposes by his old enemy, Joseph Stalin. Stalin in fact, while opposing Trotsky at almost every turn before and after Lenin's death, managed in the end to adopt Trotsky's economic policies with a ruthlessness which Trotsky would have approved had he not been forced to disapprove of it as a proscribed enemy of Stalinism.Trotsky demonstrates that a certain logic of history, in this case Russian history, a history half-European and half-Asiatic, forced the liberation of Russia to become its subjugation to a tyrrany more verbally benevolent but no less horrible than Tsarism. Trotsky was undoubtedly a more enlightened and humane man than the half-barbarian Stalin, but it is not clear that had he beaten Stalin he would have been able to do better than Stalin in two tasks: setting Russia on a path of industrialization and modernization and defeating Hitler. For Stalin, lest we forget because of his crimes, Stalin did these two important things and did them very well indeed.To relive the heroic days of the Russian Revolution is to be reminded that once Russian Socialism (including Bolshevism) deserved the respect of the onlooking world. The Cold War has distorted much about this history and hidden much from our eyes. We have allowed ourselves to adopt the counter-revolutionary ideology of the reactionary classes when it comes to the birth of Soviet Russia. Isaac Deutscher deserves praise for not only restoring our view of Trotsky but for having restored our view of the Russian revolutionary tradition."},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed Trotsky: 1879-1921","review":"THIS YEAR MARKS THE 66TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ASSASSINATION OF LEON TROTSKY-ONE OF HISTORY'S GREAT REVOLUTIONARIES. IT IS THEREFORE FITTING TO REVIEW THE THREE VOLUME WORK OF HIS DEFINITIVE BIOGRAPHER, THE PROPHET ARMED, THE PROPHET UNARMED, THE OUTCAST.Isaac Deutscher's three-volume biography of the great Russian Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky although written over one half century ago remains the standard biography of the man. Although this writer disagrees , as I believe that Trotsky himself would have, about the appropriateness of the title of prophet and its underlying premise that a tragic hero had fallen defeated in a worthy cause, the vast sum of work produced and researched makes up for those basically literary differences. Deutscher, himself, became in the end an adversary of Trotsky's politics around his differing interpretation of the historic role of Stalinism and the fate of the Fourth International but he makes those differences clear and in general they does not mar the work. I do not believe even with the eventual full opening of all the old Soviet-era files any future biographer will dramatically increase our knowledge about Trotsky and his revolutionary struggles. Moreover, as I have mentioned elsewhere in other reviews while he has not been historically fully vindicated he is in no need of any certificate of revolutionary good conduct.At the beginning of the 21st century when the validity of socialist political programs as tools for change is in apparent decline or disregarded as utopian it may be hard to imagine the spirit that drove Trotsky to dedicate his whole life to the fight for a socialist society. However, at the beginning of the 20th century he represented only the one of the most consistent and audacious of a revolutionary generation of mainly Eastern Europeans and Russians who set out to change the history of the 20th century. It was as if the best and brightest of that generation were afraid, for better or worse, not to take part in the political struggles that would shape the modern world. As Trotsky noted elsewhere this element was missing, with the exceptions of Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and precious few others, in the Western labor movement. Deutscher using Trotsky's own experiences tells the story of the creation of this revolutionary cadre with care and generally proper proportions. Here are some highlights militant leftists should think about.On the face of it Trotsky's personal profile does not stand out as that of a born revolutionary. Born of a hard working, eventually prosperous Jewish farming family in the Ukraine (of all places) there is something anomalous about his eventual political occupation. Always a vociferous reader, good writer and top student under other circumstances he would have found easy success, as others did, in the bourgeois academy, if not in Russia then in Western Europe. But there is the rub; it was the intolerable and personally repellant political and cultural conditions of Czarist Russia in the late 19th century that eventually drove Trotsky to the revolutionary movement- first as a \`ragtag' populist and then to his life long dedication to orthodox Marxism. As noted above, a glance at the biographies of Eastern European revolutionary leaders such as Lenin, Martov, Christian Rakovsky, Bukharin and others shows that Trotsky was hardly alone in his anger at the status quo. And the determination to something about it.For those who argue, as many did in the New Left in the 1960's, that the most oppressed are the most revolutionary the lives of the Russian and Eastern European revolutionaries provide a cautionary note. The most oppressed, those most in need of the benefits of socialist revolution, are mainly wrapped up in the sheer struggle for survival and do not enter the political arena until late, if at all. Even a quick glance at the biographies of the secondary leadership of various revolutionary movements, actual revolutionary workers who formed the links to the working class , generally show skilled or semi-skilled workers striving to better themselves rather than the most downtrodden lumpenproletarian elements. The sailors of Kronstadt and the Putilov workers in Saint Petersburg come to mind. The point is that \`the wild boys and girls' of the street do not lead revolutions; they simply do not have the staying power. On this point, militants can also take Trotsky's biography as a case study of what it takes to stay the course in the difficult struggle to create a new social order. While the Russian revolutionary movement, like the later New Left mentioned above, had more than its share of dropouts, especially after the failure of the 1905 revolution, it is notably how many stayed with the movement under much more difficult circumstances than we ever faced. For better or worst, and I think for the better, that is how revolutions are made.Once Trotsky made the transition to Marxism he became embroiled in the struggles to create a unity Russian Social Democratic Party, a party of the whole class, or at least a party representing the historic interests of that class. This led him to participate in the famous Bolshevik/Menshevik struggle in 1903 which defined what the party would be, its program, its methods of work and who would qualify for membership. The shorthand for this fight can be stated as the battle between the \`hards' (Bolsheviks, who stood for a party of professional revolutionaries) and the \`softs' (Mensheviks, who stood for a looser conception of party membership) although those terms do not do full justice to these fights. Strangely, given his later attitudes, Trotsky stood with the \`softs', the Mensheviks, in the initial fight in 1903. Although Trotsky almost immediately afterward broke from that faction I do not believe that his position in the 1903 fight contradicted the impulses he exhibited throughout his career- personally \`libertarian', for lack of a better word , and politically hard in the clutch.Even a cursory glance at most of Trotsky's career indicates that it was not spent in organizational in-fighting, or at least not successfully. Trotsky stands out as the consummate free-lancer. More than one biographer has noted this condition, including his definitive biographer Isaac Deutscher. Let me make a couple of points to take the edge of this characterization though. In that 1903 fight mentioned above Trotsky did fight against Economism (the tendency to only fight over trade union issues and not fight overtly political struggles against the Czarist regime) and he did fight against Bundism (the tendency for one group, in this case the Jewish workers, to set the political agenda for that particular group). Moreover, he most certainly favored a centralized organization. These were the key issues at that time. Furthermore, the controversial organizational question did not preclude the very strong notion that a \`big tent' unitary party was necessary. The \`big tent' German Social Democratic model held very strong sway among the Russian revolutionaries for a long time, including Lenin's Bolsheviks. The long and short of it was that Trotsky was not an organization man, per se. He knew how to organize revolutions, armies, Internationals, economies and so on when he needed to but on a day to day basis no. Thus, to compare or contrast him to Lenin and his very different successes is unfair. Both have an honorable place in the revolutionary movement; it is just a different place.That said, Trotsky really comes into his own as a revolutionary leader in the Revolution of 1905 not only as a publicist but as the central leader of the Soviets (workers councils) which made their first appearance at that time. In a sense it is because he was a freelancer that he was able to lead the Petrograd Soviet during its short existence and etch upon the working class of Russia (and in a more limited way, internationally) the need for its own organizations to seize state power. All revolutionaries honor this experience, as we do the Paris Commune, as the harbingers of October, 1917. As Lenin and Trotsky both confirm, it was truly a \`dress rehearsal' for that event. It is in 1905 that Trotsky first wins his stars by directing the struggle against the Czar at close quarters, in the streets and working class meeting halls. And later in his eloquent and \`hard' defense of the experiment after it was crushed by the Czarism reaction. I believe that it was here in the heat of the struggle in 1905 where the contradiction between Trotsky's \`soft' position in 1903 and his future \`hard' Bolshevik position of 1917 and thereafter is resolved. Here was a professional revolutionary who one could depend on when the deal went down.No discussion of this period of Trotsky's life is complete without mentioning his very real contribution to Marxist theory- that is, the theory of Permanent Revolution. Although the theory is over one hundred years old it still retains its validity today in those countries that still have not had their bourgeois revolutions. This rather simple straightforward theory about the direction of the Russian revolution (and which Trotsky later in the 1920's, after the debacle of the Chinese Revolution, made applicable to what today are called \\"third world\\" countries) has been covered with so many falsehoods, epithets, and misconceptions that it deserves further explanation. Why? Militants today must address the ramifications of the question what kind of revolution is necessary as a matter of international revolutionary strategy. Trotsky, taking the specific historical development and the peculiarities of Russian economic development as part of the international capitalist order as a starting point argued that there was no \`Chinese wall' between the bourgeois revolution Russian was in desperate need of and the tasks of the socialist revolution. In short, in the 20th century ( and by extension, now) the traditional leadership role of the bourgeois in the bourgeois revolution in a economically backward country, due to its subservience to the international capitalist powers and fear of its own working class and plebian masses, falls to the proletariat. The Russian Revolution of 1905 sharply demonstrated the outline of that tendency especially on the perfidious role of the Russian bourgeoisie. The unfolding of revolutionary events in 1917 graphically confirmed this. The history of revolutionary struggles since then, and not only in \`third world' countries, gives added, if negative, confirmation of that analysis.World War I was a watershed for modern history in many ways. For the purposes of this review two points are important. First, the failure of the bulk of the European social democracy- representing the masses of their respective working classes- to not only not oppose their own ruling classes' plunges into war, which would be a minimal practical expectation, but to go over and directly support their own respective ruling classes in that war. This position was most famously demonstrated when the entire parliamentary fraction of the German Social Democratic party voted for the war credits for the Kaiser on August 4, 1914. This initially left the anti-war elements of international social democracy, including Lenin and Trotsky, almost totally isolated. As the carnage of that war mounted in endless and senseless slaughter on both sides it became clear that a new political alignment in the labor movement was necessary. The old, basically useless Second International, which in its time held some promise of bringing in the new socialist order, needed to give way to a new revolutionary International. That eventually occurred in 1919 with the foundation of the Communist International (also known as the Third International). Horror of horrors, particularly for reformists of all stripes, this meant that the international labor movement, one way or another, had to split into its reformist and revolutionary components. It is during the war that Trotsky and Lenin, not without some lingering differences, drew closer and begins the process of several years, only ended by Lenin's death, of close political collaboration.Secondly, World War I marks the definite (at least for Europe) end of the progressive role of international capitalist development. The outlines of imperialist aggression previously noted had definitely taken center stage. This theory of imperialism was most closely associated with Lenin in his master work Imperialism-The Highest Stage of Capitalism but one should note that Trotsky in all his later work up until his death fully subscribed to the theory. Although Lenin's work is in need of some updating to account for various technological changes and the extensions of globalization since that time holds up for political purposes. This analysis meant that a fundamental shift in the relationship of the working class to the ruling class was necessary. A reformist perspective for social change, although not specific reforms, was no longer tenable. Politically, as a general proposition, socialist revolution was on the immediate agenda. This is when Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution meets the Leninist conception of revolutionary organization. It proved to be a successful formula in Russia in October, 1917. Unfortunately, those lessons were not learned (or at least learned in time) by those who followed and the events of October, 1917 stand today as the only \`pure' working class revolution in history.An argument can, and has, been made that the October Revolution could only have occurred under the specific condition of decimated, devastated war-weary Russia of 1917. This argument is generally made by those who were not well-wishers of revolution in Russia (or anywhere else, for that matter). It is rather a truism, indulged in by Marxists as well as by others, that war is the mother of revolution. That said, the October revolution was made then and there but only because of the convergence of enough revolutionary forces led by the Bolsheviks and additionally the forces closest to the Bolsheviks (including Trotsky's Inter-District Organization) who had prepared for these events by the entire pre-history of the revolution. This is the subjective factor in history. No, not substitutionalism, that was the program of the Social Revolutionary terrorists and the like, but if you like, revolutionary opportunism. I would be much more impressed by an argument that stated that the revolution would not have occurred without the presence of Lenin and Trotsky. That would be a subjective argument, par excellent. But, they were there.Again Trotsky in 1917, like in 1905, is in his element speaking seemingly everywhere, writing, organizing (when it counts, by the way). If not the brains of the revolution (that role is honorably conceded to Lenin) certainly the face of the Revolution. Here is a revolutionary moment in every great revolution when the fate of the revolution turned on a dime (the subjective factor). The dime turned. (See review dated April 18, 2006 for a review of Trotsky's History of the Russian Revolution).One of the great lessons that militants can learn from all previous modern revolutions is that once the revolutionary forces seize power from the old regime an inevitable counterrevolutionary onslaught by elements of the old order (aided by some banished moderate but previously revolutionary elements, as a rule). The Russian revolution proved no exception. If anything the old regime, aided and abetted by numerous foreign powers and armies, was even more bloodthirsty. It fell to Trotsky to organize the defense of the revolution. Now, you might ask- What is a nice Jewish boy like Trotsky doing playing with guns? Fair enough. Well, Jewish or Gentile if you play the revolution game you better the hell be prepared to defend the revolution (and yourself). Here, again Trotsky organized, essentially from scratch, a Red Army from a defeated, demoralized former peasant army under the Czar. The ensuing civil war was to leave the country devastated but the Red Army defeated the Whites. Why? In the final analysis it was not only the heroism of the working class defending its own but the peasant wanting to hold on to the newly acquired land he just got and was in jeopardy of losing if the Whites won. But these masses needed to be organized. Trotsky was the man for the task.Both Lenin's and Trotsky's calculation for the success of socialist revolution in Russia (and ultimately its fate) was its, more or less, immediate extension to the capitalist heartland of Europe, particularly Germany. While in 1917 that was probably not the controlling single factor for going forward in Russia it did have to come into play at some point. The founding of the Communist International makes no sense otherwise. Unfortunately, for many historical, national and leadership-related reasons no Bolshevik-styled socialist revolutions followed then, or ever. If the premise for socialism is for plenty, and ultimately as a result of plenty to take the struggle for existence off the agenda and put other more creative pursues on the agenda, then Russia in the early 1920's was not the land of plenty. Neither Lenin, Trotsky nor Stalin, for that matter, could wish that fact away. The ideological underpinnings of that fight centered on the Stalinist concept of \`socialism in one country', that is Russia going it alone versus the Trostskyist position of the absolutely necessary extension of the international revolution. In short, this is the fight that historically happens in great revolutions- the fight against Thermidor (from the overthrow of Robespierre in 1794 by more moderate Jacobins). What counts, in the final analysis, are their respective responses to the crisis of the isolation of the revolution. The word isolation is the key. Do you turn the revolution inward or push forward? We all know the result, and it wasn't pretty, then or now. That is the substance of the fight that Trotsky, if initially belatedly and hesitantly, led from about 1923 on under various conditions until the end of his life by assassination of a Stalinist agent in 1940.Although there were earlier signs that the Russia revolution was going off course the long illness and death of Lenin in 1924, at the time the only truly authoritative leader the Bolshevik party, set off a power struggle in the leadership of the party. This fight had Trotsky and the \`pretty boy' intellectuals of the party on one side and Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev (the so-called triumvirate).backed by the \`gray boys' of the emerging bureaucracy on the other. This struggle occurred against the backdrop of the failed revolution in Germany in 1923 and which thereafter heralded the continued isolation, imperialist blockade and economic backwardness of the Soviet Union for the foreseeable future.While the disputes in the Russian party eventually had international ramifications in the Communist International, they were at this time fought out almost solely with the Russian Party. Trotsky was slow, very slow to take up the battle for power that had become obvious to many elements in the party. He made many mistakes and granted too many concessions to the triumvirate. But he did fight. Although later (in 1935) Trotsky recognized that the 1923 fight represented a fight against the Russian Thermidor and thus a decisive turning point for the revolution that was not clear to him (or anyone else on either side) then. Whatever the appropriate analogy might have been Leon Trotsky was in fact fighting a last ditch effort to retard the further degeneration of the revolution. After that defeat, the way the Soviet Union was ruled, who ruled it and for what purposes all changed. And not for the better.In a sense if the fight in 1923-24 is the decisive fight to save the Russian revolution (and ultimately a perspective of international revolution) then the 1926-27 fight which was a bloc between Trotsky's forces and the just defeated forces of Zinoviev and Kamenev, Stalin's previous allies was the last rearguard action to save that perspective. That it failed does not deny the importance of the fight. Yes, it was a political bloc with some serious differences especially over China and the Anglo-Russian Committee. But two things are important here One- did a perspective of a new party, which some elements were clamoring for, make sense at the time of the clear waning of the revolutionary ebbing the country. No. Besides the place to look was at the most politically conscious elements, granted against heavy odds, in the party where whatever was left of the class-conscious elements of the working class were. As I have noted elsewhere in discussing the 1923 fight- that \\"Lenin levy\\" of raw recruits, careerists and just plain thugs which enhanced the growing power of the Stalinist bureaucracy was the key element in any defeat. Still the fight was necessary. Hey, that is why we talk about it now. That was a fight to the finish. After that the left opposition or elements of it were forever more outside the party- either in exile, prison or dead. As we know Trotsky went from expulsion from the party in 1927 to internal exile in Alma Ata in 1928 to external exile to Turkey in 1929. From there he underwent further exiles in France, Norway, and Mexico when he was finally felled by a Stalinist assassin. But no matter when he went he continued to struggle for his perspective. Not bad for a Jewish farmer's son from the Ukraine.The last period of Trotsky's life spent in harrowing exiles and under constant threat from Stalinist and White Guard threats- in short, on the planet without a visa -was dedicated to the continued fight for the Leninist heritage. It was an unequal fight, to be sure but he waged it and was able to cohere a core of revolutionaries to form a new international, the Fourth International. That that effort was essentially militarily defeat by fascist or Stalinist forces during World War II does not take away from the grandeur of the attempt. He himself stated that he felt this was the most important work of his life- and who would challenge that assertion.But one could understand the frustrations, first the failure of his correct analysis of the German debacle then in France and Spain. Hell a lesser man would have given up. In fact, more than one biographer has argued that he should have retired from the political arena to, I assume , a comfortable country cottage to write I do not know what. But, please reader, have you been paying attention? Does this seem even remotely like the Trotsky career I have attempted to highlight here? Hell, no.Many of the events such as the disputes within the Russian revolutionary movement, the attempts by the Western Powers to overthrow the Bolsheviks in the Civil War after their seizure of power and the struggle of the various tendencies inside the Russian Communist Party and in the Communist International discussed in the book may not be familiar to today's audience. Nevertheless one can still learn something from the strength of Trotsky's commitment to his cause and the fight to preserve his personal and political integrity against overwhelming odds. As the organizer of the October Revolution, creator of the Red Army in the Civil War, orator, writer and fighter Trotsky he was one of the most feared men of the early 20th century to friend and foe alike. Nevertheless, I do not believe that he took his personal fall from power as a world historic tragedy. Moreover, he does not gloss over his political mistakes. Nor does Trotsky generally do personal injustice to his various political opponents although I would not want to have been subject to his rapier wit and pen. Politicians, revolutionary or otherwise, in our times should take note.REVISED JULY 25, 2006"},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed Trotsky: 1879-1921","review":"This is a great and very informative book, you never get tired of reading it"},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed Trotsky: 1879-1921","review":"From the start, Trotsky always thought that revolution in any one country could only succeed if it received the active support of revolutions in other countries. But similarly, these other revolutions would also need to receive help from others: the Russian revolution could not survive without a revolution in Germany, but neither could a German revolution survive without a Russian. This mutual dependence meant that no country could ever start a revolution: it would have to wait on the success of another.So to provoke these indispensable other revolutions, Trotsky was quite prepared to invade other countries. For example, in 1919 he wrote, \\"A cavalry corps of 30-40,000 horsemen must be formed to invade India.\\"Similarly, at Brest-Litovsk in February 1918, Trotsky made the Soviet revolution's very survival depend on the putative German revolution, risking total defeat by the German army on the throw of a revolution in Germany. He said, \\"We declare we end the war but do not sign a peace. They will be unable to make an offensive against us. If they attack us, our position will be no worse than now ...\\" This phrase-mongering did not frighten the German generals, who saw only that Trotsky was refusing to sign the offered peace. They then attacked, as he said they could not do, and seized millions of square miles of Soviet territory, making the Soviet position far worse than before.In the 1930s, the Opposition leagued with Hitler. Churchill wrote, \\"The German government was in touch with important Russian personalities through the Soviet embassy in Prague. The plot aimed at overthrowing Stalin and introducing into Russia a new pro-German regime. Soviet Russia carried out a merciless but doubtless useful purge of political and economic circles. The Soviet army was purged of pro-German elements.\\" Goebels admitted, \\"Stalin got rid of all the opposition circles in the Red Army and thus succeeded in making sure there were no more defeatist groups in the Army.\\"The Opposition fought against the programmes of industrialisation and collectivisation that made possible all the Soviet Union's heroic achievements. For instance, in April 1930, Trotsky's Bulletin of the Opposition said, \\"Put a stop to \`mass collectivisation'. ... Put a stop to the hurdle race of industrialisation. ... Abandon the \`ideals' of self-contained economy. Draw up a new variant of a plan providing for the widest possible intercourse with the world market.\\" In 1938, Trotsky called for the collective farms to be closed down, and for Soviet enterprises to be handed over to foreign powers.He consistently called on the Soviet people to overthrow the Soviet government when Hitler attacked. He called for a \`revolutionary uprising', an \`insurrection' against the Soviet government, when Hitler attacked the Soviet Union. He wrote, \\"the impetus to the Soviet workers' revolutionary upsurge will probably be given by events outside the country.\\" \\"The first social shock, external or internal, may throw the atomized Soviet Society into civil war.\\"He asked, \\"Can we expect that the Soviet Union will come out of the coming great war without defeat? To this frankly posed question, we will answer as frankly: If the war should remain only a war, the defeat of the Soviet Union would be inevitable. In a technical, economic and military sense, imperialism is incomparably more strong. If it is not paralysed by revolution in the West, imperialism will sweep away the present regime.\\" \\"The defeat of the Soviet Union is inevitable in case the new war shall not provoke a new revolution. ... If we theoretically admit war without revolution, then the defeat of the Soviet Union is inevitable.\\"He wrote, \\"It would be childish to think that the Stalin bureaucracy can be removed by means of a Party or Soviet Congress. Normal, constitutional means are no longer available for the removal of the ruling clique. ... They can be compelled to hand over power to the Proletarian vanguard only by FORCE.\\"\\"Inside the Party, Stalin has put himself above all criticism and the State. It is impossible to displace him except by assassination. Every oppositionist becomes ipso facto a terrorist.\\"Trotsky lied to the \`Dewey Commission' when he told them that that he had not been organising an underground in the Soviet Union.The leader of Trotsky's Fourth International, Ernest Mandel, openly applauded Boris Yeltsin, the key figure in the counter-revolution that finally restored capitalism in the Soviet Union. He wrote, \\"The reformer Yeltsin represents the tendency which wants to reduce the gigantic state apparatus. Consequently he follows in Trotsky's footsteps.\\"The Socialist Workers Party backed the US-organised and funded terrorists, which spawned bin Laden, against the people of Afghanistan. \\"Mujehadin victory will encourage the opponents of Russian rule everywhere in the USSR and Eastern Europe.\\""},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed Trotsky: 1879-1921","review":"Leon Trotsky would seem to most people today, simply by nature of having been a Communist and a founder of the Soviet Union, an utter irrelevance. Fifty years ago, when Deutscher published this volume of his chronicle Trotsky's life this was not the case. Trotsky was more libeled by Stalin's Soviet Union and the sycophantic Communist Parties of the Third International than any dissident has ever been by any regime. Deutscher took it upon himself to save the founder of the Red Army from an oblivion that he did not deserve, and place him in the pantheon of twentieth century giants where he belonged. The fact that his book is still in print after half a century shows that in the eyes of some portion of the reading public he succeded.This first volume deals with Trotsky's genesis from a bookish and brilliant student to a commited revolutionary and his successful part--second only Lenin--in leading the Soviet Union to victory against the forces of reaction. The years of Trotsky's life in exile; as the flamboyant leader of the St. Petersburg Soviet during the 1905 revolution; his violent and polemical disagreements with Lenin on socialist doctrine in the years before the Bolshevik seizure of power; and the often overlooked Trotsky who was a great critic of art and literature are all recounted with utter beauty. This biography reads like the best fiction because of Deutscher's unbelievable control over the English language--he did not begin using the language on a regular basis until after his thirteith year.Overall, for anyone interested in the beginning of that great experiment gone awry that has rightfully been consigned ash heap of history--Soviet socialism--this book is an absolute must. The Trotsky who was responsible for birthing the Soviet Union rightfully appears to the reader, especially in light of the state's collapse in 1991, as one who would have ensured that it would still exist today in a form that would have made the priveleged and the exploiters of the world quack with a fear that the murderous Stalinists never dreamed of--and without all the murder. Oh Brave world that never was!!"},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed Trotsky: 1879-1921","review":"Firstly, it's necessary to keep in mind that Deustscher was not trying to write a biography of Trotsky- if by that is meant an account of his life for its own sake- nor was he trying to write a history of the Russian Revolution and its leaders as a self-contained account. Deutscher's goals where twofold: to vindicate Trotsky's early opposition against Lenin's conception of the revolutionary party as well as his later opposition to Stalin's policies _in the long run_ and at the same time to acknowledge the necessity of Leninism and Stalinism _in the short run_. However objectionable such a view is today, Deutscher's political dialogue with Trotsky's ghost is superbly argued and documented, and anyone, no matter one's political views, will finish reading this work feeling one knows more about the subject than beforehand. In all the languages this work was translated (and I remember the ruckus produced in Brazil by the 1960s Portuguese trans.) it played havoc with accepted Left commonplaces.There are many faults in this new Verso edition: first, its paperback binding is atrocious (after a first read, I have already a couple of loose pages); secondly, there lacks an introduction that sets the work in perspective 50 years after its publication, as well as a glossary of unusual terms for today's conservative age (such as comissar, soviet, etc.) and, perhaps, some short biographies of the smaller characters,with dates of birth and decease, positions held, whereabouts, etc.However, the work can still be enjoyably read on its own, even if you miss some (admittedly small) points."},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed Trotsky: 1879-1921","review":"This is an excellent biography of Trotsky, and, despite the fact it takes up 3 books, it makes up excellent reading and gives one understanding of not just the life of Trotsky, but the reason for many of the peculiar changes that happened in the USSR in it's early days.

This three-volume work remains Isaac Deutscher's great opus.Covering the years from his birth in 1879 until the opening stages of Trotsky's struggle with Kamenev, Zinoviev and Stalin for leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, this volume is an exciting entre into the three-volume series.Isaac Deutscher, obviously, believes in what he writes about. He has a great deal of interest in explaining the details of the struggle that developed between Stalin and Trotsky. Consequently this first volume may give somewhat short shrift to the most productive period of Trosky's life while the author manuveres to tell the story he really wants to tell in the secon and third volumes."},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed Trotsky: 1879-1921","review":"For nearly all its existence since Lenin's death in 1924 Trotsky (aka Lev Davidovich Bronstein) was Satan in the Bolshevik's manichean view of the world. Most of the purges of the 1930s were allegedly meant to cleanse Soviet society and its key institutions (the Communist Party, the unions, the Red Army, the intelligentsia) of the Trotskyte taint that, like some sort of Original Sin, pervaded the proletarian dictatorship. Stalin tried to erase Trotsky from the history of the Revolution. He even erased Trotsky's physical attributes, not just by killing him in 1940, half a world away, but by obliterating his likeness wherever it might have been found.This book, published fifty years ago, tried to counter the Stalinist plot against Trotsky by vindicating his key role in the 1905 and 1917 revolutions, in the Civil War and in the establishment of the Red Army and the Soviet state. The author partially succeeds. Here we see Trotsky in all his glory, as perhaps he would have liked to be remembered, as a child prodigy who from humble rural beginnings quickly found his way in the world, as a professional revolutionary, as a brilliant polemist and orator, who even as a young man was seen as worthy counterpart to Lenin, and far above the rest of the Party, as a good hearted man who tried to promote harmony within the Party and failed at it, as a cultured, civilized \\"westernizer\\", much more appealing than the brutal Stalin, who came straight from the \\"log cabin\\" of czarist barbarism. He also came up with many good ideas, such as Lenin's New Economic Policy. Deutscher also gives us some of the darker sides to Trotsky's scintillating personna. He was proud and haughty, but brittle. He was abusive to others, often unnecessarily. He often let abstractions and daydreams take the place of reality. And he came up with many bad ideas, such as War Communism and the Militarization of Labor.But, given Deutscher's profile (he was a Trotskyte) the book is often a competent whitewash. The author shares Trotsky's (and the Bolshevik's) worldview to a great extent, and sees the October Revolution as a worthy action. Mostly, he takes Trotskyte and Bolshevik motives as justification for their actions. He portrays opponents (such as the White Guards and nationalist Ukrainians and Poles) as illegitimate. Nowhere does the awfulness of Soviet rule, and the brutality of the Bolshevik leaders come through, except perhaps in their remarkably abusive writings. To find such bitchiness nowadays one would have to refer to the academic world, where the nastiness is commensurate to the irrelevance of that which is being discussed.Also, the book is often not very readable as history. The author will often refer to future or past events in a single page, without indication of the precise dates, which makes this a hard book to read for someone not familiar with the October Revolution.Having said this, a good reason to read this book is that it is beautifully written, and that the author really does get very close to his subject, which is mostly a negative in that he lacks perspective, but does bring the advantage of great liveliness which makes this a very good read. This reminds me of Preston's life of General Franco. Preston hated his subject and was unable utterly to develop any empathy with him, so the book was fairly arid and not insightful. Deutscher has the opposite defect: he gets too close, as perhaps does Nicholas Farrell to Mussolini. The ideal would be like Kershaw's Hitler or Short's Mao: far enough to look the monster in the eye, but not close enough to kiss him.At this book's end, Trotsky is at the apex of his power, from which he would begin to slip during Lenin's final year. But this is better left to volume II, which I also hope to review.So read the book, but don't take Deutscher at his word. Complement this with Volkogonov's Trotsky. And with Trotsky's own voluminous writings, which are often very amusing (particularly his biography of Stalin)."},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed Trotsky: 1879-1921","review":"Not only a great overview of Trotsky, a great resource about the ideas, debates and people that formed this century and."},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed Trotsky: 1879-1921","review":"A very readable biography.

There were some, to be sure. What I didn't expect to find was one gr-gr grandfather who was a Union veteran from Maine and a gr-gr-gr grandmother who sheltered a band of deserters who took up arms against the Confederacy in Jones County, Mississippi.Victoria Bynum's book concerns the latter event, its antecedents, and its reverberations down through the years. Jones County stood in marked contrast to most of antebellum Mississippi. In 1860 55% of the state's population was held in slavery, whereas in Jones County the figure was 12%. The area was heavily forested and more suitable to raising livestock than plantation agriculture. Thus Jones County citizens were by and large anti-secessionist. Once the war broke out, however, a goodly number of young men joined Confederate units. Others only did so a year later one step ahead of conscription. But many of the late joining soldiers felt no espirit de corp once the Confederacy lost Vicksburg in 1863 and then passed a law exempting owners of 20 or more slaves from military service. Confederate deserters were not unique to Jones County, but in the Piney Woods their numbers and the support they received from kin and sympathisers were enough to draw attention. And in Newt Knight they had a man willing to organize them and fight. After several attempts, Confederate forces waged a successful campaign that diminished but did not eradicate the Knight Band.While she did not grow up in Mississippi, Victoria Bynum has kinship links that made her aware of this odd story of a rebellion within the rebellion. After a decade of research she has written what will likely remain the definitive book on the subject. She painstakingly traced the various family lines that ended up on separate sides of the Jones County divide. If the Civil War did not pit Jones County brother against brother, it did pit cousin against cousin--usually based on who owned slaves and who did not. Yet it was these family connections that may well have kept the blood from flowing as freely as it did in Missouri.Bynum adds depth to this \\"longest Civil War\\" by following the trail of the mixed race descendents of Newt Knight and with his mulatto consort, Rachel. Their efforts to fashion a life in post Civil War Mississippi, apart from both the black and white communities, gives meaning to Faulkner's observation that the past isn't dead--it isn't even past.All in all, this is a fascinating story. Certainly not light reading, but it is a highly informative and entertaining one for anyone attracted to the many ironies to be found in Southern history. One bit of advice: since \\"Free State\\" begins with the migration of western Carolinians into the Piney Woods, I'd suggest reading the short Wikipedia article about North Carolina's pre-Revolutionary \\"War of the Regulation\\" if you are unfamiliar with this bit of history.As my nephew said after I sent him a copy of this book, \\"Why didn't they teach us about this stuff in school?\\" Probably because too few authors have the diligence, skill, and sensitivity to write historical accounts of this caliber."},{"Title":"The Free State of Jones: Mississippi's Longest Civil War","review":"I have always wondered exactly what happened in Jones County, Mississippi, during the recent unpleasantness, and after reading The Free State of Jones, now I know. Often billed as the county that seceded from the Confederacy, the author provides an excellent local history of Southwest Mississippi from the early 1800s to the dawn of the Civil Rights movement. The author begins with the immigrants to Mississippi territory, mainly from the Carolinas. Excellent maps of migration routes and the early counties in the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi are included. During the Civil War, a band of 100 or so deserters from Confederate military service hid in Jones County, where the soil did not promote large commercial planting, and few individuals owned slaves. While there was never a formal act of secession from the Confederacy by the county government of Jones, the band of deserters did fight fourteen skirmishes with Confederate troops between 1863 and 1865, and many locals were sympathethic, either because they were relatives, they didn't like the relatively strong central Confederate government, or Confederate troops misbehaved by stealing from their small farms. Many of the band deserted because the felt the war was &quot;a rich man's war and a poor man's fight&quot;--especially after the &quot;20 Negro Law&quot; was passed exempting slaveowners with 20 or more slaves from Confederate military service. The author also goes into the mixed racial family of the leader of the band of deserters, Newt Knight, who survived until 1922. There are few places to read the details of this interesting micro-history within the Confederacy. Ms. Bynum's thoroughly researched book encompasses the whole story, and is worth the effort of delving into such a detailed local history."},{"Title":"The Free State of Jones: Mississippi's Longest Civil War","review":"I grew up in a community called Union in Jones county, but never heard about the Free State of Jones. I only heard about the glorious Southern cause growing up. In Mississippi, the victors were the secessionists, followed by the segregationists. This book shows a different side of Mississippi - opposition to secession, resistance to that secession, and different views about race in Jones county.Ms. Bynum even has stories about my g-g-grandmother, who lived to be almost 100. I have found that my g-g-grandfather and three of his brothers actually joined the Union army in New Orleans. Many other men from the county joined about the same time. Ms. Bynum shows the origins of the opposition to secession. She has uncovered a great deal of information that I did not know existed. I am impressed by her work.There was division. Jones county did send troops to fight for the South. Some of those later deserted, such as Newt KnightA movie about the Free State of Jones is now in production by Gary Ross of Seabiscuit fame. Since I read the book I have been collecting everything I can find on the web about the Free State of Jones. I have links to Victoria Bynum's blog and other sites at http:/www.squidoo.com/freestateofjones.This is a great story that Victoria Bynum has unearthed and told in amazing detail. I highly recommend the book for anyone interested in Southern opposition to secession.You might also like Bitterly Divided by David Williams. It tells of opposition to secession throughout the South. His book is convincing, but rather repetitious in its examples. I found Ms. Bynum's book much more accessible and interesting.The opposition to secession in the South is story that needs telling. This is a great place to start learning that story."},{"Title":"The Free State of Jones: Mississippi's Longest Civil War","review":"If you have been following all the hype about the upcoming movie, \\"The State of Jones\\" and its commercial spin-off, the pseudo-historical book of the same name, you will want to read Bynum's seminal work. Don't let the \\"too close for coincidence titles\\" and the eerily look-alike book covers confuse you There is a significant qualitative difference between the two books.Bynum enables the reader to sort historical fact from the convenient Hollywood fiction that is set to obscure this fascinating tale. In The Free State of Jones, Dr. Bynum offers up a thoroughly researched and well-documented book on the little Mississippi county that refuses to be neatly categorized, no matter how brilliant the movie producer or facile the journalist historian.But don't let the fact that Dr. Bynum is faithful to history lead you to believe Free State of Jones is a dry read. The author's genius as a narrator pulls the reader into the story. She is a true history detective at work. We are with her as she follows leads, interviews descendants, tromps through overgrown cemeteries of those lost to legend, rifles through caches of forgotten historical memory. Even when she goes to the collected oral histories of those long dead, she brings them alive again.Bynum refuses to sacrifice her academic integrity by grasping at easy conclusions based on scant data. If she puts forth a scenario, or asks us to consider a hypothesis, you can trust that the accrued evidence warrants it. Her authority has the heft of thoroughness to it.Lastly, Dr. Bynum understands context and that makes all the difference. From years of exhaustive research she knows the difference between what is possible, what is probable and what is highly unlikely, given the place and time. She does not impose fantasized 21st Century sensibilities upon her subjects, but lets the subjects speak for themselves--ambiguities, contradictions, warts and all. Instead of providing the reader with comfortable Hollywood scripts with pre-determined outcomes, Bynum leaves us in awe of the complexity of human character."},{"Title":"The Free State of Jones: Mississippi's Longest Civil War","review":"Victoria Bynum has done an amazing job of research that goes a long way toward explaining how race, class, and gender affected and were affected by the development of social customs in the South. She uses as her central focus the Free State of Jones, the theoretical secession of a southern Mississippi county from the Confederacy. She then goes back in time to find out why the participants were so willing to flout authority during the Civil War. She ends with a trial in 1948 that decided whether one of the descendants of the leader of the Free State of Jones was legally white. Throughout the book, the depth and quality of research is astonishing.In Part One, Bynum looked into the ancestry of the people of southern Mississippi, finding that in colonial and Revolutionary times, their ancestors were just as resistant to central authority as any Fire Eater. Most families came from South Carolina, but their parents lived in North Carolina, where they took part in many small-scale rebellions. They were part of the Regulator movement that resisted the concentration of power into the hands of a few wealthy landowners. They were also part of the more independent Baptist sects that resisted central power in a church hierarchy. Many of these families also resisted the peer pressure to own slaves. Bynum makes it clear that resistance to authority they exhibited during the Civil War was nothing new to these families.Bynum traces the settlement patterns of these families as they moved into Georgia and Alabama before finally putting down roots in Mississippi. This westward mobility was not unusual, of course, but Bynum shows that the types of land that people moved on to can be a clear indicator of their later political views. Families who settled on rich river bottoms tended to become wealthy slave-owners while families and parts of families who stayed by choice in the less fertile hills tended not to own slaves, though some did garner considerable wealth. The plantation owners in any extended family were the strongest supporters of the Confederacy while the backwoods subsistence farmers were more skeptical of any authority.Religion also played a part in the division of family groups into those who defended the Confederacy and those who wanted no part of it. Most of these people were Baptists, but the Baptist church itself was anything but unified. Post-Great Awakening exhorters clashed with more modern missionary congregations. Bynum shows which families belonged to which style of Baptists, and discovers that those who were members of independent churches were more rebellious toward authority than were people who supported the unification of all congregations into one hierarchy. Bynum also traced the experiences of family members who were chastised by their church - a serious social discipline - as it differed from the experiences of those who never flouted the church. Unsurprisingly, long-time members gave less trouble politically than those who were often censured by their congregations.The second part of the book deals with the Civil War, Reconstruction, and on into the twentieth century. It was during the Civil War that some families of the county of Jones in northern Mississippi, led by Newt Knight, declared themselves independent of the Confederacy: the Free State of Jones. Bynum uses the device of contrasting the outlooks of two novels published about this event to frame her arguments. _Tap Roots_ by James Street was published in 1943, and it ignited arguments over what really happened in Jones County. One of Knight's descendants, Ethel Knight, counter-published _Echo of the Black Horn_ in 1953, a novel reeking with Lost Cause overtones, just in time for the Massive Resistance to the Civil Rights movement.Bynum uses these two novels to ask who owns history. Each side claimed their version of events was the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Was Newt Knight a good man who resisted serving in the Confederacy because he believed it was a rich man's war and a poor man's fight? Was he an evil, power-hungry man who used the anarchy of the war to aggrandize himself? Bynum uses the usual scholarly sources to find out what really happened, but she also listens to current versions of the past to analyze the effect of those events on modern Southerners. The fact that New Knight had a long-standing relationship, and several children, with Rachel Knight, a mulatto woman and former slave, brought the race issue to the forefront of many arguments. The fact that Rachel was a strong woman who took responsibility for her own life in difficult circumstances made gender a definite factor in what people wanted to believe, then and later.All these facts and factors come together in the miscegenation trial of Davis Knight, great-grandson of Rachel, who married a white woman in 1948. Bynum suggests that the publication of _Tap Roots_ in 1943 renewed awareness in the doings on Newt Knight and his offspring, and so Davis's marriage five years later became a matter that townspeople felt they had a vested interest in. Davis, who was probably one thirty-second part of African descent, was found to be legally white, and therefore not guilty of miscegenation. Race, class, and gender issues all mix together in this examination of his status, and also inform Bynum's careful analysis.Bynum brings together three turbulent times in American history - the Revolutionary Era, the Civil War and Reconstruction, and the Civil Rights movement - and shows how several extended families unify all these events. Her variety of sources is stunning, ranging from the manuscript census to church records, county-level records, and oral traditions. There is enough research here for three books, but Bynum's writing is so good that the reader is simply swept along with her story.If you are tempted to read another version of this story, be aware that those authors did not do the historically accurate type of research shown in this book, and they aimed their interpretations at sales (both of book and movie) rather than scholarly precision.Note: much of this review was published by H-Net: Humanities and Social Sciences Online."},{"Title":"The Free State of Jones: Mississippi's Longest Civil War","review":"For me, the best history books are ones that show us how the great movements in history affect (and bring out the best in) everyday people who are just trying protect their families, live by their guiding principles, and get by in the world.

She goes into details, explaining the different economic, cultural, and religious factors that served to mold the life of the everyday Jones County citizen.The Free State of Mississippi... is a must read for anyone whith roots in Jones Co., MS, as well as for anyone who is simply interested in deep South History."},{"Title":"The Free State of Jones: Mississippi's Longest Civil War","review":"Having grown up in Jones County and having heard about Newt Knight for the past 50 years, I thought I knew the story. Of course, the story is in the ears of the beholders, so there was much to learn from this well-researched account. I still think the people of Jones County just can't get along with more than two other people at a time, but I appreciate the alternate explanation. Having also left Jones County as soon as I was able (at age 18 to go to school among yankees), I was touched to read the evidence for anti-slavery sentiment presented in this work. I also read the movie-script-based book and found it's just-so story approach much less satisfying. Dr. Bynum's work presents convincing evidence, clear explanations of missing information (records lost when the courthouse burned), and logical analysis of a small counter current in the eye of the civil war hurricane. The tempest in Jones County continues to provoke heated discussions at local family reunions; perhaps, the story will survive its 15 minutes of fame among wider circles."},{"Title":"The Free State of Jones: Mississippi's Longest Civil War","review":"Professor Bynum does the seemingly impossible: she researches and analyzes like a good historian and writes like a popular novelist.

In late 1864 a large Union cavalry raid of several thousand men, from Baton Rouge, La., to Pascagoula, Ms., made it as far as New Augusta and the Lucedale, Mississippi areas, right through the very heart of the Pineywoods region and the very boarders of Jones County. No mention in the war records of this expedition mentions ANY pro-union support from the people of that area. No mention of the \\"Free State of Jones\\", no mention of Newt Knight or his company of pro-union irregulars. Even Newt Knights own history, written by his son, does not mention any contact with this very large and noticable force or of its existance so close to their base of operations. The Union expedition was turned back in a skirmish with Confederate forces just south of Lucedale and forced to retreat to the coast.2. After the war during reconstruction the Federal Government setup commissions to document and determine damages to pro-union Southerners committed by Union forces. According to the commission records the Pineywoods section of the state had some of the fewest claims on record. To win a claim against the Federal Government a person had to prove loyalty to the Union; and prove damages officially by Union forces.The records state that...Jasper County- 2 filed claimantsJones County- 1 filed claimantGreene County- 1 filed claimantSimpson County- 1 filed claimantSmith County- 1 filed claimantWayne County- 2 filed claimantsPerry County- 0Covington County- 0The Warren County, not a Pineywoods county on the Mississippi River, had over 350 claims on record. If the Pineywoods counties were pro-union there should have been more claims from here since several well known Union Raids crossed right through this area, i.e. Grierson's Raid, which survived by taking from the locals food, fodder and materials, plus any valuables they could find for the taking.3. The 1860 Election Returns for the Pineywoods section is upsidedown from the popular history presented.Jasper County- 361 Bell, 712 Breckinridge, 18 DouglasJones County- 96 Bell, 264 Breckinridge, 0 DouglasGreene County- 45 Bell, 250 Breckinridge, 0 DouglasSimpson County- 136 Bell, 370 Breckinridge, 3 DouglasSmith County- 234 Bell, 517 Breckinridge, 5 DouglasWayne County- 110 Bell, 180 Breckinridge, 0 DouglasPerry County- 105 Bell, 201 Breckinridge, 6 DouglasCovington County, 106 Bell, 391 Breckinridge, 8 DouglasBell was the Union Party candidate, Breckinridge was secessionist candidate. If Jones County was pro-union then this fact should certainly would been reflected in the votes for president. Bell won in several counties along the Mississippi River where the population of slaves and the size of plantations was GREATEST, and where secession would do most harm. Breckinridge, the secessionist candidate, won in primarily non-slave owning counties. The fact that Jones County was against secession is put into doubt when the official records show different.When reading the history of the \\"Free State of Jones\\" one should be aware there is no official documentation to support most of the stories presented in any of them."},{"Title":"The Free State of Jones: Mississippi's Longest Civil War","review":"Very interesting book about Jones County seceding from the state of Mississippi during the Civil War.

Does put a lot of things in perspective about the south. Too bad the south is still living in the past today over 160 years later."},{"Title":"The Free State of Jones: Mississippi's Longest Civil War","review":"Calling one county in the whole state of Mississippi a separate state loyal to the Union is a stretch, by anyone's standards. There were a lot of Union sympathizers in the county, as enumerated in some of the many maps and tables in the book (too many, in my opinion), but there were several counties and whole areas in many of the southern states (Tennessee, for one) which were sympathetic to the Union cause. Why the author picked this county for analysis, I cannot figure out. It is implied that the county remained loyal to the Union cause long after the Civil War, but so were a lot of other counties, even whole areas of various states. And, there is not much explanation of why the author implied that there existed continuing hostility to the Union in this county; there were (and still are) pockets of Confederate loyalists throughout the south. (As a southerner, I can attest to that fact.)In any case, this is a readable book, and probably worth purchasing if you're into Civil War history, and even if you're just mildly interested. But, as a book for beginners of that period of time, I'd recommend several other books to start with. It is readable, but not gripping. It was easy for me to lay down for several days, and then pick it up again. I didn't feel that I had missed anything. (Usually, books either grab me right away, or are extremely boring to me. Unfortunately, this book lies in the latter category, even though I'm rather interested in Civil War history.)In short the title of my review: ehh...."},{"Title":"The Free State of Jones: Mississippi's Longest Civil War","review":"The Free State of Jones by Victoria E.

As a consequence, fewer and fewer of us are willing to take chances--much less, God forbid, risks--for the sake of the Gospel. Little wonder that some of the folks most ardently working for peace and justice have a healthy distrust of Christianity.Jon Daniels, a seminary (Episcopal) student, was someone who had no use for suburban spirituality. He went down to Alabama at the height of the Civil Rights disturbances, lived the Gospel's message of service, and eventually was gunned down by a white deputy sheriff (who was acquitted by an all-white jury!)when he pushed a black teenager out of the way and caught the gunshot blast intended for her.Daniels was only in his mid-twenties when he was martyred, but his essays, letters, and journal, which make up a good half of this biography, reveal a man who had thought and prayed deeply about the need to live the Gospel message of service to others. The book, first published some 35 years ago, has been reprinted by Moorehouse Press, and deserves wider attention than it's gotten thus far.

However, when they first encounter &quot;Heads Off,&quot; the marooned Conquistador, the People are part of a pedestrian, stone age culture. For better or worse, this first Euro contact changes the People and their way of life forever.Coldsmith is an excellent story-teller.

It was obviously slapped together in a few months after 9/11's military escalation...Yet the book is worth less than the ink and paper absorbed in its quick production. No special insights about what distinguishes Secretary Rumsfeld appear. The book is about an abstraction. It is based on public information stichted together abruptly in the obvious hope of making a quick buck from the prominence Rumsfeld gained at the hands of a concerned nation absorbed by daily Pentagon press briefings.Beyond this cheap publishing angle, in substance the book is empty. It could be about any figure who strikes an average reader (the mass target audience of the quick buck book gambit), at a gut level as having leadership qualities. No relevant lessons can be drawn from the assembled data. No analysis even of that limited data is conducted that could teach anything about the character of influence and leadership.Any proper approach to examining the leadership qualities of a public figure would entail far more thought and reflection than went into this skinny volume. Research would include interviews with substantial numbers of people who actually know the person. For a subject who is an active leader, research would certainly include interviewing that person (not done in this case). Most obviously to a thoughtful reader but not to this book's author, perspective borne of historical distance may be necessary before anaccurate and meaningful appraisal can be given of the leadership skills of the US's current Secretary of Defense."},{"Title":"The Rumsfeld Way: Leadership Wisdom of a Battle-Hardened Maverick","review":"I was dissapointed in this little book.

Ok, I decided to keep an open mind. After all, as a military officer, he is my in my chain of command. But after reading this, I have to agree with the reviewer from the UK - rubbish. The only lessons you will learn here are those that show you what not to do. Rumsfeld has single handedly alienated most of the senior officer corps, not to mention most of the military too. The anger within the military towards Rumsfeld is growing. I wouldn't be surprised if, push come to shove, at some point the military refuses to do this man's bidding. If it keeps up much longer, a coup seems certain. This book, if followed, will lead to the same situation in your company - divisiveness, anger, and ultimately implosion.

Probably to hit a wartime deadline, Krames based the text primarily on work published about Rummy over a 40-year period, and not on independent research. In fact, a disclaimer says the book has no endorsement or authorization from Rumsfeld or anyone around him.

People that engineered the war were hailed as great leaders and intellects of our time.What a difference a few years makes. Rumsfeld has resigned in the wake of a bloody 3-year quagmire with no end in sight, Bush is about to increase troop levels, and the month of this review (December 2006) has been one of the bloodiest in Iraq to date, and all but the most hard-nosed of conservatives have conceded what a disaster this war has been.This book almost comes across as a parody now- the leadership qualities Rumsfeld is praised for in this book, \\"Creating Coalitions\\", \\"Acquiring intelligence\\", have been tragically turned on their heads- the US rushed into this war without U.N. support, and the intelligence they claimed to have acquired turned out to be disastrously wrong.The straight-shooter, no BS style that so many conservatives have praised- basically, ignore what other people think and charge into situations half-cocked and uninformed like a \\"Maverick\\"- ironically underscores the qualities that made Rumsfeld such a massively incompetent and ineffective leader. Rumsfeld's war has become a cautionary example now, a case study in what not to do as a world leader.On the bright side, you can get it cheap- some sellers on amazon are letting it go for as little as $0.01 now. And for camp value, this book is fantastic. But as a study in effective leadership?

The easily readable book includes short and to the point chapter summaries further ensuring that we will learn how to lead in The Rumsfeld Way. From the dramatic opening pages documenting the change of power during Watergate to the final moments as President Bush ascends the platform in the U.S. Congress, Krames has created a book that is part drama, part historical documentary, and part legendary tale. In a deft and effective manner Krames has helped those who aspire to become leaders learn how to adopt and adapt Rumsfeld's Way to better lead their organizations throughout the 21st century. I not only gained a great deal from the book but immediately shared it with my MBA students who are enrolled in a course entitled, &quot;Leading Organizational Change.&quot; This books is far better and more comprehensive than any text book I could assign.

He is a man that relishes his job and is not interested in courting popularity, although at this late stage of his life he has attracted it, through sheer performance and his sense of humour.At a press conference at the end of the recent war, an Afro-American major, asked him a question relating to early retirement benefits for Army personnel. Rummy had a field day answering that: &quot;You are asking a 70 year old about early retirement?,&quot; the Defense Secretary said with mock horror and a wicked grin that reminded me of the cartoon character 'Whalesteeth' (in Chick Young's &quot;Dagwood and Blondie&quot; series), although his critics would probably refer to him as 'sharksteeth'.That quip was vintage Rumsfeld and will obviously make the pages of later, and more complete, works on him ( Krames book was published early in 2002).Indeed, books on Rummy will no doubt doubt be a growth industry by the time he steps down. How long that will be is anyone's guess, but current indications would indicate he may well go the full distance of a Bush presidency which would make him 76 at the close of two terms.America and the world have been well served by this feisty warrior - and the subject, like the book, is certainly appreciated by this Australian."},{"Title":"The Rumsfeld Way: Leadership Wisdom of a Battle-Hardened Maverick","review":"Follow the finely crafted journey of the politician, turned CEO, turned politician.

Just mentioning those two words evokes emotion from those who follow politics - be it a scowl from a liberal, or hopefully, a smile and an affirmative nod of the head from one of a more keen intellect. It seems as if Rummy has created, in what is indicative of any true leader, many friends - as well as some enemies - along his way. The Rumsfeld Way is, for all intents and purposes, a leadership book, albeit one that also chronicles Rumsfeld's highly successful exploits both in the private sector and the public arena as it delineates Rummy's dynamic leadership acumen.Rumsfeld has, in what is no small feat, rapidly transformed America's national defense from a vacillating and timid gun shy state of malaise with a dilapidated and impotent military suffering from Clinton-induced low morale to the current state of a vibrant, robust, confident, and fully empowered military unrivaled in the world. How has he, for someone the liberals gleefully lambasted as being a relic of another era, generated such impressive results in such a short amount of time, all the while accumulating an impressively fervent following? One reason is Rummy, who routinely works grueling 14-hour days at The Pentagon, expects nothing but excellence from all of those around him - including himself. Tolerating underperformers, and God forbid, nonperformers, doesn't fly in the Rumsfeld camp - to put it mildly. Rummy's 2-word leadership mantra of &quot;Get Results,&quot; while simply stated, sums up his no-nonsense philosophy. Invariably, he has achieved exemplary results, while cultivating, unlike the Clinton White House, such wildly bizarre concepts as honesty(gasp!), integrity, perseverance, propriety, and plain old-fashioned straight talk - all the while invoking a cutting sense of humor.When you're a multi-millionaire of retirement age, why return to the arduous undertaking of heading up the Pentagon? Because Rumsfeld, being the leader that he is, thrives on seemingly intractable challenges. As a country and a people, we are blessed to have had Rumsfeld return to Washington in the period just prior to such an incredibly grave and trying time in our American history. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to truly enrich themselves with the intricacies of what consitutes a truly superb paragon of leadership - from a man that all Americans should be thankful is working for them.&quot;Some people believe that the first casualty of any war is the truth. But in this war, the first victory is to tell the truth.&quot;- Donald Rumsfeld"},{"Title":"The Rumsfeld Way: Leadership Wisdom of a Battle-Hardened Maverick","review":"the paper in this book is great. it has many uses. for example, you could wipe your arse with it. but if you're looking for a book that might teach you something, this isn't it. yes, i bought it and read it. then i put it down and i laughed at what a huge joke it is."},{"Title":"The Rumsfeld Way: Leadership Wisdom of a Battle-Hardened Maverick","review":"Don Rumsfeld likes to portray himself as so &quot;tough&quot;. Yet when presented with the opportunity to prove it by serving in armed combat during the Korean War, he dodged military service by sitting it out at Princeton with a student deferment. The book conveniently glosses over this salient fact. This man has no claim to honor, and the book is a waste of valuable trees."},{"Title":"The Rumsfeld Way: Leadership Wisdom of a Battle-Hardened Maverick","review":"Well, Well, I held Rumsfeld in awe. I was sadly mistaken. I am giving 4 stars for this book(Rumsfeld himself gets a single *) because it has made me learn things about the man, and change my view of him(what the intention was, is a moot point!). The book is filled with his quips( a better word for a gaping mouth, ashamed to admit he does not know the answer, evasive tactics). The book is filled with that. To fill the career graph with 2 pages, being a chairman, is not any big achievement. People get hononary Doctorates too....people also get 4 more pages to fill in their resume ones they reach a post after working like a dog!, but some people are just plain lucky, Rumsfeld is one of them. Is he a good leader? Well - that depends on how you define leadership. He is an effective leader, no doubt, Hitler was effective too(just to drive the point home, not for comparison, unless some PC cutlet starts jumping as if sitting on a frying pan). One need not be a Patton, to be a leader. Good leaders always have a humane touch to their actions. I am not saying what actions he took post Sept 11, were wrong, but How has it helped us? Do you think it was a difficult task for him in that position to do what he did. I don't think so( With authority, comes responsibility!). If you hold Rumsfeld in awe, and want to keep it that way, don't read this book."},{"Title":"The Rumsfeld Way: Leadership Wisdom of a Battle-Hardened Maverick","review":"I can't believe this Cold War dinosaur is still in power let alone revered for his &quot;leadership&quot; qualities. Apart from the fact that he's a phycho the guy is 70+ years old for God's sake.He should do mankind a favour and retire to Miami or wherever it is that Republicans retire to. There he can be out of harm's way playing golf and reminiscing over the good old days.I think America is on a serious cultural decline if a serious publication like McGraw-Hill is publishing rubbish like this. I know freedom is a &quot;wonderful thing&quot; and that America is a place where anyone can read say what they like, worship freely etc. However, think how more wonderful that freedom would be if used more constructively. I mean what are we to expect next: &quot;The Little Book of Rumsfeld Wisdom?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Rumsfeld Way: Leadership Wisdom of a Battle-Hardened Maverick","review":"I give this book 2 stars for its comedic value.

He's the youngest man to be elected to the House of Representatives and the only man to serve as Secretary of Defense twice. Once you read this book you'll understand how he's achieved success in government and as the CEO of major corporations. It's worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"The Rumsfeld Way: Leadership Wisdom of a Battle-Hardened Maverick","review":"As a writer/author/management researcher I attempt to keep a critcal eye on areas that interest me. I found this book to be a very pleasant surprise. I expected a canned look at a currently high profile person. Instead, I found a straightforward, interesting read about a more complex person than I had assumed existed.The book has an easy to follow flow, is crisply written, and is informative. Watching Rumsfeld in action on the news programs is easy to connect to the background, operating under difficult circumstances, and experiences portrayed in this tightly written book.If your looking for the negative side of Rumsfeld this is not the book. If you want to trace how current leadership style is shaped by background than this will be a quick, educational, and comfortable read that is worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"The Rumsfeld Way: Leadership Wisdom of a Battle-Hardened Maverick","review":"I find Rumsfeld a fascinating character as do many Americans who saw him in action during the September 11th crisis and thereafter. Therefore, I was interested to read this book and learn more about Rumsfeld. What I found was a book that didn't dwell on gossip or juicy tidbits about Rumsfeld's life, but rather intelligently analyzed and distilled his true leadership qualities. The book helped me learn about myself and what it was that I was responding to in Rumsfeld. It pinpointed his strengths without making him seem saccharine. That ability, to present the best of the leadership qualities but keeping the man life-size, made Rumsfeld real. It also helped me grasp some of the more subtle issues contributing to effective leadership and I think would make an excellent text book on that subject."},{"Title":"The Rumsfeld Way: Leadership Wisdom of a Battle-Hardened Maverick","review":"Reviewer is the Director of the Center for Career and Leadership Development at Purdue University Calumet, a regional campus of Purdue University located in Northwest Indiana.I don't follow politics very closely. However, I became intrigued with Donald Rumsfeld simply by watching some of his press conferences. So I decided to explore the character a bit further by reading Mr. Krames' book, &quot;The Rumsfeld Way&quot; - and I'm glad I did! The book has some biographical elements in it, which allow the reader to understand Rumsfeld the man. But best of all, the book is loaded with practical tips and tactics used by Rumsfeld the leader. I highly recommend &quot;The Rumsfeld Way&quot; for anyone looking to develop his or her leadership style so that they are highly understood in any situation and well prepared to handle anything that comes their way. In my job, I help college students to develop their leadership abilities and I have used the information presented in Mr. Krames' previous book (&quot;The Jack Welch Lexicon of Leadership&quot;) in some of the training classes we conduct. Likewise, I plan to use this new book the same way because my students will be able to relate to its timeliness."},{"Title":"The Rumsfeld Way: Leadership Wisdom of a Battle-Hardened Maverick","review":"I have recently become a Rumsfeld junkie. I frequently watch his press briefings and admire how he handles the media and comes across as someone you can actually believe what he is saying. When my husband saw this book he got it for me. I read it quickly in two days.I felt the book covered the many facets of Mr. Rumsfeld very well. It is apparent that a lot of research went into this book. I only knew of Rumsfeld in the present but now I have a much better understanding of the man.The book is well written and maintains a high level of interest for the reader. I especially enjoyed the inside perspective from Henry Kissinger on Rumsfeld. Another credit to Mr. Krames is that he did not simply put Rumsfeld on a &quot;pedestal&quot;. He also described some other characteristics and episodes that I found revealing.I definitely recommend this book and my husband is now reading it."},{"Title":"The Rumsfeld Way: Leadership Wisdom of a Battle-Hardened Maverick","review":"Follow the finely crafted journey of the politician, turned CEO, turned politician. Learn how the no-nonsense Secretary of Defense applied his standards of excellence to the floundering G.D. Searle Corporation and turned it into a stockholders dream. And you'll be able to recognize how Rummy is applying those same principles as he works as the CEO to the war on terror.Author Jeffrey Krames takes you through four decades in the life of Mr. Rumsfeld. Whether you like the man or not, you will have a much better understanding of where he is coming from when he gives those cut-to-the-bone answers during press conferences.Whether a CEO or a student working part time, the reader will come away motivated and will have a greater understanding of how to succeed in any endeavor. Many great minds have difficulty transitioning from the private to the public sector and vice versa. Rumsfeld did it with ease."},{"Title":"The Rumsfeld Way: Leadership Wisdom of a Battle-Hardened Maverick","review":"For the time-pressed businessman or woman, I found this to be a really fast and interesting and most importantly USEFUL read, with lots of easily adoptable lessons and great ideas on how to lead and be successful. Here's the kicker: Donald Rumsfeld had never run a company before he became CEO of a pharmaceutical company, yet he went in armed with ideas (mapped out in the book) and became hugely successful. I loved this book, and you'll love the &quot;nuggets&quot; at the end of each chapter--leadership ideas that spell success!"},{"Title":"The Rumsfeld Way: Leadership Wisdom of a Battle-Hardened Maverick","review":".I just finished reading this book. And I must say that it is one of those no-nonsense books.There is no doubt that Rumsfeld is indeed a Battle-Hardened Maverick. He is a sort of licensed trouble-shooter and crisis manager.The book takes you thru Rumsfeld's ways of dealing with people and issues. Or Rumsfeld's recipe for success.At the end of each chapter the author summarizes the key ideas covered in the chapter.Worth Reading."},{"Title":"The Rumsfeld Way: Leadership Wisdom of a Battle-Hardened Maverick","review":"Love him or hate him, Donald Rumsfeld gets results. While this book is based on the famous 'Rumsfeld's Rules' it gives great examples of Rumsfeld's leadership wisdom and credentials from his days as a Congressman, cleaning house in the Ford administration, his days at Searle pharmaceuticals, and today leading the Defense Department. Short informative chapters give great insight into the man the press fears and respects. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Rumsfeld Way: Leadership Wisdom of a Battle-Hardened Maverick","review":"This book has very little substance. It written in a strange style, and little summaries at the end of each chapter. This is a very fast read, double spaced and all. Though this book does have some interesting facts it is far from a bio or an account of Rumsfelds time as SoD. I wouldn't pay full price for this book, but if you want a quick read get it used!"},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"There's a reason why I give this book a rather moderate review. For sheer readability it certainly deserves higher. Obviously my own personal biases about the topics discussed are going to cloud one's opinion of any matter, no matter what they may be. Surely I think Chittum is going a bit far, especially in the timeline predictions of the fall of America. But I don't doubt it's coming, I don't doubt a full-scale, massive race war will wipe out the government and make room for foreign powers to eventually move in and set up shop. No, none of this is too far out, although not likely in the next 20 years, but everyone writing a bound to be contraversial book needs a hook or catch to summon up all the righteous converts to get up an army and live off in the mountains somewhere. In fact, the over-the-top exaggeration I just set out is indicitive of the encroaching silliness and ghastly paranoia--all the more amusing by its hard-boiled tone--of this book. It is very funny, but not particularly credible in its effort to pass itself off as a serious warning essay. I don't want to imply that Chittum is a right-wing nut, or some frothing mouthed lunitic, just that the tone and lack of follow-up, coupled with a rely-on-my-opinions stance blows craters of relevence out of the work. Chalk it up as a good futuristic thriller/apocaylpse novel taking itself way too seriously."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"This book was awful and I had to throw it away 2 hours after reading it. I just think it is full of falsehood and frankly is so overtly white neo nazi racist I was gagging. I'm white, I'm into preparedness, I'm a constitutionalist.. yet this book is completely false. I will fight alongside any race that loves and values freedom. It really has nothing to do with race, it's about your respect for property rights and freedom. This author gets it all wrong because he's SO HUNG UP on race. He thinks the US will divide into 3 nations by race alone. How dumb can you be. I can see that the mexicans aren't integrating into US culture and that is a concern... but black folk, some hispanic folk, just as white folk will defend our constitution. This book is defending the KKK and all other white neo groups..."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"I found the book to be for the most part to be irrelevant to current times and situations. The author is obviously fixated on problems with race which while somewhat relevant concerning the nations' situation in failing to stem the mexican invasion, it falls flat almost everywhere else. I would not recommend it to my friends, and would not keep it as a part of my personal library...In fact, I would suggest that Amazon remove it from it's listings as it has little or no value to the consumer unless they were a white power racist stuck in the 1990s."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"Chittum has done a fine job of collecting statistical facts that point to the racial polarization of American society. Much of what he writes could well become fact. That being said, this book serves as fuel for those that need their racist views validated. If you think that the U.S fought on the wrong side in World War II, you'll love this book. Reference the reviwer below that stated that their preferred reading was &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; and &quot;Hunter&quot;, books written by William Pierce, head of the American Vanguard."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"Although I have thought that we are destined for a second Civil war, it will not be a race driven war. There will be another civil war within the next 100 years, maybe the next 25. It will be conceived by the elites, however, it will be mass propaganda like is going on right now on the News Channels. Specifically Faux News (Fox), which is spreading hate like I have never witnessed before. The scary thing is that the things that guys like Glenn Beck, Hannity, and Oreilly are saying are totally false, without sources, no evidence behind their claims. However, they are good at what they do, because they have already got so many (obviously uneducated or no mind of their own) people in an uproar.Case A. The whole BP thing, they blasted Obama for waiting on BP to make the corrections themselves. Now what if Obama would have stepped up as soon as the oil spill happened and said we will use American Tax payers money to fix the problem? They would have blasted Obama for spending more money and bankrupting America. Which president was it again who offered the first bailout? Oh yeah Bush. How much money did Bush spend on the War on \\"terror\\", a hell of a lot more money than they will ever tell you. And what two companies got earned more money than any other because of the war? Haliburton(cheney is CEO) and Carlyle Group(Bush Sr is on Board of Directors, Bush Jr was after he had 3 failed business attempts, including his first business that he was given by brother of Osama, yeah Bin Laden Family. And then Bush JR got booted off the Board of directors of Carlyle, cuz all he did was crack jokes and did nothing for the company).Bush raped our country for all it was worth, and gave the money to all of his cronies, then his parting gift was a nice bailout to the major banks, who are all lead by former high level government personel, including CITI CEO John Deutch who is a former CIA exec. If the way that Bush destroyed our country doesn't piss you off, then you need to go read some books about what really happened during most corrupt 8 year span in Americas history. All I can say is thank god Hillary did not win the election, because the Clintons are just as bad as the Bush's.A lot of the negative press towards Obama is starting to make sense. If the Bush>Clinton>Bush>Clinton plan would have been successful, we would have been in economic hell, and since Obama was able to prevent a presumably 28 year dictatorship, its no wonder the elites who have prospered from the former regime, are doing everything they can to smear Obama.What am I getting at? The absolute frightening nature that media outlets are exhibiting, and the total manipulation and disinformation that is causing a bunch of Billy Joes and Cletus' to get their pantys in a bunch and start these very unoriginal Tea Partys. So yes, there will be another civil war(esque) event in this country. It will not be a race war, although there will be many whites against whites/blacks, and many blacks against whites/mexicans. But those that are fighting are just pawns of the elites, and are just helping America go down the drain.Some reading material for yalCrossing the Rubicon by Michael C.

I've had this book for about a year now, and I started it half a dozen times but I've never been able to get past the first 50 pages.While I give the author credit for his obvious exhaustive research, he desprately needs someone to show him how to write a book that is readable! This is not a novel as much as it is a referance book.If someone ever needed to look up facts and figures,this is the place to go.With a pie chart or bar graph on every third or fourth page it is more an encyclopedia than a novel.If you're looking for entertainment or even info-tainment, avoid this book!!!"},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"Chittum obviously ignored the history of this country when he wrote this book. First off he engages in the kind of anti-immigrant sentiment that countless people have in the past, only he targets hispanic immigrants rather than the southern European immigrants of the late 19th century. He writes nothing of American Vernacular culture, which eventually breaks down all immigrant communities regardless of what race or ethnic group they are. Another thing I find irritating is the way he refers to New Mexico as a &quot;mini third-world country&quot;, just because half of it's population is non-white. Overall this has failed to convince me of anything horrible happening in this country because of race or ethnicity. Also, for anyone who believes that Chittum is not a racist or right wing extremist, please take a look at his website."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"I'd purchased this book some years ago from a mail-order provider of unorthodox and delightfully anarchistic publications, hoping for a well-analyzed and well-reasoned discussion of those factors most likely to negatively influence the social and political unity of these United States in the near future.That's not what I found between the covers of this screed.Although there are hellacious problems related to the bone-headed \\"politically correct\\" facilitation of immigrants' reluctance to assimilate themselves and their progeny into the mainstream social and cultural structure of these United States (particularly the \\"multicultural\\" approach that even more grievously degrades the quality of education made available to Hispanic and African-American children in those government indoctrination centers that masquerade as our public education system), and though this can certainly be viewed as a threatening circumstance, precisely what we do *not* get in this book is any sort of credible approach to the situation.Mr. Chittum has instead regurgitated a lot of plain, old-fashioned bigotry, thinking somehow that he had smoothly disguised the bile and the muriatic acid by dosing himself with a bottleful of Maalox before vomiting into his word processor. Not bloody likely. Nothing original, nothing perceptive, and nothing of any real value except as an insight into the mindset of a humorless praxeological cripple...."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"Oh, how sorry we all should feel for poor Mr. Chittum and all his reationary friends who have to endure the horrors of living in a progressive modern state based on such heresies as universal human rights and tolerance. They might actually have to live next door to a Cambodian or ride the bus with a gay person. Boo-hoo! Better to revert to the Dark Ages and found new warlike nations based on blood, soil, and religious fanaticism. Not im MY future, buddy.

Every Faux News talking point gets mentioned about a zillion times, there's the palpable fear of those dark-skinned furriners, and there's not even any zombies.This seems to be part of quite a little niche marketing; Reichwing apocalypse porn, usually written by the sort of officers you'd hate to serve under: think Ferret Face from M.A.S.H.It's marginally more subtle than \\"The Turner Diaries\\", but the people this book is aimed at are probably screaming about socialism taking their...social....security at a town hall somewhere.

Rowling."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"This book is not for the squeamish. It lays out the facts vis-a-vis America's conversion into a multi-racial, multi-cultural empire, run for the benefit of a global capitalist elite. And it explains why such a system is likely untenable, and why the most likely response is full-scale racial war, with a particular emphasis on Hispanics in the southwest and Blacks in the southeast. Depressing, but very timely and needed."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"Every schoolchild who is being force-fed the cultural &quot;diversity&quot; at all costs mantra, should be required to read this book. The current morass in Yugoslavia will be repeated here in 20 to 50 years. The fact is, that despite our Utopian dreams, people group according to similar cultures and beliefs, and choose to be among similar people. When we realize that and adjust our immigration policies accordingly, we may stave off widespread civil war and unrest. If not, prepare for a lot of strife and bloodshed."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"This book is a exact timeline of exactly what is happening in this country.

Black and Hispanic racism is on the rise and becoming more open and brazen with each passing day. The country is rapidly breaking up along lines of race, age, ethnicity, sex,sexual perversions,etc.,and the conquering hordes from Mexico and Central America are filling our prisons, bilking our welfare system, forming latino street gangs throughout the Southwest and openly vowing to take control of the Southwest as part of Mexico, while making every place they inhabit look like Tijuana north.

The author has a basic insite that makes the reader analysis every statement he makes. It is difficult to rebute his arguments. I find myself now relating every daily event to his book.

If the author lived in souther Cal. he would change his time estimates."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"As scary as this concept is, I believe it possible. The author supports his premise very well and the warning is sufficient for me to acknowledge by being ready."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"The current consensus view of America's future is that we'll continue to be a happy prosperous melting pot, and that economic growth will offset the combined effects of the unfunded age wave and the massive new influx of foreign immigration.I'm a classical liberal and I deeply, truly wish that would come to pass. I'm still looking for ways in which that optimistic outcome can be helped along.But virtually no one is talking about the possible consequences if we fail to do that. Nor is there any discussion of the possible causes of failure, or of the likelihood that things could come apart in rapid and ugly fashion.No one except Tom Chittum (and Peter Brimelow in &quot;Alien Nation&quot;) is daring or even bothering to ask hard questions of this type. And that in itself scares me. As Chittum notes, the US is now a multicultural imperial power. All such nations in history have disintegrated violently.Failures which are avoided are most often the ones that have been anticipated. But America's not running any downside scenarios for itself other than in these small books. Big mistake.I live in CA, right on top of the San Andreas Fault, but that's trivial compared to the new demographic and cultural and linguistic and economic fault lines I see opening all around my community. And that's not the future. That is today's reality.Some of Chittum's analysis can be faulted. I do not share his political position, which is pretty far out on the right as far as I can infer. I would also bet on a long period of political infighting long before shooting would start.But I learned some unsettling things from this book that I didn't know before. The facts check out. If you want cotton candy, look someplace else. If you want a hard look at the USA in Y2K plus 10, read Chittum."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"The 10 rating is not an exaggeration and it's the first I've ever given for a book. I think most Americans agree, regardless of their ehtnicity, that a major ethnic war is in our future. The only burning questions have been WHEN? HOW? WHAT WILL IT BE LIKE? and WHAT WILL BE LEFT WHEN IT'S OVER? Chittum answers these questions and more. The book is written in the no-nonsense style that you'd expect from a grunt, and in an expertly articulated manner that you might not. You can get through this in one reading and will probably refer back to it often. The basic premise of the book is that an ALL-OUT race war is coming within our lifetimes. The result will be the carving up of America into several ethnic nations. Which future ethnic nation are YOU living in right now? How can YOU expect events for Civil War Two to unfold in YOUR neighborhood? What will the war be like for YOU and YOUR family? Only the naive would dismiss out of hand the horrifying predictions of this book."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"This is a fascinating book and one that should be on the bookshelf of every serious reader of history, current affairs, and politics. Chittum shows us exactly where we are headed with our government's out-of-control Third World immigration and race-agitation policies. Chittum says a lot of things that no one in the mainstream would dare say and I especially appreciate his pointing out that in America, &quot;citizenship&quot; ceases to mean almost anything while the racial group one belongs to (generally the lower on the evolutionary scale the better), continues to mean more and more. Because he presents such a compelling case, his critics are reduced to name-calling, insults, and slander in their remarks. One overwhelming weakness, however, is Chittum's overwhelming desire not to offend and tow the PC-line despite having written a very un-PC book. For example, he takes several pages to mournfully contemplate the possibility of the genocide of blacks in the South should they lose the war but doesn't give the possiblity that the same thing could happen to the whites the same degree of sobbing attention -- as if blacks were that much more racially and culturally indispensible to the future of America than whites. Nor does he pay much creedence to the CURRENT genocide of whites in America due to the government's immigration, forced integration, welfare, taxation and birth control policies. Other than that, it's a great book and invaluable to any serious political reader."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"Mr. Chittum makes a chilling case for another Civil War in America's future, this one going along racial lines. He sets out his evidence in a coherent, compelling fashion and tells everyone who cares to listen how to survive the upcoming war. Contemplating the purchase of an armored vest and moving to a place well away from long distance artillery as Mr. Chittum suggests should be enough to sober up all Americans to the dangers of multiculturalism. While many critics would be happy to just dismiss the book outright as paranoid propaganda and say that another Civil War could never happen, these people only need to look out to southern California to see the treasonous Aztlan Movement that is growing there. Hopefully, enough people will read this book and take actions to keep the tome forever in the realm of &quot;what-might-be&quot; and not &quot;what-was&quot;."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":".Mr Chittum nails it and the 36 point check list in the last chapter is very sobering, see how many you tick off as already completed.

I recommend it for all who are interested in protecting themselves during a possible upheaval. &#128515;"},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"Thomas W. Chittum has written a book which forecasts the coming breakup of America into ethnic-based states. He forecasts a fire-and-sword revolution which will make Sherman's march from Atlanta to the sea look like a Sunday-school picnic by comparison. And I am afraid he is right. I am afraid this will indeed happen. Government actions to alleviate the ethnic tensions in this nation seem to exacerbate it instead. Perhaps that is what they wish to do; trigger a revolt along ethnic lines, in much the same fashion as the Forest Service starts a 'controlled burn' to reduce the amount of fuel available for a forest fire. However, as was proven in Yellowstone National Park awhile back, it CAN get out of hand. Likewise, the Government's covert efforts to start a 'controlled burn' will explode into a full-scale ethnic-based civil war. Anglos, Afros, Asians, Hispanics and other ethnics will hunt and kill each other as the mindless fury spreads until the entire nation, perhaps the whole north and at least central american continents are engulfed in this bloodletting frenzy. God help us if any factions get their hands on nukes!"},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"Personally, I think Mr. Chittum is a visionary in the way he predicts the fall of white culture. America has always been a predominately white country and when you take that away from us(as predicted in 10-15 years) you won't have America any more. I'm not saying that I am a racist or anything but I believe that the USA should stay a majority-white country, as it has been since it's creation."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"[...] -- What a great little book!

With the rapid spread of the supposed desirability of multiculturalism and the abandonment of the &quot;melting pot&quot; ideal, we do run the dangerous risk of becoming Balkanized. That being said, Chittum writing in 1995 employed a repeated tactic to drive his various points home. He constructs a scenario and then makes several &quot;predictions&quot;. To lend credibility to his predictive powers, included within his predictions are events which had already occurred by 1995. In short, several times he states that events 1 through 6 will take place. And then he adds, &quot;As a matter of fact, events 1 and 2 have already occurred&quot;, thus imparting believability to predictions 3, 4 and 5. A rather neat hook. Elsewhere he makes blatant misstatements. Examples; he stated in 1995 the US economy was weak; that the US was no longer &quot;the world power&quot;; that it is impossible to have a peaceful transfer of power in Mexico, which we witnesses last year. Omitted from his vision of a coming US Civil War is the role of other world powers. Does he really think our friends and foes alike will calmly sit on the sidelines while this battle rages? Hardly.The book has value in that it raises valid concerns about our shortsighted immigration policy. No nation in history lasted very long when the dominant culture was no longer shared by the majority of the population. The shift in population of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and California has serious overtones.And who does Chittum claim is behind this purposeful break up of the US? At various times he referred to them as &quot;the establishment&quot;, &quot;global elitists&quot;, &quot;establishment media&quot;, &quot;global, imperialist establishment&quot; and yes, even the &quot;Trilaterialist&quot;. Could something besides shortsighted democrats merely wanting to swell their ranks be behind all this? Something far darker? Perhaps. But it would appear Chittum doesn't have a clue as to who or what they are."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"This is a start.

This is not a serious work of scholarship. Your not going to see this book taught at Harvard. You wont see it used at Liberty University either. Not at a community college. The target audience is a male who may have a HS diploma and probably is in the military. There's nothing particularly wrong with that audience, I was an enlisted 11B myself. I have a sweet spot for \\"Starship Trooper\\" the book not the movie, myself.So where do I begin. \\"Empires are inherently unstable\\",was a point that is made early on. Well the Roman empire started with either Julius or Augustus depending on your point of view, and ended with the fall of Constantinople. That's about 1500 years. The modern nation called \\"Germany\\" was actually established at the end of the Franco-Prussian war in 1871 and gave the world Hitler about 60 years later, so what does \\"history show us\\". It kind of keeps going like that. Empires have elites, since the US is an empire it must have an elite. Because the US has an elite it must be an empire.Seventy Five years ago, people would argue if Jews where white. When the Irish first came here during the potato famine (because of liberal immigration policies) many people considered them sub-human. There are people today who think if you're Sicilian you must have a mafia connection and many of those people are Neapolitan. So I read the book and it tells me that we are doomed because whites which have shared homogeneous values are declining. I think this is absurd. Whiteness is not sameness. It wasn't 75 years ago and it isn't now.Just because ideas are not politically correct or are offensive to others, does not necessarily impart them as a \\"truth\\"."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"I read through this book in 2 days. It was both interesting and intelligenly written. Unlike many other books that discuss such subjects, this one is very well refferenced.Plus, unlike many others who discuss this subject, the author is not one of those really extreme right wingers who hates everyone thats not white or something like that. He does not toss out hateful slogans against any race, he merely points out facts. The facts are that no great nation has ever been multi-cultural and stayed together without brutal enforcement of &quot;equality&quot; by the government-such as happened in the former U.S.S.R., or as probably will happen here to some extent. We aren't all going to just &quot;get along&quot;. The establishment keeps pushing multi-culturalism more and more, thinking it will somehow help matters. Yet things just keep getting worse and worse. The main opposing philosophy to books like these is that they don't sound nice. But the critics of such literature canno attack it with logical or substansiated arguements, so instead, they just shut their ears and eyes and yell &quot;racist! Exremist! Hate monger!&quot;. Well, I think this book is correct in showing how the liberal establishment will someday have to open their eyes and face reality. I would like it if a multi-cultural society could succeed, but its not, it never has, and probably never will. This book helps to elaborate on the factors of such things rather well.However, the problems with this cannot be ignored.First off, he completely fails to adress the situation in the Northwest. This place is ripe with militias and right-wingers, it will surely become an area of great conflict when Civil War II breaks out. Yet the author does not speak at all of this.Secondly, while reading his book, I came away with the feeling that he over-hyped certain things. For example, he claims that black revolts and mass riots in the South will turn into small wars that will be equally as large as those which will happen in the Southwest. This is somewhat ridiculous. Blacks are not increasing in numbers anywhere near as much as hispanics, nor do they show many of the militant signs of &quot;taking back&quot; the South as hispanics seem to show in the Southwest. Also, I think the estimated time of Civil War II's ignition is a little early. This book seems to put forth the overall claim that it will happen in 50 years or less. I suppose you have to give all those out there who are waiting eagerly for everything to collapse (the para-military extremist types) a reason to buy the book; so that they can get excited about a SOON to come all out war. However, I'd say that Civil War II won't break out for another 40-70 years.All in all, despite the flaws, this is still an excellent book, and well worth the price. If you have an open mind, you won't regret buying it."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"So many people have reviewed this book I would like be a little different and suggest related titles:&quot;Anticipating Ethnic Conflict&quot; by Ashley Tellis - similar to CW2 but on the highest intellectual level.&quot;Ethnic Groups in Conflict&quot; by Donald Horowitz State-of-the-art survey of theories of ethnic conflict.

You will probably weep as well, for what we are already losing, (The USA as we know it) but don't just cry, do something."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"In the book _Civil War II: The Coming Breakup of America_ (1997), Thomas Chittum takes a view of America showing the United States sliding towards its imminent doom. Chittum contrasts the role of empires and nations, showing how nations are based on a common heritage, language, and ethnic identity, while empires are diverse and thus subject to failure. With the recent second War in Iraq, we can see how by over-reaching itself the American empire has become severely weakened. Chittum shows how gang warfare in which we see rival ethnic gangs operating more and more as states within the state erupts into violence. Chittum sees imminent ethnically based riots (and we certainly have witnessed them before such as the L.A. riots where Korean shop-keepers and black thugs engaged in open battle, or the recent events following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans). Chittum shows a government that has become weaker and weaker and will ultimately have to resort to military force within its own borders effectively creating a police state to quell civil resistance. Chittum explains how the super-rich and transnational elite will attempt to avoid this by simply changing location. All the while multi-national corporations rape the system and outsource American jobs, avoid taxation by re-locating, and American sovereignty is increasingly given up to transnational bodies like the UN, the IMF, and NAFTA. Chittum also explains how the elite use illegal immigration and how illegal immigration is both harmful to the country and American jobs but will ultimately lead to further race riots and conflicts. Chittum further shows how gangs and drug lords will take over the American southwest as an increasingly larger Hispanic presence causes a white flight to the suburbs and towards the mountain regions. Further, Chittum explains how racist affirmative action programs and the politically correct elite idiots who support them undermine any ethnic identity for the white race, while all other races engage in identity politics to further themselves. Chittum also explains how faced with mounting pressures the federal government will crack down on dissenters, attempt to abolish the First and Second Ammendments, and round up all firearms. Chittum also explains how police forces and the military are becoming more and more corrupt with ethnic rivalries developing within their own ranks. Further, Chittum considers the events of Waco and Ruby Ridge, showing the federal government's standoff with those who oppose the system. Chittum considers the rise of the militia movement and the growth of ethnically based militias as indicating a further sign that the state is in grave peril. Finally, Chittum shows how the white race is being increasingly weakened by such programs and changing demographic trends showing that ethnic warfare is right around the corner. To demonstrate this, Chittum examines the case of ethnically diverse Europe, showing how Europe itself is on the brink of crisis with various ethnic enclaves engaging in civil war. History is showing Chittum to be largely correct, although some of the details of his prophecy may not be. In recent times, we have witnessed the further Balkanization of the United States, increasing ethnic rivalry, the growth of secessionist movements, and further white decline. The recent election to the presidency of Barak Obama serves to only further cement these indications. It may be easy to dismiss Chittum as a survivalist nut, a right-wing extremist, or a pro-white racist, but this is far too simple. Indeed, we are witnessing some of these very events unfold as America continues to decline and break apart at the seams. Recently in 2008, the Russian analyst Igor Panarin showed that with a declining U.S. dollar, out of control foreign debt, and increasing Balkanization of the United States as rival ethnic groups vie for power, there will be an imminent break-up of the U.S. into five distinct ethnically based regions. It has been effectively shown that the chasm developing over ethnic, cultural, and political differences is so great that it cannot be bridged. For more on these same issues, one need only consult the works of Pat Buchanan to show that more mainstream figures are taking such dire predictions seriously."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"This is a \\"What if?\\" type projecting of present trends into the near future. Given the far-out title, I expected a book with lots of wild speculation. Instead, the book duns us with facts, facts, facts . . . until by the time the near-future projection is made, it is usually (though not always) virtually inescapable.The book's descriptions of the projected future sound almost familiar today in 2006. But surprisingly, the book was written 10 years ago. So, its projections (up to this point) are right on track. Its future projections should be taken seriously.The book shows numerous parallels between the situation developing in America and the situation in Bosnia and other places. The parallels are chilling.The most glaring omission is Islam. The author mentions Islam several times and recognizes its militaristic and vicious propensities. For instance, he says that the government gave 20 million dollars to the \\"Nation of Islam\\" to try to buy it off. But he did not foresee 9/11 and the formidable plans now obviously in place. How this will affect the other developments described here--the Chicano domination of New Mexico, Arizona and California; and the Black domination of the Deep South and Southeastern seaboard--is unclear. Certainly, there will be no White safe zone for whites to flee to. And in the showdown between Islamists and Blacks and Chicanos (and Whites if they choose to fight), it is unclear who will win.The author rightly says that civil war can be averted only if certain changes are made: (1) outlaw the teaching of anti-Americanism in schools and colleges, (2) end racist affirmative action, (3) deport all illegal aliens and stop further immigration from third-world countries. Since none of these is likely to occur, the author ends the book with several chapters on how citizens can prepare themselves to increase their individual chances of survival. If you want to know what saddled America with these three seemingly insane conditions, readWhile America Sleeps: How Islam, Immigration and Indoctrination Are Destroying America From Within, another unpopular \\"incorrect\\" book that lets more than a few cats out of the bag.Why is this subject taboo? As soon as anyone starts talking about citizens defending themselves, someone starts screaming about vigilantes. But there is a difference between (a) vigilantes and (b) vicious acts done by vigilantes. \\"Vigilante\\" means groups who keep a vigil, who keep watch. Neighborhood crime watch groups are vigilantes. There is nothing wrong with citizens meeting together, making contingency plans and stockpiling food, munitions and other supplies. (The movie \\"Red Dawn\\", if you substitute Islamists for the Russians, is a plausible picture of near-future America.)Self-interest dictates that every individual should read this book. Indeed, your life may depend on it."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"One look at what's happening with our porous southwestern border, the throng of illegals streaming across it, and our ineffectual government's refusal to seal and protect it makes this important analysis a must read for those who know the score concerning the looming national disaster that the evening news refuses to cover."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"Civil War II is a dispassionate view of what a racially based civil war in America might look like.

By far, &quot;CIVIL WAR II&quot; is the best political book that I have read this year. Indeed, Mr. Chittum is refreshingly honest and America needs more patriotic men like him. As an inspiring journalist and college student, &quot;CIVIL WAR II&quot; will be useful for my term papers. It is time that we talk about the possibility of a race-war with honesty. The prospects of a second Civil War is something that we cannot take likely. With the rise of illegal immigration and with the proliferation of Black extremism, the possibility of another Civil War is a reality.

That makes sense because the U.S. obtained that same territory from Mexico by the same method.The author's great contribution is to document that diversity around the world is always a recipe for conflict.In addition to the growing Hispanic population in the southwest, the author believes that comparative population growth will give Negroes a majority in large areas of the deep south. If the powder keg blows in the southwest, the author believes that the south may be ripe for a revolutionary Republic of New Africa.Is the author being an alarmist? Perhaps, but the globablists and their media lapdogs are simultaneously pushing for more diversity and fanning the flames of discord. \\"A house divided against itself cannot stand.\\"The author offers a map of his projected outcome (page 108). Japan takes over the northwest? Try China. If foreign powers get involved, the author feels that this country will get more carved up than a seal at an Eskimo picnic.The downside of this excellent book is too much Clausewitz quoting and the author's occasional straying from his topic. He devotes too much effort to discussion of our eroding civil rights and increasing power and imperial characteristics of the federal government.Anyway, when and where will it hit the fan?

So, this is a timely book, especially if you live in the southwest."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"This book covers topics such as race, race relations, inter-racial conflict both past and present, illegal non-white immigration into the US, the rise of ethnically based gangs and the creeping loss of freedom from the US Government....so some people are simply not going to like this book for a couple different reasons.1) It challenges their cookie cutter mainstream media based assumptions that everything is just fine between the various ethnic/racial groups living in the US.2) It scares people because it promises that one of two things will happen :2A) That America will end up like Brazil (a 3rd World nation where a tiny group of White/Ethnic Europeans live in gated communities away from the large, poor and violent non-white slums right outside their doorsteps where the standard of living is simply horrible).Or.....2B) That there will be an ethnically based Second Civil War in this country as a direct result of the racial friction present and that the people who are doing the fighting will join sides based along racial lines as their circumstances dictate. We have Belfast, Chechnya, the former Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Rwanda, Beruit, Kyrgyzstan and many other places where racial, religious and ethnic differences have exploded into outright war as recent examples.No one likes to hear that the nation you live in is headed for hard times and I for one hope that the scenario that Thomas Chittum presents us with in this book never comes to pass.However with the way things are right now I kind of doubt that the current problem will be resolved peacefully because it's so taboo to talk about that anyone that attempts it (like Thomas Chittum) will automatically be branded a 'Racist' (like some people here have tried to do simply because he's attended dinners and been a speaker for groups that wanted to hear what he had to say).One of those scenarios WILL happen within the next 50 years. The writing is on the wall and anyone with a pair of eyes can see that the US will not be a 'Super Power' for much longer, that the standard of living in America has fallen from what it once was and that there's little love lost between the various racial groups living in the US.Face it White People, many (if not most) Non-Whites do not like you. It doesn't matter if you're not a 'Racist', they simply don't like you based upon the assumption that you come from a system that is designed to favor you, based upon previous inter-racial conflicts throughout this country's history and because you do not think, talk or look like them.It's not talked about by Whites often, but it doesn't make the fact that this country is headed for some VERY unpleasant times any less true.Try this article by 'Fred On Everything' called 'Pondering The Black Underclass' : [...] (I gave a link to make it easier to find, but since it was deleted I guess that you're not supposed to do that on here - Try Googling it)People can see it, but the dialogue necessary to avert this upcoming war/conflict isn't there because it's taboo to talk about in the first place.In order to avoid conflict between people those different sets of people have to talk to each other and work something out. No one's talking about racial conflict in the US at all (unless it's to use it for a sound byte in a political campaign or to freak people out so that they'll vote or act a certain way), so in all probability one of these two scenarios will happen because there's a void of discussion.Plus it isn't like this is just a 'Black on White' (or 'White on Black' if you prefer) issue, there's conflict between the other ethnic groups as well. If you don't believe me go to Google and type in something like 'Mexican Gangs \\"Ethnic Cleansing\\" Blacks In L.A.' and see what comes up. There isn't a great deal of love between the various ethnic and racial groups in the US and if you scrape off the thin coating of paint that the US Government and the media has put on to cover it up you'll see it. Hot button issues like Illegal Immigration bring out the worst in people and they're always along racial lines...ever wonder why?Also : This book was written in 1995. In this book there's a checklist of various predictions that will occur and 4 different phases that will happen before the pot finally boils over. If you look at the checklist and review it you'll see that many of the predictions he made back then have already come to pass since then and he spells them out in clear cut easy to understand language. These are NOT cryptic Nostradamus-like quatrains where the message is unclear and where it could be made to fit a variety of situations, his message is pretty cut and dry.Is Thomas Chittum a Prophet of some sort? No, he's just a man who's been a soldier in 3 different wars, a journalist and so he's seen first hand what happens in countries such as the US with similar ethnic and/or racial problems. He's also a student of history and he's read and made some studies about what has happened over and over again. You'd be suprised at how much work he put into these examples and how much sense they make after you do a little reading of your own to confirm these historical examples.At any rate....like it or not this country is headed for tough times.You can either see the conflict in this country, recognize it for what it is, try and understand the reasons behind it and prepare for what's coming eventually or you can ignore it, pretend that it doesn't exist and attack those that are actually talking about it. The choice is yours."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"It's hard to criticize a book written 15 years ago which makes bold predictions that don't come to fruition, but are pretty close to the mark. After the LA Riots and the increase in crime in the early 90's, the idea of America fragmenting along racial lines seemed pretty compelling but I think the author overestimated the speed at which collapse would take place. In any event, this book is a worthwhile read because many of the predictions concerning a possible collapse and civil war may still come to pass. In addition, the author provides some good information on what to do if things fall apart. It seems to me that we are more likely to move towards a police state and economic collapse, rather than outright civil war, but it is also easy to see the polarization of our country that could confirm the author's vision in the next 5 to 10 years on account of failed leadership from both political parties."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"This book written about ten year's ago is unfolding like the daily newspaper.SO many truths that are being shown so many lies being unvealed for people who are ready for a life changeing reality check here it is if this dont get you you motivated nothing will."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"This book is an excellent prediction of what is to come in the next century.

And some of what he's predicted is coming true (ie, the increasing push for reparations). This book should be read by all those living in high-diversity areas. And one thing is absolutely true, and that this book is a compelling read, designed to get you focused on the problems to come; because they are coming.

The book is scary but presents much food for thought. Keep in mind that the book was written about 14 years ago, when the American reality was quite different from today. To those familiar and knowledgable of the economic, political and social aspects of our society, it is quite apparent that the current political administration and media are hell bent on deconstructing our traditional American way of life. Even this country can take only so much before it implodes into Chittum's predictions, and the \\"change\\" that many were fooled into voting for is quickly moving us in that direction. A shame, but then those who do not stand up for their liberty will lose it. If you want to survive Chittum's apocalypse, which is certainly coming, you must prepare and act now. \\"Hoping against hope\\" will not save you or your loved ones."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"The real conflict in this country has always been class-based, not race based. The whole idea of \\"race\\" is a fiction started up by scientific analysis of different \\"types\\" of people and their supposed characteristics. Chittum ignores this reality.The fiction of \\"race\\" was glommed onto by early Anglo-American leaders as a useful tool for keeping the lower orders at each other's throats, rather than uniting together against their real enemy, \\"The Man.\\" Even Richard Nixon (probably a saintly figure in the eyes of Chittum's fans) LIKED the idea of affirmative action because he knew it would further fan the flames of white resentment over threatening, \\"job-stealing\\" minorities.There's no ethnic/racial war coming, but there HAS been a class war going on, ever since this country broke away from England for mostly financial reasons. Look at the tremendous rise in interracial relationships as evidenced by the recent census--most Americans LOVE Tiger Woods, in part because he embraces his multiethnic heritages. Chittum is another paranoid fantasy-weaver who's been brainwashed into overlooking the realities of class conflict; when ethnic/racial violence gets worse in this country, look around for economic strain enforced on the participants from above--it's always there. Why, for instance, would whites worry about blacks and others taking their jobs through affirmative action unless there weren't enough jobs to go around? Why, to give a more specific example, did two white Detroit autoworkers in the 1980s go after and kill a supposedly Japanese man (Vincent Chin) when they lost their jobs, rather than \\"The Man\\" above them who had mismanaged their company?Oh, and how is race a \\"fiction\\" when you can look around and see Hispanics, blacks, Asians, and other \\"races\\"? For one thing, think about all the mixing that's already occurred--demographers and others estimate that 80% of black Americans have white blood (most whites don't know whether they do or not, as such \\"shameful\\" mixings in the family tree were typically hushed up--also, many \\"blacks\\" with \\"white\\" blood have passed into whiteness, marrying whites and making \\"white\\" families). And how can you be sure you're looking at a \\"Hispanic\\" person when the group includes people of so many different genetic types? And what does it mean to say Asian when China alone has so many different genetic types and features within it, or when Asian Indians differ so much from other Asian groups, and also include many other types? These realities aren't all that complicated, but they certainly counter the simplistic \\"white\\" versus \\"colored\\" worldview of Chittum and his fans. A mixed America will continue to mix more and more, instead of breaking down into divisive, hateful camps, despite the efforts and desires of our moneystuffed leaders.See Michael Moore's insightful and hilarious film, _The Big One_, if you want a more realistic vision of what's tearing this country apart.

Chittum, a retired special forces veteran and freedom fighter, paints a horrfiying, but probable future for the United States as a nation state.Chittum starts out by asking the reader to figure out which &quot;tier&quot; you belong to in the new order. If you are a member of the white working class you will immediatly understand what Chittum means. The &quot;International Bureaucratic Elite&quot; are the ones destroying America and creating an empire for their own purposes,power and greed. To do this the white working class must be degraded to third class citizens. This will be done through &quot;racist affimative action&quot;,politcal correctness, and outright tyranny. Since whites are the economic and racial backbone of America, they must go.Chittum further relates how illegal immigration, racial politics, and cowardly and devious politicians , are exploiting the ethnic tensions already present from &quot;multiculturalism&quot; The Mexican &quot;reconquista&quot; of the American Southwest is happening at lightning speed and within 20 years whites will no longer be the majority in those states. A revolution in Mexico is predicted within 15-20 years which will be a spark for a &quot;Aztlan republic&quot; and outright secession. Along with this will come a brutal race war between whites and blacks in the America south.Chittum draws a map of new America showing the probable breakdown of the new ethnic nations: the Northwest and Midwest a white European nation, the South a black one, and the Southwest hispanic. He also describes how black and hispanic street gangs( the Gangster Disciples of Chicago 50,000 strong) will be the new ethnic militias along with white militias forming for self defense. He reccomends white Americans, when the time comes, form Committees of Correspondence with other white communities for self-defense and cooperation. He also advises any whites living in the South or Southwest to get their affairs in order and move out the Northwest before the shooting starts.If this books sounds pessimistic, it is. It is also a warning to America and the International Elite who are creating the conditions for this race war: affirmative action, racial politics, blatant discrimination against the majority whites,destruction of the white working class, gun control, and the feudalisation of society through ethnic &quot;tiering&quot; and annhilation of the Bill of Rights. Chittum predicts this to begin about 2020 or so. He believes ethnic riots in Los Angeles or a city with a large black population during the summer will be the spark. The USA will degenerate into anarchy shortly after this as the Federal government seeks to regain order. Not a pretty picture.This book is a warning, so prepare yourself."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"The topic is very deserving of discussion. Those who try to dismiss it as silly are either closed-minded or uncomfortable about the topic for hidden political reasons. The concept of a turmoil-ridden America is indeed legitimate and possible.Chittum recognizes that racial identification & racial wars are an absolute. It's not about racial superiority, nor about 'hatred' or lack of interest in one another, it's about differing ideologies and few societies will not dismiss their beliefs without a fight (except perhaps the currently passive white American population). Walk into any multi-ethnic city, look closer beyond just the exotic restaurants and giddy commercialism and you will see there is indeed racial division, businesses and institutions regularly are heavily weighed with one culture and one ideology and those not of the same skin color must always succomb to conformity; neighborhoods are often the same and voting trends are noticeably xenophobic; local-based newspapers especially newsletters also focus on only one or a few very similar races of people and act as political voice (i.e. AsianWeek in San Francisco), and the topics of their discussion are seemingly of antipathy towards other differing cultures and groups and the survival, pride & betterment of their own race. A group culture -- a race -- forms automatically and race-groups do indeed war with each other. Racial conflict and violence based on one race against another is and always has been a fact of life -- different skin colors, different histories, and differing ideologies lead to conflict and war, and this is the reasoning behind Mr. Chittum's literature. The idea that the actual determinant of human collaboration is 'class' or 'wealth' and not race is an absolute hoax -- one need only look at their own workplace or group gathering and ask, \\"do the various ethnic workers who are all in the same level positions really see eye-to-eye? Can they really let their guard down and speak their minds without hesitation in the same way two people of the same race can?\\" The answer is obviously \\"no.\\" Further asking the question \\"does it usually seem that a conversation between two people of different races is almost always superficial?\\" Yes. Thus we have the simplest of explanations of human & societal emotions, and when tensions rise which they always do, race-groups war with each other unless one group decides to back down and towards extinction (current white society). Chittum recognizes racial wars far beyond the average person and his book will not let it escape you.In my opinion America is held together because the white population is remaining politically submissive and being taken advantage of, but compromise will only last so long before the races reach war.Mr. Chittum is a smart man but his book is not commercial and he is not a fluffy PhD academic -- he doesn't take any sides, he wholly admits for example that whites did indeed drive indians into near extinction until compromise was reached, and his focus is always on the reality of such ruthlessness. Interestingly he discusses almost no contemporary politics (except cleverly how affirmative action would bloom into racial preference and divide many institutions in America such as law enforcement), Bill Clinton's name not mentioned once, and focuses his thesis on: the development and reason of war tensions, some historians and military leaders' explanation for battle, the danger a disorganized Mexico poses, other nations and empires both recent and past and their experiences which coincidently mirrors each others' and how history always does repeat itself. He explains militias, gangs, and guerilla tribes.I think his reasoning was very fair, I learned that indeed guerilla tribes are much more savage and fight-till-death than 'orderly' government military branches, that our current military bases are designed more for international war and not domestic and are only guarded by a few security guards which could easily be overthrown in the middle of the night by a band of 20 savages who have nothing to lose; furthermore he discusses how he actually witnessed this in Yugoslavia. I agree with him that there is a steady rise of untrained young males in America who would find nihilistic uprising as their only path to happiness, especially as opportunity and economy wither significantly. He does well to explain direct evidence showing even blatant racial division inside the US military.I was overwhelmed by his incredible command of knowledge of the depth of corruption in Mexico and how it is a disfunctional govenment. I learned well from his section of \\"Mao-Tse Tung's three conditions for revolution.\\" One must agree that police are often biased towards the majority population in their region and often let crimes go, as well police departments growing towards the same skin color and ideology of the population to the point of corruption, all learned from reading Mr. Chittum's book that the government will be in a complete bind when at war with it's own citizens because if the government decides to obliterate a large segment of the rebellion they would be viewed negatively, thus increasing political turmoil, but if not using such massive weapons the large uprising would be out of control.Chittum proposes that America will continue to grow into disorder because of numerous races, immigrants, and ideologies like that of an empire, and unlike the first Civil War which was mainly North-whites against South-whites, the second Civil War will be about races against each other, and against the government.Mr. Chittum gives numerous checklists to keep 'watch' for, as well as discussion of what regions will experience what. His book is only about 200 pages, is quite unorthodox in nature, and is primarily focused on battle and war related tensions, as he served in the militaries of three different countries, all of them during wartimes. The only problem I have with the book is that he did not discuss how a Civil War 2 will put America at risk of international attack, otherwise it is useful. A real life homework task."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"I received a copy of this little paperback as a &quot;loaner&quot; from a friend who wanted my opinion of it. As a professional scientist,I approached this volume as objectively as possible,looking for flaws in reasoning and logical failures. I found none.I am sure that political &quot;Liberals&quot; and those who choose to be thought&quot;Politically Correct&quot; will uniformly hate this work,since it pretty well dumps on one of their sacred cows:diversity. Mr. Chittum has compiled some pretty interesting statistics on political/social stability in a number of different countries and sets up a model for analysis;i.e. Nation vs. Empire. In a logical sense,one needs to examine the premises that are stated;are they correct or not? If the premises are not flawed and the reasoning sound,then it is pretty hard to dispute the conclusion.Mr. Chittum's main premise is that the racial demographics of the U.S.A. are changing. Fact or Fiction? The most recent census figures show this a FACT.Another premise is that as the demographics change,the various groups involved become more polarized and militant. Mr. Chittum publishes an impressive list of racially concious militant groups, and not very many of which are &quot;white-power&quot; groups.The Conclusion arrived at by the author,based on comparisons with other countries, is that some form of open conflict is inevetible in the future.I found this book to be very thought-provoking and rather disturbing;I would rather be &quot;disturbed&quot; than blind sided. Ignore this book &quot;at your own risk&quot;. Although I do not agree with the author on a few of his suggestions on what to do in preparation for Civil War II, I give him 5 stars for effort and 4 stars for presentation.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"Mr. Chittum's book deserves as wide an audience as possible, but it will not receive it because of the unpleasant feelings it would arouse in the &quot;normally&quot; socialized American. Quite simply, the book points out the obvious: the new immigration of the late 20th century is an importation into the US not of foreign nationals, but of foreign nations. In the past 30 years a number of Hispanics larger than the population of Canada have entered this country. They possess a vast infrastructure of their own, are supported from outside our borders by Latin American governments, and from within by the leftist Washington establishment and by the &quot;conservative&quot; corporate elite which craves their cheap labor. Their avowed goal is to transform America, not to assimilate into it. They are, compared to their white counterparts, shockingly criminal and profligate. In the past few years, for example, they have managed to achieve an illegitimacy rate higher than that of native-born American blacks - which takes some doing. This book's thesis is simple: in an environment where there is no longer an unspoken loyalty to cultural and behavioral norms on a basic level, abstract concepts like adherence to the rule of law and respect for centralized authority will disappear. Mr. Chittum demonstrates how this has already begun to happen. If anything, the passage of time since publication only serves to reinforce his views - recently, for example, the town of Cenizo, TX quasiofficially seceded from the Union and joined Mexico. It abolished English as its official language and declared its denizens immune from federal law. This is directly in keeping with Mr. Chittum's analysis of the coming breakup of the US.The facts are clearly in support of Mr. Chittum's thesis and he marshals them admirably. Leftist critics can fulminate and rage, calling his book hateful or paranoid or extremist - but they cannot call it factually inaccurate, historically erroneous or poorly reasoned. You will note that the left will make emotional appeals of this kind against the author's thesis - this is because they are unable to make an effective logical argument against it. Note the one piece of mindless liberal drivel below. It supports my point.Despite Mr. Chittum's excellent analysis of the current situation, I feel he makes far too many assumptions about the future. We can only extrapolate the end result of our current situation by stating an incontrovertible historical fact - no multiethnic society has ever survived. In the short term there are no guarantees as to how long this situation can continue. Mr. Chittum fails to address one important social issue: economics. This is the key driver which will regulate the speed of America's inevitable decline into demographic anarchy. A book which ignores this factor remains in some sense incomplete. Thus the 3 stars."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"Author Thomas Chittum has written a scary account of civil war that might break out in America. He has been a soldier of fortune in various conflicts and looks at social events from a military perspective. He has a sweeping knowledge of ethnic conflict and revolutions around the globe and uses such examples of conflict to prove his point that America may soon face an ethnic civil war.One of his main points is that most countries that are multi-ethnic usually have ethnic-based civil wars. Countries that are almost mono-ethnic do not. He gives examples of such countries. Once a country's majority ethnic group dips below 70 percent serious ethnic troubles begin. He gives warning signs of what these ethnic troubles will be and how they signal a coming civil war.According to Chittum, America is fast turning into an undemocratic, multi-ethnic empire that is inherently unstable, unlike mono-ethnic nations. The elite upper class intends to break the power of the white working class in America and make them serfs in a multi-ethnic empire by using what he calls \\"racist\\" affirmative action, gun confiscation, and uncontrolled immigration and its attendant wage deterioration. He believes that this elite plan to control America in such a way will not work and eventually America will have a civil war.Chittum shows the areas in which he thinks that the multi-ethnic empire will split into and advises people to go to where their ethnic group will be. He gives other survivalist tips for the coming civil war. He has some great quotes about human nature and the nature of war and has some gallows humor sprinkled throughout the book. The coming civil war will be vicious, he says, given the vast differences between the combatants and inability to give land away peacefully because of the mixing of ethnic groups in the same territory. He says it will be a lot like the war in the Balkans."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"Chittum talks about phases of Civil War II: 1. Tribalization, or the undermining of the concept of citizenship. 2. The creeping loss of democracy to private, governmental institutions and international bodies. 3. Gradually falling wages. 4. The slow decay of infrastructure in our cities and the abandonment by Americans and their replacement by minorities wedded to welfare and affirmative action. 5. Growing legal and illegal immigration to transform America into a typical Third World country. 6. Massive drive for gun control to cripple military potential from the working class. 7. Cooperation of the mass media to dumb down the population.Near the end of the book he makes projections that you can see happening right now:1.Shrinking hourly wage. 2. More immigrants than Americans. 3. Foreigners hold most Federal Debt. 4. Twenty million Third World slums on our borders known as \`colonias'. 5. Manufacturing jobs moved out of the USA making it impossible for us to make or sell anything to the world. 6. Republican and Democratic politicians refusing to deal with the immigration crisis. Worse, both parties aid and abet it. 7. Growing power of advocates of Aztlan or the reconquest of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas by Mexico."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"Ben Klassen wrote &quot;be suspicious of any idea, never automatically accept anyone on their word.&quot; I happen to agree with him. Considering the way Thomas Chittum backs up every fact in Civil War II through it's source in the mass media I can only assume that he encourages suspicion as well.Mr. Chittum makes several predictions and scenarios, and then explains why he thinks this way through facts and statistics.If you are unaware of the fact that the urban army known as the &quot;Gangster Disciples&quot; which runs 50,000 men deep and has killed over 1,000 people int the last twenty years, is now funding candidates to run for city council in Chicago... then you NEED to read Civil War II. If you think that the 554,000 police officers in America can save you, when there are 100,000 better armed, better paid and more motivated gang members in the city of LA alone, you need a dope slap.If you're thinking of moving, Civil War II is an excellent (and possibly the only honest) real estate guide.If you live somewhere in which you depend upon other people to live or you place your trust in the authorities to live, you should consider moving.If you think that another Civil War will not effect you, if you think that a fence and a couple of mickey-mouse security guards are sufficient protection for our nation's armories refer to Civil War II.The military branches of the US will either begin to kill themselves because of ethnic differences or they will segragate troops - proving that their cause is a sham. You will be caught with your pants down, unless you begin thinking like Mr.Chittum. A good head-start would be to put down the beer pick up your wallet and invest the relatively minor $...If you like Civil War II you should read Ben Klassen's &quot;The White Man's Bible&quot; which you can buy from amazon.com as well. Although it's quite different it is equally as important.If you are unaware of the fact that the gang/army known as &quot;the Ganster Disciples&quot; which runs 50,000 men deep and has killed over 1,000 people has candidates openly running for city council in Chicago...you need to read Civil War II. Mr. Chittum took that fact from the April 6, 1995 edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot;"},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"Thomas Chittum has written a fascinating, though in some parts flawed work, that none-the-less deserves serious attention, not merely dissmissive rebuke.Chittum, a '65 - '67 Vietnam vet, then a mercenary in Rhodesia in the seventies and Croatia through 1992, bases his viewpoint on the fact that \\"all multi-ethnic empires are innately unstable.\\" He mentions the former USSR which broke up as its Muslim and Asian populations were growing and seeking their own autonomy out from under white Russian rule. He notes, accurately, that the nation state of Russis is now over 80% white Russian.The problem is that many Americans view any justification of racial or ethnic identity as threatening, when they are, in fact, innately natural...humans are tribal beings. People naturally divide themselves up...religiously, ethnically, etc.Chittum's experiences in Rhodesia where a brutal, repressive black government has been engaged in a deliberate campaign to eradicate the white farmers of the country, have, no doubt fueled some of his more dire predicitions...and that situation must be looked at dispassionately, the way Chittum does here.Still, there are a few things that Chittum's premise overlooks about America, for one, our unified culture, our common language (English), coupled with a strong, stable government and a vibrant and diverse economy.The question is, will these things be maintained if America's demographics continue along their current non-white, largely Third World path?If whites are reduced to the projected 50% of the population by 2050, will largely Hispanic and black areas seek independence from what they may well perceive as \\"white rule?\\"One thing's for sure, after reading the likely effects of such a Civil conflict, no one in their right mind would look forward to it.The question left unanswered is, \\"What can be done to make sure we don't head down the same disastrous path the former USSR took?\\" Sadly, Chittum never really deals with that question. What he does offer is one frightening potential reality.\\"Civil War II: The Coming Breakup of America\\" is both fascinating and disturbing at the same time...and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America","review":"There's lies, goddam lies, and statistics.

There are 28 stories here, all different in length, content and intent - but it's all very well-rounded and gives a great view of the author through a series of short reads. (Well, except for one omission: no robot stories. Asimov states that he collected these already in another volume and so they are conspicuously absent from this one)What I liked most about this book: science fiction writers often run into troubles with novels, because sustaining reader interest over a novel-length work requires very detailed characters, storylines and an engaging writing style. The short-story medium lets Asimov play with the story alone while using just-deep-enough characters to get the job done. As a result, his plots really shine, and aren't bogged down by poor development in other areas. The end result is a lot of very readable and highly engaging stories.As far as the stories in this compilation: The handful of play-on-words stories are pretty entertaining (and very brief). Most of the sentimental ones didn't capture my interest well, and there was a song parody that seemed an odd choice, but the rest of the collection was great. My personal favorites: Found!, Franchise, How It Happened, The Immortal Bard, The Last Question, Spell My Name With An S, Unto the Fourth Generation.One last note: Asimov's personal introduction to each of his stories were pretty funny, in large part because he seems to have a pretty big ego (or at least, is very confident) and so he often talks about how he wrote \\"a good story on a dare\\", \\"a particularly great piece of fiction\\", etc. It was nice to have the preface to each entry so you'd know why he selected each one. That alone helps set this collection apart from other science fiction compilations."},{"Title":"Isaac Asimov Best Science Fiction (Signet)","review":"With The Best Science Fiction of Isaac Asimov, Mr. Asimov has woven another beautifully crafted book of short stories. In this book there are 28 'best ever personal favorites' from the short stories of the master story teller. Each story features a brief introduction by Asimov. These intriguing introductions illuminate the author's reasons behind the stories. The stories themselves range from the 1950's to the 1980's and cover a wide area of topics, from humor to horror to hard science fiction.There are 4 stories that deal with a play-on-words ending, that Asimov so loved, that will make you groan and snort. Not all of the stories are quite so whimsical. There are plenty of classic Asimovian themes covered in this book. From the times of cave men to the far future when man is no longer a creature made of matter, these stories deliver far-out settings and expert story telling.Two of the highlights of this book, though by no means are there just two, are Franchise and The Ugly Little Boy. The former, written in 1954, deals with forecasting elections even before the polls close and the belief that polls influence voting patterns. Considering this story was written almost 50 years ago it is still quite relevant and almost prophetic. The latter story is a true tear-jerker, and one of Asimov's best stories ever. A story about a cave boy that will definitely tug at your heartstrings. The book as a whole is one of Asomov's better short story collections. Some of the stories will remain with you long after you put the book down."},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"This book blew me away. It is fabulous. It is the kind of book for singles that I have thought doesn't exist. Let me confess: I hated being single two years ago, even tho I am really happy about it right now. It just felt so unfair. So I thought \\"You need a Christian self-help book for singles, that will fix it\\". And oh what a great choice we have. There is Michelle McKinney-Hammond, whose books on the topic did virtually NOTHING for me. Her writing, it is ALL about *preparing* and waiting for that perfect God-blessed relationship. Sorry, but I don't even KNOW whether God has that planned for me, so why would I spend so much time *getting ready for Mr Right?*. Then there is Nancy Leigh Demoss. Her apporach is far more true to God's word and actually considers the concept and joys of life-long singleness. Or at least a life that doesn't center on waiting for God-sent Prince Charming. I liked that. Because it destroyed the myth that only a life spent in a relationship is a life worth living. BUT....what I am missing in this type of book is my down-to-earth everyday life as as single and how I sometimes *coughs*euphemism*coughs* struggle with it. You know...finding out that even God-trusting singles of the kind that strive to please God have to come to terms with certain things. And Gilliams's book addresses all that in a way that I -a woman who is in her mid-20s in 2006 and was raised in a non-Chritian household in a pleasure-obsessed world- can relate to. Chapters like \\"I Just Gotta Be Queen\\", \\"Not Getting It\\" (and yes, she means *it*) and \\"So, Why aren't you married?\\" give an idea. This is no dreamy Christian-Women-have-no-physical-and-emotional-desires-and-naturally-bloom-in-volunteer-work type of book. This is about your average woman who has made a commitment to the Lord that seems to be against everything modern western culture advocates and against what a not-to-be-understimated part of herself simply *wants*. Don't get me wrong, the author NEVER fails to give God His place in this book, but she understands that striving to be a woman after Gods' own heart does NOT mean being \\"naturally\\" and \\"effortlessly\\" chaste and happy-about-her-situation. In fact, Gilliam points out that it is the struggle, the effort and yes, the suffering, which help us to follow and understand Christ. So: Does THIS book help me at all? yes. It makes me feel I am being understood by other people in this situation and reminds me that the ultimate reason for going through what sometimes is not a pleasure is to glorify God. And the author does all that in the funniest, most down-to-earth yet biblical way I could possibly have wished for. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"REVELATIONS OF A SINGLE WOMANLoving the Life I Didn't ExpectBy Connally GilliamWhy would a happily married (for 33 years) father of three and grandfather of four read a book with a title like this? For one thing I have a single daughter, and I wanted to understand it better before passing it on to her. Most importantly, however, this is a book about unfulfilled expectations, and everyone has to deal with that sooner or later. The subtitle \\"Loving the life I didn't expect\\" should have tipped me off, but I was 80% of the way through the book before it hit me that this is really a book about unfulfilled expectations.Victor, Frankl, who survived a Nazi concentration camp, said that the ultimate freedom is the freedom to choose one's attitude. Connally Gilliam has learned this through unintended singleness. She never expected to still be unmarried in her late thirties, but that is how it turned out, and she deals with it by exercising this ultimate freedom to choose her attitude. She writes movingly of how she has discovered that the real source of joy is not to be found in a relationship with another human being but rather in a relationship with the triune God. She writes:\\"I say this now with greater clarity and conviction than I did a few years ago. It has taken me a while to get this \`source of joy' thing straight. The struggle is probably half of what this book is about. And even now, I must be reminded of what's true in a myriad of ways from a myriad of sources....at the risk of sounding like a clich&eacute;d bumper sticker, I'm just going to say it. There's one true, if mysterious, source of inexpressible and glorious joy: the triune God - Father, Son and Holy Spirit - a.k.a the Joy Maker.\\"She quotes the wife of an older mentor: \\"It is better to be single, wanting to be married than it is to be married wanting to be single.\\" There is a lot of wisdom in that, and if the divorce statistics are any indication, there are a lot of married people who want to be single, because at least half of them go through the messy, expensive process of becoming single again. One suspects that there are a sizable number in the other half who are \\"married wanting to be single\\" but who stay together for the sake of the kids or for appearances or whatever.But that is small comfort to single people, especially single women who long to be married. Connally Gilliam writes about this longing poignantly and intelligently.This book touches on many of the issues facing this generation of women, which is arguably the first generation of \\"liberated\\" women who have access to career choices that previous generations only dreamed of. The author does not disparage women who have ambitions to succeed professionally, but she does note that, for all they have gained, women have lost something as well.The book does not shy away from the hard questions either, in particular questions of sexuality. In an age where anyone who is not sleeping with a member of the opposite sex is suspected of being gay (this actually happened to Miss Gilliam), celibacy is the exception rather than the rule. The author honestly faces these questions in three well-written chapters devoted to the tensions and misunderstandings faced by a celibate single woman.Work and career also receive excellent treatment. The question of the tension faced by women who want meaningful work and marriage is raised. Successful, ambitions single women are often a threat to men, so should a girl \\"hold back\\" professionally in order to improve her chances of marriage?This is an excellent work on the tensions and issues faced by women who are unexpectedly single at the beginning of the 21st century. I would recommend it highly to both married and single women, as well as to men who have to relate to women. And who doesn't?John Ed RobertsonMarch 20, 2006"},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"When Connally Gilliam asked me to review her book, Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect (Tyndale, 2006), I considered it a good way to get to know Connally. I have appreciated her posts on this site, especially the one entitled, \\"The Jealousy of God.\\" And I thought we had a lot in common: English majors who grew up in Virginia, serving in parachurch ministry, similar age, and single and loving our lives.Where I hesitated internally-and I didn't tell Connally this-is the subject matter. I don't care for books about being single. There are so many thoughtful books waiting on my bedside table that a singleness book is not a priority. (Not to say there aren't thoughtful books about singleness.) But usually they end up as commands to be content, instructions on keeping clear sexual boundaries or how to's in using this season of \\"freedom\\" to serve God.Thankfully, Connally's book is not centered on these topics. Instead, it is about a wise woman's experiences with her God, with her friends (male, female, married, single), and with her self. Connallly asks all the questions I've asked myself: How do I live with the fragmentation and isolation of today's world? What does it look like to have life-giving relationships with my family, my friends, my community? How much of myself do I give to my career? Is full satisfaction available this side of heaven? What do I think a man should be/do/stand for?And Connally's voice is clear and strong, a real tribute to a first-time author. Her personality jumps off the pages; she is honest in her longings, true to her faith story, and welcoming in the conversation. Plus, she's downright funny! She introduces the reader to tens of her friends' and their experiences and thoughts. I liked that. Hearing from all sorts of people gives Revelations of a Single Woman a broad reach--but not so broad that that it thins out. In fact, I think this book has so much content it could have been two, or even three!Connally is at her best, though, when she offers more of herself than even she, a clear extrovert, feels comfortable. My favorite exchange occurs in Chapter 13, when an old, wise friend challenges her to \\"suffer well\\" the isolation of singleness. Connally tearfully asks what it means to do so. \\"It meant admitting that the confusion plaguing me . . . was real and not easily navigated. It meant owning my unmet desires and the related disappointment. And it also meant holding on to and holding up the goodness and realness of God in the midst of it. [Her friend's] words about suffering prophetically had felt like a gut-level punch. But in reality, they were more like the compassion-induced Heimlich maneuver, freeing me to live.\\"May her courage be contagious--in the lives of all believers."},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"During a 12 year pastorate helping to lead a large single adult community in a California church I often looked for a \\"defining\\" book that would be of broad use in our community regarding issues of singleness. Defining chapters and paragraphs turned up regularly but rarely did a whole book until now! Connally Gilliam has written a book that will cross many groups and many boundaries.First, her book is not just for women. There are thousands of men out there who would gain an enormous new understanding and appreciation for the women in their life from reading through these twenty chapters. Hopefully, they will have some healthy and honest talks with their female friends and relatives as a result.Second, this is not just a book for Christians. Though Connally leaves no doubt as to her own religious convictions she sets out such a thoughtful and comprehensive conversation that anyone, religious or not, is bound to enjoy this discussion and find themselves eager to reply to this deeply committed Christian who somehow covers all the issues the culture at large is already talking about. If you are already a Christian, you might be surprised by some of things Connally is willing to talk about. If you are not a Christian, or of any religious persuasion at all, you might be surprised how intelligent and winsome her invitation is to engage in dialogue.Third, this is not a book for sissies! There are a lot of lessons learned from the school of hard knocks between these pages. The author is not shy about sharing her own heartache in the classroom of life but also does not shrink from what she believes are self-evident truths and absolutes lines of behavior that hold true today as yesterday.Are you ready to be more honest, thoughtful, and willing to face up to life's pain as well as pleasure? This is the book for you, don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"If you or anyone you know is unexpectedly single, you definitely don't want to miss reading this book. I LOVED every chapter and was sad to get to the end. I found it to be insightful and honest with a refreshing dose of humor and candor. I was grateful for Gilliam's willingness to share openly about the joys and struggles of singleness without compromising her beliefs in the truth of God's goodness and presence in her life. She masterfully articulates the fact that the issues and struggles are REAL, yet she gently leads the reader again and again to the God of hope who can and will meet us in our places of pain and disappointment. Gilliam dares to discuss even the secret and seldom talked about topics that face single women without coming across as preachy or as a prude. Her open-hearted style draws the reader in and her brilliant weaving of the stories and insights from other women rounds out the book beautifully. I believe Revelations of a Single Woman will be a source of encouragement and hope to single women of all ages. I am anxious to recommend it to my friends!"},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"I enjoyed reading this book if only to see something written that actually reflected real issues and challenges in my life as a single woman over 35. Generally all you read about singleness is how to make yourself more attractive to date and find a good man. It's a focus on what you lack not what you have. This book asks - what do you do with your single reality now, however long it might last. Connally attempts to answer that question as she reflects on the issues that have come up in her life (from the feelings of loss as one friend after another gets married, to dealing with the awful question of \\"why aren't you married?\\", to building community in a busy, urban world, to why are men needed anyway in today's society, to name just a few.) There were some issues I couldn't relate to because I'm wired quite differently from her, but there were enough where I could to make it interesting. Connally doesn't run away from the hard issues in herself or in her situation (even when she might feel like it, or especially then.) As a reader, it's a challenge to live up to going there with her. Ultimately, the biggest challenge is -- Where will you find your joy? In your situation (expected or unexpected) or in your Lord? As much as I would like there to be a situation in life that I could grasp and hold on to which would give me that joy, Connally answers rightly that it's to be found only in relationship to the triune God."},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"This book ROCKS and is SO needed today, this minute, and right now! I, and so many women I know, are struggling through some of the very same experiences and new ways of being that Connally Gilliam bravely and honestly opens up about. Far from being just a \\"tell me I'm not alone in my struggle\\" book and a welcome respite from the constant flow of how-to books for single women, this is a book that thoughtfully grapples with and shares insights to the new world that we all, men and women, married and single, live in today. Connally has a gift for writing and storytelling and making you laugh out loud while she dares to do it all in a constant loving manner and without the usual male-bashing. I am recommending this book to ALL my friends...even the dudes...cause, come on, it's a whole new frontier out there!!"},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"I felt like Connally was writing about my own life as I read each chapter. She has really put to words many of my struggles, thoughts, and emotions. It gives a great look into the reality of living life and loving it at the same time! I highly recommend it to any person, not just single."},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"This book gives an articulate, humorous and candid voice to so many of my same desires, struggles and fears as a single woman. The author sets the example of living a life full of honest expression that is ultimately surrendered to a God worthy of our complete faith and trust.While reading this book there were times I found myself laughing out loud and times I found myself overcome with emotion at the reminder that I am not alone in this journey. It was so refreshing to read a book on single hood by an author who is (gasp) single. Not someone who is reflecting on their single days from the protected and validated confines of marriage---in other words, \\"Now that I'm married I finally feel like I can be honest about how crappy it was to be single.\\""},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"I found the book to be very honest, almost painfully so. It was challenging. I found the chapter on friendships between women to be the most challenging. I never thought of things in that way. On the whole I found reading it to be a very freeing experience. Freeing in the sense that somebody finally understood my \\"trials and tribulations\\" as an unintentionally single woman over 30. Having someone articulate those feelings and validate them with interesting statistics, musings from friends and life observations gives me hope. I am not a freak for being 32 and unmarried. I am simply unmarried, and should not feel guilty for having a full and interesting life that doesn't contain a husband. I would welcome a husband of course, but I won't die because I don't have one. Thanks Connally."},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. On the positive side, it was well-written and the author, Connally Gilliam, articulated perfectly ideas that I have always felt about being single. For instance, she talks about the \\"fragmentation of society\\" that affects single people, i.e., that the lives of single people are hardly like the decade-long television show \\"Friends. In real life, friends marry or move away, and a single person constantly finds herself trying to make new friends among this fragmentation. Gilliam also describes how tough it can be to find a guy, which I appreciate because I've so been there, and how difficult it can be to find a career and love it. She is a committed Evangelical Christian, somewhat an anomaly in our \\"spiritual but not religious\\" world. I have respect for that. I admire her prayer life, how she can take her problems to God and beautifully articulate her needs. That said, nonreligious people may hate this book, because there is a lot of God talk. On the negative side, Gilliam's life and values in many ways are completely different than mine because her No. 1 life goal apparently is to get married. She also seems to be clueless about handling herself around men at work. Several times I said out loud, \\"Huh?\\" when she complained about how difficult it is to not to flirt or fall for coworkers. To me, the answer is simple: Just don't. Turn off the sexuality switch, if you have to, and focus on the task at hand. But unlike Gilliam, I don't see every man as a potential husband, apparently. Gilliam also has some weird ideas about Catholicism, specifically when she describes nuns as \\"lonely.\\" I don't think she's anti-Catholic, just misinformed, but some readers could be offended. Most controversial are her ideas about gay people. She thinks that people choose same sex partners because of situations in their lives, such as troubled relationships with their fathers. It never occurs to her that perhaps gay people were born that way, that their orientation may be God's will as much as it is God's will for her to have been born with brown hair."},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"Boy was I dissapointed by this book. This book is nothing but a series of short pointless stories. It contributes nothing to the debate on a very important issue."},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"It seems like every book written on the topic of life as a single woman focuses on what you do not have when you are single. Not this book. \\"Revelations\\" provides a refreshing, honest and, at times, hilarious perspective of the joys and trials of being a single woman filled with the desire to follow God. Instead of looking at what is lacking in her life, Connally Gilliam celebrates the unexpected blessings of being single. I was encouraged and inspired by her story and frequently find myself recommending this book to my friends."},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"Connally's book is a collection of \\"field notes\\" for people living on the uncharted frontier of unintentional single life. If that's a part of your story, you'll recognize some of the terrain she writes about here. What I most appreciate about the book is that she makes it clear that while the single life is not what she intended for herself, she's found it to be an adventure which has drawn her soul deeper into the heart of the God she calls the Joy-maker. Connally laughs at the days to come with a freedom that is contagious and full of hope."},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"I loved Connally's book! I felt like I made a new friend reading her book and she articulated extremely well the things my single girlfriends and I struggle with and wrestle through. After reading the book, I felt like someone in the world understood me and I had renewed hope to keep making good choices.I agree with all the previous reviews that say this book is not just for women. I've already recommended it to three men."},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"I've heard it said: What we call the process, God calls the end. Our spiritual journey is the state of becoming -- an intended contradiction of terms. Take a peek at one person's journey through the mystery, the suffering, and the evolution of contentment, where singleness is the context. You won't find discrete answers, but you will find valuable markers, like those blue patches painted on trees along hiking trails, that say, \\"Another person has been here before, and this is the direction you should go.\\" You must still do the hard work of walking the path, but after reading Connally's book, you will not feel quite so alone, and certainly not lost."},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"Every now and then I finish reading a book with the feeling that I need to discuss it with someone and this is one of those books. In fact, I did discuss it with a single male friend of mine because many of the topics that Connolly Gilliam talks about are of relevance not only to single women, but to single men, as well.Because I also am \\"single wishing I was partnered\\" I was reluctant to read this book, thinking that it might be akin to rubbing salt on a wound-it is bad enough to experience feelings of loneliness and so on without adding insult to injury by READING about it - why remind yourself?? But I am very glad that I did, because instead of feeling worse, I felt better. Some of the feelings and thoughts that I experience as a result of my singleness are described by Connolly so thoughtfully, honestly and compassionately that I really did have the feeling of not \\"being alone\\" in my aloneness. She very bravely talks about the \\"suffering\\" that single people wanting to be partnered have and her story wherein she receives wise counsel inspiring her to suffer her singleness nobly was inspiring to me as well. \\"This singleness being the case, how, therefore shall I proceed?\\"Although I am a more quiet Christian than Connolly and actually am more likely to pray or meditate Buddhist fashion than to go to Church, I was not, like I expected, put off by the comfort and groundedness she feels and eloquently describes with her relationship to God. I myself have been experiencing this in more and more profound ways and sometimes wonder if my deepening faith and reliance on God has made it possible for me to avoid romantic entanglements that might not be good for me. It is as if I truly am waiting for Mr. Right, but I have not put all my marbles in his basket. This does leave you dateless and alone often. But the payback is a deep sense of inner peace, the maintenance of integrity and the well-being that goes with honoring your own self. But.........there is a loss, a deep, grief-inducing loss, knowing that the place in you that would be filled by a partner is empty. Having been married for 10 years and then single for 10 more, having experienced the death of very close friends, I can tell you that the loss one feels at being partner-less is experienced no less intensely than the loss felt at the death of a close loved one. Connolly Gilliam addresses unwanted singleness at this depth. She explores the places that many singles fear to tread. It IS tough keeping up a brave face when you are the odd woman out, when you are \\"always a bridesmade, never a bride\\". Ms. Gilliam seems like an absolutely beautiful woman, inside and out and I hope that our God is arranging for her \\"Mr. Right\\". I know after reading this book, you will,too."},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"As many have already stated, there is alot of depressing books out there written to/for singles.

Yet, not so long ago, that is exactly what happened. I looked the book up, and poured over fantastic interviews on Amazon that made me want to read the book all the more. The reviews did not lie. I am most happy to recommend the book Revelations of a Single Woman- Loving the Life I Didn't Expect by Connally Gilliam. Seriously. Go out and buy it. I don't care if you're not even single. You will likely love it.Real, down-to-earth, honest, warm-hearted, and more candid than most authors on the issue of singleness, Connally Gilliam reveals herself to be a stunning master of prose and an observer of people. Her life experience and the things she has learned through her experiences makes for an absolutely delightful read. Unlike other authors, Connally doesn't give a formula of helping in the community, dressing \\"nice\\", talking \\"nice\\" and being \\"nice\\" to solve our problems. Instead, she points to reality, tart as well as sweet, sandy as well as soft. She gives advice like you would expect from a best friend you had known for a long time.[...]"},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"What a waste of money! She loves the life she didn't expect? Page after pages sounds more like she's praying for a man to come along and save her. Let's all just bide our time until a man comes along. I don't fault her for wanted to get married, but the last thing I wanted to read this weekend were a bunch of short stories about how all her friends are getting married and she isn't. The reality is if she really loved the life she didn't expect she would talk about all the things she has done because she is single. If I had gotten married, I never would know the joy of living on my own, come vacation time I always get to pick where I go next and I love my career. Believe me, there is something to be said for doing what you want, when you want without input from someone else. Sure someday I may get married, but he would have to be a heck of a guy for me to give what I've got. So bottom line, live your life for you, not for someone who may or may not come into your life."},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"Focused a little too much on being coupled and wanting to be in a relationship.

Most of all I wish I could have handed it to my mother to read when she was not understanding my struggle with singleness and feeling left out in a couples world. I HIGHLY recommend it for anyone struggling with their own singleness or someone close to a single person who just does not \\"get it\\"."},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"I hate books about singleness. They are like fingers down a chalkboard with their trite carpe-diem-isms and lack of genuine empathy. If you are like me, don't fear. This one is written from the trenches by someone who will not shine you on. Give it a go, you won't regret it.Unlike so many books written about \\"singleness\\", this book acknowledges that there is an exponentially-increasing societal trend of undesired singleness. And, unlike the others, Gilliam begins by fully acknowledging the profound pain that many single women endure due to their unanswered, naturally deep-seated desire to join a partner. From that point, the author analyzes this situation with both scriptural and sociological observations without distancing the audience with pedantic details. It is so refreshing to find a believing woman willing to be that vulnerable on the page.I will always credit this book with enabling me to close the chapter on the most painful period of my life. At the time of reading \\"Revelations\\", I was in an... unbalanced... relationship but could not see my way through it because I was in my mid-thirties and had contracted \\"this is my last chance\\" syndrom. Reading \\"Revelations of a Single Woman\\" gave me clarity of sight to recognize the unhealthy dynamics of the relationship and ultimately break free of it. Granted, surely that was not the intent of her book, but this simply illustrates how well written it is. It surely can connect with a wide range of single women of varying backgrounds and ages. Though I did not read it from cover to cover, the book served as a deep, spiritual hug that I was desperate for at a time of spiritual isolation. I heartily recommend this book to any and all single believing women."},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"A friend recommended this to me a few years ago and I'm so glad I read it. Gilliam's stories reassured me that I'm not the first women to look for love and not find it. I really resonated with her awkward accounts of being the only single girl at a party, realizing someone is setting you up, etc. And I loved her chapters on evolving relationships with family and friends.What I love most about this book is that it isn't a guide. It doesn't try to ignore the idea of marriage, nor offer tips for finding Mr. Right. The reality is that not everyone gets married, though they want to. Although Gilliam expresses her desire to get married, she is able to honestly talk about her emotions and fears and poke fun at herself."},{"Title":"Revelations of a Single Woman: Loving the Life I Didn't Expect","review":"This is an insightful, honest, and spirit-filled book.

The first time I read Revelations of a Single Woman, I didn't appreciate the words about singleness as I did the truths about the season of life that I was in. In my mid-20's, I identified with the way Gilliam presented fluctuating groups of friends, changing relationships with parents, and the feelings that these changes evoked.She truly speaks with truth and love about singleness. Her attitude reflects a humble and Godly character. But, don't miss the details about the rest of life in this season of singleness.

Eventually they find themselves and manage a sort of stability. The third gender is not as disturbing as it might have been in the hands of a less sensitive author.This series closes with a solid finality the assimilation of mankind into the Oankali genetics...and the hard fate remaining for the 'purist' humans who choose to terraform another planet to live on, since there will be no earth for them after the Oankali are through.The series has left me feeling marginally unsettled, given Butler's vision of the future is one that indicates the human race must change if it is to survive en masse"},{"Title":"Imago (Book Three of the Xenogenesis Series)","review":"this is a wonderful book, but buy &quot;Lilith's Brood&quot; instead, which includes this book and the other two in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Imago (Book Three of the Xenogenesis Series)","review":"An outstandingly fine story!

Butler addresses unanswered questions such as why Lilith never left Nikanj, how ooloi get and keep mates - some that don't want them, etc. In addition, human sexuality is brought to the fore with the construct ooloi-human relationships and taboos such as incest are touched upon. That Butler is able to introduce these topics without causing her readers to cringe is a testament to her storytelling ability.Readers receive snippets about the Mars colony and human emigration. Butler also allows her readers to truly feel what ooloi's experience when they need a mate. She does a wonderful job of retelling the story of a construct's life on Earth (previously told in Book 2) while still keeping the story fresh, exciting, and interesting. Jodahs is introduced as his metamorphosis begins and, as the first construct ooloi, we are taken with him as he discovers his ooloi and construct abilities. Jodahs is a captivating character and, as we are pulled along on his journey, we cannot help but care about the outcome for him. The only issue I had with this final book is the series was:1. There was no follow-up on Akin and the Mars colony. Akin was such a well-crafted character that I wanted to follow him to Mars to see how he fared. The way this book was written makes Book 2 seem incomplete.Overall, it is a good story and I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Imago (Book Three of the Xenogenesis Series)","review":"Imago was one of the first Butler books I've read. The only disappointing part was that I read it too quickly. Eventually, I'll go back and read it again; it was that intriguing.Amazingly the more books, written by Butler, that I read, the more I wonder just how in tuned she may be with my vision of human reality and future.In every book is the common theory of change; and how we as arrogant, &quot;galactically-supreme&quot; terrestrials believe we are invincable. So much so that we look change in the face and outright deny that it exists or has to be adhered to.In life, the only thing that remains constant is that all things must change. I received it in a card from a close friend one day, then years later I read essentially the same thing in one of Butler's books.Imago is enteraining, suspensefuly and delightful to read. Be careful though, you'll get so wrapped up in it, that you'll wish she was sitting across from you (when you finish) so you could ask her a ton of questions."},{"Title":"Imago (Book Three of the Xenogenesis Series)","review":"Wow! What a great ending to the series! The strange story finally came together superbly. The writing is excellent. There were plot twists, an interesting main protagonist, a weaving together of all the characters and their fates from the first two books of the series, Dawn and Adulthood Rites. I highly recommend this but suggest that you read the other two books first to get the full effect."},{"Title":"Imago (Book Three of the Xenogenesis Series)","review":"Imago is the concluding volume in Octavia Butler's Xenogenesis trilogy and one thing that should be apparent by the time the readers gets more than a handful of pages into Imago is that Octavia Butler has written a trilogy in the more classic sense of the term. Butler's trilogy is a collection of three novels which tell otherwise complete stories that while they expand on the previous novel, each novel does not depend on the other to stand. Octavia Butler's trilogy is three stand alone novels telling three stories related in theme and setting and that builds an overall story arc as well as three smaller story arcs.Imago is the story of Jodahs, the latest Oankali / human hybrid child of Lilith Iyapo. An interesting thing about the Oankali child is that as a child their gender is not set, so depending on the stimulation and experiences given to the child, the child may develop into a male, female, or ooloi (a third gender). Up until this point no construct (hybrid) children have been permitted to develop into ooloi because the Oankali have had concerns about how they would develop and it was only recently that male hybrids were permitted to develop. Jodahs, of course, develops into an ooloi hybrid rather than the male he, or it, was intended to be.The story of Jodahs is one of isolation and dependence and the reader gets to experience the anxiety Jodahs feels and experiences from his community (an ooloi always needs to find a new home because of sensory differences with those in the home it was raised in).We are now at least several decades, perhaps longer, from the events of Dawn and Adulthood Rites so Butler reveals some of how the Earth has developed and how the Oankali / human project has progressed. We learn that the Mars colony that was proposed in Adulthood Rites is a success and giving humanity the only chance to survive unchanged.Imago is written with a strong sense of character and Butler describes the alien culture in such a way that it feels authentic and the hybrids in a way that we can see why some humans would never accept them, but also why others have accepted the Oankali.As always, Imago and the Xenogenesis trilogy is an examination about race, differences, fear, prejudice, the future, and identity. As always, Octavia Butler does an excellent job with her storytelling. And, as is the case with the two previous Xenogenesis novels, Imago is a very strong work of fiction but somehow less outstanding than some of her other work.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Imago (Book Three of the Xenogenesis Series)","review":"Octavia Butler recently died in Seattle. Her passing is a great loss to literature in general and science fiction in particular. She once said that she didn't really write \`Science Fiction' as such because she did know much about science. In fact her books do tackle some of the big themes of SciFi, but are not in the \`hard science' genre. Her themes were race, sexuality, and the nature of \`reality.'Ms Butler was dyslexic, [...], above average in height, African American, and a genius. She lived as a hermit in the middle of a major city and created a body of work which stands with the very best. She won both Hugo and Nebula Awards several times and the MacArthur Foundation \`Genius' Award in 1995. I think she is one of the few SciFi writers to have received this recognition.I am posting this review on each of the Xenogenesis Trilogy (Dawn, Adulthood Rites, and Imago) sites as well as the volume where they are collected; \`Lilith's Brood.' All are excellent and recommended.In this series Ms Butler took on sexuality and the nature of \`humanity' in a startling new way. She gradually takes the reader from the perspective of a \`human,' specifically an Earthling who encounters an alien race to the perspective of the \`alien,' specifically the descendent of interbreeding between humans and aliens who is now the \`human' and sees Earthlings as the aliens.Ms Butler skills are so great that this change in perspective goes so slowly that the reader is largely unaware until it has been accomplished. While some will dither about which of Ms Butler's novels are her \`greatest,' few will argue that this series is superb. I have read nearly all of Ms Butler's works and enjoyed them all. I think she was one of the finest writers of speculative fiction in recent history and will miss her work."},{"Title":"Imago (Book Three of the Xenogenesis Series)","review":"More inbreeding issues.A third novel in this series that is basically the same quality as the one preceding it, and adds little more to what is going on, or more of the same.

At first I was enthralled, but sadly, it became boring."},{"Title":"Imago (Book Three of the Xenogenesis Series)","review":"Jodahs is a young Human-Oankali construct. One of Lilith Iyapo's many children with both Human and Oankali mates. Jodahs is the first of its kind, a Human-Oankali construct ooloi...the sexless version of the Oankali that is able to heal others, facilitate the melding of genetic information from others to produce offspring, and is the storehouse for all of the Oankali's vast biological knowledge.Because Jodahs is the first ooloi of its kind, his Oankali brethren are unsure how to respond...there were not supposed to be ooloi constructs for quite some time. But, Jodahs manages to find his way in an often hostile world, finding mates of his own, and helping others to do the same.Imago is a fitting end to a superlative trilogy. Besides being a well-construed tale of human-alien interaction, Imago (and, indeed, the entire trilogy) is also a character study in gender roles. What does it mean to be male? Female? Butler's character Jodahs blends both male and female traits as an ooloi...aggressive when it needs to be, but often nurturing and deeply caring of others as well. Butler has a lot to say about what it means to be not only Human, but also man or woman.The only real peeve I have with the story is that, like the previous Adulthood Rites, and unlike the first tale in the trilogy, Dawn, Imago (and Adulthood Rites) at times merely loosely hangs on to the reader where Dawn grabbed you and reading was compulsory. In short, the pacing could have been better at some points.Nonetheless, Imago is highly recommended as the culmination to a beautifully drawn trilogy. These books are more than worth picking up."},{"Title":"Imago (Book Three of the Xenogenesis Series)","review":"I read this book before I read the other two even though this one came last. I didn't realize it was part of a series (the end part at that!) until I finished it and looked at the cover. Butler brought back things that happened in the other books without a terrible amount of exposition and a reader who didn't read the other two expects the world to be different anyway. I found this one to be more enjoyable than the first because there was no exposition, she assumed you knew what was happening because you read the other books but mentioned some things, like Akin's metamorphosis and Lilith's cancer to give it some continuity. I believe it is the mark of a great writer that someone can read the last book of a series and not even realize that it's part of a series. I don't think anyone could read a Harry Potter book after the first one without having that fact continually pounded over their head."},{"Title":"Imago (Book Three of the Xenogenesis Series)","review":"How does Butler do it? Her novels get better as the series advances! Usually, they degenerate, like movies sequels, where you get more of the same as the auteur tries to milk it (Remember that sorry Planet of the Apes?).This is the story of the emergence of the third human sex, an ooloi, the product of genetic mixing with an alien species that has taken over the Earth, saving it from destruction at man's hands. The ooloi is an extremely dangerous development, a catalyst for genetic manipulation who if undisciplined threatens to create plagues and disrupt entire ecosystems. In appearance female, the ooloi is extremely seductive and becomes a peacemaker with the human resistance to the aliens, almost a saint. As weird as it sounds, it is completely believable and fabulously written.Butler develops her vision and concepts, leaving the reader with a feeling of wonder at the universe. Only the best novelists do this: her talent goes far far beyond the confines of the sci fi genre. Indeed, I wonder if she is not revitalising the novel as a form of art, pointing new directions. She deserved her MacArthur prize."},{"Title":"Imago (Book Three of the Xenogenesis Series)","review":"After reading all three of the xenogenesis series books by Octavia Butler I find I am hungry for more.

In her \\"Xenogenesis\\" series Octavia Butler wove a most fascinating saga on the nature of humanity, exploring the interactions between human survivors and the Oankali, and, in so doing, providing some insightful literary commentary on the racial and sexual issues which are still divisive among many Americans. \\"Imago\\" is a memorable, rather absorbing, character study of Jodahs, the hybrid human/Oankali shapeshifter who is capable of giving miracle cures to injured and diseased humans by his personal touch. But also latent within Jodahs' chromosomes are some unique genetic secrets which may portend humanity's - and Oankali's - future in the solar system. Butler concludes the \\"Xenogenesis\\" series on a triumphant, optimistic note in this fine early novel of hers, which many would regard as a classic of not just American science fiction literature, but perhaps too of feminist and Afro-American literature."},{"Title":"Imago (Book Three of the Xenogenesis Series)","review":"Before I selected an omnibus called Xenogenesis from the Sci Fi Book club (containing: Dawn, Adulthood Rites, and Imago), I had never heard of Octavia Butler.Am I glad I selected this accidentally when I joined the club (Mainly because it said it had three books in it).

Can it be put into a positive and meaningful context in modern philosophy? What about modern psychology?These are promising questions. Most of Rudhyar's attempts, however, fall flat to some extent. What he ends up suggesting is that astrology is essentially a theory of personality and that this is its most important application. I am not entirely sure I agree with Rudhyar, but it is a reasonable view.The book is organized in two parts. The first is an exploration of what various philosophical ideas may apply to astrology and the second is an exploration of astrology as a theory of personality (or more broadly, an \\"algebra of life\\").My approach would be very different from Rudhyar's view in that rather than working backwards from the present, I would likely work forward from early philosophical models. For example, inTimaeus, Plato offers a theory of astrology based on a common structure between the human spirit and the cosmos. As we move towards the present, there becomes an urge, which Rudhyar entertains, to try to place astrology and similar old traditions in the purview of scientific disciplines and psychological views.The result is that I found a lot of Rudhyar's approach somewhat less than satisfying. He tries to treat acausal principles as scientific, and almost treats the I Ching as a scientific treatise. Yet for all the problems, he asks the profound and difficult questions and it is likely that individuals reading the book will be challenged and urged to think about some of the issues themselves.As one can guess, this is not a beginning book on how to practice astrology. However, an urge to practice astrology is not needed to get something out of it.Generally recommended."},{"Title":"The astrology of personality;: A re-formulation of astrological concepts and ideals, in terms of contemporary psychology and philosophy,","review":"This is a very good formal treatise on philosophy as well as an explanation in depth of the occult science of astrology.

All these books together contributed to my overall understanding of this subject. I thought this book was the best of all of them.I gave four stars because it left me confused in a couple of places. He mentions the vacancy exclusion clause in insurance policies (comes into play after you bought the property and you're fixing it up and it's on the market). Apparently, this clause means an insurer is not liable for any losses that occur to a property that's been vacant more than 30 days. Nice to know, but he doesn't say if we should just ignore that or if we make other arrangements with the insurer. To be fair, almost every book leaves me a little confused somewhere. That's why I bought four books. At least one book should fill in where another book was weak.I was also confused about the financial transaction involved taking over the house. His sample letters to property owners makes it sound like he's buying the house when really all that's involved is taking over their payments and paying the bank what is owed (plus settling liens, etc). On the subject of letters, I read another review that said his letters to property owners were rough or a little strong (my words); something to that effect. I agree. The sample letters in the Chip Cummings book were much nicer and comforting.I found his writing style refreshing; down to earth and he speaks his mind. He pulls no punches about those that will try to take advantage of you.

However, the tone of the letters are some what dismissive--but that's just my opinion.The only area that needs enhancing is providing one with an idea as to estimate value in the property. He does not provide as much detail as others (i.e., Steve Berges \\"The Complete Guide to Real Estate Finance for Investment Properties\\").

I didn't want to put the book down because each time a question came up, it was the subject of the next section or chapter. Not only does Mr. Lucier give step by step instructions he also tells it like it is. I know that there would have been no way for me to get into this business blindly and even after studying Mr. Lucier's book, my first real transaction was quite daunting. Mr Lucier was exceptionally keen on pointing out the psychology of both the seller going through a foreclosure and a novice pre-foreclosuer investor like myself. Because I read this book I have avoided a lot of mistakes that I would have made without it. You think that sellers going through foreclosure are \\"thankful\\" you are there to help them?

Well, duh! U.S. law only applies to U.S. stuff. This book is by far one of the best guides on pre-foreclosures and should be considered as the beginner's guide for bank foreclosures. Also, when the title says 'distressed' real estate, it's not talking about bad properties but rather properties with their mortgages no longer being paid.The difference is important because distressed properties suggest run down stuff. When actually, a lot of preforeclosures are great houses and for one reason or another the owner no longer chose to pay for it.Overall a good guide. Also on another note, I only buy books BY investors not marketing gurus or writers. Lucier is a REAL investor, with personal experience. Those are the type of authors you want to read from. Here are other books by REAL investors:Profit by Investing in Real Estate Tax Liens: Earn Safe, Secured, and Fixed Returns Every Timeby LoftisComplete Guide to Real Estate Tax Liens and Foreclosure Deeds: Learn in 7 Days-Investing Without Losing Seriesby SausaFLIP: How to Find, Fix, and Sell Houses for Profitby Villani"},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"Having read the other reviews, I bought this book with high expectations. I was very disappointed. The book lacks details and contains too much cursory, trivial and anecdotal information. For example, the author explains that public records are listed in alphabetical, he gives great examples of which mobile office equipment to buy and describes over and over how wonderful the internet is but glosses over important details like actual examples of what exactly you find in the public records and examples of how to determine if a deal is worthwhile or not. He talks about due diligence and that one should research the public records to get information from 50 different places. He even goes on to tell a story about a women who didn't do enough research and ended up with a $19,000 tax lien attached to her pre-foreclosure property. Again though, he never shows any examples or those records or HOW to use those records to determine if a deal is worthy or not. His step-by-step process is not detailed enough to put into practice without doing tons more research. The book seems unfocused and often times wanders away from the point. Overall not a very practical book but probably a pretty good buy if you know nothing about foreclosures, pre-foreclosures or home buying in general."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"Foreclosure investing is all the rage nowadays, but Thomas Lucier tells you why you must get in during the PRE-FORECLOSURE phase to really make the big bucks. There's just too much competition for properties once they reach foreclosure.The author suggests that you get to the properties before they reach foreclosure by doing your homework and locating the properties early. A letter writing campaign is his preferred method of contacting the foreclosees (is that a word???) and will follow up with subsequent letters should he not hear back from the homeowner.In addition to step by step instructions for locating properties and acquiring them, Lucier gives a treasure trove of information which you can use along the way to help make your job easier. He includes literally hundreds of websites and even provides his email address to provide help to those who need it.The book covers all the bases, however, it didn't leave me motivated. The author mentions all of the pitfalls and hard work required in this business and clearly doesn't try to mislead the reader into thinking it will be easy money. I appreciate the honesty, but must admit I won't be pursuing pre-foreclosures at this time. However, I haven't ruled it out for the future, and should I choose to do so, the book will serve as a great instructional manual in my quest."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"OK, let's face it. Foreclosures in this country are going to be a serious issue in the next few years. And it will be no one's fault but the lenders who took on the added risk of investing in too many questionable loans, and the borrowers who had no idea what they were getting into.Having invested in these properties, and being a real estate sales agent with investors looking for such properties, the search processes Thomas Luccier suggests to find these properties are good. I have been using them and a few others for several years now. His foreclosure letters are powerful...perhaps too intimidating. The spreadsheets are great, I have actually replaced a couple of mine with his!Overall, I find the book usefull more so for a new investor, but valuable nonetheless even for experienced investors like myself.

He educates you about foreclosures and gives you several resources so you can do your own research. I'll be going to my first foreclosure appointment tomorrow evening. I'll go over the book again and plan on using all of the forms and checklists (the book is full of forms). He also answers his emails personally.

It becomes clear to the reader from the beginning that the author has a vast knowledge of the topic and conducts a profitable business in an honest and ethical manner. Thomas outlines all that beginners must know to succeed, while highlighting the stumbling blocks that often cause them to fail. He is very systematic in his work and advises on how to take extra precaution to be absolutely certain that you have covered all your bases and do not get ripped off.

Thomas also lists all sorts of public record sites, sites to locate people, demographic information sites and comparable sales data sites.There is zero hype or motivational-make a fortune type rah-rah, it's simply page after page of facts. I love facts, and will jot down and even blog a bunch of the sites mentioned, to remember them and for easy access, but a little bit of pep talk would have been a good addition.

In the cacophony of all these self proclaimed guru's, only a handful of books truly stand out, and from those, there is one gem of a book which covers all bases in probably the most brutal of real-estate investment opportunities that a private investor is bound to come across - THIS BOOK !With the experience I have gained from hitting the road, day in and day out, I can attest to this books authority, since this was the only book which I have had the good fortune to purchase which really explained the nitty-gritty details from start to finish. From explaining the foreclosure process in a short, lucid manner, to covering the use of public records, to negotiating with home owners, to performing due diligence, to short selling mortgages, to inspecting the property, to selling the property, this book packs a punch like no other, and for a list price of $19.95, how can anyone go wrong? Not only is the book extraordinary, the guarantee behind it stands alone in the sea of \\"how too\\" real-estate - Thomas Lucier publishes his direct phone number and email address, and is accessible, hospitable, and extremely helpful with any questions a reader might have... I can attest to this, since I just got off the phone with him.Anyone serious about pre-foreclosures should purchase this book and make it a priority read."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"WELL DONE BOOK on this MUCH DISCUSSED RE INVESTOR TOPIC ...VERY HELPFUL INFO. STRAIGHT SCOOP for INVESTORS and those Pursuing the PRE FORECLOSURE INVESTMENT BUSINESS. NO NONSENSEBOOK yet easy to read"},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"I've bought and sold small investment real estate in several New England states over a 30+ year period. I have read dozens and dozens of real estate books, and have owned, operated and/or managed most of the top real estate franchises as a broker. I have found Thomas Lucier's book to be informative with lots of value without getting bogged down in detail that the novice can't understand. He does reference where to find additional info and advises hiring appropriate advisors and legal counsel. He also adds a lot of value with simple, easy to use forms and other information on his website. Several of my investors have bought his books and use his forms. I have paid as much as $2,700 for programs with lots of \\"flash\\" but much less value content. I've bought dozens of other programs for less too. Some were very good and some pretty poor. In addition I have attended at least as many real estate courses and seminars over the years. For the money, you can't beat Thomas' books. Many of the well-promoted \\"big names\\" you see That does not mean they are an end-all reference for everything that's real estate investment. You need to continue to educate yourself and keep abreast of the market, and seek out like investors and competent advisors, but you'll do well to start here."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"Was a great help with a couple of other books and the internet. Helped me to make an educated decision."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"I took this book out from my local library. I cannot figure the motivation for someone with equity in their home to sell that equity for nothing; accrued equity is one of the greatest advantages to purchasing property. This approach also does not take into account the potential for home values to plummet, as we saw recently. A better question an investor might want to ask themselves is why the homeowner is unable to sell their home despite the equity they've built up, and if it is realy an investment at all. Like many methods that supposedly beat the market, this one will not last the test of time."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"I enjoyed this book very much and finished the entire book in just a couple of days. This will go on my shelf as a reference book over the years and looking forward to starting my hobby and hopefully career of investing after a bit more studying!"},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"I first got interested in learning about this from something I found at a thrift store,but, it did'nt have any forms or worksheets. I think this put the subject into a more realistic light and includes the sample forms and worksheets that makes this a doable enterprise for the serious entrepreneur...think again if you think real estate investing is a get rich quick proposition,but, with this you'll have a better grasp of what it really takes to succeed in this business. It's almost intimidating with the wealth of information presented, but , I believe is totally necessary in conjunction with any other programs you may be looking at."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"Enjoyed this book, but some of the information is a little out of date. Author provides good detailed examples, and makes it an easy read.Not a lot of \\"fluff\\" here, and he takes the time to illustrate the process well. I am an experienced investor, and still came away with some good tips. Would definitely recommend for a beginner investor, but check for some updated information in your state."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"I bought this book to understand purchasing short sales and foreclosures at B&N full price. To the end of describing the process it was useful. The book was published in 2004 and it is very different post boom. The author offers free communication via e-mail or phone but both phone and server are disconnected when checked in 2012. Realtors, loan officers, appraisers, etc offer current and conflicting information. Not unexpected as real estate forecast involve the average of 18 economist that vary from -10% to +10% this year! Commonsense and not the promise of tomorrow will serve you well."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"Being a layman to the US real estate market, this book was a treasure for me. Not only because it provided foreclosure specific details, but also info about buying a property in general.This book is a self-help book, but it reads like a novel. Lots of real life stories, very inviting style. Great sense of humor. This might not be an important feature for most of amazon customers, but was extremely important for me, as a non-native speaker of English.This booked helped me a lot to buy a foreclosure property. Also, the realtor I worked with was surprised how much I know about buying a property."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"First off, bear with my poor written English, which always offends some native English-speakers when it happens to be their bad hair day. :))This is an excellent book, I like the writing style: straightforward and no-nonsense. People may found it a little dry if they expect this book to motivate them get into this pre-foreclosure investment business.This book is very practical and informative, but to able to make the most use of it, you'd better have some knowledge in real estate, at least in general. Otherwise, reading this book may be too easy or too hard to you, both because you do not understand the fundamentals.Here is how I plan to use this book :1 To locate a worthwhile pursuing pre-foreclosure property in my county2 follow the guide from this book to check the information about this property (title, loan status etc.)3 do my best to contact/negotiate with the owner ( I am not good at this, so needs practice)4 If I fail, I will repeat the process with another one."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"I have read several books on investing on preforeclosures over the past couple of years but have never found one that I felt gave me the knowledge I needed to actually succeed. The book is very straight-forward, no fluff, and Tom actually does respond to questions you have regarding the material.KUDO's Mr. Lucier!"},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"I read a lot of real estate investing books, but this is possibly the best one. The reason is simple. This book will tell you exactly what you can expect in this business, AND what EXACT steps you need to take.A lot of other real estate investing books are great, too, but after you finish reading and ready to start some investing, you wonder what is the step you need to take.Also, the author is generous enough to give his email address in the book, so if you have any additional question, he'll personally reply back to you. I sent him an email, and I got a reply within 12 hours. Just excellent! I can't wait for his next book!"},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"There are many \\"get rich with realestate\\" books on the market. Most are a waste of money. This is a realistic approch to realestate investing for the investor with a little bit of money, credit, and time to do the leg work. In life there is no free ride, and this author had a no nosense approch. He disabuses the \\"Rags to Riches\\" reader, One quote, \\"if you have no money, or credit, you are unlikely to be able to buy realestate\\". I would rate this book as one of the most informitive I have read on the subject."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"Mr. Lucier's core idea is to identify and purchase distressed properties before they come to public auction. He makes no secret that this requires tremendous time and effort on the invesor's part. But for those who are willing to do the work, this book offers a comprehensive guide to each step of the process, from identifying distressed properties and negotiating their purchase, to selling the property for a profit.One unique strength of the book is its detailed attention to \\"hidden risks\\", the potential pitfalls in the process that are not immediately apparent to the new investor. Everyone knows that the location and condition of a property are key components of its value, but less obvious are risks associated with the legal aspects of the deal (e.g. liens against the property). Mr. Lucier is quite thorough in his explanations of all the issues to be addressed in any distressed-property deal.Finally, I can add to the testimonials of earlier reviewers in confirming that I did write an e-mail question to Mr. Lucier, and received a response in less than one hour."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"I have purchased many books over the past few years to learn all I can about buying properties for a profit and I even purchased the one they are selling with this book as a package deal. I am also a licensed loan officer so I do recognize and expect certain lingo and procedures to be followed that every person goes through in order to buy property. I have only gone half way through this book and was very impressed. Not allot of simple explanations of what happens but real expectations and acknowledgement of roadblocks and issues. I even emailed the author to get clarification on some items and within 10 minutes I got a response back with real answers and a link to my states laws on foreclosure. By no means am I saying this is a get rich quick book but it does explain in detail how you go about buying foreclosure properties along with the hazards and if you are willing to put in the time I imagine this could work for you. I will right an update in a few months if I purchase my first property."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"Very detailed book that really explains the process. I was hoping it would include a bit more about rentals but the tactics included for getting a great deal can be applied to any type of real estate buyer. Great book for terms and as a resource. He loads the book with websites to find data. He also makes you very aware key issues that are often overlooked in other books.Not a motivating book...just meat and potatoes... which is good if you have already had enough of those. This book is loaded with info but is a bit dry. I would say it is a must read for anyone not familiar with all of the ins and outs."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"In pursuing foreclosures, the law is involved every step of the way and you better know what you're doing or you could really pay the price. Thomas Lucier does a great job of laying out all the basics, possibilities, potential liabilities, terminology, etc and offers a step-by-step process for investing in f/c's. If you're expecting buying f/c's to be simple, move on. If you accept it's going to take work and diligence, do yourself a favor and buy the book and learn the book."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"I ordered the book from Amazon and received it 2 days later.

It includes samples of a Purchase Agreement designed for this type of transaction, information release letters, and other helpful forms and worksheets. These documents are all downloadable at no additional cost from the author's website. The Purchase Agreement serves as a first draft to take to your local real estate lawyer (to be adapted for the State in which the property is located). The author explains his methods in a step-by-step fashion. Live consultation with him is also available at a reasonable cost. I've done that too, and he was most helpful."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"One of my investors advised me that a property owner approached him with an opportunity to purchase his property for the balance of the loan.The remaining balance of the loan was much higher than the value of the home on the market, so the investor told the owner he was not interested. The investor relayed this information to me, so I decided to look for a resource that would assist me in conducting a preforeclosure(short-sale)transaction.I purchased Tom's book for one chapter-Chapter 16.After reading the chapter, I put his information to good use.In November of last year, I initiated the process and in February 2006, I closed on the deal.I can't wait to apply Tom's techniques described in the rest of the book.

Read this first - then put it to good use!"},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"This is the best Pre-Foreclosure book ever written. But me being new to the whole real estate thing I had to buy a book on basic real estate, to catch up because this book is more for somebody who know a little bit about real estate. Very good read though."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST - TO THE POINT - BOOK I'VE COME ACROSS - AND I'VE SEEN THEM ALL!

This book takes you beyond the rah-rah and whoo-hoo books of most authors. Thomas guides you step by step in how to build your business and how to aviod the pitfalls. Within 60 days of reading the book and following the authors directions I find myself going out and viewing properties. Then using the provided check lists and I can decide whether or not to making offers on pre-forclosure properties. This is not a business for everyone, as Thomas points out, you actually have to work at it, do your homework and LEARN. If you are considering buying only one book on Real Estate, buy this one. If you don't do pre-forclosures that is fine, but at the very least you will have the best, most honest, book about Real Estate available.Thanks for everything, Thomas."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"I am so very impressed by the honesty, professionalism, clarity, and even more impressed by the cost of this book, that I can only value it as \\"PRICELESS\\". This is a book from the heart and the amount of effort and imformation within the first chapter alone, paid for the book. I only hope all of those who extract the wealth of knowledge it contains, will DO SOMETHING WITH IT!!In an age which many teachers are not doers, it is obvious here that Mr Lucier is on the cutting edge of this investment strategy for real estate. I have read several real estate books and courses and this is without a doubt a top 5 keeper.Many people staying up late night channel surfing need to order this before sending money in for informercial programs. It's all right here for the right people. \\"We Buy Houses\\" is old news folks. Get with the programs like this while the crowds aren't looking. Thank you, Sir for leaving this legacy of knowledge and experience with us. If you have a seminar, I'm there...front row, kicking someone out of my seat. God Bless you for this \\"gift\\". I still can't believe you \\"gave\\" this away for less than $5,000."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"This book is very well written and an easy read. Extremely informative but at the same time enjoyable due to Lucier's dry wit. I bought several books at the same time. I read his from cover to cover and used the others as cross references---the other books never provided me with any more or any better information than he did. He honestly does answer his phone and his emails. I sent a question by email and he answered within 3 hours! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"After reading this book, I get the feeling that it's written for people who watch those \\"As seen on TV\\" ads.

Buy at your own risk."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"I purchased this book some 6-8 months ago and I have used it and the resourses provided by Thomas on a daily basis.

I give it a 5+rating."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"I just got my first hand experience with this guy. His attitude really stinks. Tried asking him for an advice on making a purchase on his books and in return, he responded with a rude and a frustrated remark. Don't waste your money on his books. He is not worth spending your hard earned dollars."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"I bought this from Canada. I was naive enough to think the contents applied here. But it deals with US laws and real estate only. Therefore it should not have been made available to non US citizens, OR should have been labelled as \\"For US market only\\" or words to that effect. Very likely to be fine if you are a US citizen though. But if you're not American, beware! With transportation, that's over $40 wasted."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"The book is decent, but there are much better books on foreclosures out there.I wasn't very impressed with the amount of information that was given. I was able to find out more in some of the other books."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"I went into the right livelihood of the real estate industry by becoming a real estate agent, then a Realtor. I've been employed as an agent for over 4 months and quickly began thinking what does the broker do for 3% of a commission and then, why only take 3% of a deal if you can form your own investment company and keep all of the profit. My mother and I formed our own real estate investment company, LLC. She was the investor and I managed the company. Before this formation I ordered the following books and have read them all dealing with the subject of foreclosures and flipping as follows: The Complete Guide to Flipping Propertys\\" Wily, Keys to Buying Foreclosed and Bargain Homes by Barron's, How to Finance any Real Estate by Misko, Real Estate Flipping by Weiss, How to Pick Up Foreclosures, by Cook, and The ABC's of Real Estate Investing, What Every Real Estate Investor Needs to Know About Cash Flow, The Essential Dictionary of Real Estate, Holton, Real Estate Riches, How to Become Rich Using Your BankersMoney, by Dolf Roos, and Making Big Money Investing in Foreclosures Without Cash or Credit.....then there is The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit by Thomas Lucier. This book if there is only one guide to read for successful investing is the one. It is methodical, stragetic, and written in an easy to utilize of manner. The author also has a direct website, direct e mail address to answer any real estate questions, and gives out his telephone number for support. I testify to this because I called his telephone number and he answered the phone and my questions directly and his response had a significant positive impact on our company thanks to Thomas. Written by Michelle Vernier, a satisfied client."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"Excellent book. Very detailed. Absolutely convincded me that I wanted nothing to with this business. The author demonstrates that it is difficult and tricky business,potentially very lucrative, but not a get rich quick scheme. Since I would like to get rich without this much work, I'll pass on this method. And I truly thank this book for steering me right. I take off one star only for the author's occasional right wing rants. But I guess he's entitled. He worked very hard to get rich, and he shares his secrets openly in an inexpensive book, rather than trying to hoodwink you out of thousands by means of an infomercial. If he's got a few screwball political ideas, God bless him."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"If I would have known about this book when it first came out, I would have saved, literally, 10's of thousands of dollars.

It is wonderful how thw author goes into a lot of detail in the begining on all of the false hoods you read in many books today. He also goes into a lot of detail on the pitfalls most beginers such as myself will face. One of the greatest thing about the book is the due dillagence steps one should take to be successfull in this field. He matches his book with a website in which you can email him personaly, and down load all of the documents within the book. Over all this book is great."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"Excellent book for beginners and advance. It lays out clearly all the pro's and cons of buying pre-foreclosed properties. I have been a real estate broker for 13 years now and I have seen alot of wide-eyed infomercial junkies claiming they can do this and that. The reality is you have to have a game plan, credit and some money to have a consistent pool of opportunities. Tom clearly tells the truth. This is a fantastic opportunity if you follow Tom's instructions and advise. Most often individuals will have ideals but no plans. Tom gives you a realistic view of both. This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"This is by far one of the best books on Real Estate Investing that I have read. (And I have read almost all the books from \\"well known\\" Real Estate Investing (REI) gurus.What really differentiate Thomas Lucier from the rest is his very straight forward & knowledgeable approach to the topic. He does not claims (like many others) that investing in foreclosures will make you an overnight millionaire, however, he provides a very methodical step by step approach that is not hard to follow.The book covers almost all the aspect of foreclosure investing. One particular topic that intrigue me is \\"Subject To\\" mode of investing. Mr. Lucier has provided some gems on this topic as well.Another plus is the some real-world letters are present (that can also be downloaded from his web site) which can be used with very little modification (name and address change) to communicate with the clients.Having been a skeptic and a veteran of many REI Courses and DVDs, for past years, I think this book has finally provided me the drive to get up and enter the world of Real Estate Investing in Pre-Foreclosures."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"I bought this book on a Saturday and finished it in two days. This was not because the book was printed in 36 point type, but because the author captured my attention and held it throughout the book.I have been researching real estate markets and practices in my area for several years and I am currently pursuing my realtor's license. I have read numerous books on the subject of real estate investment and also foreclosure investing. This book is by far the most informative I have yet read on the subject of foreclosures. The material is also presented in such a way to engage the reader in a personable manner as opposed to some books that read more like a pre-scripted seminar.Mr. Lucier is also extremely thorough in providing the reader with valuable sources of information so that both beginners and those with experience in real estate can get into the nuts and bolts of the pre-foreclosure process. Mr. Lucier's approach to the pre-foreclosure investment is sensible and thorough in that he not only tells you exactly how to become an informed investor but also instructs the reader on exactly how to protect themselves and their investment dollars and stresses the importance of doing so.Of course, the pre-foreclosure process is technical and in my opinion is beyond the scope of any single book, but the information in this particular book will provide readers with a foundation of knowledge which is superior to that which might be acquired from reading other books on this subject."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"If you are serious about buying pre-foreclosure properties and being successful at it then this book is a MUST.The author tells you everything you need to know (and then some) about the foreclosure process going far beyond a \\"cook book\\" type approach.

He also includes the most common errors new investors make as well as supplying the reader with different forms and letters for marketing as well as an endless source of helpful websites The most appealing aspect of this book to me was the instruction and steps to develop my new business was taught with integrity and a good business sense. Lastly Mr. Lucier believes in his product to the point where he makes himself available by email for questions, and he actually responds expediciously!!!"},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"I purchased this book based on other reviews I found at Amazon.com and it is safe to say that 99% of the reviews were accurate. Mr. Lucier's writing style is to the point and without the \\"fluff\\" that many other foreclosure programs fill you up with. He includes examples of actual events that happened to him (or investors he knows) at exactly the right times. It is VERY easy to read and VERY easy to understand, but that does not mean there is no detail. He also includes many reference websites for you to obtain any information that you might not have fully grasped or would just like more thorough knowledge on. Finally, Mr. Lucier allows buyers of his books to ask him questions via e-mail or telephone. I actually wrote him an e-mail with a few questions and I had a response in under 8 hours! This is really a must buy for beginners and maybe a reference guide for pros. Would recommend this to ANYONE!

He gives a road map to the important web sites after every topic when it applies. He covers A-Z on how to complete a successful pre-foreclosure transaction. He not only teaches all the concrete steps but the emotional personal steps as well. He covers the fear of taking a risk, motivation, and a direct how to approach. He gives a complete list of recommended reading that will help with every obstical that I've run into. Thomas states in his book that if there is a problem that we can contact him to ask questions. How many times have you heard that from an author? It's true, I emailed him and he answered my question. He doesn't make it sound easy, he states that we must do our research and homework and study hard. His no-nonsense approach has helped me to set up a real-estate team, the paper work and the courage to move into the real-estate that I love. I would recommend his book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"This is one of the best real estate books I have ever read.

There's lot of specific checklists, like a Phase One Environmental Audit checklist and a list of common abbreviations found in title documents.My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that the book is a little disorganized.

I was not disappointed in the least. It contains step-by-step instructions and valuable must-know information for people wanting to pursue the pre-foreclosure market. It is the step-by-step detail that is the most important to me as I'm still in the process of trying to get my business running smoothly.In short, I'm grateful that the author chose to write this book and make his knowledge available to those who want to learn from one of the best.

Every form for any situation from what I can see in the book is on his site and can be down loaded for free. Considering other Guru's want you to buy a plastic CD with forms on it for about $400, this guys got to be crazy. He'll probably file bankruptcy in a couple of weeks giving all his forms away for free. I can't believe it!I got the book Tuesday May 4th and read it by noon today Wednesday May 5, 2005. I'm going to read it again, after I read his other book that I bought with this book. Today after I finished the book around 1:30PM or 2:00PM I sent Mr. Lucier an email, a very long one. It probably took him 2 hours to read it and I got an answer back in about two hours. I'm impressed!This book is meat and potatoes. I can't wait to read the other book so I can test his email answering again!Read some of the other books if you need motivation, but get this book if you want to know what to do, how to do it, where to do it and when to do it. Besides, you won't have to pay $2500 for an 18 month home study course. And I bet that if you do go through an eighteen month course you still won't know what to do and will still have to buy Tom's book.I bet if he wasn't an X-Marine, he'd get a lot of static for giving $400 to $1000 worth of forms away for free.

It is well-written, easy to understand, and insightful. The only problem is that it does not give relevant economic information to investors to navigate the real estate bubble. However, I do not fault the author for that since they are really two seperate topics. To fill this gap I would also recommendCashing in on the Real Estate Bubble. This book focuses on the economic aspect of teh bubble and presents a survey of the best methods to make money from the real estate mess.If you want to buy pre-foreclosures, I would recommend both books - this one for instructions on how to handle foreclosures and the other (Cashing in on the Real Estate Bubble) as an economic resource.

Although the author claims not to be a get-rich-quick type author, it seems he goes a bit overboard with this \\"messiah message\\". We get it Thomas, we won't get rich next month in Real Esate.Even though it is refreshing that he espouses many disclaimers...it almost scares you into not applying the business as he mentions many, many times how cut-throat extremely hard this business is.As an adult who excepts my own actions and resposibilities i can do without the negativity...I would have rated this book 5 stars had it not been a little less frightening sounding to practice pre-forclosures as he represents the business to be \\"EXTREMELY HARD\\". It almost sounds like one should just pass on the business because of all the pitfalls and scams.Secondly, the cover of the book is misleading as \\"YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD THE FORMS FOR FREE\\". He sell the \\"forms\\" on CD on his website.Important: Once you know what to do you are \\"on your own\\" so sometimes bootcamps and seminars from the \\"right educators\\" (Ron Legrand) are almost an essential part of the business, This author bundles everyone that is not him as a snake oil salesman. Bad advice!!!I have done many deals i would have probably not have done if it weren't for the extra support and motivation in seeing others succeed in this business ffrom ongoing education (/courses, books, bootcamps,etc.)Don't most of the fortune 500 comopanies spend millions on sales training and product knowledge for thier industries?This author seems to want you to live in a vacuum---- EVERYBODY needs motivation and on-going knowledge from differnt experts every now and then and sometimes it's worth the price of a bootcamp otherwise you will be paying for a bootcamp in the real world with $$$ mistakes.UPDATE:Andrew Marin says:But, was the book useful to you? Did you apply the techniques? I get what you're saying, but want more meat about what's important to me, the prospective buyer :)Mark Twain says:I have bought 28 homes on a PRE prior to reading this book and what got me through it was the teachings of a few great courses.

I have modified some of my strategies as the result of having read and learned from this book, and can and do recommend the book very highly. It is easily worth many multiples of its price. Get it and follow the advice this author provides.Perhaps most commendable (and surprising) is the fact that the author makes himself accessible both on-line and by phone (!!) to readers who have questions, need assistance, or perhaps a clarification regarding an idea or concept presented in the text.

Loved it. The book gives you instructions on how to go to his website so you can download the appropiate marketing letters you should send out to people in distress.I own a foreclosure prevention company and have adopted some of his techniques, nevertheless (not to take away any merit from the author but instead to enhance the next version of his book) our company principals felt like these letters were a little bit to hard on the person that is loosing their homes. Be believe that this kind of hard approach could have negative consequences if you are trying to do business with someone in distress. We have to understand that when someone is loosing their home, they can go into denial and sometimes even be heavily depressed.If you do decide to get into this process of sending out letters the only thing you should try and add to them, is to let the people know that you are there because you really care to help them out and not to make a quick buck! People will give you their business if you are upfront, honest and ethic about what you are trying to do.Don't forget to add a little note written by hand on every letter that states: \\"We really care!\\"Other than that, you should buy the book if you are into the business of Real Estate in this decade!"},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","review":"Let's face it, tax liens and preforeclosures are the new \\"it\\" for this new downward market.

Mr. Lucier, the author, provides a detailed, step-by-step system for finding, buying, polishing, and selling distressed(pre-foreclosure)real property. The book is written in clear, easily readable and easily understandable prose. Additionally, the author provides you with all the support you need. He offers worksheets, checklists, examples of letters he has used, helpful websites and much more. OK, here's the icing on the cake. The author offers his email address so you can ask any question you may have regarding the process. I, in fact, did have a question so I sent Mr. Lucier an email. He responded in less than 24 hours. More than that, he voluntarily sent a follow up email with more helpful information (that is relevant for my geographic area). Ask yourself, how often have you gotten that type of attention from an instructor?

It suits readers who think logically and sequentially. And, oh my Goodness, Thomas holds nothing back. Many times when I read something I get the sense that the author wants me to have only so much information (aka \\"power\\") and not a bit more. With Thomas Lucier I get the feeling he really wants me to be empowered to win. The man has integrity oozing out of his pores. This field could be grimy (with investors who only care about themselves). Lucier, however, is simply a very balanced person.

The material of the book is presented as the testimony of three members of Scotland Yard (each with a distinct personality and point of view) summarizing their own investigations into a complex murder situation in a private St. James museum, accidentally stumbled upon due to a bizarre run-in with an eccentric character by a constable. Fell has nothing to say until the very end, and he's highly subdued even then.2) The details unfold in an unorthodox fashion which keeps the reader surprised and bewildered throughout, despite there regularly being substantial new facts presented which clear up several of the questions all along the track of the narrative. The book is paced well, with revelations well-placed and new complications introduced in such a way to make this book more of a \\"page-turner\\" than many of Carr's novels.3) Through the indirect means of the \\"perceptions\\" of the three representatives of the Yard, different reactions to and insights about the various protagonists and suspects help the reader to enjoy a different approach to characterization than in many other Carr novels.I found the actual conclusion slightly contrived (there were a few minor questions that remained unconvincing to me by the end), yet I found the book thoroughly enjoyable, and one of the best examples among Carr's work of our suspicions constantly being redirected, our sympathies evolving, and our understanding of the motives and actions of the odd bunch of eccentric characters (represented by both \\"modern\\" young people and stodgier older people)constantly being led down new avenues.All in all, a solid 30's mystery with some lively characters, well-told and mercifully free of Fell's histrionics! :)"},{"Title":"The Arabian Nights Murder","review":"Another fine mystery from John Dickson Carr! This one starts out slow but has a bang-up conclusion. As sometimes happens in his novels, the great detective (in this case the brilliant Dr. Gideon Fell) hardly appears at all. Unlike Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, the personality of the detective hardly comes into play at all! This is somewhat unfortunate. The detective, in Carr's mysteries, is more a device than a character.As in some of his other books, Carr (aka Carter Dickson) in this book portrays a group of young, prankish, aristocratic Brits. These characters can be quite insufferable. Unlike P.G. Wodehouse (surely an influence on Carr), the author does not seem to recognize how annoying these upper-class twits can be! But in Carr mysteries the puzzle is all, and few authors have constructed more entertainingly and elaborately misleading traps."},{"Title":"The Thunder Tree: Lessons from and Urban Wildland","review":"Starting from a personal viewpoint (but in no means limited by it) author Robert Michael Pyle eloquently writes of the importance of nature and of making a personal connection to the land and the natural world. Never preachy, he manages to gently urge the reader to look more closely at the local landmarks, wildlife and little details that make up their most familiar landscapes. I saw the landscape in my area with new eyes after reading this book."},{"Title":"The Thunder Tree: Lessons from and Urban Wildland","review":"I doubt that many books intertwine as many themes as artistically as The Thunder Tree: on the surface this is the memoir of the childhood of America's premier nature writer. But in a few hundred pages Robert Michael Pyle produces by far the finest encapsulation of the biology, geology and ethology of the Rocky Mountain foothills and plains ecotone one could imagine, with forays into cultural and philosophical territory. Walden Pond is attenuated into a 60 mile Highline canal that traverses the heart of the Denver Metropolitan area. This canal enabled much of the suburban growth of the city. Utterly unnatural, it nevertheless brings wildness into this urban and suburban sprawl. Bob Pyle demonstrates his personal epiphany that inspired a life's work due to this slice of urban nature. I believe that Richard Louv has acknowledged Bob's influence in Last Child in the Woods: the premise that children need wild spaces is never more eloquently stated than in the \\"extinction of experience\\" sections of The Thunder Tree. This book has become a touchstone in my life: buy it! Read and reread it! Treasure it!"},{"Title":"The Thunder Tree: Lessons from and Urban Wildland","review":"Pyle grew up near an irrigation canal running through Denver and Aurora, Colorado. He has returned to this canal throughout his life, and in this book he tells their stories.

This text also depicts the ari as antagnistic to the supremecy of Indra and the soma sacrifice while venerting Varuna as sovereign deity. This book is essential for any scholar of Vedic tradition."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"As a travel book and a literary work this is very good (I hesitate to say excellent) and I think every American, as well as anyone interested in America, should read it. The problem is that it has no plot so things can get draggy, and events aren't wrapped up nicely as in fiction (like the deserted motel he comes across). Memorable characters don't stay for more than half a chapter.But there're lovely descriptive scenes, enough to make me want to run down to New England and Montana right away in the autumn; there're insightful observations and analyses (admittedly cliched and sentimental) and there's humour, a humour that's just as willingly directed inward at himself as outward at his journey."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"John Steinbeck's Travels with Charley earns a rank of seven for provoking much thought and entertaining the reader with his experiences. This book deserves a reading if you aim to relax by journeying not figuratively across the United States; but through Steinbeck's mind, meandering from a remembrance to an analysis to an aimless thought. Oddly enough, this disjointedness facilitated the reading since no intricate plot line demanded attention and no details lay strewn about for the reader to assemble. Rather, Steinbeck abandoned each thought line to pursue the next; more often than not, the connections came together nicely, but two adjacent stories seldom relied on each other for coherence.The reader must keep an open mind while Travels with Charley exposes and discusses human foibles and cultural differences, since it occasionally identifies and criticizes the reader's own characteristics. Steinbeck nevertargets any specific group or individual other than himself in hisreproaches, yet every reader will discover some fault of humanity in his own soul as Steinbeck censures what he notices along the roads of America. This allows for offence, self-evaluation, or dismissal by the reader; however, it nearly always elicits some contemplation.The most worthwhile aspect of Travels with Charley lies in its ability to expose the humor in events most people allow to pass by unnoticed. Steinbeck dissects every conversation during his trip, recounts every event of discussional merit, and assigns endless personalities and opinions to Charley, his poodle. With his attitude, a close encounter with a grizzly bear provides an opportunity for open laughter; and from his mental perspective, the psychology of a flock of turkeys requires a close evaluation.Travels with Charley induces only one disappointment since Steinbeck doesn't measurably accomplish what he introduces as the goal of his book Steinbeck sets out &quot;to try to rediscover this monster land&quot; of America, but instead he honestly admits that he found no succinct and presentable truth about this country (5). &quot;This monster of a land...turns out to be the macrocosm of microcosm me&quot; Steinbeck states in his only attempt at a generality derived from his journey (159). This inconclusiveness may disappoint the reader who expected an endpoint rather than a surrender presented with an assimilation of the author's ideas. When expecting not a neat summary of America, but anticipating only an amusing and diverting presentation of its component territories and people, Travels with Charley will lend much satisfaction to the reader."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I bought this as a gift for my ex husband, so I have no idea how I would rate it, but Im sure he would rate it high. Thats why I bought it for him!"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Travels With Charley is the tale of a trip that John Steinbeck made around the country, accompanied by only his poodle Charley. The book is both funny and thoughtful at the same time. Steinbeck wanted to rediscover the real America that he had been writing about for so long, an America which he had lost touch with. &#34;With Charley, his French poodle, Steinbeck drives the interstates and the country roads, dines with truckers, encounters bears at Yellowstone and old friends in San Francisco. And he reflects on the American character, racial hostility, on a particular form of American loneliness he finds almost everywhere, and on the unexpected kindness of strangers that is also a very real part of our national identity.&#34;I'm not overly fond of America, but I love this book. It's hilarious in parts, especially when Steinbeck describes Charley's antics. But at other moments, Steinbeck is dead-on right. For example on page 26, &#34;...but I do wonder whether there will come a time when we can no longer afford our wastefulness- chemical wastes in the rivers, metal wastes everywhere, and atomic wastes buried deep in the earth or sunk in sea.&#34; That time that he refers to is now, and Steinbeck, writing in the 1950's and 60's, predicted it. Are humans so predictable?Much of the book is about interactions between Steinbeck and various people, and encounters with various animals. Steinbeck comments on Charley's waking-up habits, commenting that &#34;Charley likes to get up early, and he likes me to get up early too. And why shouldn't he? Right after his breakfast he goes back to sleep. Over the years he has developed a number of innocent-appearing ways to wake me up. He can shake himself and his collar loud enough to wake the dead. If that doesn't work he gets a sneezing fit. But perhaps his most irritating method is to sit quietly beside the bed and stare into my face with a sweet and forgiving look on his face; I come out of deep sleep with the feeling of being looked at. But I have learned to keep my eyes tight shut. If I even blink, he sneezes and stretches, that night's sleep is over for me...he nearly always wins.&#34; Hilarious, right? There are way too many funny and interesting parts for me to include them all, but another fascinating instance is when they're driving through Yellowstone. Charley, normally a gentle dog, suddenly becomes a savage beast when confronted by bears, regardless of the fact that a bear could crush him with one paw.I really love John Steinbeck, and Travels With Charley is a humorous and thought-provoking work of nonfiction. I need to reread some of Steinbeck's novels (the only one I've reviewed on this blog is The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights). Rereading The Grapes of Wrath is probably next on my list. I would highly recommend this book too, and I'm glad I have my own copy now.Check out my blog, Cleo's Literary Reviews."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"A few years ago I bought this book and read it aloud to my husband...we both enjoyed it very much.

But this book which is brilliantly written let me down in the last 20 to 25 pages. The tone and mood completely changed (which he may or may not have intended) once he arrived in New Orleans. Although for the most part I agreed with him, there are some points in which we differ. What hit home with me was his \\"Leave to Beaver\\" description of the black Cooper boys he grew up with in Salinas CA, which was quite a bit different then my experience growing up in the inner city of Cleveland, Ohio, having my neck slashed with a straight razor. If you were white and still breathing by the 12th grade you graduated based on that merit alone. I'm not discounting what Steinbeck said. Both versions of that time are true. Just viewed through a different lens.Although I am a conservative and Steinbeck was a liberal... to use his own words, \\"I'm a blown in the glass Democrat\\" I tried to put that aside. Because we don't agree politically that in no way diminishes his flair for writing, although he sometimes goes off in philosophical tangents. I think though he should have stuck with what he does best. Description. His written account of what he sees, smells, feels, is where he shines.The ancient giant redwood trees that he encounters along the Oregon coast:There's a cathedral hush here. Perhaps the thick soft bark absorbs sound and creates a silence. The trees rise straight up to zenith; there is no horizon. The dawn comes early and remains dawn until the sun is high. Then the green fernlike foliage so far up strains the sunlight to a green gold and distributes it in shafts or rather in stripes of light and shade. After the sun passes zenith it is afternoon and quickly evening with a whispering dusk as long as was the morning.Thus time and the ordinary divisions of the day are changed. To me dawn and dusk are quiet times, and here in the redwoods nearly the whole of daylight is a quiet time. Birds move in the dim light or flash like sparks through the stripes of sun, but they make little sound. Underfoot is a mattress of needles deposited for over two thousand years. No sound of footsteps can be heard on this thick blanket. To me there's a remote and cloistered feeling here. One holds back speech for fear of disturbing something - what? I have had lifelong association with these things. ... I can accept them and their power and their age because I was early exposed to them. On the other hand, people lacking such experience begin to have a feeling of uneasiness here, of danger, of being shut in, enclosed and overwhelmed. It is not only the size of these redwoods but their strangeness that frightens them. And why not? For these are the last remaining members of a race that flourished over four continents as far back in geologic time as the upper Jurassic period. Fossils of' these ancients have been found dating from the Cretaceous era while in the Eocene and Miocene they were spread over England and Europe and America. And then the glaciers moved down and wiped the Titans out beyond recovery. And only these few are left - a stunning memory of what the world was like once long ago. Can it be that we do not love to be reminded that we are very young and callow in a world that was old when we came into it? And could there be a strong resistance to the certainty that a living world will continue its stately way when we no longer inhabit it?On Charley's love life:\\"Once Charley fell in love with a dachshund, a romance racially unsuitable, physically ridiculous, and mechanically impossible. But all these problems Charley ignored. He loved deeply and tried dogfully.\\"Moose crossing the road in front of him:\\"They stood stately then walked away in cushioned-stately steps.\\" Can't you just see that?When you're treated to writing like this having to endure the ending, a freshly painted Picasso which mud was flung upon, somehow left me hollow inside. Maybe even more so then if Charley had died."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Travels with Charley to me is first of all a perfect story of a man and his dog.One of the best stories, I have ever read."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I would SO MUCH love to take this trip with my poodle \\"Apu\\" !

Like Louis Lamour's, Education of a Wandering Man, it is a book very different from the more familiar approach the authors are known for. Both tell you more about the author, and the stories although interesting and well done, are in many ways secondary. One uses an autobiography, the other a trip across America, but both show you things about the man you probably didn't know.His interaction with people from all over the country that he meets on this trip adds insight to the type of country many of us remember in the 1960's. The book is full of Steinbeck's opinions on the country, the people in it, and really about how he looks at things.The book also reminds me of William Buckley's book, Raging through Paradise. In both books you find yourself on a very interesting and even educational trip but it turns out that the trip is a backdrop for the authors opinions on the just about everything.Charley the dog was well worth getting to know. The dog served as an interesting character well worth getting to know. In addition the dog, as much as the trip itself, served again as a means of learning about the author.My reading of this book followed my reading of most of his books. I think that is a great approach. Read this book after the others. It brings a whole new feeling about the author. A great book to add to your reading of Steinbeck."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I have read this book two times, once as a teenager and now 40+ years later. It is a great book and easy to read. I was amazed as a teen ager, and now, how such a famous author would do such an ordinary thing as travel around America in a camper and write about it. He can do more than write well about things, he shows how to really observe and absorb experiences around him."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Steinbeck and his publisher's thought it was time for him to re-discover America some twenty-five odd years after the Joads great pilgrimage from the Oklahoma dustbowl to the fruitful bounty of the Califoria coast, in his most famous work \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\".Thus in 1960, just before regionalism had ceased to exist and homogenization took a firm hold, Steinbeck and his dog Charlie set off, in a camper he designed for the journedy, to see America one more time.No writer captures America better than Steinbeck. For those of us over 40 great nostalgia for a time past, for those younger folks, a wonderful look at an America you never knew. You'll want to read it over and over again."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This book was excellent. I would reccomend this as a book for anyone to read.

Excellent book for all ages! 12+"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"John Steinbeck's book:&quot;Travels With Charley&quot; is one of the most interesting book that I've read. It's about about an exciting travel across America made by Steinbeck and his french poodle, Charley. Although the book has been written since more than forty years ago, there are still some aspects that are found in the current society. The paint of America made by Steinbeck is so authentic, so real that it makes the reader dazzled, stimulates his curiosity and takes him to places that he might have never been.Steinbeck is a great observer. He describes everything so perfectly, from people to the american society; from the american society to the environment. By using a numerous figures of speeches, he gives to all his descriptions an attractive color which bring them alive. As an example, the way Steinbeck talks about the nature is just extraordinary.Steinbeck points his finger at the problems of America, and precisely the pollution caused the industrialization of the big cities. Also, he mentions one of the greatest problems that is ravaging the american society since ever, which is the problem of discrimination and racial conflict between Black and White. Personally, I was proud to read his perception about the problem, and the fact of considering himself as a cosmopolitan. In short, Steinbeck discusses with vigour a lot of delicate facts that are still found in today's society.Therefore,&quot;Travels With Charley&quot; still has its place in the in this new generation.Although I reproach Steinbeck for his tendency to include too many details for things or events which are not important( discussions with charley...), I still think it's a good book to read because you can discover the genius of an author that can make you discover the beauty of a country."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Travels With Charley: In Search of American is an entertaining and personal novel. You really get to know Steinbeck, which is why I think people who are already Steinbeck fans will enjoy this book more if they have read his other major works (&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; and &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;). Those novels will also give the reader a point of comparison (as well as an introduction) as far as his opinions, because, as usual, he does not hold back in his opinions. He was a very smart man with much to say of importance and he gives his opinions on what he sees directly in this novel.Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors, this is the fifth book I have read by him and I plan on reading most of his other works. He gives visual imagery like few other authors, so the reader really feels as if he/she is in the passenger seat with him.I give it 5 stars because nonfiction does not get much better. because it is, afterall, nonfiction. However I would recomend you read &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; and &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; before you read this, because frankly, they are better ... and are also good introductions."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"A treasure of a book to read again and again.

Better yet if he can write like Steinbeck. On my top 10 list of all-time favorites. A great gift to new Americans."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"When I picked up this book for my summer reading list I was intrigued in whether or not Steinbeck would ever reach a simple answer to the purpose of his journey. I'm extremely glad that he didn't. It's incredibly hard to analyze an entire country and find the meaning behind it and all it's people by taking a simple trip. The fact that Steinbeck realized that he didn't really know what he was looking for and never had a true sense of finality was very fitting and interesting. I enjoyed this book because of Steinbeck's strong mind and opinions and I enjoyed reading his notes and comentary on the world around him. Charley was a memorable poodle and i very much liked this book."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"The book arrived in sterling shape with dust jacket attached and in excellent shape. the purveyor was prompt and the item arrived in good time.

An absolute must read for Americans of all walks."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I purchased this book for my grandmother and after she read it she loaned it to me. It's an excellent read, even if you have never read Steinbeck before, and very humorous and entertaining.

Charley and his truck are additional \\"characters\\" to this book, each with their own personality and quirks, and this camraderie keeps Steinbeck's narrative rolling along."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Steinbeck manages to perfectly capture the loneliness and quiet desperation he comes across during his cross-country trip.

Steinbeck is able to take sometimes sentimental, sometimes angering mental snapshots from his travels to create a small nugget of truth that accurately reflects his America. His perceptions are relevant to almost any American, any traveler with an open mind as he is able to piece together a simple scene of America, stuck in time, and somehow pull an eternal message from each experience."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I read this book before bedtime. I read it on snowy days, on rainy days, on sunny days. I read it while listening to the ocean waves. I could totally relate to Steinbeck's experiences. I too have traveled the United States- with a cat. Cats arent quite as fun, but he didnt seem to mind.I experienced Steinbeck and Charley's travels with them. I laughed with them, cried with them, felt disgust at the Cheerleaders with them. I know the feeling of getting lost in familiar territoty. I still recall the peaceful serenity of mountanous roads, rudely interrupted with manic city highways. I WAS there!This book will always remain on my bookshelf. John Steinbeck is my liteary hero."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Travels with Charley is a solid four-star book. You should read it. It is nowhere NEAR the best thing Steinbeck ever wrote (viz. Of Mice and Men--IMHO), but it does give personal insight into one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century...a guy whose name belongs right alongside Fitzgerald, Faulkner, Warren, etc.The book is a travelogue, recounting Steinbeck's 1960 solo-except-for-a-French-poodle-named-Charley cross-country road-trip. Nothing really exceptional occurs, but the pages turn nevertheless. Steinbeck has the chops to make sump'n out of near-nuthin', and the reader is transported INTO the front seat of Steinbeck's truck, observing what Steinbeck observed, hearing the voices of the people he encountered, smelling the air, feeling stiffness in the limbs after a few too many hours on the road.Steinbeck seems to be aware of the lack of Moments. If he set out to \\"find\\" America, he failed. He drove a lot, drank plenty of coffee, met a couple characters, but did not have an Experience. There was no epiphany. No transcendent thunderbolt of revelation, wherein the secret of life was revealed by an ancient Indian shaman. (Charley got prostatitis and had to stay at the vet's for a few days.)At the very end, there is an episode on racism which struck me as...suspect. Steinbeck was wont to play with the \\"truth\\" and embellished events as any writer worth his liquor inevitably does. His political sympathies and unvarnished outrage at segregation led him, I believe, to fudge his great moral coda. Encountering Jim Crow in New Orleans, Steinbeck reconstructs a too-good-to-be-true black family from his youth in Salinas (Wikipedia--I know, I know--casts some doubt as to their authenticity, but other sources indicate that they did, in fact, exist...although to what extent they resembled Steinbeck's hagiographic portrait is unclear), and has interludes with an old black man who encapsulates the pain and oppression of Southern racism, and a white man who epitomizes the evil, unattractive nature of bigotry.Those interludes are, uh, a little TOO black and white. They don't seem real (the white guy, especially, is a caricature). I don't think Steinbeck invented them completely...but I think he may have finagled with reality in order to serve the narrative--HIS narrative. That's his perfect right, of course, but as a reader, one can feel the tug of the nose-ring.Still, I recommend the book."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Travels with Charley is one of my favorite books and one of the few that I have read over and over again. I want here to especially recommend the Gary Sinise reading of the book for Classics on Cassette. Sinise has played and directed in productions of other Steinbeck works, and he reads the book in an engaging manner that I suspect reflects his own love for the book. I have listened to part of the Recorded Books version on CD and enjoyed it far less. I do hope the Gary Sinise version comes out on CD soon."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I liked this book for the most part. It's not so much a story about John Steinbeck taking a trip, but rather a story of a trip, that happened to be told through the eyes of John Steinbeck. Steinbeck, himself, often takes third billing to the miriad of unique individuals he encounters (French-Canadian migrant workers, mechanics, hotel keepers, actors, etc.) and the beautiful scenery that Steinbeck describes so well.Other reviewers consider &quot;Travels with Charley&quot; the ramblings of a grumpy old man, but I disagree. Yes, his age and his opinions come into play in this book, but the world is always going to be seen through the eyes of an individual. This individual happens to be nearing the end of his life and is apt to compare the world as it is to the world as it was. This comes into play during the meeting of a young man who works on a nuclear submarine and when Steinbeck visits his hometown. Other times, Steinbeck comments on changing American opinions, such as his surprise that many Americans prefer to own a mobile home than own a piece of property--Steinbeck always believed that the stability that comes with a piece of land was superior to the advantages of mobility and he was curious to find out why the shift in attitudes.As the book neared its end, however, it seems as if Steinbeck got really tired of the project. His travels through the Deep South, during which time he encountered numerous racists was depressing. Furthermore, the ending of the book was quite abrupt. A book as good as this one deserved an ending with more effort put into it. In all, I would recommend this book. It's fast-paced (but with introspection, unlike &quot;On the Road&quot;), witty, and (with a few exceptions) makes you feel pretty good about being an American."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"First of all, the read is wonderful. This is not a book that you have to read for class, it is not a story, it is more like a small annotation of an autobiography. Here we get to see what it is like to be one of the greatest American Writers of the Twentieth Century. Alone in his thoughts, it is not a drawn out - chronological book on his life. It is almost a journal, but written in a style that makes you feel like a close and personal friend.It is not only a look at America, it takes you inside yourself. It inspires you to take a deeper look inside of you and the life that goes on around you.I give this book the highest rating, please treat yourself and read this one!"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"It's been a while since I have chewed on any Steinbeck..... and I forgot how much I adore him. Wanderlust overtook Steinbeck's common sense, and in 1960 he traveled cross country with Charley, his standard poodle. His candid account is wonderful and generous - I especially enjoyed his descriptions of the preparation - too many books that would go unread, not enough liquor to be shared.The pages are filled with humor, humanity, dog-manity, and adventure. His tales are heartfelt and honest - never flipant or cruel. He saw goodness in most and overlooked shortcomings of the people he met. Steinbeck's trip seems such a far cry from America today. We rarely reach out to even offer a friendly \\"hello\\" - much less engage in conversation with one another. Why is that? fear? embarrasement? self importance? lack of time? He had it right - and I'm inspired to buy a camper."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This book covers the travels of John Steinbeck when he was 60 years old in the autumn of 1960. Steinbeck gets a camper and drives from New York counter-clockwise around the country.His narrative moves rather quickly with only a few stops described in detail. Being a native Californian, his time there is one of the most complete parts of this account.I liked 2 things in particular about this book. First, Steinbeck throws in occasional asides on some aspect of Amreican Culture that are incredibly incisive. For example, he sums up modern American Literature as \\"sex, sadism and murder\\". Take a look at the best-selling fiction table at your favorite bookstore and see if you can disagree.Second, Steinbeck picks and chooses only a poignant few occurrences of his trip to examine in depth. For example, he spends time describing his account of watching bigots insult a little black girl who is escorted into a white school. The same bigots insult even worse the white students who attend the school rather than boycott it. This snapshot of American Culture is wonderfully described.Negatives of the book are that much of it is too brief to be meaningful. Some parts are just a blur of travel. This may be how it felt to Steinbeck, but I don't really want to spend time reading about it.Overall, there is a wistful, autumnal feel to the book. Steinbeck doesn't come home finding anything other than gradual disappointment and a wish to be home with a few noteworthy exceptions. Overall, an enjoyable, quick read with a few moments of thought-provoking introspection. 4 stars."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I find this to be an influential novel about one writer's experience through the country. From coast to coast the story is filled with remarkable quotes and tales of the America so many of us take for granted. The story makes us see that America is more than a piece of land, it is a piece of history. So many of us see our land and our inalienable rights as simply every day pleasures that we will always have. By reading this book I began to think of how often I simply take a right for granted and do not stop to think of what past peoples have had to do to give these rights to me.I am glad to have read this book. It is an inspiration to the way I look at the world. I will never simply travel to go somewhere, I will travel to see the country and understand my history."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"What a great book! It sure was a pleasure to sit down and just read a very relaxing read. Not a book that you have to rush through or try to understand or discover the hidden meaning. Just a man, his dog, his truck and three months across America. It may just be me, but there is something special, fun and exciting about going out and discovering America with your dog. This is a trip that we would all love to take. Why didn't they make us read this in High School instead of some of those other boring just put me to sleep books. If I would have read this in High School I probably would not have ignored books for the last 10 years. I need more books like this one."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Steinbeck took an inspiring &amp; educational trip with Charlie, saw sights, and had interesting conversations with the folks he encountered across America. Steinbeck is a genius who can say so much, so brilliantly, with so few words. He noted subtle regional differences of the people of our country but what I liked was on of his many points I agreed with, to paraphrase...we are more American than we are Northerners, Southerners, Westerners, Whites or Blacks as a whole. Another thing I can relate to is how in the beginning of the book, as Steinbeck was preparing for his journey, American folks were asking typically curious and also very stupid questions about his trip, and why he wanted to partake in it. Is there something wrong with Americans who have a desire to explore and experience new people and places? Americans are still as chained to this rigid mentality today as they were when Steinbeck penned this classic. A must read."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I first read this when in high school, now at 40 I have just reread it. As with all of Stenbeck's books it is beautifully written. I don't consider it his most interesting book but it is one of my favorites. His compassionate observations of America and Americans are as relevant now as they were in 1960. You will cringe with disgust when he describes the &quot;cheerleaders.&quot; (Unfortunately such people and attitudes still exist in our society.)Some have complained that this book plods along. I'll admit that it is a bit slow at times but comic books don't plod, but they aren't great literature either.Read this book and you will love this man - not only for his writing but for who he was and what he believed."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"For ages 12-up, this book is an excellent journey. Steinbeck is a great writer, story teller, and I think I'm in love! If I could find a man with the sense of adventure, humor, and passion for life that he has, I would be the happiest girl alive. I cherish the fact that he has such a passion for life. He says, &quot;For I have always lived violently, drunk hugely, eaten too much or not at all,...&quot; (17). I love that fact that he cares so much for his wife and devotes much of his time to his &quot;...old Franch gentleman poodle known as Charley&quot; (7). He also has a wise personality, and one can tell that he loves to investigate. In one part of the book he talks about how he is &quot;over-interested injunk...Recently I stopped my car in front of the display yard of a junk dealer...it suddenly occurred to me that I had more than he had&quot; (35). Anyway, if you want to read a book by an incredibly brilliant author who will take you on an across the country tour, meeting lots of people, read this! MReynolds"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"When I first began reading this book I had no idea that it would be this good. I loved everything about it. The only reason why I gave it an nine is that I have a hard time believing that a book is perfect and there have been books that I have enjoyed more. Though, it wasn't the best book I've ever read, it definitely was one of my two favorite autbiographies. The thing that I liked the most about it was the way John Steinbeck came to certain conclusions. He traveled all across the United States and met all kinds of interesting people. He was able to gain so much insight into human nature. During one of his many nights alone he began to experience a little depression. He was sulking in the bathtub and then he began to recall a time when he was in north Africa. He told of an &quot;old Arab&quot; (38) who offered him tea out of glass &quot;so coated with use it was opaque&quot; (38). He knew that it was dirty, but the man had extended his hand in kindness and &quot;the tea was wonderful because of it&quot; (38). He survived the filth and his final comment on the whole thing was that &quot;A sad soul can kill you quicker, far quicker than a germ&quot; (38). I really liked that because even though he was feeling sad he could remember something as beautiful as a man's kindness. John Steinbeck seemed to make these kind of interesting observations all throughout his book and through simple words he challenged to think about life and to remember to not dwell on the insignificant things. emb523"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This is not really your typical John Steinbeck work; it is autobiographical in that these things actually happened, \\"these things\\" being a trek that Steinbeck makes, in his late fifties, from his home state of Maine, westward across the United States, then back southeast and up again, always alone except for his faithful and intelligent french poodle, Charley.There is no plot in the conventional sense, other than that of allowing Steinbeck to express his deep love for his country, his desire to explore it in a kind of hybrid/conditioned truck/sleeper vehicle, and his inevitable eventual sense of disillusionment with parts of the troubled land, the south in particular, but also with the burgeoning wastefulness and decay of the cities, among other aspects of the land. Not to say that this is a depressing work, although certainly, his encounters with some of the ugliest expressions of racism in the deep south are deeply sad (New Orleans in particular, where a bizarre ritual of middle-aged women publicly spitting invective and hatred towards black schoolchildren on their way to school provokes Steinbeck to confront some bigoted and despicable people). He is a true northerner, both in attitude and love for that part of the country. He barely hides his distaste for that time in the south (describing it as a \\"troubled place and a people caught in a jam\\").His descriptions of many of the emerging trends of the country - the decay of the downtowns, urban sprawl, ethnocentrism (his passages on Texas are fascinating), are both quaint and prescient. One thing has changed little, and that is the ebullience of the American character, how it is viewed by other cultures (Steinbeck reflects on the attitude of Europeans in particular towards Americans), and a push for growth and change. Steinbeck leaves it to the reader to decide whether many of the things he describes are good things, often holding his opinions in a certain check, but throughout it is clear he is a passionate and outstanding liberal mind, whose reflections on the strange, complex but wonderful country of America are as relevant today as they were in 1960."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"\\"Travels with Charlie\\" is the delightful narrative by a master story teller of his 1962 journey across America with his pet poodle, Charlie. Feeling a need to become reacquainted with America, Steinbeck purchased a custom made mobile home which he outfitted, by his own admission, to excess, before setting out on his travels. Although warned that his fame and familiarity would prevent him from maintaining his anonymity, Steinbeck was able to meet America at its own level. From sea to sea he was recognized only by friends and relatives. This anonymity permitted him to drift in and out of American society, tasting and testing, interacting and remembering. From New England to California and back to New York, we are admitted to his conversations with taciturn Yankees and French-Canadian migrant agricultural workers. Traveling west, we read of border guards, the representatives of the government bureaucracy, state specific highway designations and Steinbeck's observations of topography. His roadside visit with an actor and his entertainment by rich friends in Texas provide a sharp contrast in outlooks and behavior of different Americans. During his return to his hometown of Salinas, California, Steinbeck learns the truth that \\"you can't go back home again.\\" Home has changed, his friends have changed, and Steinbeck had changed. It is sad, but true.Steinbeck dreaded the South but knew that he could not be avoided. Traveling in 1962, Steinbeck saw some of the dramatic events of the Civil Rights movement while he sampled the prevailing racial attitudes of Southerners of the day.At the start, Steinbeck was looking to become reacquainted with America. I was hoping that the would finish with some wise conclusions gleaned from his experience. He did conclude that Americans were more united as Americans than they were divided as residents of different regions. He is amazed to find the degree to which diverse immigrant groups have amalgamated into a new nationality in less than two centuries. I passed this on to a distant cousin in France with whom I have been discussing themes in American and French history. Beyond this, we are left to draw our own conclusions from the facts reported.I wonder how many of the people to whom Steinbeck referred have read and recognized themselves in this book. How many of us, who did not meet Steinbeck, see ourselves or our acquaintances reflected in its pages?This a a hard book to put down, so don't try. Pick it up, free your mind and enjoy \\"Travels with Charlie.\\""},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Steinbeck is one of my all time favorite writers. This book is a fitting curtain call to an illustrious career. Steinbeck had a deep love for the common man, for the misfits and socially shackled, and spent a lifetime spinning tales about their trials and tribulations. Yet, he remained so humble despite all the struggles he had endeared to become an &quot;accomplished&quot; writer. The language in this book is a joy to read and I would strongly encourage any young writers to give it a read."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"What makes this book so special to me is that I feel I am close to one of the great writers of all time. Sometimes the book seems (and of course, it is) dated, sometimes it seems visionary. But most of all, it is warm and touching and the writer's obvious love of his dog is particularly dear. It makes a &quot;great&quot; man quite human, although it is amusing to note that Kerouac's &quot;On The Road&quot; is a far-superior book - a truly great work. Steinbeck's fiction is much better than this travelog, but still, it's a joy to read and I feel like I really got to know him as a friend."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Written before the plethora of travelogues now available, Steinbeck was, as usual, ahead of his time. His observations are still fresh, and his style of writing as inviting as ever. After reading the other reviews of this book, however, I noticed one thing lacking: any mention of the inescapable fact that Charley was a standard poodle! Most unusual, then as now, to associate poodles with dreams of the open road. But Charley plays an important role in the book, as companion, conversation partner, and comic relief. Would the book have succeeded had Charley been a lab or a beagle? Perhaps--yet the idea of a tough and wisened writer touring the country with a poodle by his side is simply irresistible. Add this to all that is good about this book, and welcome the multitudes of poodle-lovers to its pages."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This book is vital and interesting, even across the gulf of the 40-odd years since it was written. Steinbeck writes to us from the far side of the 60's \\"generation gap\\" and even the far side of post-World War II industrialization and urbanization.Steinbeck dislikes superhighways and cities, and is most comfortable on country roads and in rural areas. Steinbeck and his dog Charley fight bureaucracy, park rules, bad moods, and mistrust of strangers with free liquor, good old American hospitality, and wit. Along the way he encounters uncooperative Canadian border guards, quaint European migrant farm workers, his own politically polarized family, rich Texans, and other exemplars of the melting pot.The book's climax is Steinbeck's description of racial tension in the south over the integration of public schools. He describes a performance by the New Orleans \\"cheerleaders,\\" a group of racist women who yelled obscenities at white children and their parents who escort them as the children dare to attend an integrated grade school.Steinbeck pulls this off through his remarkably pleasant narrative voice. Reading this book is like spending time with your well-liked great uncle. You know he is basically nostalgic and prefers things the way they were rather than the way they are, but he stops short of being tiresome about it, and doesn't seem to blame you.In writing about America, Steinbeck directly demonstrates some of the best things about the american character. He honestly reports the good and the bad, believes that people are basically good and striving to improve, and shows that honest, respectful relations between individuals can cure, or at least make tolerable, most of society's ills."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"i study english language at faculty of philosophy in rijeka, croatia and we have to read books to improve our vocabulary. i chose this one and i was totally surprised. i love it so much! it gives a great account of america in the 60's but it also gives a warm story about a man and a dog!it could be read as a travel book, as a realistic fiction etc. i recommend it to everyone who enjoy reading absolutely great books!"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I have read my fair share of travel books. Intrigued by other's perceptions of distant places, I never mind being the passive partner in their adventures.Steinbeck's travels feel timeless. He has the skill to grasp the experience of yesterday and make it seem like it is today. It was with extreme pleasure to read of him simply packing up for his trip in his very new, custom made camper that he named Rocinate. He delights in explaining the intricate features of the camper, running water, stove, bedding and water tank. As he kisses his wife goodbye, he and his poodle, Charley take off to see the United States and the people that live there.Of extreme delight is getting to know the moods and habits of Charley. Before long, you feel as if he is sitting beside you, fftting you to go out. He was an attraction, the ice breaker that brought many of the characters Steinbeck writes about to life. As Steinbeck moves from state to state, he relishes his friendship with this dog. He writes down his memories and feelings and these beautiful, funny, timeless reminisces feel just as fresh today as they were yesterday."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"&quot;Travels With Charley&quot; is wonderful to read, as is testified to by other reviewers, but having it read to me by Gary Sinise, a serious actor who loves Steinbeck and reads accordingly, elevates the experience. Steinbeck's values are reflected in his portraits and anecdotes, and the book generates wanderlust, if you're ready or not."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I enjoyed this book as much as any book I have ever read........and I've read many. I'm 80 years old and consider this a classic."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I recently bought the library binding so that I could loan this book to my friends and students and not worry about it falling apart from use. However, I'm more than slightly disappointed with the quality. The library binding is nothing more than the mass market paperback in a hard cover. The paper is thin, dark, and of the poorest quality; the binding is of questionable stability and I doubt it will last as long as I had expected, and the overall feel and look of the book are poor.The content of the book, however, is fantastic. Steinbeck shows the reader a side of America which, even in the early sixties, seemed extinct. What the book still offers is a glimpse of America's core: Steinbeck sought out and found the small and quiet remains of the foundation of what makes America such a unique country. Most striking of all is that this is a book that could have been written just five or ten years ago -- it is incredibly timeless.This book is a book to be read, not displayed, and Penguin's editions reflect this in their pure non-displayability. I suggest that when you go to buy this book you buy it used. Save yourself some money and buy copies which are just as good (my used copies are actually much nicer) and far cheaper than the library binding or the paperback version."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This \\"nonfiction\\" book, which turned 50 this summer, is worth reading for many reasons by young and old. But delivering the \\"truth\\" about 1960 America -- or anything else -- is not one of its strong points. Based on what I accidentally found out in 2010 when I set out to follow Steinbeck's \\"TWC\\" trip as faithfully as possible, the book is mostly fiction and untrustworthy at every level. As I detail inDogging Steinbeck: How I went in search of John Steinbeck's America, found my own America, and exposed the truth about 'Travels With Charley'\\" most if not all of the characters he met on the Steinbeck Highway were fictions. \\"Charley,\\" I'm sorry to say to its many fans and admirers, is a dishonest account of Steinbeck's actual trip, how he traveled, who he met and what he really thought of the country. Read \\"Travels With Charley\\" with an adult, critical eye. Then read \\"Dogging Steinbeck\\" or Google The Truth About Travels With Charley to read what I learned about the book and the trip it's based on."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"...With his French poodle dog Charley, John Steinbeck set out in his truck Rocinante to explore and experience America at the age of 58.

In he's journey john was not happy with most of the big American cities for example Chicago and Texas as having problems of people not being very friendly compare to the American villages. He was also appalled by racism in new Orleans.I like the description he gave of Maine and New England in general in 60's. It has not really changed, most of the things he talked about or saw are still around.My view of the book is that it is not exciting at all, it is too plain!. It does not cause any curiosity to the reader."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This is a beautiful edition of a wonderful travelogue.

His mission is to find out more about the American people. Although he wrote about them, he felt he didn't know enough about them. The book shows how the average life of someone in California would be compared to the average life of someone living in New Hampshire. With Charley, his faithful dog, by his side, he seemed to feel very comfortable meeting people of high and low financial status, people from his very own home town and people from places he had never visited before.

Sorry, but it's a fact. This Steinbeck book is...drawn out; i found it very easy to put down, and couldn't seem to get involved in the book. Maybe because it's non-fiction, and i think that that genre is not exactly Steinbecks best form of writing. When i opened the book i was distracted, very easily. The book lacks all of John's genius. It drags like dead weight, and bordered on boring. It is very difficult to finish, in a way that if you stopped reading it and never picked it up again you wouldn't be missing anything. I love steinbecks other work, and he was what got me into reading, but it wasn't because of this book. Not a good travel; halfway through you'll be asking are we there yet?"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I wasn't too into this one. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck's fiction, but this memoir is rather dull. I was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of America at the time he wrote it. But as an older man (as he even admits) he isn't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths. The ones that he does write about come across as a bit uninspired. Nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he doesn't have too much to say.The one highlight was the last couple of chapters, when he goes to the South (New Orleans) and witnesses all the slimy, seperatists as they scream and holler, with pure craven hatred at the first little black children to be integrated into public schools. He is disillusioned and angry and when he tells the tale of what he saw it is absolutely heartbreaking.As much as a mediocre work as it was, I did take an interest in it because I am a fan of Steinbeck. It was cool to hear him write a memoir. Other Steinbeck fans make get something out of it as well and for them I recommend it, just on that basis. As long as you take into account the stuff I said above. If you haven't read Steinbeck, please...start with \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" or \\"Tortilla Flat.\\" Those are much better works and will give you something to go on if you try to read this."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Had a problem with this low cost used copy... not as describedBUT vendor 100% honest ---No problem FIX.. they stood 100% behind what they sell.Tks!"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"As Steinbeck would tell us, as Americans we all have that sort of longing for the road and to travel our great country. In my opinion, it is becoming a lost love, however, in the age of speed.And so, this book was like a vacation for me. I read it over the space of about a week and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would compare it to William Least Heat Moon's *Blue Highways* although it is a bit different. Both men are intellects and both lend their insight and thoughts as to their experiences and their spiritual journey's and neither lets us down.I loved the book because it gave me a light-hearted reprieve from our everyday duties in life....work, laundry, bills, work, dishes, bills, work, carwashing, groceries, work--and it brought me back to the realization that in many ways we are our own worse enemies....nothing really has to be so hard.

White's affection for the anthropomorphic qualities of animals.The kindness of Stuart Little,Charlotte,and poor old Wilbur!Charley is a nice fellow.I won't spoil the book for you with any details,but one.Steibeck was getting on,feeling old,and decided to travel the US in his re-outfitted camper with his pal Charley.Of course,with his dear wife's consent.I consider this to be one of the great passages in modern fiction.THE GIST OF LIFE:\\"...In long range planning for a trip,I think there is a private conviction that it won't happen.As the day approached,my warm bed and comfortable house grew increasingly desirable and my dear wife incalculably precious.To give these up for 3 months for the terrors of the uncomfortable and unknown seemed crazy.I didn't want to go.Something had to happen to forbid my going,but it didn't.I could get sick,of course,but that was one of my main but secrets reasons for going at all.During the previous winter I had become rather seriously ill with one of those carefully named difficulties which are the whispers of approaching age.When I came out of it I recieved the usual lecture about slowing up,losing wieght,limiting the cholesteral intake.It happens to many men,and I think doctors have memorized the litany.It had happened to so many of my friends.The lecture ends \\"Slow down.You're not as young as you once where\\".And I had seen so many begin to pack their lives in cotton wool,smother their impulses,hood their passions,and gradually retire from their manhood into a kind of spiritual and physical semi-invalidism.In this they are encouraged by wives and relatives,and it's such a sweet trap.Who doesn't like to be the center for concern?A kind of second childhood falls on so many men.They trade their violence for the promise for a small increase of life span.In effect,the head of house becomes the youngest child.And I have searched myself for this possibility with a kind of horror.For I have alway lived violently,drunk hugely,eaten too much,or not at all,slept around the clock or missed two nights of sleeping,worked too long and hard in glory,or slobbed for a time in utter laziness.I've lifted,chopped,climbed,made love with joy,and taken my hangovers as a consequence,not a punishment.I did not want to surrender fierceness for a small gain in yardage.My wife married a man;I saw no reason why should inherit a baby.I knew that ten or twelve thousand miles driving a truck,alone and unattended,over every kind of road would be hard work,but to me it represented the antidote for the poison of the professional sick man.And in my own life I am not willing to trade quality for quantity.If this projected journey should prove too much than it was time to go anyway.I see too many men delay their exits with a sickly,slow reluctance to leave the stage.It's bad theatre,as well as bad living.I am very fortunate of having a wife who likes being a women,which means she likes men,not elderly babies.Although this last foundation for the trip was never discussed,I am sure she understood it...\\"(Penquin Books-1962 from 'travels with charley' pgs 19-20)Enjoy folks.Health and Happiness"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"During the twentieth century a giant of American letters roamed the earth.John Steinbeck, distinguished by both the Pulitzer and the Nobel Prizes, made his writing read so easily his books often challenged any that ventured his way with capturing the reason for the author's efforts.His love of life and the joy he evinced describing anything he stumbled upon were so apparent as to, as in 'Travels with Charley' entice the reader to seek the author out to discover how truly good his coffee might be. Steinbeck's masterful description of his preparation of a pot for a guest began with his intriguing notation that he was going to 'cook' some coffee. And indeed he did, so strong it smelled right off the page.Choosing to construct the work by including his pet french poodle Charley in the adventure may well have been a developement unplanned. Certainly, Charley's apparent lapse into insanity upon coming to face with bears in Yellowstone was surprisingly shocking to Steinbeck. That Charley's ancestors were the hunting dogs of French Kings in centuries gone by was a path of delight it would have been for that author to examine.The racial tensions that close the final chapters explain Steinbeck's journey ending so abruptly in Virginia. Even gifted talents such as his cannot change history. And Steinbeck was riding his pickup right into it. It would have been even more satisfying if instead of his riding into history, the great man had decided to write into it.Much in America has changed in the four plus decades that have followed the publication of his search for America. The differences alone are worth opening the book.Library editions include comprehensive lists of his life's writings. Notable among them sits a work he categorized as a fabrication, The Moon Is Down, documented as the inspiriation for clandestine operations employed by Winston Churchill in specific secret sorties during WWII.Steinbeck might have laughed at the idea of positioning works by labeling the efforts with a meagre system of stars. But he would have agreed to accept smaller magnitudes of clusters identified in the swarming galaxies across the heavens.Surely, he would have allowed a reviewer to suggest that 'Travels with Charley' in the vastness of literature was then worthy of a small cluster of stars. One can imagine he would be thankful that such a suggestion might even point to the Glory that such light declares.TL Farley,author,When Now Becomes Too Late"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I have read a number of John Steinbeck's works, and I plan to read the rest of his major novels.By travelling America during his life's twilight, Steinbeck paints an America that now is lost.

It is a combination history (of a now by-gone America), essay (on what it means to be American, on the coming modern world, on racism, on travel, even on what the mind of a dog may be thinking), memoir, history, travelogue and poem. Steinbeck sets off with his dog Charley in a glorified pickup truck to see America in 1960. He explores as many themes along the way as he does landscapes and states. He meets people, he offers opinions, he converses with his pal Charley, and he offers a comment on America - past, present, and future. I find this a fascinating, thoroughly enjoyable (and I'd even say \\"classic\\") read. And I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to reflect on America and travel with Charley and the great author who drove him around. For those familiar with John Steinbeck only as a writer of fiction, this book reveals a new side, and one I think you will enjoy."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I'm giving Travels w/ Charley two stars because at least there aren't any typos, and there are very few hyphenated words appearing in the middle of sentences.The problem with TWC is that all the white space between text sections has been removed (rather, overlooked), but the non-indent of the new opening paragraph remains. What that means for the reader is confusion as the chapters are a collection of non sequiturs.Conclusion: Sloppy (even contemptuous) text to Kindle conversion."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"In considering \\"Travels with Charley\\", I thought about the time period it was written. Around the Beat Movement, when you had classics from Kerouac and Wolfe and others of similar caliber. Also important to note in \\"Travels with Charley\\" is that the book was written late in Steinbeck's career and he was well-established.Read: wealthy. In a funny way it shows in this book. Steinbeck is not the rough and rugged outdoor character that you might find in a Hemingway novel, nor does he try to be like that. It's great that he, and older man, decided to take a trip away to discover the people of America.But the roughing it and the life on the road gets to him rather early on, showing his age and time, over say the beat writers who made driving across the country seem like a stroll across the street.It doesn't seem that Steinbeck did much research and planning for the trip, as there are not many accounts of National Parks, etc. An avid traveller may scratch his head because of that, trying to see as much possible going cross country. This adds to the humanity and \\"spur of the moment\\" without a net style the book becomes. In \\"Travels with Charley\\", there is a nervous tone at many parts of the trip, almost sad and desolate. The reader can feel Steinbeck's homesickness and thankfulness for trusty ol' Charley.Communication between Charley and narrator is excellent, oftentimes narrated with an envious tone toward Charley's simplistic personality. Perhaps the strongest part of the book is the plight in New Orleans during the 1960s, very chilling account of school desegregation that Steinbeck witnessed. Some very important characters are introduced in this part of the book.If you like \\"Travels with Charley\\", I recommend \\"Into the Wild\\", by John Krakaur. I prefer \\"Into the Wild\\" over this book, because while Steinbeck hadn't planned his trip all the way through, bogging him down at many points, I feel that he really had nothing to lose by taking the trip. There's much emotion in \\"Travels with Charley\\", regardless.Conversely, young college grad Chris McCandless had everything to lose by packing up and travelling America to try and ditch society and live off the land."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Mark Twain was better, William Z. Foster was better, Aldous Huxley was better, but Steinbeck was interesting. My impression when reading this book was that Mr. Steinbeck really didn't want to go on this trip and was in a rush to get back home to his Yacht and material comforts. It also seemed to me that he was actually seeking out people to have a conversation with. There are a lot better travel books than this one - but this is Steinbeck and therefore a must read.

His decision to travel alone, with his dog Charley, in a big camper, incognito, is a risky decision. Risky for his security : you can be attacked by anyone in some isolated areas. Risky for his mental state because it means solitude and the necessity to speak and converse with total strangers he meets on the road, here and there, and this solitary adventure is kind of difficult for him because he is not always capable of being receptive to the unknown others. Risky too for his intellectual welfare because he meets with people and circumstances that force him to think and to question his own personal convictions. The first conclusion he finds is that in fact this last risk is not that great because one, and he is no different from anyone else, only looks at things and sees things that one is ready to see and look at. In other words he discovers that tourism, since his trip is nothing but tourism of some kind, does not really enable the tourist to see with virginal eyes. The tourist can only see with his cultured and cultivated eyes. The second conclusion he comes too is that all Americans are fundamentally alike, share some fundamental truths and characteristics. Yet he does not see the contradiction there is in such an assertion with the fact that he discovers some extreme form of racism in the south that is grappling the first moments of school integration. He feels nothing in common with the racist whites and he cannot really get in contact, in touch with the few blacks he meets and who resist any exchange, closing themselves up in some kind of cautious silence and artificial humble attitude to prevent any provacative action or reaction from the whites. He does not see either the contradiction between his belief that all Americans share some fundamental values and his conviction that he as a tourist projects his own vision on the reality he tries to scrutinize. These fundamental common elements seem to be in the eye of the author. He is defending the principle of the melting pot, the blacks and the indians not being taken into account, and he goes thus against history that sees the emergence of the black civil right movement at this time and will see the emergence of numerous other movements of the same kind over the following decades : native Americans, gay people, women and their liberation, hispanics, etc. He is not able to conceive the salad bowl the US is going to become in the wake of multiculturalism. An interesting book that gives us a series of perfectly well dated snapshots of the US and does not avoid some unpleasant realities he comes across.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Steinbeck with his best prose style and observations on people, places, and things, from New England to the west coast"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"The year is 1960 and highly acclaimed American novelist John Steinbeck has decided to make a three month driving tour of the United States. His means of travel is a three-quarter ton pickup truck with a well provisioned and appointed camper mounted in the bed. His sole traveling companion is his poodle Charlie.Steinbeck begins his journey in Sag Harbor, New York shortly after Labor Day with a short loop through New England before plowing through the upper Midwest. Along the way, it is his hope to \\"rediscover\\" America after having written about it for so many years. He is touched by the almost innate wanderlust within himself and many of the people he encounters.Much of the book reads as a travelogue, and to be honest these were the most entertaining and enlightening. When Steinbeck begins to philosophize, as he does extensively throughout his travels through Texas and then the Deep South (this is 1960, remember), he loses my interest. The book is interesting and entertaining, though at times pedantic and irritating.Most irritating to me was the obviously fictional encounters that Steinbeck creates in an around New Orleans in which he confronts four obvious stereotypes of the region and time frame: The wise, old white gentleman who acknowledges the sins of his race; the elderly black gentleman who is utterly subservient and beaten down; the fire breathing middle aged white racist and the idealistic young black freedom rider.Overall, not a bad read."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I read this just before going to the States for 4 months and I really enjoyed and appreciated the image it gave of the country, we even managed to make it to some of the places he talks about.

There wasn't much motivation to pick up the book each night. After Steinbeck left New England, in my opinion, the story dwindled. The feeling of exploration and new horizons seemed to be jaded, more of a guy driving in a car with his dog than someone discovering America. I mean, how many times can you analyze the tendencies of the local man? It was a good idea, and done to the best of his capabilities, but Steinbeck didn't make it interesting enough, and didn't establish a long running story."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"After my own travel through USA I red Steinbekc's book.

Altough everything that Steinbeck sees he describes in extreme detail. Despite this he still was able to keep my attention. The book was full of one liners. Every situation that Steinbeck comes across brings some interesting idea comment. My favorite of all his fortune cookie wisdom was that everyone sees the world in a different way, so everyone has their own world. The only thing that bothered me about this book is the section about my home town. He represents my town as a racist place.

Mr. Steinbeck uses his informal style through the book to make the reader feel at home with him as he travels the countryside. His personal accounts and author intrusions explain more into the life and beliefs of John Steinbeck. The dog, Charley, and him are friends on an almost human level, that compliment each other. The strong descriptions of the places, people, and actions give a mental picture to the reader of where the duo have gone. The informal structure and simple sentence structure keep a steady rhythm. The adventures that happen on the trip and the people he talks with all contribute to a non-stop reader.Spyderman"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Travels With Charley is an account of John Steinbeck's travels through the states, rediscovering America all over again. Readers are given an account of the raw details, the nice people, the grumpy, short-spoken people, and the plastic-covered hotel rooms that litter our country. He shares his impressions of the land itself and the characteristics it has inspired within the people who live in those lands. John Steinbeck tells a true rendition of the country, the good, the bad, and getting lost near home. He puts his feelings into his words, and shows America from a whole new perspective."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"A captivating literary work for anyone who has ever wondered about their country, Travels with Charley, by John Steinbeck, gives insight into the mind of the American citizen as a single grain in the diverse sandbox of America. Steinbeck recognizes the burning desire possessed by so many Americans at least once in their lives to travel around their country, and experience its many lifestyles firsthand. Travels with Charley has the power to calm this urge by delving deep into the many hearts of America, and blends together elements of friendship, civilization, wonder, and life in a spectacular story."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"In this book, Steinbeck demonstrates his great gift of connecting his stories with the American people, to give his works a gritty, down-to-earth style. Steinbeck beautifully depicts the American people, not as superhuman, but as truly alive, with all their flaws and shortcomings. Travels With Charley represents the American dream, or as it was seen decades ago. Yet Travels With Charley is still worth reading in today's modern times. And ultimately, it provides the reader with an in-depth look into America's recent past."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Travels with Charley paints the reader a beautiful portrait of America, from individual accounts to opinions of cities and states. Steinbeck1s simple words yet deep meaning allow the reader to identify with his inside view of America. The personal accounts that Steinbeck writes about provide a look at the people and cultural regions in America, instead of a simple descriptions of the landscape. The opening chapter is certainly something anyone can identify with, as it describes Steinbeck1s own hunger to explore our great country. Travels with Charley is a unique book that provides an unprecedented description of America."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I mostly picked this book up because I have been a Steinbeck fan since I was 12. I wanted more insight into his personal life, and I was not disapointed. I could just picture John driving all over our great country with his DOG!

Another A+ for the records."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Steinbeck captures the essence of what it means to be an American, using the wisdom which he gathered all his life."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Steinbeck is one of my least favorite writers. After, \\"The Red Pony,\\" and, \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" that was it. I was done. But I am SO glad I read this book regardless of his other depressing works (that scar children's psyches). It's a thin book but it's so full that I have to put it down and let the words steep for a while. The reader becomes a voyeur into Steinbeck's thoughts. He is Everyman as he states obvious truths. He makes it seem simple, but having just returned from a similar trip, with an empty journal (but a full camera-google, \\"squidoo/kidnap,\\" if you're interested) the ability to write such obvious truths is what makes Steinbeck great. I recommend this curious book out of historical significance (they're actually worried about The Bomb and segregation) and as a collection of well-worn personal truths and the human condition. Personally, I feel less guilt that he saw cannery row as it is now, no longer historical, just full of disappointing tourist shops, although I think he'd have enjoyed Monterey Bay Aquarium. Even in his lifetime it was not the Cannery Row he made famous. Over-shadowing the whole book is the reader's knowledge that Steinbeck has less than 8 years left to live. He must have suspected because he alludes to aging and death it throughout."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Interesting slice-of-life deal of 1960 from Steinbeck. Needless to say, great writing, and Steinbeck's observations are often witty (I like how he describes interstate truckers as being like sailors in submarines). It's also interesting to see what he gets wrong (e.g., the uniformity of food, which, of course, totally changes with the influx of non-Western immigrants from the mid-'60s onwards). The ending of the story, when he travels through the Jim Crow South, was horrific, something straight out of Black Like Me. Overall, a truly great book, esp. anyone who's interested in learning about mid-20th-century America."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I heard of this book on a TV show and it sounded interesting. Must confess I had not read any Steinbeck work since high school when I had to read his work. As I am a full timer on my motorhome, have an American Bulldog, and was preparing for a trip from Texas to Atlanta for a visit. My book will be titled \\"Traveling with Dottie\\". Very easy read and hit the nail on the head for me."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I loved this book. I don't know why Steinbeck's gentle prose and sharp wit surprised me so much--perhaps because The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men, my other Steinbeck reads, were more serious. But from the first few chapters it is obvious that Steinbeck is not only a masterful writer but also an incredibly likable person.This book is about a road trip Steinbeck took in 1960 with the stated goal of finding out what the true America is like. Upon further research, I found that Steinbeck had a heart condition and knew he would not live much longer. Thus, as his son surmised, the real reason of the trip was to give Steinbeck one long, last contemplative look at the American that permeated his classic novels.\\"In Spanish, there is a word...vacilando. If one is vacailando, he is going somewhere but doesn't greatly care whether or not he gets there, although he has direction.\\" That is the spirit with which Steinbeck sets off with Charley, his standard poodle. His camper is named Rocinante after Don Quijote's horse, an acknowledgement of his quixotic quest.He sets off from New York and circles the country counterclockwise and literally observing it from all angles, one of America's greatest writers describing his grand subject in short scenes and insightful observations.Although Steinbeck laments the disappearance of regional dialects and the growing homogeneity of the country, America is still a collection of vastly different cultures. A testament to Steinbeck's writing is that he is able to capture a cross-section of the country, good and bad, big themes and personal moments, in what is a relatively slim book.He is critical of politics (\\"I find out of long experience that I admire all nations but hate all governments.\\"), sometimes disillusioned by what he sees as the loss of American culture (\\"We have exchanged corpulence for starvation, and either one will kill us.\\"), and wary of progress:\\"American cities are like badger holes, ringed with trash--all of them--surrounded by the piles of wrecked and rusting automobiles, and almost smothered with rubbish.\\"But his faith in our goodness is bolstered time and again by personal encounters with folks at roadside campsites, lakes and veterinary offices. He frequently invites strangers to his camper to share a whisky or coffee, picks up hitchhikers to pick their brains, and has amusing encounters with a cast of characters that might populate a modern Canterbury Tales.\\"I can only suspect that the lonely man peoples his driving dreams with friends, that the loveless man surrounds himself with lovely loving women, and that children climb through the dreaming of the childless driver.\\" Steinbeck has Charley, the perfect companion, sometimes observing in bemusement the mysteries of human civilization, sometimes disinterested, sometimes engaging Steinbeck in fully-rendered conversations as 10,000 miles unfold under them.\\"One goes, not so much to see but to tell afterward,\\" Steinbeck reflects on the American traveler. What Steinbeck tells here is the story of who we are, an invaluable portrait that captures our complicated, idiosyncratic character, as true today as it was fifty years ago. Charley's conclusion, after much experience, is less nuanced: \\"I've seen...a quickly vanishing look of amazed contempt, and I am convinced that basically dogs think humans are nuts.\\""},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Read this first when I was a kid, and just re-read it now.

Travelling with Steinbeck and his poodle Charley you get to experience a slice of American life that is sadly no more. You get his usual rich imagery and ability to conjure up a scene in blazing brilliance as he travels across America from New York to California and back again. I find his style to be immediately comfortable and evocative to read and his descriptions are simple, yet wonderful. For example, when describing autumn leaves he writes \`The climate changed quickly to cold and the trees burst into colour, the reds and yellows you can't believe. It isn't only colour but a glowing, as though the leaves gobbled the light of the autumn sun and then released it slowly', simply breath taking writing. This story is all the more endearing as it is mixed in with tales of his relationship with Charley and how they interact together out on the road. I am a huge fan of Steinbeck and I have to say this sits highly in his body of work. It is concise, eloquent, descriptive, engaging and a whole host of other words that escape my vocabulary to describe his incredible writing style! This is a departure from his earlier works, which are based around depression era America and the Salinas valley, but that takes nothing away from the style, skill and story on offer and this comes highly recommended indeed.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"If you are a Steinbeck fan, and I definitely am, you will want to read this book.

I love the way this book helps young people to get a glimpse of earlier times and the observations of the consequences of urbanization on society. This work displays Steinbeck's gift in all of his writing to create space and time for thoughtful reflection. Steinbeck's amazing ability to read deeply into the body language, mannerisms, and even the traces they leave behind in a hotel room, give us a glimpse of how this literary genius developed some of his greatest works."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I have previously read, \\"Travels With Charley\\".

It's about about an exciting travel across America made by Steinbeck and his french poodle, Charley. Although the book has been written since more than forty years ago, there are still some aspects that are found in the current society. The paint of America made by Steinbeck is so authentic, so real that it makes the reader dazzled, stimulates his curiosity and takes him to places that he might have never been.Steinbeck is a great observer. He describes everything so perfectly, from people to the american society; from the american society to the environment. By using a numerous figures of speeches, he gives to all his descriptions an attractive color which bring them alive. As an example, the way Steinbeck talks about the nature is just extraordinary.Steinbeck points his finger at the problems of America, and precisely the pollution caused the industrialization of the big cities. Also, he mentions one of the greatest problems that is ravaging the american society since ever, which is the problem of discrimination and racial conflict between Black and White. Personally, I was proud to read his perception about the problem, and the fact of considering himself as a cosmopolitan. In short, Steinbeck discusses with vigour a lot of delicate facts that are still found in today's society.Therefore,&quot;Travels With Charley&quot; still has its place in the in this new generation.Although I reproach Steinbeck for his tendency to include too many details for things or events which are not important( discussions with charley...), I still think it's a good book to read because you can discover the genius of an author that can make you discover the beauty of a country."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"With the knowledge that a trip evolves and causes the traveler to evolve with time, John Steinbeck set out across America in his waning years. In his most noted work of non-fiction, Steinbeck ultimately discovers that there are more similarities than dissimilarities in Americans.Steinbeck's writing lacks a genuine plot as he documents the places he visits in \\"Travels with Charley\\". His writing portrays itself in a manner best described as stream of conscious. Readers that find this writing style irritating will think less of the book. The unique aspects of the book include getting to see Steinbeck as his own main character and the wit that accompanies the role.Steinbeck emerges from New York with the intent of rediscovering the Americans he spent a lifetime writing about. With his travel companion the French poodle Charlie, Steinbeck continues through the Midwest, visiting places he has not seen in years. When Steinbeck arrives in his beloved California, he discovers how much has changed since he grew up there. It is a disturbing sight to see the land that you loved has passed. From the far west, Steinbeck circles through Texas and the south. It is in the south that he observes the racial prejudice of the south first hand in the civil rights movement.While this is not my favorite work of Steinbeck, it holds up well to the standard of his works of fiction. The one question of the book that I am most curious is whether the book sold enough copies to pay for his trip. I suspect that it did."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"After reading &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, &quot;Travels With Charley&quot; was irresistable to me. It is a treat to read Steinbeck's observations as he travels America some 20+ years after the terrible times he chronicled in &quot;Grapes&quot;.The voice is still there but a bit softened with the wisdom that passing years bequeath. Make no mistake, he still is angry with injustice. But Steinbeck writes with a wonderfully appealing gentleness and depth of compassion as he converses with his fellow citizens. Plus he writes with remarkable skill and grace.An artist has time to &quot;ponder&quot; and consider currents, circumstances and feelings in ways most simply find near-impossible in the busy world of &quot;bringing home the bacon.&quot;Steinbeck is an artist of the highest order.It is a gift to be able to listen to what this artist discovers - in himself and the country he loves.The time and circumstances of 1960 come alive as vibrant history, while the observations and writing of John Steinbeck will register as relevant for all times.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"The best of writers, and no one could have written this better. It survives the decades since it's been written as still being relevant in the new century. I never tire of reading Steinbeck, and i never tire of reading of his adventure with his old dog."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Steinbeck's novels are some of the most powerful statements about American culture available on the planet. But who knows the writer? Travels with Charley lets readers get to know John Steinbeck, how he thinks, what he believes in, all with great wit and intimacy. Steinbeck is a very funny man. I even learned a new respect for poodles. What else could you want in a book?"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Travels with Charley is a must read. A delightful and insightful journey in Steinbeck fashion. His faithful companion Charley, a poodle with a personality, lends humor to his trek across America. Enjoyed it very much!!"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Travel with Charley in Search of AmericaTravel with the Charley is my first book for reading. I never ever read John Steienbick's book before. I like this book vary much. He wrote this book forty years ago but it still look like he wrote it today. I believe Steinbeck's has a skill and experience of yesterday and make it seems like today. It was very exited to read about packing of his trip, custom made car that he called Rocinate. He was the man; his dog, his truck and three months travel across America. It was very funny and exciting about going out and discovers America with dog. He traveled across the state in large circle from New York to Main to Illinois to Washington, California, Texas and further south. As he traveled, he meets with the people along the way and describe them in vary short paragraph. His observation and opinion about every thing from antiques, small towns, American language, interstate system, hunters, trash and many others items and also he made clear statement about how different New England peoples from others. John Steinbeck's also noted subtle regional difference of American people and realize that American south is different than the rest of America. Overall Travel with Charley is an interesting book that present John Steinbeck's idea in a unique and effective way.To see the Travel with Charley as just an interesting side of American is to miss the point. Mr. John Steinbeck's was present a number of important historical events in American life, while he was travelling toward the southern state during their trouble time of integration. He witnesses people and event during the time of integration school. He also recorded the rise of motor hotel beside of road and towns. He also appreciated with the modern interstate system and small roadside towns throughout the nation."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Steinbeck is brilliant and Sinise is amazing.

Not I! The quality of the product however is high and the produce handling unequaled. Thanks"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This book could have just as easily been called, \\"Travels with Charley, in Search of John Steinbeck\\" in my opinion. I absolutely loved it, and felt like it was filled with lighthearted, innocent humor.The way he talks about Charley as though the dog is smarter than the master is just hilarious. Steinbeck has a way of personifying his pet, without the pet ever having its voice heard throughout the book. It's very clever and is always good for a little chuckle.Aside from the man/dog social interactions that serve as the comic relief, this account of Steinbeck's lap across the country in the early 1960s reveals much about the character of Americans back then, but even more than that it reveals quite a bit about John Steinbeck himself. He seemed to look for patterns or trends in American behavior in various parts of the country, and it helps those who have always loved his prose to see just how he picked apart society and translated his findings into detailed written accounts that are as fun to read as they are vivid.I am glad that I didn't read this story as one of my first Steinbeck books, or I am afraid I wouldn't have appreciated it nearly as much as I did after having read most of his great literary works. I wouldn't urge anybody to read this if they are not familiar with the author already, because he has many more impactful and poetically written books than this, and Travels with Charley is really more of a glance at Steinbeck and America, through his very own eyes and interpretation, as opposed to a story that displays the true poetic genius that he really was.This is a great book, and well worth the read, but wait until you get to know his work better before you pick this one up. It is a fantastic book nonetheless, but you'll enjoy it more that way."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Steinbeck seems right at home telling a good traveling story, the pleasure and interest he felt while completing this odyssey comes across in his prose. The book feels like a good story told by a friend over lunch (albeit much longer): a compilation of activities and destinations interspersed with commentary and recollection of individual interactions. This roundabout quality makes it easy to read and absorb, but at times leaves the story without a central driving theme or idea. The beginning and the end are the two sections that seem most coalesced, but at no point does the book drag.I found Travels with Charley to be a book I could spend five minutes on or an hour on and take something away. Some sections could be read straight through and not feel weary. I doubt many would want to read the book in one sitting, many parts need time to mull over and the style sometimes becomes a bit stale and I found it better to come back later when I found it fresh."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"In 1965 I read this book as a just graduated high school kid who was about to begin my own journey with Charley; this Charley, however, was considerably different in demenor as well as appearance--this Charley was a Lithuanian priest.My friend had helped Charley doing odd jobs around our parish in a small town in California and as a means to pay him for this help my friend and one of his friends was offered the chance to accompany Charley on his annual trip to Chicago to visit his relatives. This was our \\"big\\" trip because neither one of us had traveled so far and we loved the chance of seeing America and Canada and we needed only to share the driving and the gas money. John Steinbeck's travel masterpiece accompanied me across the States and the used copy I received from Amazon recently had the same cover as well as the original price, 75 cents in early sixties money, as the beloved copy that traveled with me all those years ago.As Forrest Gump said, \\"I am not a smart man...\\"; I do not have the writing skills to speak of Steinbeck's literary genius but I do believe I know quality when I read it and this is the epitome of travel writing in my humble opinion. Steinbeck, although traveling across a continent, manages to entrall his reader with prose about very few specifics. Of course he has many interesting encounters with many differnt people but I felt that the brilliance of this book is to elaborate on the commonness of the travel experience in so many instances. Perhaps this is the genus of Steinbeck; he can elevate the ordinary through his writing to become the extraordinary. I am reminded of Seinfeld's comic brilliance--he took the commonplace of life and also endowed it with specialness,There are many examples of Steinbeck's ability to work this magic: the pages describing Charley's confrontation with his first bear; later, Steinbeck's disappointment when Charley was not impressed by his first Redwood tree; Steinbeck's description of the harsh beauty of the Arizona desert and finally, his dificulties with aspects of race in the early Sixtie's South. Although these were specifics, Travels with Charley was stitched together by pages of beautiful prose that rested on little besides the author's massive ability to meld words.This is a book to be savoured; a book to reread favourite passeges and a book, therefore, to be treasured. I hugely recommend it to all travelers, regardless of distances traveled."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I just finished the book and it was a fantastic read. It was a fairly \\"light\\" book, considering the author; it was genuinely hilarious at times, and, as always, Steinbeck created an incredibly vivid, personal, and accurate portrait of the relationships between nature and society. Shades of his earlier can be seen in the prose style, and his unconditional devotion to the creation and development of images and characters can't be matched by anyone from any time.As far as a \\"Travel-style\\" novel is concerned, I think I liked this one more than Kerouac's On the Road...but, then again, Steinbeck was far more talented than any of the Beats -except Ginsberg (who might've been in his league, but in a junior-varsity-type capacity) and maybe Neal Cassidy.If you like Steinbeck, you will really enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"traveling across america in 1960 with a man and his dog. awww, for the wanderlust in all of us and too live it via john steinbeck. each turn more exciting than the other......yet was 3 months enough time? i think not!"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Travels with Charley was one of the inspirational books that lead me to write \\"Hobo-ing America.\\"Hobo-Ing America: A Workingman's Tour Of The U.S.A.I had always read travel books. Everybody from Mark Twain to George Orwell. But Travels with Charley (his dog) ranks right up there in the inspiration category for me. I had always longed to travel America but I could never afford to do it. Finally my wife Carol and I took off with about $2,400 and a van with a homemade bed in the rear and hit the road. We paid our way by picking fruits and vegetables and we stayed on the road living under bridges and equipment shelters for a number of years. Carol says that it was the best time of her life. I am still hoping that the best time hasn't come yet. Though my time is running low.I guess that the whole point of this review is that it was books like Travels with Charley that made our adventure a reality.

I didn't know what it was about when I started reading, but after a few pages Steinbeck caught my attention with his way of writing. I was really impressed how he described his feelings towards the journey. After reading &quot;Of mice and men&quot; I had to correct the view I had of John Steinbeck. The way he describes people is just amazing. I mainly read the book to compare the characters I meet during my year in Kansas with those in the book. But not just the people intested me, also how much the society has changed in 40 years. And I was surprised. Steinbeck previewed several themes that are of importance nowadays. for example the enviromental pronlems we have. Also the lack of interest in political matters. But without Charley the book would never be what it is. One laughs about him(yellostone national Park) but one the other hand one suffers when Charley feel bad. I liked to read the book, because it is written in an easy to understad language. That' why I rated the book 5."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"In our ongoing struggle to develop an American identity that extends beyond CocaCola and denim jeans, we have forgotten what makes us a nation. Steinbeck alludes to a few of those American traits, but never makes a clear statement. The observations are vague at times, but consistent with his belief that each of us should find America on our own.Because &quot;Travels&quot; is a collection of events, it was hard to stick with. I found that I was easily distracted by the nearest interruption. But just as easy as the book was to set down, I was never lost when I picked it up again. And when I continued, each episode had a valuable insight into Steinbeck's America.If you stick with it, you'll find a few of his observations provoking. From the outset, Steinbeck insists that his observations were merely his, and that his experiences were unique.The most important entries are saved for the end as he visits a racially segregated South on the verge of bursting. Steinbeck's exhaustion with the situation mirrors the pain that many of us feel today as race relations continue to make headlines across our nation."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"First I must admit to a certain bias here. I travel a lot, I travel with a dog as a companion and I enjoy reading this particular author. I was doing all of this long before this book was published and continue to do so to this date. I can relate to this work! That being said, this is one of those books that I have reread several times over the years, and year after year, I find that Steinbeck's observations contunue to be relevant. This is a very easy reading book. I do need to point out to a number of other reviewers though, that this is NOT a novel(despite what his son said)! It is a travel book and it takes a look at parts of our country seen through the author's eyes. It is interpreted through the author's past expierences and how he preceives the world. I am sure that any ten (or one hundred) people could take the same trip and we would come up with ten (or one hundred) different stories and interpretations of those stories. I shared some of his opinions and agree with some of his observations...others I did not. That is what makes life so wonderful and why it is always good to read, or better yet, talk to others, and agree or disagree, enjoy their views. I certainly cannot fault the author's usage of language, syntax and organization. It is all good solid Steinbeck. This is one of those books that can be read on several levels. You can read it as a social commentary of that particular time in America, or, as I do, you can relax and enjoy the ride with the author. As a side note: I do note that many of the younger readers appear to feel this work is boring. I can see where this might be the case when you consider the movies, T.V. etc. of this day and age. I might suggest though, that you give it another read in a few years. Perhaps you will look at it differently. I know I have expierence that with other works by different authors. All in all, recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This book got me obsessed with John Steinbeck. I'd read Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men in high school and enjoyed them for their realism and eloquent characterizations. Also, knowing how much of Steinbeck's work reveals an active social conscience, I figured his &quot;search of America&quot; would have to be intriguing. And I was right. Steinbeck's travelogue is beautiful, witty, and highly observant. Travels With Charley takes the detailed autobiographical leanings of Walden or the Autobiography of Ben Franklin, adds the unpredictability of the best road stories, and throws in at least one great, classic, funny one-liner every few pages. By the time I finished this book, I could picture Steinbeck as one of the greatest traveling companions one could want. Another sign that his work his successful: now I want to read more by him. In the middle of Cannery Row right now. Thanks, Mr. Steinbeck."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Travels with Charley is a book that could not be written by any living writer. To write such a book requires the possession of a deeply ingrained curiosity about and love of people, a remarkable command of the English language, enough years under the belt to vividly recall a time when things were not as the are now, a hearty and tenacious grasp of life, and a sense adventure. It is difficult to imagine a modern novelist undertaking such a quest. Just think of it, Toni Morrison travelling about the country in a pickup with her dog (or cat for that matter), stopping at truck stops, camping in parks, and sleeping in roadside motels, all the while blending into the background, appearing as just an average Joe (or Josephine) so as to get a true picture of the land and its people and recording it all without once making a psychologically revealing admission. They just don't make them like ol' John anymore. More's the pity.To see the book as just an interesting slice of Americana is to miss the point. Mr. Steinbeck was present at a number of important historical events in the life of America, especially during his travels through the southern states during their turbulent time of integration. He witnessed the integration of a school with all its protests and he recorded it without political posturing, without ulterior motive, simply as a witness to the people and the event. He described the birth of the modern interstate system and chronicled the effects it was beginning and could be expected to have on the small roadside towns throughout the nation. He recorded the rise of the motor hotel and the advent of the recreational vehicle. These may not seem significant now, but think how ubiquitous they have now become. Can you really imagine traveling by automobile these days without seeing a camper or motor home, or passing a Motel 6?Mr. Steinbeck also chronicles the more subtle aspects of American life - the homogenization of both the country's language and its food, the form, style, and purpose of religion in America, and the mind of the people. This last is perhaps the most interesting. Along with John Dos Passos and Studs Terkel, Mr. Steinbeck has given us a great gift by having taken the time simply to talk with people and record what they said. Not what the policy makers and captains of industry said, but what Bill and Mary Jones of Cedar Rapids said. He had the restraint to listen, to follow along in conversations rather than to lead them. This in itself is not only a lost art, but a lost character quality among our nations people, especially our intellectuals and artists.This is not only a book that should be read, it is a book that should be loaned. Loan it to everyone you know. I myself own three copies just to have two to loan to others. The book is that good and that important. We will not have another writer of such quality; let us therefor take all the more effort to appreciate his life's work."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Forced in high school to read Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" \\"Cannery Row\\" and \\"Tortilla Flats\\"--and hating all three--I was reluctant to buy a Steinbeck book. But since I was going on my own road trip across America I was desperate to read anything on the topic, and was suprised to love Steinbeck's writing, who, to me, is better at non-fiction. His powerful, punch-between-the-eyes sentences left me stunned and blinking, and wondering if I really know my fellow Americans. (Afterwards I got his later book on America, [I forget the title]--also very good).When telling people about his journey, he writes,\\"I saw something in thier eyes I was to see over and over again in every part of the nation: a burning desire to go, to move, to get underway, anyplace away from HERE.\\"True. I saw that, too. The desire to take to the open road beats in every heart.Some reviewers say that the book is depressing, but I didn't find it so. It gave me the courage to take my own trip, especially when I read these words,\\"I had seen so many begin to pack their lives in cotton wool, smother their impulses, hood their passions, and gradually retire from their manhood into a kind of spiritual and physical semi-invalidism. In this they are encouraged by wives and relatives, and it's such a sweet trap.\\"That did it! I quit my job and went on my own journey. I cherish this book."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I first read this book when I was 12. At the time I thought it an entertaining book about a man I had never heard of an his journey across America. 4 years later I reread and rediscovered the book. The years have given me a new perspective on this book. Unlike Kerouc's solopsistic and dated &quot;On the Road&quot;, Steinbeck writes with a genuine love of this country. He chronicles details with a writers flair but without the subtle arrogance of a book like &quot;Making of the President, 1960&quot;. Steinbeck is distinguished in his eye for detail, he movingly tells of a small black girl being walked to school, her tiny, gloved, hand clutched inside that of a burly officer. Charley provides a light tone to the book amid telling commentary on the nature of America and such social trends as our migration to the suburbs. In summary, a compelling tale told in a loving fashion about idiosyncratic, genuinely decent people."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"To me, John Steinbeck is the great voice of twentieth century America. There is not an author that is more distinctly American. To read the thoughts of this great man directly is an indescribable pleasure. After reading Travels With Charley, I feel more personally aquainted with the writer who for years has been my favorite. Anyone who has an interest in the study of what makes Americans American should read this book. I love all of Steinbeck's books, and this may very well be my favorite. (For the record, my other Steinbeck favorites are East of Eden, Cannery Row, and The Pastures of Heaven)"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Most people reading this will undoubtedly know the background story behind John Steinbeck's Travels With Charley.In 1960, Steinbeck decided that he had lost touch with America and wanted to re-discover the country. So he bought a 3/4 ton pick up and a camper unit and set off, accompanied by his dog Charley, on a three month trip through the United States.Travels With Charley was the travelogue he wrote about his trip. It's a classic; this is one of those books that will still be around a century from now.This unabridged audio book version of Travels With Charley is really well done.I have a 40 minute highway commute to work and I usually fill the time listening to audio books. I thoroughly enjoyed this one."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I first read this travelogue as a teenager shortly after it first came out and ever since I always think of it when taking long car trips myself. The book is the most honest one I've read about the PROCESS of taking a lengthy motor trip - the excitement at the beginning, the enthusiasm for what is first encountered on the road (it's not a surprise to me that Steinbeck's most detailed and tantalizing writing occurs while in New England and the upper Midwest, his first \\"stops\\"), and then the gradual and finally very sudden and absolute realization, often when still far from home, that the trip is over, caput, no longer any fun. He works through that classic process perfectly. Touring the country in a counter-clockwise direction brought him to the deep South last, which was a depressing experience for Steinbeck, and surely accelerated his wish to be done with the trip. (I've always wondered how different the book might have been if he had gone in the opposite direction.)Throughout the book Steinbeck has maintained a good balance between his own observations and those of people he meets along the way. Encounters with hitchhikers, merchants, motel keeps, and others one is likely to meet as a stranger passing through are related in short vignettes, and they don't overpower or skew the narrative. Likewise, Steinbeck is not interested in relating the history of any particular area - there is not the faintest odor of scholarship after-the-fact in the book. His only purpose in making the trip seems to be to satisfy a life-long urge to be someplace else; perhaps in doing so he will feel the pulse of the country (he gives that as his reason for the journey), but even that seems secondary to the desire just to be moving. There are no preconceived notions, no axes to grind; like his dog Charley he will take things as they come. Steinbeck's steely writing skills shine brightly here, too, and it's a delight to read his descriptions and impressions. It's a wonderful American travel book, and I'm glad Steinbeck, at 60, made the trip."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I start this review through caveat by saying, Steinbeck happens to be my favorite American writer. I read \\"Travels with Charley,\\" early on in life because my parents swore up and down on his worth as a writer, our family had blazed through California on another memorable family vacation and dropped by Monterey for the express purpose to see where Cannery Row had been set. So, that's where I'm coming from. After re-reading \\"Travels with Charley,\\" as an adult, I find it odd that a child would have read the book and enjoyed it. Well, there is the writing convention of the man and a dog take a journey across the United States Don Quixote style which a child would find appealing but trust me...this is no child's book.I struggled to give this 3 stars, but my expectations run high for any Steinbeck work and this is not his best. From the one's I have read so far, \\"Travels with Charley\\" is running behind the middle of the pack. It's a worthwhile read. Steinbeck sets out from New York in a camper pick-up with his French Poodle Charley and searches out the America he fears he doesn't know any longer. He finds some wonderful and beautiful things, but also encounters a dark countenance among some of the people which he finds off-putting and sends him to writing off the trip through much of the Southwest and Southeast. The racism he encounters in the South in 1962 is largely responsible for this feeling that pervades the book, that Americans though approachable and still hopeful, have sides and personalities that are none too redeeming when put to Steinbeck's observations.Rich parts of this book are his observations of people and places. He loves Wisconsin and finds its beauty a brand new discovery at the age of 59. He extols the virtues of Montana. Readers who are interested in Steinbeck's life and influences will find his observations of San Francisco and the Salinas valley quite engaging. His chapter on Texas and Texans is simply divine wit and I found (having been raised a Texan myself)it rollicking good fun. His observations are poignant, cutting, and downright funny. Steinbeck says, \\"When I started this narrative, I knew that sooner or later I would have to have a go at Texas, and I dreaded it. I could have by-passed Texas about as easily as a space traveler can avoid the Milky Way,\\" and he is just getting started. You will have to read the rest. Many of the observations seem to be lifted our of the notes of a Robert Earl Keen or Townes Van Zant song.\\"Travels with Charley,\\" as any Steinbeck works, is a worthwhile read. But if you are itching to read a top-notch travelogue or wanting to divulge in the best of Steinbeck's works I'd suggest you start elsewhere.--MMW"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This is just a shadow of Steinbeck's best. I had hoped for brilliant insight into the character of America. In fact, Steinbeck engaged with rather few people, and most of these were only marginally interesting. By the end of the book, Steinbeck admitted to himself, and also his readers, that his effort to find the real America was not successful."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"When I was a teenager, I read a lot of John Steinbeck - Of Mice and Men (1937), The Grapes of Wrath (1939), The Moon is Down (1942), Cannery Row (1945), and East of Eden (1952). The last Steinbeck book I bought was Travels with Charley - In Search of America (1962). I remember taking it to my first real job when I was 18 and being laughed at by the workmen for reading it at lunchtime. The cover looked \\"fruity\\" - a jaunty drawing of a man in a green truck riding with a French poodle. Reading matter at work consisted of girly magazines and Louis L'Amour novels. I must have been one o' them there tinker bells or somethin' reading a book like that.The title was a bit silly, though, wasn't it? I lost momentum and didn't finish. Twenty years later, I got another copy, having read that Travels with Charley represented a classic piece of travel literature, that most satisfying yet most unrecognized of genres. And who knew Steinbeck wrote other travelogues? Who has heard of his Sea of Cortez (1941), a report about a voyage from California to Mexico, or A Russian Journal (1948), where he heads off for a snoop around the Soviet Union?Born and raised in California, where many of his novels are set, John Steinbeck spent the second half of his life in New York City, with frequent trips to England and France. At the age of 58, after a couple of strokes, he lit out from his home in Sag Harbor, Long Island with his (also) ailing poodle, Charley, to refamiliarize himself with America, its land and people. In a letter to a friend, he outlined his method of travel and his route.\\"In the fall - right after Labor Day - I'm going to learn about my own country. I've lost the flavor and taste and sound of it. It's been years since I have seen it. Sooo! I'm buying a pick-up truck with a small apartment on it... bed, stove, desk, ice-box, toilet - not a trailer - what's called a coach. I'm going alone, out toward the West by the Northern way....\\"And that's what he did. In the truck he named Rocinante, which he painted on its side, he and Charley drove to Massachusetts and then to Maine before hitting Wisconsin, Minnesota, Montana.... With a stockpile of booze, he rode around the United States in a giant circle recording conversations, observations, reflections, and offering up delectable vignettes of natural beauty. He writes, \\"I was told that a stranger's purpose in moving about the country might cause inquiry or even suspicion. For this reason I racked a shotgun, two rifles, and a couple of fishing rods in my truck, for it is my experience that if a man is going hunting or fishing his purpose is understood and even applauded.\\"Much of what was man-made in America disturbed Steinbeck. He was horrified and angered by the pollution, industrial ugliness, uniformity of communities, soulless trailer parks, and much else. He was also annoyed by people's attitudes towards race and difference.Where Steinbeck really shines is in his description of the landscape. Setting was crucial in Steinbeck's novels and he's almost showing off, proving to skeptics he still has it. He characterizes Montana as \\"a great splash of grandeur,\\" and talks about its terrain as \\"shouting color.\\" Mere samples; he can go on for whole pages, molding topography until the ear hears poetry and the mind sees a portrait. Consider this impression of California's redwoods.\\"There's a cathedral hush here. Perhaps the thick soft bark absorbs sound and creates silence. The trees rise straight up to zenith; there is no horizon. The dawn comes early and remains dawn until the sun is high. Then the green fernlike foliage so far up strains the sunlight to a green gold and distributes it in shafts or rather in stripes of light and shade. After the sun passes zenith it is afternoon and quickly evening with a whispering dusk as long as was the morning.\\"Travels with Charley is nice read - witty, poignant, lyrical - but did its author pull a Bruce Chatwin? Chatwin, a British writer of considerable talent, best known for his In Patagonia, was a first-class fraud. His writing is largely fiction passed off as travel literature. The New York Times thinks Steinbeck embroidered. So does Steinbeck's son, also named John, who said that the conversations in Travels are bogus and that his father hardly talked to anyone. \\"He just sat in his camper and wrote all that (expletive).\\"There's a discussion between Steinbeck and a New England farmer about Nikita Khrushchev's famous shoe-brandishing incident.Steinbeck says, \\"What happened at the U.N.? I forgot to listen.\\"\\"You wouldn't believe it,\\" he said. \\"Mr. K. took off his shoe and pounded the table.\\"\\"What for?\\"\\"Didn't like what was being said.\\"\\"Seems a strange way to protest.\\"\\"Well, it got attention.\\"The chat continues for a page and a half. The only problem, according to Charles McGrath in his 2011 article \\"Reality Check for Steinbeck and Charley,\\" is that this conversation occurs several weeks before Mr. Khrushchev spoke at the United Nations. McGrath notes several other discrepancies and claims Steinbeck did a lot of the trip with his wife, Elaine, who, in the story, Steinbeck meets briefly in Chicago. Moreover, Steinbeck (and, perhaps, his wife) didn't rough it all that much. He (or they) not only stayed in motels (which he acknowledges), but luxury hotels.With this in mind, the conversations in Travels seem stilted. I noticed this, but chalked it up to being the vernacular of the times. I now see that it's a bit like dialogue one would find in, well, a John Steinbeck novel.Vrai ou faux, Travels with Charley quickly became a bestseller (and is still popular, with over 200 peer reviews on Amazon.com), allowing readers to get a glimpse into the literary icon's curmudgeonly yet sensitive personality.The year this book was published happened to be the same year Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for literature. During his acceptance speech in Sweden, Steinbeck said, \\"the ancient commission of the writer has not changed. He is charged with exposing our many grievous faults and failures, with dredging up to the light our dark and dangerous dreams for the purpose of improvement.\\"A tiny bit of embellishment is sometimes required in travel writing. But outright invention certainly constitutes grievous fault and failure. John Steinbeck's Travels with Charley is an American beauty, though perhaps not a natural beauty.Troy Parfitt is the author of Why China Will Never Rule the World"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I am 64 years old and highly educated, yet I had never read Steinbeck before picking up \\"Travels with Charley\\" at an airport bookstore a few weeks ago. What a master wordsmith the man was - this memoir flows so smoothly, revealing simple truths as well as life's subtleties throughout. It is as fresh and timely today as when written 50 years ago. I know most of you already have experience with and set opinions about this icon. For those as ignorant as I was about Steinbeck, I am glad that it is never too late to be rewarded."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I recently read what may have been my first Steinbeck novel (Cannery Row). Better late than never. I enjoyed it and was inspired to read more by the author; TRAVELS WITH CHARLEY was my next choice. One of the reasons for selecting it was that it describes a trip taken exactly 50 years ago this fall.The book is a narrative of the author's 1960 cross-country trip with his French poodle, Charley, in a custom-built recreational vehicle. Steinbeck would have been 58 at the time. After a brief introduction, he spends most of the book (160 pages) describing the Long Island, New York to California part of the trip, with the return stretch receiving only about 45 pages. Steinbeck tells his readers his purpose in undertaking the journey was \\"to try to learn something of America.\\" (By \\"America\\" he, as with so many others, before and since, means the US.) While the Amazon format prohibits an exhaustive discussion of what he learned, I've selected next a few of his thoughts that struck me as interesting or perceptive.Early on he points out \\"we know so little of our own geography\\", an observation which, even today, would probably be seconded by just about any Geography or History teacher in the country. He adds \\"and another thing I had conveniently forgotten was how incredibly huge America is.\\" Yes. Try driving from one ocean to the other if you doubt this. On another subject he finds easterners (those from New England, New York, Pennsylvania) rather close-mouthed. Not until he gets into Ohio does this change. Of the Dakota Bad Lands he writes: \\"This is one of the few places I have ever been where the night was friendlier than the day.\\" Intriguing.Steinbeck gushes about Montana. If only it had some big water he'd love to live there! He also truly loves the Pacific redwoods, which of course are located close to his home area. There is a ten page chapter on Texas and Texans, and I'm curious what the reaction to this was in that state. (Texans reading this are welcome to comment.)By the time he reached California the author postulated that Amricans were definitely more similar than different, and that regional speech was in the process of disappearing -- with television a big factor in this. He made attempts to talk to lots of people (in churches, restaurants, bars) as he traveled and was slightly disappointed in the lack of interest in (or at least disinclination to discuss) the current presidential election campaign between Kennedy and Nixon.While I would have liked a map showing his route, this is a minor shortcoming. I strongly recommend the book. It's fast reading, timeless, and keeps you wondering about what is coming next.Tim Koerner November 2010"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Travels with Charlie was the first book I picked for my new Kindle and my first non-fiction book by John Steinbeck.It is a fantastic book as a travel memoir that really gives the reader a glimpse into the person that was John Steinbeck. I've always been a fan of his works although my breadth in reading his work has been limited to about 5 novels before this.Travels with Charlie is a chronicle of the writer's journey from his 1960's home in Long Island across the Northern U.S. to the home of his youth in Monterey County (Salinas and Monterey) in California, back home by way of the south.It is a relatively short book that perhaps provides the reader the best opportunity to get to know the person that was John Steinbeck. You'll find yourself a part of a journey just as you may have with the Grapes of Wrath only John and Charlie (his poodle) are your companions. Not only do you see the character of Steinbeck, you see the character of the U.S. at the beginning of the 1960's. The stories he tells, the people he meets, his interactions with Charlie are all fantastic.If I had to make any criticism of the book, it would be that as the story progresses, things get a bit more sparse. However, this isn't really so much a fault of the book as a loss of patience on Steinbeck's part. You get the feeling during the beginning that this trip is going long, and it does. A lot of detail goes into the trip through the northern part of the country. I am not sure it is too much detail, but as Steinbeck gets exhausted with the length of his trip, so does his writing. From the beginning, I was interested in what his commentary would be as he came back around. Unfortunately, given the length of his trip, he became more rushed and the commentary more sparse. That doesn't necessarily hurt things as there are some interesting items from the South to be read about, but it is too bad there isn't a bit more. The end is a little too abrupt for the quality of the overall book.Overall, it is a fantastic read, and the interactions with Charlie are really fantastic. He really does a fantastic job of showing the love that most people have for their dogs. I am thankful I gave this book a try as it really added to my admiration for John Steinbeck and gives the reader a window into a man who is obviously not perfect but is definitely respectable."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I have to admit that I did not choose this book because of a prior love of Steinbeck, nor even to learn something profound about America circa 1962. No, I chose this book because I wanted to know more about Charley, pure and simple. I was checking in books at my library and noticed the dog's photograph on the front cover, and for some reason I couldn't shake the feeling that he was a dog worth knowing. A week later I wandered over to the shelf and took the book home just so I could find out more about the wise looking Poodle.I was not disappointed in the dog. He had lovely quirks. What's not to love about a dog who goes about saying \\"Ftt\\" and who discovers in his old age that he is a mighty bear hunter? I was also not disappointed in Steinbeck. He is a writer of great insight and a person who carefully observes people. And the best part is that in his observations of others, Steinbeck reveals himself.The purpose of Steinbeck's cross-country journey (besides proving he was still capable of traveling alone at his age) was to reconnect to the American people. Steinbeck wanted to recapture what it meant to be an American, but what he ended up encountering was the vast array of personality that makes up this country.At times in his narrative Steinbeck tries to bring his experiences of different people into a place of commonality. For instance, he rather humorously states that all Americans have itchy feet because we are all descended from those people who were brave enough to strike out on their own (the assumption being that the quiet homebodies all remained in Europe). He \\"proves\\" this point by saying, \\"The pioneers, the immigrants who peopled the continent, were the restless ones in Europe. The steady rooted ones stayed home and are still there.\\" However, even in such a seemingly innocuous statement (this is a travel book after all) there are visible exceptions. All those old friends and family members who Steinbeck encounters in his hometown of Salinas were obviously rooted to one place. And the many restless wanderers he does run into are the kind of people one would expect to meet along the highways and in amongst the travel diners of America. If he had strayed into more obscure locations his findings may have been completely different.However, despite such jokes early on, Steinbeck is too insightful to simply force a definition of \\"American\\" on those he encounters just to make himself comfortable. That is what makes his short book so honest and interesting. He knows that he himself brings an element of bias into all of his observations. Indeed, some of the people who he found most distasteful may have been merely caught by him at the wrong time. I love that he is willing to acknowledge this, \\"I discovered long ago in collecting and classifying marine animals that what I found was closely intermeshed with how I felt at the moment. External reality has a way of being not so external at all.\\"Such an acknowledgment does not in any way diminish the power of Steinbeck's descriptions though. The waitress he encounters and finds so utterly distasteful may have been merely tired or struggling with a night of defeat, but none of that matters to us. What matters is that his description of her as one \\"who can drain off energy and joy, can suck pleasure dry\\" rings a bell with the reader. We all know of whom he is speaking. We have all met someone like this and have had these same irritated thoughts. It is a pleasure to hear such thoughts articulated so well.In fact, much of my pleasure in reading this book was in learning bit by bit about Steinbeck. His character unfolds with his observations and it grips the reader. When he deplores the waste he sees all around America's large cities one can't help but feel surprise. His statements are so out of sync with his time and yet would prove to be prophetic. His humorous description of local hunters and government officials at national borders reveal a delightfully dry wit. And yet this same wit is tinged with sadness as he describes the new breed of Americans who travel in mobile homes. He is able to see all that is being lost in America without building a shrine to the past, \\"Mother's cooking was with rare exceptions poor, that good unpasteurized milk touched only by flies and bits of manure crawled with bacteria, the healthy old-time life was riddled with aches, sudden death from unknown causes, and that sweet local speech I mourn was the child of illiteracy and ignorance.\\" It is a rare ability to be so honest about what was and still make a reader feel the loss of it.I know that much has been said of Steinbeck's experience in the South at the end of the book, and although it was obviously an emotionally draining time for him, and one that put a close to his trip, it was not the moment that stood out to me. For me, the significant moment in Steinbeck's travels was when he had the opportunity to kill two coyotes in the wild. He comes to that moment with years of training behind him. Steinbeck is not unfamiliar with a rifle and considers the killing of two coyotes to be a public service, and yet he does not kill them. Instead he observes them, becomes aware of their value in the arid desert, and leaves a small offering of food when he departs.For me, this wasn't merely a satisfying scene because I dislike the idea of blood sport, but because I think it represents his trip as a whole. Steinbeck set off to discover America and in the process he saw many people, both the ugly and the inspirational. We as readers are given the chance to share those experiences only because of Steinbeck's sensitivity to what he observed. Just as he spared the coyotes, animals that many considered vermin, he also saved the personalities he encountered and presented them to us for our own conclusions.In his introduction, Jay Parini states that Steinbeck, \\"refused, at last, the prophetic note that might have lifted Travels with Charley above the level of a merely charming and absorbing travelogue.\\" I couldn't disagree more. That is what I loved about this book. Steinbeck makes no great statement of truth that we all must swallow in order to join him and Charley. He leaves the conclusions to the reader. I think that is a strength in the book, just as I think it is a stronger choice to spare two lonely coyotes.I'm glad that Charley's wizened expression led me to this book. It was well worth reading."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"In this book, John Steinbeck shows patriotism at its best. He travels through the United States, and experiences all the beauties of this nation in a marvellous way. He shows no arrogance as he appreciates his homeland.

You golf right on the cliffs of the Pacific Ocean. The scenery is breathtaking. For any avid hacker, it's a golfer's paradise. Anyway, I had a 69 year old caddy who carried my golf bag (which I swear has a couple of bowling balls hidden in it somewhere.....it weighs a ton), up and down the hilly grounds of the golf course all day long without breaking a sweat......how'd he do that?!? At the end 18 holes, I was ready to plop down and have a brewski with the guys and ease my aching bones, while my 69 year old caddy was off to meet another golfer and pack that player's clubs another 18 hilly holes before his day was done. Anyway, he was a terrific gentleman and he loved to read. While we cruised the courses over a couple of days we resolved a lot of the worlds problems, and talked a lot about our favorite books. He said that I just absolutely had to read this novel as he felt it was his favorite book of all time. He was a huge Steinbeck fan. Soooo......I read this book because he said that I should, and I thank him for the recommendation.I've never read a Steinbeck novel before, even though I know he's considered one of the great American writers of all time. It's hard to believe this book was first published 45 years ago.....it's hard to believe how fast the time goes by. The difference in the writing style and the language used by the author compared to the verbal dreck that most authors get away with today is very evident. Steinbeck's vocabulary and use of words reminded me of the kinds of books that we were all forced to read when I was a student back in the dark ages.Basically, the book is a travelogue of Steinbeck's journey across America in a pickup truck and camper. He has his trusted companion \\"Charlie\\" (who is a full-sized poodle) sitting beside him throughout his several month's journey. Steinbeck made this trek because he wanted to know what America really was, rather than the pre-conceived notions he'd already had in mind. He found that there is no way to really describe our country in a specific way because of how vast and different each region of the country is. I think it took a lot out of him emotionally as he faced prejudice, witnessed racism in the South, the ratrace of the cities, and the virtues of small town values. Just as most of us tend to define the French or the English or any other nation with a specific identity and preconceived notions, I think Steinbeck had also hoped to define America and it's people in a specific, generic way, but I think that through his travels he found this country too complex and diverse to simply give a general definition for what a 'typical' American is. He found that there really isn't any such thing as a 'typical' American. I think he was probably worn out and frustrated at the end of his trip because he was not able to reach many conclusions that he had probably anticipated answering prior to his leaving.So anyway, he traveled across the country with Charlie, seeing old friends and making new ones. He visited his home town and found out that he could never really go home again.....things change, and people and places are never really quite like you remember them. Steinbeck was really quite a wild man, and he loved having his drink most anytime that he could get away with it. I loved his observations about life and the people around us. It was amazing how so many of today's problems were also yesterday's problems. It was fun to read a classic author again. I can't say this would be everybody's cup of tea, but I surely enjoyed most of the book.Bottom Line, I give the book a solid 4 Stars."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"If you love to travel, you will love this book.

I was surprised at the irony of the ending!! I highly recommend this book to everyone. After I read the book, I researched it. One of the things that I read included a comment by Steinbeck's son that said he believed his father was writing fiction, as Steinbeck actually would have been too shy to talk to all of the strangers he met along the way.

Steinbeck also went out of his way to witness and describe a particularly shameful episode of racism in New Orleans -- (...).

In the process he explores the very nature of travel, why so many of us are so drawn to it and how that affects our lives. Travels with Charley in Search of America is similar in some respects to Steinbeck's 1948 A Russian Journal, although here the writing is somewhat more about America than A Russian Journal was about Russia. This book is also very different in that here Steinbeck travels with his dog as his only companion, whereas A Russian Journal was about travels with Steinbeck's close friend Robert Capa.This book is a very thought-provoking and entertaining exploration of many aspects of America.

And second: his heart-rending description of the scenes he witnesses in segregated 1960's New Orleans, involving the women (\\"Cheerleaders\\") and their abusive treatment of a little black girl and her single white escort on her way to school.

Parachute pieces, as these things are called, are always going to be superficial. Now, mind you, John Steinbeck is no average reporter. I enjoyed this book and read it quickly, despite what I felt was a rather lacking story line. I enjoyed it because I enjoy Steinbeck's writing - his style, his observations and other things. I enjoyed it like I think I would enjoy taking a road trip with Steinbeck, a wonderfully compassionate but curmudgeonly man. I think the failure of the book is the failure of the idea - trying to sum up the nature of a big and complicated subject like \\"America\\" on a road trip is inevitably going come up short. The subject really becomes the writer's thoughts and personality - and Steinbeck does a great job making this an enjoyable if not terribly engaging or meaningful ride. He's also funny as hell. The exception to what I'm saying about this idea is Blue Highways. For some reason that book works at a level that Travels with Charley does not. I'm not sure why. I think it has a more heart.All that said, taking a trip with Steinbeck is certainly worth your while. If you enjoyed his novels, you'll get some insight into his character, if not a whole lot about \\"America.\\""},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I liked some of his other works better, but this one is OK.

Strangely I went into it thinking it to be a travelogue of places and things but it's much, much more. He journeys into the soul of America. His observations are still valid and universal.

Over all I enjoyed the book, only to be left feeling a bit resentful because of Stienbeck's use of &quot;Wet Backs&quot; when he refers to Mexican people. Stienbeck's recolections of his dog (Charlie) during this trip is a times humorous and makes one smile and feel good about the bond formed between man and his most loyal friend"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"He pours all of his heart, soul and everything he has left into this book. It is the last novel he wrote in his career. Many of the small essays concerning his experiences are very touching but also make you think. He somehow turns a subjects such as sleeping near a mountain into an adventure as he writes down every detail from the crack of a limb to the smell of whiskey from a nearby dump. He puts his life into perspective and what I found the most interesting was his struggle to comprehend age. He uses all off his writing tools from his creative metaphors to his fantastic descriptions. When reading this book you learn not only about this country but also Stienbecks writing style. He also give articulate opinions, not bland insults when he is describing places, people, or ideas that he doesn't like. But above all, he admits his errors willingly. Steinbeck started the book months before he even was on the road, but the journey had while he was planning it, so that is where he started the novel. It was over before he every reached home because there was a point in his travel where he just stopped thinking, and taking in all that was around him. But, the journey was over and there was nothing he could do about it because in Steinbeck's works, \\"You don't take the journey, the journey takes you.\\""},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I have recently finished reading John Steinbeck's Travels with Charley, and without thinking I can say two thumbs up. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best, I give it a solid nine. An old, experienced author, Steinbeck decides that he does not know enogh about the American world he has been writing about for so many years. Things have changed and he decides that he and his k9 friend Charley should go and have a new look at things. During his three month road trip in a well eqipped motor home Steinbeck experiences his country for what seems like the first time. From visiting his home town in California, camping on roadsides and visiting with stangers from state to state, Steinbeck learns Americans' perspective of their world and how they too cope with change. With the help of his French poodle Charley, Steinbeck discovers his constancy in a forever changing world. Sarah A.S."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. I have never read a book that used such diction in a way that made the reader feel as though they were going on the adventure with him. His explanations of the people and their way of life and ways of communication amoungst each other are immaculate in the fact that I have never read a book where the author says things like that and I can understand them. Overall, _Travels with Charley_ was one of the best books I have read in my high school career, and I hope that other students are required to read it or chose to read it too. G. Landers"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"For easy reading and lessons about life, I strongly encourage anyone who has the chance to read this book. Steinbeck, the most brilliant man, stops and makes the reader think about life and how simple it could be. He takes ordinary circumstances and finds humorous things arising from them. It astounds me how anyone could jump into a vehicle and travel across the United States learning about the different cultures and personalities of the American people. If you are in for an adventure and challenge for life, I strongly suggest reading this book. The easy, flowing style of writing makes it understandable and enjoyable to read. I guarantee that every reader will be satisfied with the lessons they learn from Steinbeck.

I believe that it was the style of writing that captured my attention. Steinbeck wrote in a manner that was conducive to quick, flowing reading making the book enjoyable and thought-provoking at the same time. With every turn of the page, Steinbeck brought forth a new and inventive way of looking upon the world around him. The way that he offers new outlooks on such a variety of subjects was enticing to me and kept the book in my hand and the pages turning. Therefore I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting a new challenge and aspect on life. Travis C."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"The past few weeks I have been reading Travels with Charley. But before I tell how I ranked it, first we must examine the parts that make up this book. No story line and a plot headed nowhere, like the winding roads, pretty well describes the writing style John Stienbeck used in his novel. This technique defines no barriers of pages, for Stienbeck's writing is not only words, but thoughts strung into ideas, which create the essence of memories. &quot;When the radio was on, music had stimulated memory of times and places...&quot; (74). This book worked in much the same way.If you haven't read Travels with Charley it begins with an incurable itch &quot;to be someplace else&quot; (3). Stienbeck was infected and had been so for as long as he could remember. Neither time nor maturity could cure him. So, against the will of his friends, he set out on a journey too not only cures his itch but also to rediscover America. All of his experiences on the road are common, everyday feelings like fear, loneliness and even the sheer joy of escape. I'm not sure that Stienbeck ever did find America, but he found something even better. He found the stuff that America is made of, people. Every where he went, he went out of his way to meet someone new and see America through someone else's eyes. &quot;I cannot commend this account as an America that you will find. So much there is to see, but our morning eyes describe a different world than do our afternoon eyes...&quot; (60).Nevertheless, I don't think that the point to his book was the journey. I think the point is taking a chance that he took. Everyone has an itch inside to do something or become something. This itch may be your destiny or your fate just waiting to be found. Taking Roctaine out on the open road all alone with only his old dog Charlie was chance that Stienbeck knew he had to take. I loved how whatever chances he took in life; he willingly faced the consequences. That was courageous and commendable. His irony ended the novel perfectly because after so long on roads he had never traveled when he finally reached the roads he knew he was perfectly lost. I guess you could say there's no place like home. Well, I definitely give this book a 10 because it was wonderfully written and a treat to read."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"In Travels With Charley, Steinbeck journeys through America wanting to redetermine what America is - its people and their dreams and beliefs. He provides deep insights throughout his adventure which he shares sometimes humorously and sometimes with sadness. Travels is not just a collection of events, but a wonderful saga that may be called the mosaic of America."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I definitely reccommend this book. This book is about John Steinbeck and his journey across America. His only companion is a dog named Charley, and he travels through the country meeting all sorts of people and visiting all sorts of places. Steinbeck's odd ideas and amusing opinions kept my attention throughout the entire book. So many things that Steinbeck talked about were things that I have experienced and could relate to with ease and amusement. The fluidity of his writing makes it easy to understand so the book moves quickly. I loved the comical style of his writing and often found myself laughing outloud. Also, Steinbeck's thinking is so logical. He often brings things to my attention that I may have normally overlooked. If you're ever in the mood for a little light reading I would definitly suggest this book to you. This page turner holds your interest and makes a hard day a lot easier to manage."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Later in his life as he reached the age of 60, John Steinbeck decided to take a trip cross-country from Maine to California and back again. He was looking for the average American and what that person was all about. Throughout the book, Steinbeck makes several comments that he could not find anyone that he could pin down as this fictitious average person. And instead, Steinbeck really found out about himself. Three months in a car with his long time friend and pet poodle, Charlie, Steinbeck began to see just how vast and dangerous this country must have been for the early settlers and explorers. Even with the \\"modern\\" conveniences of 1960, Steinbeck felt uncomfortable, lonely, and at times inconsolable. Near the end of the trip, he no longer looked forward to seeing anything but home.It is rare to get this type of glimpse into the earlier days of my life in America, so I enjoyed this short book describing my childhood days. Steinbeck foretold many concepts that were yet to occur but that he could \\"feel\\" coming: the continued move away from the cities and into suburbia, people not being able to discuss the political issues of the day, and even that America was getting a little soft.Near the end, Steinbeck the master is at hand as he describes his visit to the South just as the New Orleans Cheerleaders began their demonstrations at racial integration of the school system. Passion drips from the dialogue. Verbal points and counterpoints are injected as Steinbeck tries to come to grips with what just might tear the country apart. This section is vintage Steinbeck and is riveting reading. His fear of the unknown future is palpable. Unfortunately, this is not the way the rest of the book is handled.This is somewhat a rambling diary of Steinbeck that hits home on occasion and other times is just a piece of American history. I cannot say that the writing is superb or riveting - except near the end, but there is a comfortable pace to this book and overall I would recommend it to the over 50 year old crowd. I'd also recommend it to a younger person that is trying to find out what the country was like in 1960."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"(4.5 stars) When John Steinbeck obeys a life-long urge to drive from coast to coast in 1960, he little anticipates the variety of the \\"American experience.\\" Beginning in Maine and traveling along the northern states through Wisconsin, the Badlands, Montana, and all places in between, to Washington and Oregon, Steinbeck then decides to visit his childhood community of Salinas, in northern California. After meeting with friends there, though many have died, he then drives southward through the length of California and then eastward through the southwest desert to Texas, Louisiana, and eventually up to Virginia before returning to New York.Carrying the reader along with him as he reconstructs this journey for publication in 1962, Steinbeck observes people and human nature, being careful not to draw conclusions about an entire area based on the individuals he meets along the way. Often it is their reactions to Charley, his aging standard poodle, which stimulates their conversations and allows Steinbeck glimpses of their thinking and ways of life. From the terminally gloomy waitress in Maine to the evil-looking mechanic in Oregon (who turns out to be the kindest and most generous of men), Steinbeck explores attitudes toward life (and strangers). Steinbeck's high school buddy (who almost comes to blows with him) shows him that you really can't go home again, and \\"the cheerleaders\\" of New Orleans, a group of white-supremacist women who taunt and scream obscenities at a tiny black girl integrating one of their schools, shows him how much work the human race still has left to do.As he travels in his truck with a house attached to its bed (a pre-camper invention), he notes the changing landscape, the disappearance of treasured aspects of the environment, and the growth of new trends--including the increasing popularity of the mobile home and the contemporary loss of \\"roots.\\" He is genuinely frightened by the Badlands, until night falls, when it becomes beautiful. He adores Montana, and he hurries through the almost blank southwestern desert where he learns something new about shooting.

His observations of life in the early 1960s capture the country at pivotal moments of history--the time of Sen. John Kennedy and freedom rides. In this respect, Steinbeck creates a time capsule for future generations and a picture of himself that lovers of his writing will treasure. n Mary WhippleThe Winter of Our Discontent (Penguin Classics)Tortilla FlatJohn Steinbeck, Writer: A Biography"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"(4.5 stars) When John Steinbeck obeys a life-long urge to drive from coast to coast in 1960, he little anticipates the variety of the \\"American experience.\\" Beginning in Maine and traveling along the northern states through Wisconsin, the Badlands, Montana, and all places in between, to Washington and Oregon, Steinbeck then decides to visit his childhood community of Salinas, in northern California.

By the time Steinbeck was in his late 50s, he had begun to feel detached from ordinary Americans and their lives. He had built his reputation on telling the stories of everyday people, but thanks to the lifestyle changes his successful career had brought him, he was no longer confident he knew anything at all about how ordinary people spent their days or what they talked about. So he set off on a grand cross-country adventure, just him and his dog, Charley, to try to get back in touch with his readers and with himself. In preparation for the trip, he had a camper top custom built for his pickup, on which he bestowed the name Roscinante. In September of 1960, he and Charley set off in Roscinante from Long Island heading towards Northern Maine. In this book, Steinbeck recounts his and Charley's adventures with Roscinante, all the way from Maine to California and back to Long Island again.Although one of Steinbeck's main goals was to get in touch with ordinary Americans through this trip, the speed of the journey didn't really allow him any but casual contacts. At one point in the text, Steinbeck even acknowledges that this kind of travel writing will no doubt reveal much more about the personality and viewpoints of the author than any other people along the trip. It is when Steinbeck is on home ground in Northern California that he really hits his stride. In Monterey, he is not struggling to achieve meaningful contacts with strangers-instead, he has the time to explore the concept of home and friendship, and what happens to these essential elements of life when one moves away for good. His Thanksgiving visit with in-laws in Texas also takes us beyond the superficial anecdotes from other regions. Even though many of his interactions along the way were superficial, Steinbeck still found some provocative lessons to take from them, and made some very astute observations about American culture that still ring true today.Some of Steinbeck's most remarkable reporting comes from the Southeast, where he makes a special effort to witness the \\"Cheerleaders\\", who turned out daily to jeer the brave children and parents who dared to segregate the Louisiana schools. Looking back from today's vantage point, it's hard to believe that just forty years ago, Americans were so filled with hate and prejudice that such behavior was considered normal. It would be so easy to forget that such events ever happened, without descriptions such as the ones contained in this book."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"John Steinbeck witnesses a change in American society during the early 1960s. TRAVELS WITH CHARLEY IN SEARCH OF AMERICA is Steinbeck's autobiographical trek where he shows readers America's metamorphosis. For three months in 1960, Steinbeck and his faithful Blue colored Poodle, Charley, saw history in the making as he drove his camper, Rocinante, which he named after Don Quixote's horse, through the back roads and superhighways. The three travel along a similar route in which Lewis and Clarke may have taken, which directly leads towards the Northwest. However, the beginning of their journey takes them along the New England coast, and they drive through California; They further travel along the Southwest corridor, the deep South, and back up North to New York from where they began. One questions comes to mind, did he know that what he observed during his journey across this vast American landscape would be the seeds of change?The most pivotal aspect of the book is Steinbeck's account of history in the making. He observes an intense pre-Civil Rights era and five years after Brown vs. The Board of Education, which foreshadows an eminent change on the horizon for race and culture in the United States. He discovers that images and remnants of the America he knew during the Depression fading. But his past experiences while growing up in Salinas, California, has only served as a prerequisite to understanding the people he encountered along his trip.Steinbeck's simple language and vivid observations allows the reader to feel the experience. However, his observations raise pondering questions and thoughts. He describes several new technological innovations and modern infrastructures as if he was experiencing the inventions that appeared at the New York World's Fair of 1939 finally coming to life. When he describes automobile thruways and rest areas and vending machines, one wonders, has progress surpassed the time when life was simple in America? Steinbeck states: \\"Civilization had made great strides in my absence\\" (p. 70).The Centennial Edition of TRAVELS WITH CHARLEY includes the original proposed ending for Travels With Charley that had been omitted from the first 1962 Viking Press edition. The passage makes reference to John F. Kennedy's inauguration, but it is questionable why it was not included. Nevertheless, it is a somewhat fictitious and surreal passage that completes the story of Steinbeck's TRAVEL WITH CHARLEY.Overall, this book is engaging and may entice readers to further read and study the issues he discusses that have not disappeared from the time he wrote about them."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This is a beautiful litle book that John Steinbeckwrote about his observations of America in 1960s, butstill so relevant nowadays.

I picked it up a few weeks ago, and started reading. I almost feel I know Steinbeck personally now. I would definantly reccomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Travels with Charley offers a rare opportunity to simply spend some time with one of America's greatest writers. There is no structured plot, there is no in-depth look at a character's life, there is no symbolism. Instead we just ride along with Steinbeck as he travels across the country with his dog. We see things as Steinbeck sees the. We enjoy the scenery and sites that Steinbeck enjoys. And we make the mistakes that Steinbeck makes. The only character we get to know on this journey is Steinbeck himself, and he is a joy to behold. A lot of people often speculate on what famous characters they would like to have to dinner so they could engage in conversation with them instead of trying to get to know them through their work. Here, Steinbeck offers us the opportunity to not only have dinner with him, but to have lunch with him. To help him clean up his house. To lend a hand at changing a tire. We are allowed to see a genius up close and personal and to have him as a companion as we traverse the United States. This is something that no other author has ever offered, but I wish that every author did. Reading this book is like being allowed to read through Steinbeck's journal. We see his little slipups and we watch him engage in conversation with the people he meets. It is just Steinbeck's personality, which is warm, witty, smart and fun to be around. No pretenses, no art, just Steinbeck, his dog, and you taking a little trip across the country."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Do you remember ON THE ROAD by Jack Kerouac? The endless bouncing from one coast to another in post war America? The seminal hedonistic beat book? This book is not ON THE ROAD. It is a introspective and much slower look at a changing America written by a great writer nearing the last chapter of his life.Steinbeck overloaded his specially built truck to travel with his poodle Charley from New England,then the Midwest to his boyhood Salinas and an ominous journey to the segregated South of 1960. The book ends with a mad dash from the South to New York in record speed with blured insights and forgetfulness through West Virgina.The story has a strange entropy to it. The beginning vividly describes the rich New England Fall and a Maine potato harvest. Steinbeck tells us about the daily struggle with being lost and the pitfalls of overloading his truck named after Don Quixote's horse. We are told of a sinister night in the parking lot of a recently abandoned hotel replete with dishes still in the sink...after two days no one ever showed up.Steinbeck tells us much history about the transient culture of 1960: disposable eating utensils, the benefits of trailer camp life and the possible consequences of our wasteful practices. The marine biologist peeks at us from behind the writer when the author describes nature, the glory of Montana, and ecological problems. The South gets its chapter as Steinbeck views the horrible school desegregation battles of 1960.The South also raises a disturbing aspect to this otherwise good book...the characters seem oddly media stereotyped. The old black sharecropper, the young arrogant white racist hitchhiker Steinbeck forces out of his truck only to be followed by a young black revolutionary.The characters seem like script figures from a hastily written movie script. The rest of the story progresses rapidly...too rapidly through the mountain states.Despite the scenery skipped the story remains compelling.\\"Travels with Charley\\" is a trip well worth taking."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"My first \\"non-fiction\\" Steinbeck.

I've been to the Steinbeck Center and checked out the restored Rocinante as well as the great old GMC 3/4 ton truck it's mounted on...I'd have like to have looked through it at the end of the journey.The Kindle edition I purchased is just fine: easily navigated, as ususal."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This old favorite was chosen by my book club. I expected it to be dated, but found it surprisingly current because of the focus on larger themes, not just a travelogue. Steinbeck's sense of humor is delightful and I was often smiling as I read. The addition of Charley to the account adds an interesting dimension and changes his interactions with locals along the way. The author is honest about the downside of travel and his own mistaken notions about areas of the country before visiting."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"A classic travel story from one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. Despite the age of the book, it's fair to say this is a timeless masterpiece."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I'm a huge steinbeck fan, and this was one of his only books I hadn't read. I happened to be out of the great country that is the subject matter of this book at the moment, so I thought the time was right. Two things bothered about this book, but both are common sense prior to delving in. First, what makes steinbeck so great is his intimate portrayal of characters, and what he reveals about human nature through them. In more of a memoir type book this is going to be lacking. Also the declaration by so many reviewers that not much has changed today is just nonsense. This book serves as good nestalgia for the past, but having been all over the country I can say that a great deal would be different if taking this trip today. Some for better and some for worse._While I am a dog lover too, at times his gushings over his dog can get old. It does at another character though, and if anything I expected more interaction with people in a cross country trip. But overall there is a nice illustration provided for a country that provides more variety within itself than any other place in the world."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"From the moment Rocinante carried Steinbeck and Charley away from the comforts of home, I was with him. I never felt like I was a voyeur. I felt invited. The simplicity of his words indicated a master of the craft. The events carried the story without embellishment. I used my kindle to bookmark passages, though I probably won't need them as I intend to read this book - over and over. And you know something? If I met Steinbeck, I probably wouldn't have a single question to ask him about the work!"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Travels with Charlie is a timeless look at the USA in the early 1960's. However, the insights and conversations of the people John Steinbeck encounters along the way is just as good today as 50 years ago. The story-telling style is easy to read or listen to. It would be interesting to re-create this trip and see what is out there now with all the years behind us."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This book is pretty much the best. Everyone I've talked to who has read it loves it. I loved it. I still remember many favorite parts, though I read it years and years ago.The story revolves around Steinbeck's travels through America in his truck and camper with his poodle, Charley. Charley says \\"pffft\\" a lot. Steinbeck is honest, funny, and easy to travel with as he drives around, experiences the country, and thinks up ingenious solutions to little problems (traveling laundry, anyone?).Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors but I'm sure you don't have to be a fan to enjoy this book. The writing carries you along and unlike most of his stories the overall feeling of this one is uplifting. If you are looking for a book to gift, this is a good bet. Also paints a portrait of America at a certain time in history. Good for teens, adults, grandparents, anyone who likes dogs, traveling, camping, history, laundry...just plain good!"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Travels with Charley is one of Steinbeck's better books, though several of the incidents he \\"reports\\"(?) bear a suspicious resemblance to episodes from some of his novels. Personally, the parts I enjoyed the most were those about his eponymous traveling companion Charley, an elderly French poodle, and I wish there had been more of them. I'm not sure that Steinbeck managed to learn or convey much that was very meaningful about America, but his description of his sojourn through New Orleans near the end to witness the protests against desegregation as six-year-old Ruby Bridges became the first black child to attend a white grade school (immortalized in Norman Rockwell's painting \\"The Problem We All Live With\\") is quite interesting, even moving. On the whole, despite some problems (including its dubious veracity in places), definitely worth a read. Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"In the early sixties, Steinbeck, in his fifties, felt out of touch with America, so with poodle Charlie, he set out in camper Rocinante to renew contact. This is his telling of that journey, roughly circular from his east coast home to Maine, across the northern states, down the western states, and east through Texas and Louisiana. Within these travels, Steinbeck is very self-revealing, discussing his social interactions, his traveling experiences, his responses to social changes when visiting places he had been before, and providing his one-man's-look at things, not to be confused with attempts to make broader general conclusions. He does, none the less, manage more than a few general observations about a number of places, events and opinions that cross his path. For this reader, some of his talk about his own past and family brought \\"AHA\\" connections to some of his other works, particularly how family members had been in East of Eden, and a visit with an old crony who has a central role in Tortilla Flat. Notably cogent were Steinbeck's experiences and observations in Maine, Montana, Seattle, Monterey, California, and in Louisiana. As a novel-reader, this turned out to be an interesting journey and provided valuable insight into Steinbeck's life, thought processes, and other works, but left me feeling like there was not a lot of sense of Steinbeck's meeting his goal of re-connecting, or any general conclusion beyond some fascinating glimpses of how life was in America fifty years ago. The writing is terrific, as expected, and others would probably enjoy it. I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I found this book very boring and unintesting. I love reading books by Steinbeck but it seems that he gave up when he wrote this one. There was no excitement and it just seem tiring just looking at it. I would not recommend anyone to read this book."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"The tape's sound quality is extremely bad. Not only does it sound like it has an echo, it also fades in and out constantly. I am not impressed with this purchase. Even though I got it for a good price, the shipping and handling fees were a complete waste of money, considering the tapes are inaudible."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This is the most boring book I have ever read in my entire life, and I have read quite a few books. How Steinbeck could say soooooooo much about soooooooo little makes my head hurt. It is very good if you are an insomniac, though."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"The only good thing about this book is it put me to sleep many night"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I am completely indifferent to Steinbeck, no biases, nothing, but I would have to say that this is by far the worst novel that I have ever read. Long, dull depictions of possibly the dryest parts of America dominate this book, along with not-so-clever interactions between Steinbeck and his dog, Charley. Though for a novel this book may be short, it certainly could have ended about 200 pages before it did and we would have gotten the message: geography and people influence each other, and it is obvious that Steinbeck traveled only through the wastelands of America."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"In \\"Travels with Charley\\" Steinbeck takes a break from the exploitation fiction that made him famous and hits the road. He and Charley, well, travel. That's it. Along the way there are plenty of things for him to offer opinions of, mostly negative. One gets the feeling that Steinbeck is out looking for more pathetic people to exploit, er, uh, I mean downtrodden subcultures to champion. But in the end, it is clear that Steinbeck concludes that the America of 1962 wasn't such a bad place. Gee, thanks Mr. Steinbeck, hey eveybody, we can get on with our lives, John Steinbeck thinks we're okay!Overall \\"Travels...\\" reads like a supreme testament to Steinbeck's ego. One can almost hear him saying, \\"My opinion of this truck is 100% relavent, I am, after all, John Steinbeck.\\" What's more, it is a \\"personal experience\\" and nothing dates faster than a \\"personal experience.\\" I can see how in 1962 rambling around the country offering sporadic opinions might have been the height of literature (it was right in between \\"On The Road\\" and \\"Easy Rider\\") but America has changed a bit in the past 40 years. So why is this book still in print? Apparently, because it was written by John Steinbeck. Although this vidicates his superhuman ego, it does make one grateful that Steinbeck's publisher did not get a hold of his grocery list. Otherwise we would be subjected to \\"Truffles with Chutney; The John Steinbeck Diet.\\""},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Travel with Charley is the most awful book I had ever read in my life. The plot of story is like going nowhere, he keeps telling the same occasion over and over again. He can tell a second of moment into two or three pages. Describe his stupid truck into more than a page. There is nothing interesting in his journey. He said he prefer went through the countryside road than the highway almost every time in the book.Travel with Charley makes me absolutely lost my interesting in reading novels. I think this would be my last novel to read if I don't have to read it. I'm not going to insult John Steinbeck's books; probably someone out there would like his books to death. I'm not discouraging people not to read his books, but this is my comment after reading it."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"When i first started to read Steinbeck's Travels with Charley, i thought that it was going to be an interesting book to read, considering that we where going to have quizzes on it, but as i went on to reading the book it was the worse book i have ever read in my life,the book was boring and long,and It also ramble on and on. i personally didn't see any plot or even a well plan of organization going on. As i continued to read the book i was completely loss and confused, he would talk a lot about he's french poodle dog that spoke french; i thought that he was very weird, i also thought that he had major issues. Also when ever he was traveling he would meet all sorts of people and conversate with them,and before you knew it he was conversating with someone else completely different. I would strongly emphize that i would not recommended this book to anyone, because this book would really discourage people from wanted to read anymore of his book. For me personally i would not read another book written by John Steinbeck, and maybe if i decided to give another of his book a chance i would be really cautious."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Steinbeck seems to have a rather elitist attitude in this book. His ego is on full display. Example: he doesn't like the transformation of the American infrastructure from highways to interstates because you lose touch with the real America because of all the billboards, efficient truck stops,lack of scenery, etc, etc. John would't be happy unless we were all farmers living in old mother Russia telling stories around a fire. Sitting around a fire because we didn't invent electricity because it might elevate us socially above our neighbor or possibly rob us of the joys of sitting around a fire telling stories; all while eating raw potatoes and drinking water out of a hole in the ground. While I have always thought Steinbeck could write beautifully, his books seem to be little more than propaganda to further his socialist desires for society. But who am I? I guess I'm just more of a Hemingway kind of guy; I didn't get a college degree in something that only offers a job teaching the same subject as my diploma."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I am reading this for the third time. I have about twenty five books in my library that are my lifetime favorites, and this is one of the top three. I just wish Steinbeck was still alive to have seen the changes (some good, some not so good)in America since he wrote this wonderful book. It brings back some great childhood memories of family trips through New England on the way to Canada and Prince Edward Island."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Unlike most of the John Steinbeck books that I read in school and loved, this one had me laughing and totally enjoying his description of the people and places he encountered on his travels. Very refreshing!! A good read!!!"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I have read some of the best and worst authors of all eras. When I need great literature Steinbeck always delivers. This book is a wonderful story of John traveling around our continental U.S. with his dog. No matter what your politics are or your age, this story is timeless. I was amazed at how well John's opinions and observations fit so well in modern times. Easy read, and flows well. I always recommend Steinbeck to new readers as well as old ones, because his writing makes you think and feel at a deeper level."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This low key book, suposedly about his travels by a motor home in the USA, is much more of a chat his perceptions of change in the USA ( to the 1980's ) and sometimes a chat about the places or people he sees. Excellantly written, as we know John Steinbeck can, and although softly wandering is not an easy book to put down. You want to find out more and the dog Charlie is a rewarding passenger having np views of his own."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Reading it for pleasure; then going to donate it to the local library. Went there first to check it out but they didn't have it on the shelves even though it is listed in the card catalogue, so I'm very glad that this copy is hard cover. Amazing that it was written so long ago."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"As a fellow camper and dog lover, my husband enjoyed reading about Steinbeck's camping adventures throughout the US with his canine friend."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. It was an account of a trip taken in 1960 across America, alone with only his dog for company. I consider it the best travel book written. Too bad that it was so short, I am sure that there were things left out that would have been worth reading. Now, some people are saying that parts of it are a work of fiction by Steinbeck. I personally will go on believing that the trip actually happened just as John described it. As for the book itself, I had to use one of Amazon's \\"partners\\" since the hardback is out of print. I paid a lot of money for what I thought was an original hardback copy of the book. What I got was a hardback book, that was published for a book-of-the-month club. I ended up paying ten times what the original book was purchased for. Beware of false advertising when purchasing from anyone other that Amazon, even if Amazon has them listed on their site."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This is a must-buy for anyone interested in travel accounts, written by a Master.Buy this and enjoy th&eacute; ride.Steinbeck and Charley are kings of th&eacute; road."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I first read this in high school ... just 4 or 5 years after it was first published. Recently I obtained the audio book, performed by Gary Sinese.In 1960 John Steinbeck undertook to travel across America. He had lived in and traveled to various parts of the country, but longed \\"to hear the speech of the real America, to smell the grass and the trees, to see the colors and the light.\\" He bought and outfitted a truck, Rocinante, and with his French poodle, Charley, set out. His goal was not to visit typical tourist destinations but to get the feel of the country and its people. Along the way he met and conversed with many folks, including farmers, truckers, and waitresses. He traveled by interstate for part of the trip, but preferred the smaller roads, where he might come across a road-side stand selling local produce, fresh eggs, honey, or jams. He stopped in small towns and large cities; he visited with old friends, made new ones, and even encountered a bear in Yellowstone National Park. But mostly he enjoyed peace and quiet and a lot of time for thinking. His book is not just a travelogue but a series of essays on the American populace and on a way of life that was rapidly disappearing.Gary Sinese has a facility with voices that really makes this work come alive. This is the second audio of a Steinbeck book that I've listened to with Sinese as narrator. I suspect he has a particular fondness for the author. He certainly performs the audios well."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"An interesting travelogue that is best when focused on Charley the dog. Steinbeck veers wildly between keen observation and maudlin self-absorption. His pompousness is irritating -- from naming his truck Rocinante to his bragging of his own 'manliness' are serious flaws.However, he also provides transcendant observations that are still valid. His feelings on the mobility of society, the dignity of animals and the depths of human depravity are trenchant and well thought-out. Particularly his end-of-book rumination on the New Orleans meeting regularly to curse at a little African-American schoolgirl to the acclaim of a crowd full of bigots hits some real truths.The writing is generally strong, and overall it still feels relevant despite the time gap. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This book provides an incredible resource for the American people and tells us about our history, however not in the way that we would usually recognize a history book. It could even serve as a traveler's guide for the U.S, because it discusses the actions and lives of various American communities. Aside from that, it shows us just how little we know about ourselves and the area in which we live. Everyone that Steinbeck comes across during his journey serves as a window to a completely different (yet still in some ways very \`American') world. Steinbeck does a great job of putting the reader into his travels and allowing the reader to learn much about the real, everyday America."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"A story about the author's travels through the United States in search of America, accompanied by his poodle, Charley. On the way he meets any people and visits many places which characterize America. This is a good book which uplifts your spirits and which gives an insight into America and all who llive there."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"In Steinbeck's travel across America, he sets out with the aspiration of rediscovering the country. He had lived his life in Maine, and had been longing to explore the country that he had lived in for years. Thus, he embarked. This book deals with his adventures across America. Throughout his book, Steinbeck tries to give a feeling of the \\"true\\" America. He talks to many people, from the removed country folk to the urban, big-city inhabitants. In his journal you will notice the difference between the two people. Steinbeck also talks of his love of the countryside and how this diversifies America. In the end, Travels with Charley: In Search of America turns out to be a great book, but it occasionally failed to sustain my interests. I found Steinbeck rambling sometimes, as he sometimes does, but it ended catching the true essence of America. Steinbeck has pieced together fascinating events that reflect the genuine America. It is not the America of people splashed across magazine tabloids or on the television, but the America of the working-class citizen."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Travels with Charley is a great novel about the American character. John Steinbeck has a unique way of presenting the American character. There is no another way to explain this book except as a diverse account of the strange and wonderful creativity of traveling alone, while still needing the company of others. I think that no other book can truly be as accurate as this one. Travels with Charley definitely ranks as a 10 on my scale!"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"In an eerily ironic passage in Travels with Charley Steinbeck notes Sinclair Lewis's fall from the canon as well as from cultural view. Like Lewis, Steinbeck seems to have fallen from academic and literary vogue in favor of writers who present a more &quot;diverse&quot; portrait of American culture. However, such a tacit dismissal of Steinbeck's white-male view and his politically incorrectness (most notably using the phrase &quot;wetback Mexican&quot; to refer to an illegal Mexican immigrant) reduces the impact of a work which broaches many current issues well before they were in vogue. Dealing with environmental concerns (especially with his dead-on critique of the wasteful packaging of American goods), and America's restless quest for both spiritual and economic transcendence, Steinbeck's quirky travelogue speaks cogently to today's world as eloquently as it did to the Cold World of the early 1960s. Despite his penchant to embellish his enccounters with Americans, Steinbeck's work provides a cultural history which is important not only in academe and American Studies programs, but in realizing that our history as Americans is rooted squarely in our past, and a not so distant past at that. In searching for America, Steinbeck reminds us that we need to indeed look past labels and stereotypes that root us in fallow soil. Tilling the land in Rocinante, this little book prepares our minds for the diverse crops of American fiction of the past thirty-six years, and adds to our understanding of characters we have met and have yet to meet."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This is simply a fun story. It's wonderful to hear Steibeck's excellent voice describing a first person account of his adventures. One warming or telling or shocking encounter after another. Plus, it's a dog story! What's not to love? This was an airplane & vacation read for me and turned out to be a great choice for that purpose."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Steinbeck's Travels with Charley seemed reminiscent of Thoreau's Walden in that they both deal with the subject of escapism, nature, and gaining a stronger knowledge for the existence of what America is. While Henry Thoreau needed to get away from everyone and everything to clarify this point, Steinbeck's seems to do the exact opposite-seek people and places out and gain a better insight. Steinbeck's path of this knowledge is clearly the more sought after one, because well, after all, who doesn't like a road trip?The book was far more entertaining than I had thought it would be (even I, a Steinbeck fan, had bought it and put in the book shelf for quite a time before finally opening it up, I guess mainly because it looked too \\"autobiographical\\"). Steinbeck's premise is clear in the first part of the book, as he makes his plans to escape from family and friends to set out and explore America with the help of two companions-his dog Charley and his vehicle, which he amusingly names Rocinante (a la Don Quixote's horse). There are some humorous parts, such as Steinbeck's trouble getting a passport so he can cross into the Canadian border as well as his usual dry humor in depicting people and conversations. There are also many detailed descriptions of the beautiful regions of many parts of the country. Steinbeck has a knack for bringing these areas to life in one's mind as much as possible, and that in itself is what makes this book worthy of praise.What Steinbeck is able to find in America is the likeness in us all: \\"From start to finish I found no strangers...For all or our enormous geographic range, for all of our sectionalism...we are a nation, a new breed.\\" I think Steinbeck means not to say that we are all alike in our attitudes and beliefs, but rather that we all have an identity that captures the nature of Americanism.One of my favorite parts of the book was the descriptions of the Mojave Desert and California, mainly because I can readily identify with this region and loved to hear what Steinbeck had to say about it. Still, I believe that there will be an area of this book that will interest you depending on which region you are located. There is something for everyone in this book, something we can all readily idenity with.If there is one down side to the book, there are definite slow periods, where maybe Steinbeck goes on a little too much about one topic or one story. He is able to make up for it, overall, however, with his ability to capture America in a way that is humorous, telling and descriptive. Steinbeck fans should love this one, but if you just want to read a book about exploring America on a road trip, then this is a great book to check out."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"More than any autobiography a book like this tells you what kind of person the author is. I found him to be a very interesting person who reflects on himself and what he sees around him. Naturally the book displays his amazing writing skills; it is wonderful to see how he expresses himself. I really enjoyed what he said about Love: \\"Once, when I raptured in a violet glow given off by the Queen of the World, my father asked me why, and I thought he was crazy not to see. Of course I know now she was a mouse-haired, freckle-nosed, scabby-kneed little girl with a voice like a bat and the loving kindness of a gila monster, but then she lighted up the landscape and me\\". John Steinbeck, the person people who were close to him knew, lives on in this book for as long as the English language remains unchanged. He was not too different from many of my friends other than his phenomenal command of the language."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"In the 1960s when Steinbeck always lived up to our expectations for powerful fiction, Travels with Charlie drew our scorn without having to read it. John Steinbeck and a poodle dog traveling together? Gradually we read it anyway. And read it again. And again throughout the years. It's always a joy."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"A guy - a dog - a camper truck named Rocinante(in case you don't know and I didn't--that is the name of Don Quixote's horse.) This is Steinbeck's account of a road trip around the U.S. He traveled via RV before thousands took it up when only a few traveled via camper trucks. It's a 1960 trip with humor, pathos, and keen observation in which Steinbeck sees America from the grass roots.I loved Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday. I adored East of Eden and The Wayward Bus. I have been reading Steinbeck all of my life. I have seen every movie ever made based on any story he has penned( I mean penciled). This one is the winner for me. I loved his account of everything he saw, but I especially loved the parts about his traveling companion, a 12 year old large French poodle named Charley. Can't travel - read this and you will be making a journey of heart and soul. Like history - it's here. Love America - now you will even more.I was a baby when Steinbeck married; I was a young teacher when he took this trip. I was a mother of two when his bright candle went out and yet this story is classic - it is contemporary and ageless. My husband and I took turns reading it and shared the laughs and joys. Thanks to Operation Windmills(Steinbeck's original title) I can hardly wait to hit the road again next year. Travels with Charley - a great read!"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"\\"Travels with Charley\\" is a book with a lot of soul to it. Steinbeck's travels are charming, with some exceptions, particularly when he describes his travels in the South. His insights into American life are very interesting and I find he was right when he talks about interstate travel (how you can't see much of a place from the interstate) and how interstates cut into life and business along rural roads and freeways. Steinbeck is such a great writer, he makes everything flow so well that reading his books seem effortless. Travels with Charley isn't considered his masterpiece, but it's a great book (is it a novel or non-fiction, I can't seem to figure that out.) Highly recommend this."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"It's been many years since I've read this book. A great story/journey, This book arrived in very good condition, and I wanted a paperback for home or traveling. If you haven't read this Steinbeck book yet, well it's time you did! A charming account of the author's travels across America in his funky vehicle with his Standard-size black poodle named Charley."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Reading Blue Highways for the last two weeks somehow led me to pick up a copy of Travels with Charley.It reads like a contemporary travelogue. Steinbeck laments the the pollution and human encroachment of wilderness that he finds wherever he travels. If I'd not been told this had been written by Steinbeck, I'd never have guessed it was his child.I liked the book and I didn't like the book. He seems to run into the scruffiest of people, people who have run down to their last dollar, who are down on their luck and down on life. No happy people, John? No cheery optimists?I suppose I'd hoped for more depth."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Much has been written about John Steinbeck's \\"Travels with Charley: In Search of America,\\" particularly as it relates to what Steinbeck learned about the character and overall composition of the United States' inhabitants, as he traversed the nation with his poodle in the fall of 1960. For Steinbeck admirers, however, the joy in this non-fiction book may not stem mainly from learning about the nation, but rather from what the reader comes to understand about Steinbeck, the man. Of course, there are the broad stances Steinbeck takes on matters of religion, for instance, where he appears amused at the fire-and-brimstone preaching he hears in New England. And there is, say, Steinbeck's aversion to racism, as he is overcome with a \\"weary sickness\\" upon witnessing negative treatment toward African-Americans in the South.Yet beyond such numerous revelations, and perhaps above all, the attuned reader understands that Steinbeck is primarily an inquisitive person: Like a journalist, he asks questions - and starts conversations with - complete strangers on his trip, while he simultaneously observes the rich details of the landscape.John Steinbeck must have possessed tremendous grace and charm, otherwise the people he met likely would not have changed his truck tires in the rain, on a Sunday, in Oregon, or routinely dined with him - or given him such quality driving directions.Yes, Steinbeck showcases the United States, but he deeply reveals his personality in the process. Overall, \\"Travels with Charley\\" is a classic that will be read for generations to come. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I am only about one-third into this book and am already loving it - not at all what I expected. Steinbeck's observations about the US in the 60's are as true today as they were then. He has a pithy sense of humor, doesn't take himself too seriously, and sees beyond the obvious. A good read."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This book was recommended by someone in my own age bracket... I loved it. It took me back in time. I graduated High School in 62, so that gives youan idea :) Good book for those interested in our (USA) history, and how things were."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I enjoyed the first half of this memoir, but then lost interest after Montana. Steinbeck does has some spot-on observations. I especially liked his view on antiques. Recommended."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"John Steinbeck, a Nobel prize winning American author, travels with his beloved canine companion, Charley, from to Maine to West and back East again. This book is in first person narration. I can see why Steinbeck was such a great writer. He writes very clearly and detailed of his obvservations across the country. There is a lot to see as he drives across country in 1962 in the middle of the Civil Rights movement for African Americans and before John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963.The most drama was Charley's health at the time. Steinbeck writes about his cross-country journey without overdoing it. He writes for a mainstream public perhaps Americans who don't get the opportunity. He provides very good points that we've lost our local identities because most people don't have regional dialects anymore, people were moving and migrating even back then, and the lack of communication in our society. Steinbeck writes about his thoughts and observations about society as well and where we were going even back then. I wonder what he would think about today with the internet, social websites, etc.For the most part, this is a good book."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"A little over fifty years ago, author John Steinbeck sets out on a journey across the United States with his faithful dog Charley. As he views the incredible and changing landscape of the continent, Steinbeck offers details and insights into the people he meets and places he sees.I am a fan of Steinbeck, who is a trained observer and is also wise in his interpretations of the places, people and situations he encounters on his trip. He has a delightful way of writing and I found myself reading a great many passages aloud to my husband.His descriptions of his time in Deer Isle, Maine had me instantly craving lobster and checking flight pricing to Maine. My husband, who was born in Wisconsin, loved the glowing reports of his birth state. We both dreamed of moving to Montana. I felt the rebuke and the truth in the story of the very compassionate but evil looking man from Oregon. I reminisced on my own short but pleasurable trip to Carmel, California. I chuckled at his insights into Texas and the unique and devoted people that inhabit that land. And I ached at the racial struggle Steinbeck encountered in the deep south.Steinbeck took me along for his journey. His writing is so beautiful and descriptive that I felt I was sharing the seat with his loyal but aging friend Charley. His sentiments ring so true and honest that they are still relevant fifty some years after his adventures.I'm ready for a road trip. Too bad the gas prices make it impossible right now."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I loved the first half of this book, the second half I did not like much at all. I've always been a fan of Steinbeck but never before had read any of his non-fiction works. I'm glad I did read this book, even if I was unsatisfied with the ending.In his later years, Steinbeck, along with his older poodle Charley, decides to take a trip around the country to see how it has changed in the past twenty or so years (he spent a lot of time abroad). He buys a truck and a customer trailer he names \\"Rocinante\\" and stocks it full of supplies. Most notably enough liquor to fill a bath tub because he feels when you meet someone on the road, you can always use a good drink. He spends the first part of his trip in New England, seeing the sites there and tasting the local cuisine, and then moves on through the mid-west all the way to Seattle. He expresses an especial love for Montana and its \\"old-time\\" feel.Once he reaches California, his original home, he makes a detour to see family and then resumes his travels towards Texas. For some reason, Steinbeck is a bit apprehensive about Texas and almost wants to skip it, but finds that he can't (especially since his wife's family lives there). He spends a couple days on a ranch and then moves on through the rest of the South. His trip isn't as pleasant through this part as the south during the sixties was full of turmoil due to the rights movement. He also learns the dangers of picking up Hitchhiker's who don't agree with your viewpoints.Steinbeck meets several interesting people along the way. The best part about them is that they are all different, but the same in that they're just trying to make a better way for themselves. They share a drink and some interesting stories with him and help him from becoming too lonely on his journeys. However, some of the conversations seem a bit pretentious and I really do wonder if they were real conversations. Maybe its just being a product of my time but I don't think I've ever heard people talk as poetically as Steinbeck describes their conversations. His description of his dog is also wonderful. Just the conversations they had going back and forth, with sometimes the dog only saying \\"Fft\\" was funny reading to me.Steinbeck's writing is of course marvelous. He does a really wonderful job with the description in the first part of the book and you can truly tell what an enjoyable time he's having. He describes Charley humorously and it really is a trip for him and his dog in these descriptions. However, he loses this description and somewhat ignores Charley in the latter half of the book. He also spends less time on places and it almost seems rushed. I would have liked to see him spend the same amount of time detailing California, Texas and the South as he did New England.Overall though, this was an enjoyable read. It was the type of book you could pick up and read in pieces without having to worry about forgetting detail. It was simply a man's journey with his dog in search of what makes America the way it is and how the people who live in it shape the whole experience.Travels With CharleyCopyright 1962277 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2010"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I have read somewhere that what makes a novel a &quot;classic&quot; is that it must contain some fundamental truths that can withstand changing fads, cultures and eras. I know that &quot;Travels with Charley&quot; is not a novel but a memoir. However, this memoir contains so much truth that it deserves--and has acheived--almost instant &quot;classic&quot; status.It is about John Steinbeck's trip across America. He begins in New York, drives up through Maine, across the midwest, through Montana to Washington, down the Pacific Coast, through Texas and finally through the American southeast. He was 58 when he took this trip, and his only companions were his loyal dog Charley and trailer Rocinante. I appreciated the way that Steinbeck respected Charley, gave him human characteristics, and looked for Charley's observations on mankind as well as his own.I have heard this memoir described as an &quot;angry&quot; book, but I think this only describes a small portion of Steinbeck's experiences on the road. Steinbeck was certainly troubled by certain things--chief among them the horrifying &quot;witches sabbath&quot; that occurred in New Orleans. He also looked with sadness upon the &quot;progress&quot; that has diminished our cultural identities and ravaged our beautiful land. However, he was wise enough to know that older people often cling to the past simply because it is familiar, but not because it was superior or even good. He recognized that trait in himself and challenged it.Some individual passages in this book were so wise I read them several times to try to appreciate the full extent of his wisdom. For example, the passage where Steinbeck remarks that too many older people turn in their exciting lives for healthy and safe ones. He wrote that he was not willing to exchange the quality of his life for slightly more quantity. As I read this passage, I considered that he died less than 10 years after writing this book. Sad, but how many people do a solo, cross-country road trip in their twilight years?I also appreciated, but was wounded by, his descriptions of racial unrest in the south. The witches sabbath brought tears to my eyes, as it described the young black students as ultimately less pitiable then their tormenters. The students were going places and had their whole lives before them; their tormenters were ugly, twisted people clinging to a past that they cherished simply because they feared the future and the unknown.Ultimately, &quot;Travels with Charley&quot; is about embracing life. Though Steinbeck saw much that troubled him, he saw much more that was beautiful, like the migrant farmers in Maine, the kind veterinarian in Amarillo, the wonderful tire shop owner in Portland. As Steinbeck remarks, the America that he wrote about in this book doesn't exist anymore. If we followed his exact route today, we would encounter something entirely different--both because of the passage of time and because of our varying perspectives. However, while the America he wrote about no longer exists, the Americans do, and Steinbeck's memoir is a love song to them."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"In 1960 John Steinbeck decided to reacquaint himself with America after being away because, in his own words, \\"I've lost the flavor and taste and sound of it. I'm going to learn about my own country.\\" So he set out on a 3+ month journey with his dog to do just that. Along the way, he met people and made conversation, observed the state of the country, and let his mind wander as he made his journey. Then he returned to his mobile cabin at night and recorded the day's events. These journal entries became \\"Travels with Charley.\\"Overall, Steinbeck seems to paint a pretty picture. While driving through New England in the fall, he is taken with the brilliant foliage on display. He is much impressed with Wisconsin, and says about Montana, \\"I am in love. For other states I have admiration, respect, recognition, even some affection, but with Montana it is love.\\" Later, Steinbeck also speaks glowingly of the California Redwoods.Steinbeck also has nice things to say about the American people - sometimes. He notes that midwesterners are openly friendly, and again praises Montana, for its inhabitants \\"had time...to undertake the passing art of neighborliness.\\" However, interspersed throughout his journey, Steinbeck encounters many things which are not so delightful. In fact, some were quite upsetting. He talks of waste - \\"American cities are like badger holes, ringed with trash\\" - and of miserable people - \\"(some people) can drain off energy and joy, can suck pleasure dry and get no sustenance from it. (They) spread a grayness in the air about them.\\" (This was his opinion of a waitress Steinbeck had just met in Maine.) And the waitress wasn't the only one.Along his journey, he met many close-minded, opinionated, bigoted and rascist Americans, and it made for depressing reading. I don't think Steinbeck was quite prepared for it. I believe he had an idealized vision of a great trip, but in reality, it wasn't, and it took a lot out of him. By the end Steinbeck was burned out and wanted nothing more than to get back home. After California he went straight through to Texas, and then to New Orleans, where he encountered rascism at its worst. That seemed to be the last straw for him. After that, he blew off the rest of the southeast US and went back to New York. He had had enough.Jay Parini, who wrote the introduction, notes this ominous feeling. He states that the book is filled with \\"whimsical vignettes, charm, etc., but beneath its surface there is a sense of disenchantment that turns to anger.\\" He goes on to say that Steinbeck \\"is never quite able to bring himself to say that he was often disgusted by what he saw.\\" But there's no question that he was.Still, this was a very good book. And it's not demoralizing from start to finish. There are many humors adventures as well - his discussions with border guards near Canada being the most memorable. But one can't help but feel that Steinbeck was sorry he'd gone. He had a pre-conceived notion of what America was, and when it didn't meet his expectations, he was crushed. \\"Travels with Charley\\" brilliantly captures what Steinbeck reluctantly learned - that you can't go home again.Four stars."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"It's amazing how relevant Steinbeck's observations of America are forty years after he wrote this book. In fact, much of what he says seems to apply even more now than when he first wrote it, such as when he observes: \\"the mountain of things we throw away are much greater than the things we use. In this, if in no other way, we can see the wild and wreckless exuberance of our production, and waste seems to be the index.\\" In a similar vein, he wonders, when considering the expansion of large cities, \\"why progress looks so much like destruction.\\" Steinbeck's sarcasm also comes to the surface when he notes some of the many odd habits and leisure activities of Americans, such as antique-hunting in omnipresent antique shops, which he felt were \\"bulging with authentic and attested trash from an earlier time.\\" He was also quite impressed with the country's intrepid hunters, to whom he feared his poodle Charley would look like a buck deer. After spending an evening in Maine with some migrant farms workers from Quebec, he expressed (rather vainly, in retrospect) his hope that the country would not some day be overwhelmed \\"by people not too proud or too lazy or too soft to bend to the earth and pick up the things we eat.\\" Far from being simply critical though, what comes out of this book is Steinbeck's great love for the country. His view that the \\"American identity is an exact and provable thing\\" still rings true today. \\"Travels with Charley\\" is not just classic travel literature, it is also a very readable and informative set of observations on America in the mid-20th century and beyond."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Steinbeck clearly thought at the time he was writing The Winter of Our Discontent (1961) that America was in the middle of a serious moral and ethical crises, that the traditions and values this country was founded upon were no longer looked upon as serious guidelines for American behavior. The trip across America detailed in this book was undertaken at least in part as an attempt by Steinbeck to determine if this evaluation of the state of America was valid, if when Americans were approached as individuals, face-to-face, some other picture might emerge.To facilitate his investigation, Steinbeck brought along his poodle Charley, as companion and ice-breaker, and packed up a camper truck with everything he thought he might need in his travels (probably too much, as he ruefully admits at one point), and proceed to travel across the states in a large circle, from New York to Maine to Illinois to Washington, California, Texas, and the Deep South. As we travel along with him, we are treated to a rather incredible display of the sheer writing talent that Steinbeck possessed, as the people he meets along the way are described accurately and so very concisely, sometimes in just a couple of paragraphs, to where these people come alive to the reader, to where the reader can say \\"I know someone just like that\\".But perhaps more importantly, the book is spattered throughout with Steinbeck's acute observations and opinions on everything from antiques, the virtues of small towns, the value of manual labor, the homogenizing of American language and cuisine due to the influence of radio and television, the beginnings of the interstate system and its influence on everything along its routes, hunters, trash, and many other items, all carefully supported by his actual observations along the road. There are a few comments expressed by Charley here, too (typically a \\"Fttt\\" and a sniff). And although this book was written forty years ago, much of what Steinbeck wrote then is still very valid today. Whether this represents a good thing or not, that there has been so little change in some very basic elements of American society in the intervening years, must be decided and thought upon by the reader.It seems that many writers of stature eventually write some form of 'travel' book. This is one of the best of this genre, due to both Steinbeck's great powers of observation and his ability to distill what he sees to something that is recognizable, distinctive, that resonates with the reader's own experiences. This is not his greatest book - that distinction belongs to his great fiction works of The Grapes of Wrath, The Pearl, East of Eden, The Winter of Our Discontent. But it is a very satisfying look at a great writer and his outlook on the America of his day."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I read Travels with Charley after reading most of Steinbeck's novels. I enjoyed it so much that I immediately read it again. This work lets the reader get a glimpse of John Steinbeck, the American and the man. I put American first because Steinbeck, I believe, was one of those men who loved his country so much, that he seemed to consider himself an American above all else. I enjoy creative works by individuals who have an unquestionable love for something. I believe Steinbeck was such a person. In the early '60's he is dismayed (but loves) America, and so sets out to rediscover her. Since he is a shy person, he takes his dog, a large black poodle named Charlie, with him to help break the ice with people as he travels around the country. What follows is an account of the places he goes and the people he meets, but more importantly to me as a huge Steinbeck fan, is the uncovering of John Steinbeck, the man. If you want a vicarious trip into '60's America or want to know John Steinbeck, you'll love this little book. I still love it !"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Wow! Let me repeat: WOW! Steinbeck is not particularly known for his humor, but in Travels with Charley, he lets everything spill out of the bag. I don't want to ruin anything about this book for those who haven't read it, but it is one of the top five travel books I've ever come upon. (far better than On the Road, and right up there with Travels in Hyperreality).Steinbeck packs his bags at the age of 60, and heads out to discover an America he claims he hasn't known for over 20 years. And although he never, in so many words, tells precisely what the White Whale of America is, I think he tells us the following:America is a land of people who want to go somewhere else so they can be alone; and the only reason they want to go anywhere is so they can come back and tell everyone about it.A word of warning: You will cringe at Steinbeck's description of the American South, and realize just how different it is than the rest of America.Also: it is interesting to note that at the height of his career (1960), probably only less famous than Ernest Hemingway of all world literary figures at the time, not a single person recognized Steinbeck in his three months abroad. Tell me that isn't depressing for any Leos out there with literary aspirations. :)"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Steinbeck packs his bags at the age of 60, and heads out to discover an America he claims he hasn't known for over 20 years. Since he is a shy person, he takes his dog, a large bleu poodle named Charlie, with him to help break the ice with people as he travels around the country. What follows is an account of the places he goes and the people he meets during this three-month journey.I hadn't read any of Steinbeck's novels until I picked up this great piece of American literature! I enjoy creative works by individuals who have an unquestionable love for something. I believe Steinbeck was such a person. Travels With Charley is a charming, honest, and in a way, innocent novel about the author's observations of Americans and the Americans people think they know. Alone in his thoughts, it is not a drawn out - chronological book on his life. It is almost a journal, but written in a style that makes you feel like a close and personal friend. It is not only a look at America, it takes you inside yourself. It inspires you to take a deeper look inside of you and the life that goes on around you. He broadens your perspective on subjects that you would never even think about.John Steinbeck's journey across America was like being in a movie. Everything he did he described in every full and minor detail so I, the reader, was able to follow along with him as if I was really there."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This surely deserves its place among the hallowed shelves of Great American Writing. It stands alone as perhaps the most light-hearted of Steinbecks books, yet also one of the most sensitive and thoughtful, being a partial auto-biography. This is in no way, shape, or form, a boring book, as many disappointed young high school readers have said. Quite sorry, kids, but English class is not meant to be filled with snappy little series books that require little more thought[possibly less] than a telivision show. Steinbeck, perhaps is ''my'' writer in that he seems to capture my thoughts and feelings to the point of perfection, and with frightful clarity. This book is such a suberb rendition of America that the new comer to this country would do well to read it to get a feel for the land. It seems as if the plains of the Heartland, the peaks of the North, the desert land[that I know best] of the South West are all presented as if they are skillful little photographs, taken with a firm and learned hand.Different from the typical travel book in that it is not so much about the land or people[though they play a tangible role] as it is about the authors own emotions and thoughts on this wonderful country, this totally unique land. Reccomended to all who love Steinbeck, America, and clear thought. Pouncing Fossa"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This book is a gem and is probably the least known of John Steinbeck's works which is a real shame. After 20 years of writing about America John Steinbeck felt the need to see if he was still in touch with the American people.As a consquence of this he was one of the first people in America to buy a Mobile Home which he had to have custom made to his specifications. This fact indicates that Steinbeck was ahead of his time given the proliferation of Mobile Homes that you see today. During his journey he laments the fact that there is no room service at any Auto Court ( Motel) where he sometimes stays and he finds a world full of people without any Political Opnions living in trailer parks.He also laments the fact that one day a person will be able to drive from New York to Los Angeles on a Superhighway and not see anything except a road during the entire journey. Sadly this has become a reality and quaint roadside stalls selling fresh fruit and vegetables have virtually disappeared.His dismay at seeing that nearly everything is disposable in our Society is made quite clear by him. His dog Charlie's antics prove to be most amusing to the reader and his description of Autumn in Maine is truly wondrous and breathtaking. Once again Steinbeck proved that he was a Master of his Craft.This book will remain with you long after you have finished it and it reads like it was written yesterday because the prose is so fresh and enduring."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This year marks the 100th aniversary of the birth of Steinbeck, and this book is one of the great pleasures of an avid reader. From his home in New York, there and back again, Steinbeck crosses America in a truck named for Don Quixote's horse, (all men should name their car Rocinate, after all), with a French poodle named Charley.The worst part about the book is it is far too short, leaving a reader desiring more. Steinbeck's journey touches a side of America, the true awe and wonder for the land and her people like few novels. The work is full of humor and insight, both profound and personal. Perhaps only a handful of books pierces the American experience like &quot;Travels with Charley&quot;. It is a book that requires a slow pace, to savor the voyage across this great land and her treasures.My experience in reading the book can best be stated by Steinbeck himself, in an observation made while leaving the state of Maine, &quot;There are times that one treasures for all one's life, and such times are burned clearly and sharply on the material of total recall. I felt very fortunate that morning.&quot;"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I first read this in the 60s and it resulted in a nationwide trip around the States in a '59 Chevvy. Steinbeck's mixture of travelog, homespun philosophy and humour is captivating. Not great literature but a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"TRAVELS WITH CHARLEY gives us a chance to move to an up-close-and-personal position with the aloof, John Steinbeck, At the age of 60 in the fall of 1960. Steinbeck acquired a primitive pickup-style recreational vehicle, packed up a few belongings, and loaded his faithful poodle. He drove throughout the United States to reconnect with the inhabitants of the nation.Like any other tourist who travels too far too fast, he was unable to see everything, and he skimmed over many details in his tale. He delineated some of his stops in sufficient detail. Most of the travel log is a glazed-over account.Steinbeck wrote with the voice of a mature senior citizen, who was disappointed with much of what he saw in the nation. When I first read this book, I was in college. Now that I am in the age group of Steinbeck when he wrote it, I wonder what he would think of our nation today. He showed some of the good, such as the idyllic farms with friendly people, and some of the bad, such as people who were prejudiced and unkind. I believe if he could see our country today he would find something positive. He always expressed trust in the underlying goodness of our people."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"In the autumn of 1960, author John Steinbeck (1902 - 1968) felt that he was writing on the fumes of experience. That and the wanderlust that usually passes with youth still itched at age 58. He bought a camper truck he christened \\"Rocinante\\" after Don Quixote's horse and with his 10-year-old poodle named Charley he set off to find America. His route largely rimmed the 48 contiguous states: from his summer home on Long Island, he headed up to Maine, across to upstate New York and down US Route 90, out to Chicago, through the Badlands to Montana, over to Spokane, down the Oregon coast, to his native Salinas in Central California, cutting across the Mojave to Texas, onward into the Deep South and then a straight shot home to New York City.In 1960, Steinbeck stood on a cusp of history and what he reveals, especially as regarded 47 years later, is the country coming and going on itself. He finds cities ringed by huge garbage piles created by the rise of a disposable culture that had yet to discover recycling. He uses the new highway system as well as the old back roads, encountering a country adapting to a new mobility. The people he met were timeless characters, though many were in age-old circumstances that have since passed. Despite the Pulitzer Prize, bestselling books and media coverage, he is never recognized and finds people at their most candid. His accounts on the road are episodic, some comic, some fodder for philosophical rumination. When he hits the Deep South, however, he collides with the opening salvos of the modern Civil Rights movement and tangles with racists as he watches \\"The Cheerleaders,\\" the gang of middle-aged \\"respectable\\" white women obscenely haranguing a tiny black child being escorted to school. He is sickened. It is time to go home.The insights to the human condition and what it means to be American as divulged by the journey are priceless. The beautiful thing about Steinbeck is his persistent curiosity in life outside of himself. Though he comes to realize the journey is as much internal as it is external, his inspiration was not to find himself but to connect with others. He was a most generous soul."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Favorite memories of this book come from years ago when I could not put the book down as I read of Steinbecks travels with his poodle. For those whose minds wander and wonder about the roads, towns and people of the U.S., I highly recommend this book. I am purchasing it to read again."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Simple and wonderful, this book made me want to go get a big dog and pack everything I own into an RV. Steinbeck has such a gift for characterizations and elegant truths:\\"It occurs to me that, just as the Carthaginians hired mercenaries to do their fighting for them, we Americans bring in mercenaries to do our hard and humble work. I home we may not be overwhelmed one day by peoples not too proud or too lazy or too soft to bend to the earth and pick up the things we eat.\\""},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"As with many of the readers listed here, this is my favorite Steinbeck story. I had this book with me when I moved from Michigan to Arizona(and back),thinking I was making a feeble attempt and his story. Any American with a car and a wanderlust should read this, on the road of course! It was hard not to feel envious of the author during this tale of route '66-ing."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"John Steinbeck left from my hometown, Sag Harbor, in September 1960 shortly after the big hurricane, I remember. I lived three blocks from him and saw him around town alot. This is probably my favorite book of all time. I too, yearn to go on such a journey someday to rediscover America. Have reread the book at least 50 times since it was published in 1962!"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Book Review Travels with Charley While reading Travels with Charley, all of my preconceived notions were shot and my mind frame changed. When I chose this book it was nothing like I assumed it to be. I never thought it would be so full of lessons and insights into life. This book rates a ten on my list. Very few books have moved me and I have to say that Travels with Charlie definitely has. He lets his readers know that the world does not represent an evil place. There is still some good in life today. He gives insight into life in general as well as his own. His generalizations about how he feels inspired me to change the way that I live my life. I could quote a million phrases, but to really understand his words, one has to read the entire novel. I never expected a book about a man traveling around America to grab me with so much intensity. In my copy, I took a highlighter and marked every sentence that meant something to me. Travels with Charley not only added to my literary knowledge, but about the knowledge of fellings that I found within myself.END"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I first read this book at about age 12. That period of my life was the height of my unrequited wanderlust and fixation with man's best friend, so I was delighted at finding this journal written by a guy who put a camper top on his pickup, took his dog, and drove around the United States. It didn't even bother me that the narrator of this adventure was an \\"old guy\\". He shared my feeling about what it is like to get goosebumps when the wild geese fly overhead in the fall and the air is chill. You want to grab a sleeping bag, some grub, and hit the road. At that time, I was just like the young boy in the book who wanted to stow away in Steinbeck's camper. It would be a few years before I saw the movies \\"Of Mice and Men\\" and \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", which led me to reading his novels and really finding out who John Steinbeck was and what he was about. In \\"Travels With Charley\\" the reader doesn't feel that gut wrenching sympathy for his fellow man which is such a big part of Steinbeck's fiction. In this book Steinbeck is kind of a grumpy old man, like Andy Rooney. Now that I'm getting kind of old myself, I find myself experiencing the changes in the world Steinbeck was discovering when he wrote this book. When he writes about meeting a shiney young submarine officer, you get the willies along with Steinbeck about the nuclear sharks deep under the sea, manned by the very young, protecting us, yet at the same time menacing. The first time I read his description of the waitress in the diner in Maine, so full of negativity that she would only think a big tipper was crazy, I had never met that kind of person before. Since then I have worked with many just like her. My favorite part was when Steinbeck camped out with the potato harvesters in Maine. Also of note are his comentary about ubiquitous \\"top 40\\" songs on the radio, last generation's castoffs as today's antiques, and sadness as charmless but comfy mobile homes replace the old family place. Steinbeck got road-weary halfway through the book, his dog got sick, and everything seemed wrong. He witnessed the terrible discrimination and trouble of integration of the early '60s. The badlands and the South creeped him out, and he couldn't wait to get back home. Isn't that just the way a real trip works?"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Steinbeck is expert at weaving a tale! I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Readers who enjoy adventure, traveling, and experiencing new things will love this book. Travels with Charley is an interesting novel that is almost biographical in the sense that it tells a lot about Steinbeck himself, and his own experiences while traveling across America. The author's descriptions of places such as the Salinas Valley are made so real that I can almost imagine I was there, at that time. While reading this book it is important to not rush through it because it is better understood and enjoyed if you are relaxed while reading. All of the sights are seen through Steinbeck's eyes and retold as Steinbeck sees them. This book also supports the theme that companionship is essential to survival. The companionship and comfort that Charley,the poodle, gives Steinbeck is vital and very necessary. Not only does Charley protect his master, but he is Steinbeck's lifelong friend. Their bond is truly inseparable. Besides this theme, the author touches a little on other topics such as racism in the South, defining the national identity of America and its people, and the loneliness as well as the benevolence of Americans in different geographical regions. As a result of reading Travels with Charley:In Search of America, I want to travel again. My spirit of adventure has come alive!"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"...With his French poodle dog Charley, John Steinbeck set out in his truck Rocinante to explore and experience America at the age of 58. He meets a lot of different people on his way across the nation. What follows is an account of the places he goes and the people he meets during he's three-month journey. In he's journey john was not happy with most of the big American cities for example Chicago and Texas as having problems of people not being very friendly compare to the American villages. He was also appalled by racism in new Orleans.I like the description he gave of Maine and New England in general in 60's. It has not really changed, most of the things he talked about or saw are still around.My view of the book is that it is not exciting at all, it is too plain!. It does not cause any curiosity to the reader."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"It started off nice, but then the bordom sat in. I was required to read this to pass an english class and didn't see the literary merit to it. Steinbeck wrote in an easy to understand manner and added some humor (in my opinion) on how people act. It was a book that was well written, but really should have been shorter."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I wish my master would take me on some journeys like this! The farthest he takes me is to the corner liquor store, which is cool because I get to see this really cute Yorkshire Terrier along the way."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I read this book as a young man and looked forward to re-reading it as an old man. I was excited to get it, but when I opened the package and saw this crummy little book I felt totally ripped off. This thing looks like a grade school reader, not a hard-cover book that you would want to put on a shelf. It is a total rip off. I refuse to pay this much money for garbage quality."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Steinbeck took a skim across America to find new places and people to DRINK with.... Then filled more boring pages with ego, which he had to highlight with descriptions of where/how his dog urinated on things."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!Steinbeck has reinvented himself in this work as a pretentious bore. Was this the man who wrote East of Eden? Hardly seems possible.This Steinbeck comes across as a pseudo intellectual who names his truck after Don Quixote's horse seems unaware that the New York license plates on the truck will influence what people think of him.He spends time between boring observations inserting a combination of Hemingway toughness and sophomoric intellectual \\"name dropping\\".I am sorry after 100 pages I quit...most of his insights were wrong and the few that were good weren't worth the pain."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Dogs are great companions but they have their limitations - namely the present. I know Steinbeck is tongue-in-cheek in some places, such as when he has a conversation with Charley, but it's not clear when he is and when he's not. I suspect it wasn't clear to him either.Some examples: &quot;Charley was torn three ways - with anger at me for leaving him, with gladness at the sight of Rocinante, and with pure pride in his appearance.&quot;&quot;I saw the look of veiled contempt in Charliey's eyes.&quot; &quot;...trying to make himself look small.&quot;This is not to say he doesn't hit the nail on the head in quite a few places, e.g. how Charley gets him up in the morning. There have been days when I open my eyes in the morning and the first thing I see is a black nose two inches from my nose!I didn't find Steinbeck's human interactions paticularly interesting so if you're not interested in dogs, don't bother."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"This book is painful to read because you are hosted by a crotchety old man who is annoyed by life and loves no one except his dog. He meets people who he finds boring and visits places that insult him and tells you about all of the lousy things that happen to him and then reminds you of all of the good things that have disappeared about America. If you love Steinbeck don't read this book because perhaps you are meeting the real man and you will feel different about his other beautiful books. If you don't know Steinbeck and want to, try Pastures of Heaven or Cannery Row. Those books are how you want to remember him by, and not by this last, wheezing gasp."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"All I can say is that I didn't like this book for the reason of being so boring. I think he paid too much attention to Charley. Instead, he could of made the story more interesting. I couldn't focus much on the book, because I didn't have much interest in it. The story was going forward pretty well at the beginning but then it seemed to be stuck in a loop; everything repeated over &amp; over.I don't recommend anyone to start off with this book of John Stein beck's unless one wants to lose the good impression he or she had in mind on him.The winning awards as Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award made him famous and known as a great writer, but personally, I don't think he put much effort in writing this particular book at all. Although I didn't find much interest in \\"Travels with Charley\\" but I still look forward to reading another book of his. I've heard that his other books such as \\"Grapes of wrath\\" is very interesting. I'll give it another try..."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"In this rather short novel, Steinbeck tells the reader about the most memorable parts of his cross-country trip with his dog. Unfortunately, these memorable moments are among the most boring narratives that I have ever read! Steinbeck wastes half of the book on an in-depth study of what his French poodle, Charley, prefers to urinate on, a topic that I personally do not care about at all.Ultimately, I think that had this novel been written in the Middle Ages, it would have quickly replaced the rack as a popular torture method."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"At first I thought this book was a snooze and couldn't wait to finish it. It seemed like he went into every single detail he could have possibly done, but when I got towards the end of the book, my whole view of this book changed at New Orleans, and it turned out to be a wonderful book. It was so interesting and believe it or not, I couldn't put it down! John Steinbeck is a wonderful author, and I wouldn't miss this book."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I'm a Steinbeck fan anyway, of the mindset that about anything he does is marvellous- but this book ranks right up there with the Grapes of Wrath for me. I had an old dog-eared copy of my Mother's at home, so on a road trip of my own, I picked it up to read. I was blown away by this book, and the intensely personal memoirs of Steinbeck's. This book not only gave me a feel for Steinbeck as a person, but for America's true blood. He chronicles an actual trip he took in this book, travelling fromt he east coat, through his hometown of Salinas, CA, and back home through the southern states. He deals with real people, not a glamorized stereotype of what Americans are. Some of the attitudes and slang seem a bit dated, but don't let that deter you. It is like a time-capsule left for us by a magician of the pen. I highly reccomend this book for anyone who is a fan of Steinbeck's, or going on a trip of their own. Steinbeck's journey of self-discovery beats Kerouac's &quot;On the Road&quot; hands down! I found him to be a very down-to-earth writer, more so in this book, as opposed to Jack Kerouac, whose pointless, drab novel failed in comparison to this."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I found Travels With Charleyt to be a very entertaining and profound book. John Steinbeck is very good at bringing up many things in one book without making it seem cluttered. The book does not have a story line the way that a novel or short story usually does. Instead, it is more like a travel journal meant to express the author's ideas and enlighten the reader about America and its people. Many people would enjoy this book, but particularly those who enjoy traveling, because they could sympathize with how Steinbeck feels when he talks about how much he loved his journey. Overall, Travels With Charley is an interesting book that presents John Steinbeck's ideas in a unique and effective way."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I found this book to be one of the more interesting ones I've read in a while. Mr Steinbeck, in my opinion, was a genius. One great example of this comment is how when the huricane was approaching he put his boat in the middle of the bay...pure genius. This man had a dream of going and seeing this massive place of which he had been writing about for so long without a clear understanding of exactly what he was refering to in all his works. So in preparation for his trip he got the truck he would need and a traveling companing named Charley. The book is about exactly what the title said, a trip with 'Charley' in search of a place that he has yet to find. The only part I found to be sort of boring was his habit of having long dialogue with almost every one he met. I thought we the readers could have done with out all of the talking. But dont get me wrong I loved the book and must reccomend it to anyone who lives in America and would like to explore the country without the actual effort."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"It's remarkable that John Steinbeck's \\"Travels With Charley\\" can seem so contemporary, given that it reflected his experiences across America in 1960, and his interest in looking back at his life at least as much as looking to the future. Stenbeck's remarkable skills of observation and his ability to winnow material to the most memorable aspects enable him to carry off this tough trick. And yet, it's also a book that feels very dated in parts, and, frankly, I find it surprising that most reviewers have given it such high ratings, given the things that hit with a clank occasionally.In his chronicle of 3 months of driving in the fall and early winter of 1960 in a custom-made truck camper, Steinbeck hits on things that concern us today, and which were just coming to the consciousness of thoughtful people at the time. He writes about the dying towns in Maine, the growth of suburbs (especially in Seattle and Portland), the homogenization of food along the interstates and of language everywhere. He writes about Americans' restlessness to move from their birthplace, but yet, the tug to return. He writes about our love affair with the automobile and the open road -- and the damages that it creates.Steinbeck renders these ideas with lovely language, humor, and often-biting commentary. This book is more colorful, more mellifluous than his novels, which are searing but not always pretty. Who knew he could be such a prose stylist?And when Steinbeck takes on race in the final chapters of the book, his commentary is decisively angry. It's almost a surprise because it comes at the end of a book in which he's mostly trying to find a Thoreau-like calm amidst a churning America. When he gets to the worst churn in the country at the time -- the nascent civil rights movement and the violent reactions to it -- he steps right into the flame. And remember, this is in 1960, and he writes that he knew the \\"end game\\" would be equal rights, but he was worried about the route it would take to get there. Brave stuff.So, those are the positives. However, I found a few things to be jarring in this book that I would imagine would not appeal to a current reader.1. He's sexist. Women are judged by their looks and their morals (and men are supposed to always pursue the loose women, but marry the pure ones).2. He drinks constantly, and drink seems to be the lever that opens up everyone. He'll pull off the road, drink a beer or two, and then start driving again through the night. On the one hand, his drinking reflects his time and his temperament; on the other hand, I'm always suspicious of someone who claims to do his best work while under the influence.3. He's corny. He hates traffic. He talks to his dog. He pours a belt and sits a spell by the river. He sees a rancher by the side of the road and stops to make small talk. The rancher responds with one-word sentences. Steinbeck remarks: \\"You talk too much.\\" The rancher answers: \\"That's whut the missus says.\\" Ugh. How about this one... Speaking to an unnamed storekeeper in Wisconsin, he asks him why people are afraid to have serious conversations any more, and when they do, it's only to complain. \\"Why, I remember when people took everything out on Mr. Roosevelt. Andy Larsen got red in the face about Roosevelt one time when his hens got croup. Yes, sir, those Russians got quite a load to carry. Manh has a fight with his wife, he belts the Russians.\\" I felt like Steinbeck was traveling in an alternative world in which dialogue had to be Woody Guthrie lyrics.4. Finally, I found the dog parts (Charley) to be tiresome as often as they were interesting. I certainly didn't need to hear about Charley's urinary habits and problems over and over again. After the first time, I didn't it was funny that Charley was supposed to be a sophisticated dog because he was born in France. I can't stand it when people focus on their dogs instead of on people, especially if other people are in their presence. I know I'd be trying to kick Charley under the table if I'd been sitting with Steinbeck.So, while this is an interesting book and has some charming and memorable vignettes, it's definitely a \\"period piece\\" in the same way that a film noir from the 50s is a period piece. If you like the period, it's great. If you don't, it will feel very dated."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"The book was excellent, except for the missing page. I had to return it and I am still looking for another centennial edition."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"It's unfortunate that this recording by Gary Sinise is not available on CD. If you still have a casette player somewhere, this is the recording to listen to. Great Story."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I love Steinbeck, so I try to read what ever he has written. This book was a total surprise, it is so diferent from his other books. I think this would appeal to people who are not Steinbeck fans. For the loyal reader it is a surprise to see his veiw of a country on the bring of the Interstate revolution. He observation of trailor park life is great, and I hear you can see the truck that he drove at the Steinbeck Museum in California.This is one of my 3 favorite travel books. The other two being On the Road and Henry Rollins's \\"get in the van\\". If your going on a raod trip you should bring along one of these books so that you can enjoy the down time."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Leaving Long Island, Steinbeck traveled to Maine, turned west through Chicago, arrived in Seattle, went south to Monterey, east through Texas, into New Orleans, up through Virginia, and home. And, he did so in just over 200 pages. Indeed, Steinbeck's Travels with Charley leaves one with the distinct impression that, once he had embarked on his journey, he immediately wished he would have stayed put. Rocketing through space and time, Steinbeck provides little outwardly oriented beyond conversations with cordial strangers and whimsical references to his dog. A veteran reader of travel writing will undoubtedly mark the lack of cultural, geographical, geological, or historical context. Steinbeck claimed to be in search of America, but, strangely, spent most of his time locked in his truck.Indisputably one of America's greatest novelists, it is not, perhaps, unthinkable to surmise that Steinbeck was a reluctant travel writer. He lacks the humor of Bryson, the dedication of Heat-Moon, and, well, there's just no comparison with Twain. Unlike the bona fide wanderer, Steinbeck never seemed to warm to his task. He turned inwards peforming, perhaps, an inventory of preconceived notions rendering Travels with Charley more autobiographically than externally motivated. He raced out, then raced back in and, in the interim, gave us bits of himself. This is not to say that Travels with Charley is hopeless. Quite the contrary. It is a good book. But, it is not a good travel book. Don't expect one and all will be well. 4 stars."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"T. Griffin After reading Travels with Charley I have new insights on many things. He broadens your perspective on subjects that you would never even think about. John Steinbeck's journey across America was like being in a movie. Everything he did he described in every full and minor detail so the reader was able to follow along with him as if you were really there. I rate this book a 9. It was almost a 10 but I'm extremely picky about my books. This has been one of the best book I've ever read, though. Steinbeck has many different opinions and sayings on everything under the sun. My favorite was his opinion on God and life and us. He said, &quot;It is our practice now...to find from our psychiatric priesthood that our sins aren't really sins at all but accidents that are set in motion by forces beyond our control.&quot; This phrase of his made me think for a long time after and I enjoyed discussing it with other readers from my class. I recommend this book to everyone and hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"&quot;travels with charley&quot; is perhaps one of the best books i have read, it is on my shelf of favorite books. as a college bound senior, i decided to read this book out of free will, but realized its fantastic potential as a book for my literature class and also as a tool for the AP Literature test.i've read other Steinbeck books such as &quot;the grapes of wrath&quot; and &quot;of mice and men&quot;, but i don't think that one can get a real feel for Steinbeck's gift as a writer until they read &quot;travels with charley&quot;.not only does this book try to discover america, it is a book about what we all know as life. a few reviews from undoubtedly miseducated people said the book was &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;narrow-minded&quot;. anyone who says that does not deserve to read Steinbeck. Steinbeck explores all sides of things, at times he even doubts himself. he is an american, with shortcomings and all. Steinbeck stands out from many writers because he speaks from actual experience.what amazed me most about this book was that practically every page has an exquisite oneofakind statement...those types that you don't come across very often...a book of favorite quotations could be made out of &quot;travels with charley&quot;.at this point in my life i am a &quot;prisoner of education&quot;. &quot;travels with charley&quot; is Steinbeck's legacy. if you are like me, you should read this book, lest you never get to live the journey that Steinbeck did."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I began John Steinbeck's \\"Travels With Charley\\" with great interest and expectation. It struck me as interesting that the author made this journey, at least partly, over concern that he had written himself out. Indeed, he compares his journey to Don Quiote tilting at windmills. If anything, this book proves that idea wrong. However, this is a bittersweet journey for Mr. Steinbeck, perhaps epitomized by \\"You can't go home again.\\"He seems to be a little disconcerted from the start. He had traveled a great deal in Europe and now found how much American had changed; Steinbeck found himself ill at ease with what he found, as we all would when change erases what we grew up with.This book gives us a close one-on-one relationship with the author in this book, since he is directly addressing the reader with his thoughts. I must confess at being a little at odds with some of his atitudes. This came most strongly with his encounter with two coyotes. He wants to shoot them both, but stops himself and lets them go. To him they are varmints, something to be exterminated, and this knee-jerk reaction is reactionary rather than a more thoughtful encounter with two fellow creatures that inhabit this earth. Over the years, coyotes have been, and still are, mercilessly hunted. I disagree with Steinbeck in that coyotes have the same right to exist as we do, and humans are, in truth, more trouble than we are worth.The bittersweet quality is most apparent when Mr. Steinbeck returns to Monterey, the setting of so many of his books, and when meeting his friends he finds things have changed too much. Charley, also, gives him reason to worry with urinary problems that eventually do get cured. The book is most interesting when Mr. Steinbeck is among people he does not know and asks them questions about themselves and their lives.So, I find this an interesting book that raises many issues about what America was and is today, and is important to understanding John Steinbeck as he grew old. I was never so thrilled when I saw Rocinante, the truck he drove on this journey, at the National Steinbeck Center. One almost expected to see the author seated in the cabin slotted in the bed of the truck. This is a journey I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"It was an excellent book for someone just to sit back and read"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Once again, John Steinbeck has proved to be one of the best writers of all time. An incredibly easy read, which really strikes at the heart of all that is good and bad in america."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"At the beginning of this book, I was confused by the story line because it didn't seem to have anything to do with traveling across the country. It was all about a week at the author's house. After a bit of reading though, Steinbeck starts his trip across the United States with his dog Charlie. I was interested in this book because I have driven across the country with my dog also. Before I bought this book, I thought it would all be the stereotype of America and not include what you would really see, but, in my opinion, all through the book he was right about everything. He makes it seem like you're really there and with him. He does a great job at describing things, from his dog Charlie to the roads he passes. This is a very addicting and wonderful book and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"I love Steinbeck. Travels With Charley only makes me love him more. The way he writes just touches people so easily. It's not at all difficult to read, but, at the same time, it is incredibly poetic."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Travels with Charley is a story which can be read and appreciated by all ages. for the young it offers a kindhearted and rich story of a man and his dog. For adults, the book offers a road story on par with On the Road. Steinbeck's treatment of Charley (and even his anthropomorphization of his mobile home) are reminiscent of Kerouac.Most people's first encounter with Steinbeck is in grade school because of the accessibility of his lanuage. I find I appreciate his work more now, as an adult, than I ever did as a kid.Also check out his other very warm hearted books for kids and adults - Cannery Row and Tortilla Flats."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Steinbeck's Travels With Charley is not one of his better-known books; however, it is the all-time best book that has ever been written,"},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"With wisdom that can only be attained through years of true living. Steinbeck captures the true essence of what it means to be an American. His legendary &quot;travels&quot; epitomize the American experience in a manner that is impossible to surpass. He deals remarkably well with the constant and ongoing struggle for Americans to form a unique identity. Although these are the main issues, there are several innuendoes of other topics, such as human independence, self-reliance, and devotion. This book is a most prudent example of the American character and how we Americans live our daily lives. Steinbeck harnesses all these powers in his historic novel, Travels With Charley."},{"Title":"Travels With Charley","review":"Like my one line summary says Travels with Charley was a required book for one of my high school english classes. Although I love to read I usually don't enjoy being forced to read a book that I did not pick out. The only major thing wrong about this book (besides the sometimes excessive details) was the way he portrayed my home town- Detroit Lakes. Although it was just a little segment in the book I felt that he looked at our town as a little hick town. It may have been in 1960 but I assure everyone now that is definitly not."},{"Title":"Collins Greek-English Dictionary (English and Greek Edition)","review":"This dictionary and the other companion collins english-greek helped me improve my greek knowledge.Recommendable.However I advise the greek language lovers to visit 'www.books-in-greek.gr' to find more sophisticated greek dictionaries and other useful items for building up their capacity."},{"Title":"Alien Dice (Alien Dice Series)","review":"I finally have my copy of AD, and I'm happy.If you have already read the e-comic you have tu buy it! specially if you want to know what happen before Lexx meet Chel.If you haven't read it, you're missing a great story ( what I like to call a perfect combination between shoujo and shonen)with action, romance, and shirtless aliens XD this comic it's the begin of all that.

I appreciate their ability to effectively communicate women's emotion in writing, which is not easy to do! I believe the lady authors do a superb job at capturing the emotions and lending that support for the female during the 1st year of marraige.The book also speaks on topics such as sex from both the male and female perspective...So the female authors explain what sex is like for the men-and the importance of making love with your husband, and the male authors explain sex to the men using a baseball analogy (first base, second base, third base, and home) to ensure they comprehend how to make love to your wife.There is also the middle section, \\"Meet in the middle\\" with activities/review material for the husband and wife to complete together once they have each read their portion.This is a very creative book! 2-in-1! I have never seen that!I will definately recommend this book to other newlyweds in my church!"},{"Title":"Most Important Year in a Woman's Life, The/The Most Important Year in a Man's Life","review":"I have been married for a year and a half and just read the book.

From one side, women can read about what to expect, how to handle, and generally what constitutes a good first year in a Christian marriage. From the opposite side of the book, men develop the same type of material. Then, in the middle, are questions and ideas to bring the two sides together. They tackle topics from a balanced, Christian perspective and give tremendous insight into both sides of the marriage relationship.The only issue I had with the book was that from the woman's perspective (yeah, I peaked in on that side :) there is great emphasis placed on the woman's ability to change the man. Though typical of our culture today, I think this is the only (though not necessarily insignificant) unbalanced part of the book. I would have liked to have heard on both sides of the book how both the husband and wife provide complimentary change into each other's lives. This then focuses on mutual change, dreams, and submission.Even with that problem, I think I could recommend this book to newly married couples as a good guideline on how to build a strong foundation for a life-long commitment to an imperfect person.For a full review, go to the blog in my screen name and click on the Readings category."},{"Title":"Most Important Year in a Woman's Life, The/The Most Important Year in a Man's Life","review":"My fiance and I each bought a book to read for our pre-martial counseling.

However, this book was given to my husband and me when we were engaged and we both loved it. Although it is geered towards couples who are newlyweds, we found the book great for getting us talking about key issues that we had never considered before, and working out problems before we were confronted with them in the marriage. We learned a lot about each other from this book, and even found it more helpful than our professional pre-marital counseling. We have since given this book to all of our young friends getting married."},{"Title":"Most Important Year in a Woman's Life, The/The Most Important Year in a Man's Life","review":"We read this before we got married and found that there were several \\"aha\\" moments and things we hadn't thought of.

It's a must read, and I'm sure we'll do it again somewhere down the road."},{"Title":"Most Important Year in a Woman's Life, The/The Most Important Year in a Man's Life","review":"My wife and I have both read this book (both sides of it) and found the information to be very good regarding the 'normals' each person brings to a marriage and how they are not necessarily \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" but just different. It helps open up discussion about things like sex, money, habits, toilet paper alignment, work, kids, in-laws, church, man/woman roles, etc. Although we didn't read it until after 2 years of marriage (we have read many other sources, though :)) we still pulled some good info from it.I like that the book reviewed the importance of both love and friendship. You can fall head over heels in 'attraction' for your mate, but if you have nothing in common and don't want to learn how to please or be a friend to them, it's going to be rough. When you can learn together, admit that you make mistakes, and each work on your 'issues', the friendship and marriage grows better. Your problems will NEVER be resolved if you just ignore them! Keep working on constant improvement.Another recommendation I liked is that each person should SAY what they want rather than trying to 'hint' at it. A woman who thinks, \\"if my husband really loved me, he would...\\" may never see it happen. I don't know about you, but I sure can't read minds and don't get the 'hints'. Thankfully, my wife tells me what is on her mind so I don't have to magically figure it out. It's so much less hassle that way.

I felt like I was talking to some of my parents friends trying to help me get started on the right foot and learn from their mistakes.

We skirted a potential scuffle about when Christmas presents are opened up, and really talked about the fact that I make more money than he does- something we hadn't discussed before.

Yes, maybe this is all \\"common\\" sense to some of you and it was for me but actually having a time-table and seeing it in black and white made a difference.The most important thing I read so far (still reading the book) is about how Christ is the bride groom and the church is the bride, and it lists the qualities of the Christ as the bridegroom.Yes, again I have heard it a million times, Ephesians ...etc but for some reason I found the way it was written to be powerful.Also, the \\"normal\\" in my own family may not be the \\"normal\\" behaviour in my wife's and again, this was not something I had thought of explicitly though I was aware of it, again seeing it in the book made it more concrete.Overall I think I am enjoying the book, in fact thinking of getting a copy for my cousin who is going to get married soon."},{"Title":"Most Important Year in a Woman's Life, The/The Most Important Year in a Man's Life","review":"This book had some great point in it and they were things that I brought up in the premarital counseling we are doing with our pastor right now but other than those handful of good ideas/points.

That's by Hokusai. He worked about 200 years ago, but his work is still fresh and vital.\\"Fresh\\" may seem an odd word to use about images made by the hundreds, and \\"vital\\" may seem odd when describing the days, weeks, or months needed to carve a set of wood block. Still, the images are clear, communicative, and decisive, as if one thought were held for the days or weeks of cutting a set of wood printing blocks.That freshness aslo belies the huge labor that went into each print, or set of prints (36 of Fuji, 100 of Edo). Each of them was based on a \\"key\\" block, the one that created the black outlines. Then there were more blocks in each color, usually one for each color, sometimes four or more of them. Then there were the various trial proofs of each block and combination of blocks. Then there was the effort of inking each block and pulling each impression uniquely. The \\"100 views\\" is beatiful, but also a statement of Hokusai's endurance.Hokusai also printed some shunga, \\"pillow books\\" allegedly used to show baffled newlyweds what goes where. Some are charming, some have outlandish exaggerations of both his and her genitals, and some (see the diptych p.157) are just strange - funny, but strange funny.This is a wonderful colletion of Hokusai's color and B&W; printing, along with a few brush drawings, and a very informative text. It's a wonderful book in its own right, but a wonderful addition to any library on printmaking or on world art.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Federalist","review":"The Federalist was an astonishing political document. Written for public consumption during the debate over adoption of the U.S. Constitution, it combined immense learning and sophistication with shrewd insights into the nature of politics in a republic. It's an essential text for anyone interested in American political history or constitutional theory. In fact, the Federalist should be essential readingt for any educated American: it remains an unparalleled example of realistic political analysis being placed in the service of political ideals.After more than 200 years, the Federalist has lost little of its relevance. The sections on judicial review and Presidential nominations, for example, could have been written about current controversies over judges. Likewise, the discussion of Presidential war powers, or the emphasis on checks and balances as essential to the preservation of liberty, are eerily topical in an age of pre-emptive war and one-party control of Washington. Even when the analysis is wildly dated -- as with the Commerce Clause or slavery -- the reader can see how far Constitutional doctrine has wandered from the \\"intent\\" of the Founders.The Federalist is also superb as literature: the writing is droll and eloquent, once you get used to the long, convoluted sentences. The introduction by Benjamin Wright is excellent and helps to place the text in political and intellectual context. I don't know why I wasn't forced to read the Federalist at law school! Six stars.Note: Contrary to one review below, God is hardly mentioned in the Federalist, and then only as a rhetorical flourish. The Federalist has countless references to ancient Greece and Rome, but none to the Old or New Testaments. It is a thoroughly secular document. Religious nationalists and other conservatives should actually read it."},{"Title":"The Federalist","review":"Each essay is highlighted by a description of the reason for the publishing and the target of the work, and the timing of it.."},{"Title":"The Federalist","review":"This is an excellent book. The text is larger and easier to read.

This assessment of basic human rights and freedoms should be required reading for all kids, and repeat reading for adults with any appreciation of history and/or politics. Its lessons and statements are universal, and should not be examined as simply a part of US history, but rather how the lessons may be applied elsewhere in parts of the world that are still stuck in the Dark Ages."},{"Title":"The Federalist","review":"We want our founders to be demi-gods and our original texts to be divinely inspired. For an example of this nonsense, please see the first review on this page.I want to offer a vision of The Federalist in historical context. I will argue that to see it thus enlarges its greatness will allowing us to admit its faults.In many ways, the developments that led to the Constitution of 1787 started as soon as colonists reached our eastern shores. We had at least 150 years of experimentation in writing charters and in representative governance behind us by 1787. After the Declaration of Independence the States either wrote new constitutions or reaffirmed old charters. The national government wrote the Articles of Confederation and we lived under that from 1781 to the late 1780s.The Federalist should be seen as part of that ongoing development. More specifically, it should be seen as part of the ratification debates in New York. Largely written by Madison and Hamilton, these papers reflect the compromises that the founders made in regards to the Constitution. Madison had wanted the President to have a veto over any state laws. Hamilton had favored a President for life during good behavior (read #78 in re the appointment for life of federal judges to sense the fervor that Hamilton felt for the benefits of lifetime tenure). Neither man believed in the necessity of a Bill of Rights. Madison eventually saw the political necessity of such amendments. During the first United States Congress he wrote up the Bill of Rights and guided them through passage. This way he could make sure they did not grow too numerous.As a whole then The Federalist should be seen as rhetorical and political arguments for passage of a Constitution that the authors had some doubts about.Of course, as Publius they could express no doubts. Madison, Hamiltion and Jay used this pseudonym which was a typical rhetorical device of elite writers at the time. (See Saul Cornell's The Other Founders for a nice discussion of the variety of rhetorical strategies used by writers during the ratification debates.) The idea was that hiding their identities would allow readers to focus on the quality of their arguments. As a result, there are many passages that can strike the modern reader as duplicitous because Publius pretends to know nothing of what went on during the convention. Madison and Hamilton, of course, were instrumental throughout the Constitutional Convention.Publius works his explication of the need for the Constitution by critiquing the Articles of Confederation then by going thru the new document, article by article supposedly answering all objections. His counterarguments are largely of two types. In the first type, he will state a political principle so \\"obvious\\" that any \\"candid\\" reader will instantly agree to it. Publius then builds his arguments from there. The famous paper #10 is one such chain of argument. Or Publius will demolish the arguments offered against the Constitution by pointing out that the article objected to is contained in some or many of the States' constitution and have resulted in no such problems. Many of these arguments are justly famous. Number 10 is very much worth reading. (Although I still find it curious that when Madison asserts that a man's property holdings has a great influence on the way he thinks it is celebrated as political realism but when Marx says much the same thing it is decried as class warfare. But that's just me.)But the reader really does get a sense at to how much thought went into the various checks and balances and the competing claims of the states and the new national government. To me this is where the glory of the book lies. We as a people thought our way out of the failure of our first experiment in nation building. We avoided civil war (for a while) and did not become the victims of foreign manipulation. We don't have to make our founding fathers and mothers demi-gods. In their fully flawed humanity, they dazzle aplenty.Finally, it should be noted that The Federalist as a piece of political rhetoric avoided some issues entirely. The main problem that most Anti-Federalists had with the proposed Constitution in re jury rights had to do with the following phrase: \\"such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed\\" (Article 3, Sec.2, Para. 3). Whig thought at that time insisted on juries being as local as possible. Blackstone stated that jury trials should be held within the county of the crime. This guaranteed that local knowledge of the crime, the defendant and the victim would be maximized in the jury pool. Trying cases in distant jurisdictions or without juries had been some of the main provocations of the British prior to the revolution. Men like Patrick Henry saw that phrase in the Constitution as a clarion of the tyranny to come from the new national government. The Federalist does not speak to this issue at all. Instead, Hamilton focuses on arguments about whether jury trials are guaranteed for civil cases and even has Publius argue that maybe we should limit jury trials a little because juries are so bad with complicated issues, blah, blah.Should all Americans read this book? Yeah, probably. Are we the worse if they don't? Again, probably yes, but what we really need as a people is more of a sense of our history. I would rather have more people read a good series of books on our history as a whole (I recommend the Oxford History of the United States as one excellent ongoing series).But if you want to get to know two great minds at work on political issues that are still relevant then this is your book. Forget Locke, Montesquieu and Rousseau. Their philosophies are antiquarian in a way that Publius is not."},{"Title":"The Federalist","review":"Having experienced Cliff's Notes in college years ago, it was what I expected.

In 92 short (5x8) pages, McDermott introduces one to the key sources, the key scholars who are writing about the formation of ancient Israel, and the key arguments written by these scholars.One meets the Amarna letters, the Shashu, the Merneptah Stela, and the Ugaritic texts. One also meets Herzov, Halpern, Ahlstrom, Redford, and others. McDermott puts forward the key arguments of these scholars. For example both Redford and Halpern argue that Israel came into Canaan from outside. Then McDermott points out the shortcomings of these arguments.What are they saying about the formation of Israel? This is it in a nutshell."},{"Title":"What Are They Saying About the Formation of Israel?","review":"This book lets you know about the biases of many scholars who wish to revise the biblical account or reconcile it with modern methods of doing archaeology and \\"biblical studies.\\" However the scholars are far from being 'decided' about the issue. In fact this author admits that although the evidence suggests a mixed background rather than a single model, the question of Israel's origins is still open and awaits new discoveries about the ancient world. The author attempts to move beyond the 3 competing theories on Israelite beginnings (1) conquest, (2) peaceful infiltration, and (3) social revolution by surveying the textual as well as the archaeological evidence and finds the latter insufficient to draw any definitive conclusions. This is likely to remain the status quo for quite a while... unless some one comes up with a full-proof method to reinvent the past better than the best textual records handed down."},{"Title":"Java 2 for Professional Developers","review":"I spent about an hour flipping through various books before choosing this one. The writing seemed pretty clear, and there seemed to be enough examples to give an experienced programmer in other languages a good starting point for learning Java. However, I discovered several things about the examples in the book -1) The source code isn't on the company's web page, as described in the book.2) The company won't provide the source code, meaning you have to type it in (not a huge deal, just an inconvenience)3) The source code does not compile (The Tstore example has at least seven compiler errors) and it isn't obvious to a non-experienced Java programmer how to fix it.4) The author's website/e-mail doesn't exist.5) E-mail to the publisher about the problems go unanswered.So you're left with a book for which you paid for, and if like me, without the experience to correct the errors.

Errors in the code samples, cross-references, figures, and text just make things worse. Also, MacMillan/Sams Publishing seems unable to post the sample code files on their website, as promised in the book. And don't bother with the author's email or website.

He jumps from one subject to another, from his 'hospital' application to UML, then back, then to threads, then ... There is no complete text of application itself, only pieces. Thus it gives nothing to 'professional' developer.I also dunno who is supposed to read it. From beginning it looks like it is for novice, but in fact it would become incomprehensible (for novice) just in 20 pages. But why bother about simple examples on threads, awt etc then?There are no topics which completely covered. Author gives NO explanations on UML, although he uses it. He quickly discusses software development, but never shows how to apply it and never uses on his example (which is, as I told, incomplete). Etc etc.Actually, a year ago I found this book too difficult to me and put it on the shelf in the hope id read it in some time. 4 months ago I did, and found nothing more than empty phrases on academic subjects and trivial (and bad) Java basics.If you will find this book in thrift store, buy it and throw away."},{"Title":"Java 2 for Professional Developers","review":"No one has ever covered Java programming the way Mike Morgan has.

They are excruciatingly detailed, erudite, exact, and best of all are completely searchable and browsable. So one may ask why a Lisp Machine user might ever need a book outside of the Document Examiner? Well, despite the vast amount of documentation and the fantastic interactive searching and browsing capabilities of the online documentation, a new user can barely hope to learn anything from them because they are entirely too detailed and complex. Symbolics helpfully provides some simplistic teaching manuals but it's often very difficult to keep switching back and forth between DocEx and the Dynamic Lisp Listener or Zmacs. There's also a fairly large gap between the exercises provided in the Genera docs for a new user to become familiar with the system, and for a programmer to start writing new software. That's where this book comes in.Although the book was originally written for Genera 7 it is still in most ways very up to date. It provides simple examples of using the Genera system, and how to get around in the network. More importantly it provides lots of information and examples of writing both simple and complex software for Genera. Toy programs are given, along with intricate programs using most of the advanced features of the Genera environment. One of the more entertaining examples is a Solitaire program. Exercises are given at the end of each chapter, and every exercise is well tuned to the expected knowledge of the reader as they progress through the chapters.The only drawback of the book is that it is somewhat out of date. Instead of object-oriented programming with CLOS, available in Genera 8, the book gives examples in New Flavors, which was superseded by CLOS but is still heavily used in the internals of Genera. New Flavors is however a generic function style of OO programming, which isn't too far from that of CLOS, although the message passing paradigm of Old Flavors is still evident. Other advanced features of Genera only available in the more modern releases of this decade are uncovered in this book as well.All in all, a fantastic book for anyone who works with Symbolics Lisp Machines to have around. Unquestionably the ideal book to learn the system from and to learn the feel of programming in Genera. Users of other flavors of Lisp Machines may also find it helpful, although the book is unashamedly biased towards Symbolics systems."},{"Title":"Maximum PC 2005 Buyer's Guide","review":"While we are well on our way through 2005, this book still has merit for many readers. Its attraction is the clear language and objectivity of its assessments of the myriad types of hardware and software associated with personal computing. Buttressed by technical explanations of new features, like command queuing, or how to set up a tri monitor display.Even if you have no specific need in mind, this guide is nice for its overview of the entire PC arena. It neatly characterises waht is available in 2004-5. One day, future historians of technology might also find this book valuable, on this account."},{"Title":"Maximum PC 2005 Buyer's Guide","review":"Written by the chief editor of Maximum PC, a magazine devoted to modding and overclocking but not particularly good at it, this is a very poorly written and edited \\"book\\" that's basically just a compilation of equally poorly written and edited articles from the magazine's 2003 issues. Published last summer, it's already out-of-date. But that's not its true vice; the problem is 1) it has a lot of factual errors, and 2) it doesn't give you critical comparisons you need to choose among the products in each category.The book is broken into sections by the different PC components: mobo, CPU, hard drive, etc. Each section begins with some general information which is too simple for power users yet too difficult-to-understand for beginners. If you fall in the middle, you would have found this useful, except the author keeps saying everything is great and dandy, so you end up not knowing which technology or brand you should pick. An author who's more critical and opinionated would have been more helpful.For example, between Intel and AMD CPUs, and among the many different models, which one should you buy? There are 12 pages on processors, but the section reads like a typical magazine article that says \\"model A has features 1-2-3, model B has features 7-8-9, but the higher numbers are not necessarily better than the lower ones, except if you are willing to overclock, which BTW may void your warranty, if not causing your PC to explode if not done properly, but you should really do it because the manufacturer says it's okay as long as you do it right, which BTW BTW is not possible if you didn't buy and read the last 20 issues of our magazine.\\" You get my point.One more critical point from this reviewer: when a book like this recommends specific products, you are never sure if these products are truly the best in their respective categories, or they are here only because the manufacturers pay the author or publisher or both some kind of kickbacks. One thing I learned working in different industries in the past is how corrupt private businesses are, despite our country's having the best legal system in the world. Kickbacks and \\"soft money\\" are just everywhere. Anyway, many products in this book are of dubious usefulness or quality, and there are certain better products out there, so one must be skeptical about the author's picks, esp. when he works for a magazine and publishing company that relies entirely on advertising dollars for profits. (Organizations like Consumer Reports do not accept advertising and are thus more trustworthy in their reviews.)This book is a waste of money. Books like PC Bible have more in-depth and, more importantly, *accurate* information that you can rely on."},{"Title":"Maximum PC 2005 Buyer's Guide","review":"Yep, it's a recap of the last years magazine articles.

There are alot of symboloisms found through out the novel that allow you to better understand the plot. It gives the reader a vivid picture of what was actually going on. The only problem I saw with it was the use of different names for each character. I saw myself going back and forth. I do believe that the subject matter is much deeper than what meets the eye.

The book discusses many touchy subjects in which society doesn't talk about that much. The way the book is written is different. It switches time frames and goes back and forth alot. You really have to pay attention to what your reading about. If you like out of the ordinary touchy subjects then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story","review":"Attila A Barbarians Bedtime Story is a uniquely written book by Peter Hargitai. In this book we are taken through a journey with a boy who leaves his communist country as a boy to be free as man. This book is a collection of drama, sarcasm, fantasy, reality, and illusions. I was honored to have had the pleasure of reading this book so wonderfully written by a talented author."},{"Title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story","review":"From the moment Professor Hargitai began to read a short passage of his book , I knew that this would be a book that I would be totally interested in. I think what caught me attention most in the book was all of his refences to sex and sexual behavior. His word usage is sometimes so graphic (but in good taste) that I feel I might have to cover my eyes if my mother came into the room. At some points the the story it would become a bit confusing because of all the names he would use and all of the flashbacks. I also didn't understand where mythology fit into the story, but I would probally have to read further into that to understand it. Overall I would really recommend this book to anyone who has an open mind and is looking for a great book to read."},{"Title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story","review":"This book from Peter Hargitai is something other than a bedtime story. It is about a family from Hungary that travels to America and begin to show their true inner self as time passes by. This book is so interesting since it talks about fantasy and the truth about dreams needing to reveal themselves as our unknown side. The book is for everyone since it can allow you to open up your mind and give imagination to those who are creative.It will not allow you to go to sleep but to another world since it constantly goes from the present back to the past having you flip through pages and making the book a non ending exciting travel through time."},{"Title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story","review":"The book Attila is extremely confusing. The first part of the book deals with a lot of flashbacks so this makes it hard to keep up. But the main point of the book is the life of a little boy named Attila how is Hungarian and is going through very tough times in his life. He passes through many obstacles and Hargatai makes you feel like if you were living them with Attila. He describes the scenes very vivid and you feel like you want to keep on reading to find out what will happen to poor little Attila next. Over all it is a good book and I recommend it to those who like details."},{"Title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story","review":"The book Attila discusses a young boy's journey from childhood to adult. The author Peter Hargitai does a good job at portraying the mixed emotions and experiences a boy faces as he is growing up. The beginning of the book displays cliffhangers for the readers as Attila goes through life and death situations. But there is an excessive use of flashbacks in the first half of the story that confuses the reader. The second half of the book should be completely deleted from the book, as it focuses on the future. As a whole, Attila is a good piece of literature. All it needs is some beneficial editing."},{"Title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story","review":"Attila, A Barbarian's Bedtime Story, is such an interesting book I asked my college English teacher to review it with me. The book contains taboo social topics such as incest, and death eroticism as seen through the eyes of a child on his way to adulthood. The book also contains action and a bit of mythology. I recommend this book to any reader who enjoys a good complex story with many characters, guaranteed to keep the reader on his toes."},{"Title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story","review":"What a wonderful journey from a boy in Hungry, who flees to America and struggles to fit in and flees again but this time from his family. It captured a perfect image of the trouble the author went through and how he dealt with them. This book was exciting, funny, and at some times sad, over all I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a great inspirational book. I think everyone should read this book, especially if they want to be inspired or just read an exciting book."},{"Title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story","review":"\\"Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story\\" is a true story about a young Hungarian boy living first in Hungary and then in America.

At first it was hard for me to understand any of the book. I actually had to start reading it all over again after 50 pages or so. Once i started over, i finally started to understand the book, and i must say it is a very fine piece of work. The only thing that was a little confusing were the events that were taking place in the book. Maybe it would have been easier if the author didnt jump to so many scenes and different times. But overrall this was a interesting book."},{"Title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story","review":"As soon as I started to read Attila, I couldn't put it down. Not overlooking the fact that at times it was a bit difficult to follow the various names of the characters, I enjoyed the challenge because it kept my mind focused. I found myself not just skimming over the sentences, but actually reading into every word. Peter Hargitai created wonderful images of Attila' s fantasy and reality which helped keep my interest and imagination going."},{"Title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story","review":"Peter Hargitai's novel, Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story is a complex journey through the author's life and his psychological sturggles. Beginning as a young, intimidated child with a weak bladder and weak nerves, Hargitai's protagonist Attila and family escapes from Hungary to relocate in America. Despite the highly emotional and psychologically developmental content of the first half of the story, the flow was choppy. Jumping back and forth through time and settings, it is often difficult to follow - thus inhibiting a comfortable, fluid reading pace. The Hungarian references and words also interfere with the clarity for the universal audience. As the story goes on, it becomes more and more fantastical as the protagonist (who is also his own antagonist), becomes a goddly figure. As a reader I had difficulty, at first, understanding story, but the further I read and the more time I let for it to sink in, the more I could relate the character's journey to that of my own. Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story is a novel that sheds light on the truth of human nature and the human imagination. Escaping from reality, Attila transforms himself into the hero hidden within everyone. This novel is a fantastic story that can relate to the sensitive ego of the human race, despite the weakness of its flow."},{"Title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story","review":"In Peter Hargitai's novel Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story, he descibes to the reader a journey he encountered. He tells about his travel from Hungary to America. Hargitai uses flashbacks to let the reader know about pepople in his life and things that have happened to him. Although this book is hard to follow at times because it jumps back and forth, it has a good story line and once one finishes the book it will make more since. If you are a person you enjoys reading and can stay with a book then this is a good book for you...if you are the complete opposite and cannot read a book that is quite complicated then this may not be the book for you."},{"Title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story","review":"Attila, is a very complex and interesting book which describes many forbidden topics. I believe this book is not apt for everyone to read. It takes an active and dedicated reader to understand and get through all the book before going mad. At times it was very confusing due to the immense amount of flashbacks. Attila is definitely an interesting character who lived great adventures. As a reader is difficult to distinguish the character's fantasy from reality. I would recommend the book to a reader with an ample vocabulary,who enjoys reading and who has a lot of time available.

Throughout the whole book, &quot;Attila&quot; is unsucessfully trying to find his &quot;niche&quot; in the world. His true purpose shows itself when he excapes global armaggedon on a spaceship, and takes his place as a deity, watching over a ficticious world."},{"Title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story","review":"If I were to recommend this book to anyone I would tell them that is very to possible to read it all at once- because of the many characters mentioned and different situations that occur- it is very easy to get lost while reading it- if you read it by parts. It is very interesting to see how subjects that were forbidden are mentioned so free and so raw in this book. Hargitai shows the reader the drama of his life- he does not just tells us but shows us- with descriptive scenarios and epiphanies. He includes flashbacks and thoughts that go through his mind and that's where it becomes a little bit confusing."},{"Title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story","review":"I read this book and was a bit confused at times. There are alot of flashbacks and flash-forwards, which make it hard to follow. Also, the end becomes a mythological tale, which I thought did not have to do with the book. Still, it has potential, and can be revised into a great book."},{"Title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story","review":"Peter, this book is in need of some help. You had sex, death, action, all the key elements. The only thing was the lack of order in the books context. The class all agreed on the exclusion of part three, good idea. Just look over all the flash fowards and flash backs. Maybe leave less to the readers imagination."},{"Title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story","review":"This book exposed me to things I've never ever experienced in my life. It is an interesting read, if only you read it with an open mind and accept what the author has to say. The one thing i related to in this book were the struggles the author went through moving from one country to another, which is something i've done as a child, where I've escaped from violance in my country. The abuse and neglect the author went through however, was something new to me. It is something i've never experienced, so i did not quite relate to what he was saying.

Even though I had to get the energy to read, because I am one interested in non-fiction literature, I found myself comsumed in the storys plot. The many flashbacks first gave the emotion of anxiousness to know what would happen next, yet the character of Attila did not please me because in a way I did not like him. Personally I dont agree with suicide or murdering your own wife, but thats Attila. Though he did have unique relationships with a few other characters. Also I was cinfused throughout the whole Part 3. Other than that, thank you Mr. Hargitai for the great Hungarian literature and the imagination which I would have never thought of myself."},{"Title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story","review":"The book started of on the right foot.It captivated my attention and kept me entertained, but it then lost its path through too many flashbacks. The story had it's captivating moments were it would grab my attention but it would soon enough have a ramdom flashback and throw me off course. Part one and two were related to each other, but part three was in another world.

At moments you don't know where you are.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys and knows about Hungarian mythology.

As I write this, I am currently shopping for a new boat with a friend and reading each review is like sitting down with a knowledgeable person that owns each boat.In addition to the areas covered above, there is also a great summary and Sailing Magazine Value Guide that covers: Price, design quality, construction quality, user-friendliness, safety, typical condition, refitting, support, availability, investment and resale, and overall 'SVG' rating.The only criticism I have is that the author is definitely biased in what he likes and doesn't like and makes it apparent while reading. He is extremely qualified in his opinions, but they are just that - opinions. So just keep that in mind while reading and buy based upon what YOU want, not just what the author likes.That said, that is also what gives the author credibility. His reviews are not just 'glam-shots' of the boats. Each boat and it's shortcomings are discussed, but the boat is not simply shot down.Would I buy a boat without reading this book in-depth? No way. This book is well worth the money even if you are not buying a boat as it will help you look at your current boat with some new ideas."},{"Title":"Used Boat Notebook: From the Pages of Sailing Magazine, Reviews of 40 Used Boats Plus a Detailed Look at Ten Great Used Boats to Sail Around the World","review":"Drawn from the pages of &quot;Sailing&quot; magazine and incorporating reviews of forty used boats (plus a detailed look at ten great used boats to sail around the world), Used Boat Notebook by professional delivery skipper John Kretschmer is a thoroughly &quot;user friendly&quot; guide for anyone looking to buy a used sailboat.

Rather it is a caution that many of the reviews in this collection are quite old and so are the boats reviewed. If you are new to sailing or own a day sailer of say 23' or less do not expect this book to prepare you to explore the overwhelming number of used boats currently for sale. Many of the boats reviewed have been out of production for many years and many of the companies that built them are out of business or have been acquired by other builders. The reviews include approximate selling prices for the boats but they are mostly used ships built in the 1970's.There is no doubt that many of the ships covered are considered \\"classics\\" and some, such as the Alberg 30, have active clubs of enthusiasts around the country.But people who are intent on owning a classic boat are a special breed. They are certainly not novices and they usually have deep pockets; either to buy a classic that has been lovingly and meticulously cared for (damn-the-cost!) or to rehabilitate an \\"abused\\" treasure that needs new rigging, sails, engine, wiring, electronics, stove, etc,etc, etc.The good:The author has a lengthy and deep knowledge of sailing ships. Even if you never see many of the boats reviewed you will gain a fundamental knowledge of the compromises that all yacht designers must make in hull shape, performance and comfort below decks. The specific problem areas he discusses for each boat will apply in general to any ship you may consider.In summary: For a great read on some of the great boats built in the last 35 years this is the book. Just don't plan on going to a marina (even at the major sailing locations in the USA) and expect to see very many examples of the ships reviewed in this book."},{"Title":"Used Boat Notebook: From the Pages of Sailing Magazine, Reviews of 40 Used Boats Plus a Detailed Look at Ten Great Used Boats to Sail Around the World","review":"Congrats on achieving what so many writters and sailors have tried to do.

It describes the culture in which our grandparents grew up, a time our political parties like to invoke as the essence of American, but a time which is long past. Basically, it is a number of little stories about the life of a small boy growing up on a farm. Although I gave it 4 stars, one should take that rating in context. This is not Dickens or Willa Cather by any stretch of the imagination. But as a book for children, which gives them a flavor of the past and which evokes many cultural references still common today, it is quite good. Helen Fuller Orton was one of my favorite authors back in third grade. Her writing is simple and clear. This would be a good book to read to one's grandchildren."},{"Title":"An Adair County, Kentucky history","review":"A unique book that is packed full of tidbits and snippets of information gleaned from the long history of Adair County, KY. There are many surnames of people who lived in this Kentucky county that crop up and can be useful for anyone searching for genealogical information of their ancestors in this area. I found several of my \\"England\\" and \\"Janes\\" lines in the book.

Gornick's intelligent essays are marked by the odd brand of effortlessness born only by writing that penetrates.

If you're on the fence, buy it now."},{"Title":"Approaching Eye Level","review":"This book really connected with me. Gornick is a great storyteller and a thoughful observer. She has a fabulous style of writing. It is clear, but so deep. She writes the most amazing insights about ordinary life. It is eloquent, insightful, but not overly academic like I usually expect books of essays to be. I love reading memoirs that reveal a lot about the author's world. If you like the genre, don't pass up this book."},{"Title":"Approaching Eye Level","review":"I really enjoyed reading Vivian Gornick's Approaching Eye Level, and I don't even live alone. I didn't read too much into Ms. Gornick's essays; I pretty much took them at face value. Her writing style can be described as a bit rambling but also conversational. She probably write just like she thinks.My favorite essay was the first one, which discussed her first jobs as a student. I just found them really entertaining, and I guess the one I could relate to the best. The other essays centered a bit around living alone, relationships (both friendships and marriage), and feminism. Overall, this book is a quick and interesting read. I certainly wanted to pick it up throughout the day to read - it wasn't a chore. I'll certainly read more from Ms. Gornick."},{"Title":"Approaching Eye Level","review":"Still trying to validate the paper it's printed on. The only thing I liked about the book was the design of the pages.

Guess I wasn't lonely enough to want to crawl up with this book....it made me fall asleep."},{"Title":"Mars - A Warmer, Wetter Planet (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"This book is one heavy read, both literally and figuratively! It's heavy! The book weighs a lot and your hands and arms get tired holding it up. It's printed on fine heavy paper with top quality pictures and it is very technical in many areas, complete with formulas and mathematical equations. While many times I found myself struggling to comprehend what I was reading; reading it over and over, and sometimes throwing in the towel and skipping over what I couldn't understand, for the most part it was a very enjoyable read.The author presents a convincing case for current subsurface reservoirs of water on Mars as well as evidence of erosion caused by glaciers and subsurface permafrost. He compares earth topography with similar features on mars and makes correlations between earth and Mars relative to the causes.The book is fresh view of Mars, its history, and current environment, that differs from the orthodox view and presents theories not well publicized. It is a great and engaging read for the technically minded reader."},{"Title":"Mars - A Warmer, Wetter Planet (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"This is a wonderful book. Some of it is challenging to read, like this: \\"I have reported that the spiral-structured troughs [in Mars' poles] have topographic forms and associated fine-scale tectonic features consistent with plate flexure similar to that seen in Earth's oceanic lithosphere around major loads, such as the Hawaiian Islands and in the vicinity of oceanic trenches\\". However, he doesn't assume the reader knows geology; he teaches it while telling you about Mars.The book is mostly about the role of water on Mars. Water has shaped the surface a lot, may have allowed life to evolve there, and will help humans to colonize Mars, if we do.Mars likely had oceans, a long time ago. But they weren't like the oceans of your experience. Maybe a mud ocean. Very, very salty, so it had a lower freezing point than water. Very very cold and a lot of sulfuric acid. He has a vivid description of what it would be like to take a dip.Mars' atmosphere was much more dense then, with a lot of warming from carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.There's no permanent water ice on the surface of Mars, only a temporary light frosting. But there are huge reservoirs of water ice under the ground or covered with dry ice. Mars has glaciers! The polar ice caps flow, so they're glaciers. And at lower latitudes, there are probably rock glaciers, meaning that ice underground lubricates the rocks so they can flow. Mars glaciers move much MUCH more slowly than Earth glaciers, like one ten thousandth as fast, because ice is very stiff at very cold Martian temperatures.There have been gigantic floods of *several cubic kilometers* per second, which flooded large parts of the surface.There may never have been rain on Mars, though.There's still a lot of water on Mars, but it's frozen underground. There are a lot of permafrost type terrains, such as polygonal cracking.Unlike on Earth, solid carbon dioxide is active in Mars geology. For example, layers of dry ice and CO2 clathrate play a part in how the polar ice caps flow.Mars' spin axis varies chaotically over hundreds of thousands of years. It changes much more than Earth's spin axis, which is stabilized by Earth's large moon. The tilt of Mars' spin axis is changed by torque applied by the Sun. So Mars' climate was quite different, very recently. The spin axis has been extremely tilted, like more than 80 degrees, almost in the plane of Mars' orbit around the Sun. When it gets that tilted, some areas get a lot of sunlight in the summer and can get a lot warmer and wetter.He thinks it's not far-fetched that microbial life would have evolved on Mars, since billions of years ago, Mars was fairly friendly to life. And maybe microbes still hang on to life on Mars somewhere underground. He gives a cute description of microbes living in Mars: growing little swords of salt precipitate to jab other microbes, growing tall like trees in their competition for nutrients.There's a detailed description of how Mars could be colonized: how to obtain water for people and for agriculture; how to synthesize oil on Mars since it probably has no fossil fuels. People might live in caves on Mars, created by volcanism, so they're shielded from the lethal radiation at the surface. The entire planet might be modified to be more friendly to humans. Maybe if the atmosphere became dense enough people could fly there.He describes the long-term future of Earth. Apparently life has reached a peak on Earth and the future will be a long slow decline. The Sun will be putting out more and more heat as it gets older, and over the next hundreds of millions of years, Earth life will fade away as the Earth gets hotter and hotter, and in time there will be only microbes left, and eventually even they will die, and the Earth will turn into a ball of magma with maybe an ice cap of metal snow on the side away from the Sun, which will become a red giant expanded out to the Earth's orbit and beyond ...He doesn't consider that animals might evolve refrigeration. After all, people have! Maybe a biological compressor will evolve.Mars will be getting warmer too. Life might begin there a billion years from now, when it's warmer and wetter and not yet geologically dead.The image of a geologist as a naturalist of rocks, armed with a pick and hammer, is clearly only a tiny part of the reality. He applies physics to Mars, tells how Mars works as a large-scale system where the energy of radioactive decay ultimately forms mountains; he talks about the chemistry of mineral synthesis on Mars.The book has lots and lots of images of Mars, produced by various imaging systems, and images of analogous places on Earth. There's a big color section in the middle of the book, which includes a map of Mars.The author seems to have a strong artistic side. He has a vivid imagination. He lightens his writing with wit, sometimes delightful: \\"I shall not go into the details of why the Cydonian theory falls on its Face, but rather I shall emphasize things geological that relate to The Face and its anthropomorphic friends.\\"It's hard reading, all right. He casually tosses acronyms like MOC, MOLA and THEMIS at you, and maybe he defines them in some buried location in the book, but I had to look them up online. He uses words like \\"diapirism\\" and \\"ultramafic\\" and didn't include a glossary. Don't read this book on an airplane, because you'll likely have to look up a lot of things.The book's index is not much help. Many words like \\"sublimation\\" and \\"sulfuric acid\\" that should be in it, aren't. I couldn't find passages again that I remembered reading. Unfortunately there's no ebook edition to search. A good index and a glossary would help the poor puzzled readers a lot.The view he presents seems to be pretty near the consensus of Martian scientists. This book is not in the genre of popular science writing that aims to fascinate with dramatic and very controversial theories. Instead it fascinates - and sometimes bewilders - with a phantasmagoric intensity of information.He flubs the English language sometimes, as in \\"eek out a living\\" :) Maybe he just cares more about the science than about getting his words quite right. His clumsiness with words doesn't happen often enough to interfere with the readability of the book.It's incredible how much people know about Mars. They must know even more now, since this book was published in 2004. If you have been occupied with concerns other than Mars in the last couple decades, and you suddenly turn to this book, a whole new world awaits you, brilliantly illuminated by the author's fascination."},{"Title":"Mars - A Warmer, Wetter Planet (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"A great book covering all the scientific data up to publication. a revised chapter covers the discoveries by the rovers of a Mars where rain fell from the skies and sulfate salts and halides precipitated to form sedimentary rocks.

Basically I found it outstanding value. It contains the 5 Sybex Exam Notes books in one volumne. I got it for 18 here in Ireland where normally each book costs about 22. As regards the content it is detailed enough to pass the exams when supplemented with practise exams and braindumps. I am currently studying for the SQL 7 Admin and using this books in conjunction with it's sister Test Success. The TS book is more exam orienated but this book fleshes out a number of sections nicely.

At the time I thought the work was pretentious and inaccessible.Many years later, I chose to read the novel and was amazed by it. The portrait of a parochial, socially and sexually repressed Mexican town \\"on the edge of the storm\\" of the Revolution is searing. Images from the novel have stayed with me long after plot details have been forgotten, and I remain impressed with Yanez' prose.The novel very deliberately incorporates the stream of consciousness techniques introduced by Joyce, and may be offputting to people who have little pacience with this narrative structure. On the other hand, the structure works well in providing snapshots of the tensions, needs, resentments, and pain of various villagers in isolated rural Jalisco. This is a work that is generally overlooked by people who have the Latin American literature bug. It shouldn't be, as it is one of the best novels from the region that I have read."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode 1: Podracer Punch-Outs","review":"The picture of the pod is intriguing, that's why I bought the product for my son.

Writing assignments included many sample topics; my students rarely needed help coming up with ideas after they read the book.

Apart from covering all the basics in a lot of detail, it offers checklists and (so-called) case studies. The downside of this is that the book starts out a bit dry and too straightforward, with instructions so clear-cut you would think they are for operating some sort of machinery. The \\"case-studies\\" are examples rather than studies, so the objection here lies with the misnomer. These are clearly minor drawbacks to a great book that only gets better as you read on.

I use it just about every day and it has come to the rescue more than once.Buy this book you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Microsoft Sql Server 7.0 Administrator's Pocket Consultant","review":"First, this is not a &quot;teach yourself book&quot; it is a reference, geared toward field engineers. With that said, this is a fabulous carry everywhere reference (small; roughly 8&quot;x5&quot;x1&quot; in size) that has just about everything you need to know (from a DBA perspective, that is) for maintaining/installing/etc. SQL Server 7.0. The book is broken into four sections:I. Administration Fundamentals - Configuring and TuningII. Administration - Managing Enterprise, Core DBA, SecurityIII.Data Administration - Backup/Recovery, Import/Export, Distributed Data/Remote Servers, ReplicationIV. Performance, Optimization, and Maintenance - Monitoring/Profiling, Creating Tables/Indexes, DB Automation/MaintenanceHaving worked with SQL Server for several years now, I have always dreamed of having a book that summarized (with examples) all aspects of installation and maintenance (and wasn't a 4&quot; thick luggable). Stanek has done it. The contents are well laid out with a very thorough index. Examples are well laid out (step-by-step) to get you through what-ever issue you are working with. The book contains stored procedure calls, but is not a Transact-SQL manual (actually it would be nice if the author would come out with a T-SQL Admin Pocket Guide also!).I consider this a must-have for every SQL Server DBA's library. It will not gather dust, but instead become VERY dog-eared."},{"Title":"Microsoft Sql Server 7.0 Administrator's Pocket Consultant","review":"I would say that this is a good addition to a DBA's library. It is small and light yet includes a lot of information. You can read it from cover to cover to get an overview or use it as a reference. It gives an overview and then the syntax and steps for doing each of the major DBA activities. I was able to find some information that I have not found anywhere else, viz., the role of log files for the tempdb database. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Microsoft Sql Server 7.0 Administrator's Pocket Consultant","review":"This book is compact (although pocket means coat pocket in this case) and well-indexed, so it's very handy to have with you if you in a pinch. Unfortunately, much of the book is devoted to explaining where things are in the UI (this button does this, that button does that). There are a few good how-does-this-work sections and lots of tip/best practice/real world insets, but in the final analysis they are only occasionally more helpful to me than the Books Online. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, there is precious little here about the gotchas inherent in certain operations--good SQL and GUI examples of how to accomplish a task, but not much to help you if something goes wrong. In short, if you're asking yourself how much depth there could be in a book whose title advertises that it will fit in your pocket, you should probably buy something else. But there are a lot of topics covered here, and the newer you are to SQL Server 7, the more use this book will be to you."},{"Title":"Microsoft Sql Server 7.0 Administrator's Pocket Consultant","review":"First book review I've ever written but this book deserves it.

This book covers all the basics. I would want to have a total coverage book around as well for reference, but for getting all the basic questions answered, this book does the job. It's hard to find answers to general questions in the heavier reference books due to their total coverage. This book gets to the point and tells you how to accomplish specific and important tasks.It's also light and small (relatively), so if you're a consultant you can easily carry it along with you.

More importantly it gives clear examples of syntax for things from ISQL and OSQL to creating jobs to run DTS packages.The one thing it needs to include is an FYI or &quot;gotchas&quot; section. The pocket administrator is not so good at indicating what it is leaving out.For example: Restoring backups to other dbs with different owners but identical schemas is non-trivial.DTS packages running stored procedures do not allow for error trapping. This mean if the SP raises an error, the DTS package will not notice and continue as if the SP ran successfully.While you can not expect a pocket administrator to cover these details. It should briefly indicate that these are issues to be considered, but beyond the scope of the reference.Other than this oversight, it is an excellent reference."},{"Title":"Microsoft Sql Server 7.0 Administrator's Pocket Consultant","review":"This book does a good job of covering the major activities confronting a DBA, such as back-ups, recoveries, creating and using DTS packages, scheduling jobs, etc. Furthermore, the book provides concrete syntax or screen shots as part of the step-by-step descriptions.

RossonSandals in the Dust is unique among many books I have read. M. E. Rosson has gleaned facts from such historians as Josephus or Jerome, and used ancient writings and legends to put together details of the life and characters of each of a group of men chosen by Christ to take his gospel of love for mankind over the four corners of the then known world. This makes for a remarkable and very rare book.Did you know, for example, that James Ben Alpheus looked so much like Jesus that Judas would have to give him a \\"kiss\\" to distinguish the two in the Garden of Gethsemene?This is the type of research that makes this one of the most fascinating collections of \\"biographies\\" I have ever read.Of course, we may wonder at some of it. Is every detail true? Is it an accurate portrayal of these apostles, inspired by God, or is there some fiction in it? We won't really know; nevertheless, this is a valid piece of research that seeks to show who the apostles were, what they were really like and how Christ motivated, inspired, guided and molded ordinary men who, through the action of the Holy Spirit would become the carriers of his message of salvation to a world that needed it as badly then as it does now.Don't miss reading this one.Joyce Ann EdmondsonThe Listening TreeIn the Arms of the ShepherdFalling Petals"},{"Title":"No Child Left Behind: No Parent Left in the Dark","review":"This book was presented to me as an aid to sucessful parent teacher conferences, and I must say it live up to its recomendation.

I specify this because this group of reviews also includes reviews of the \\"Middle Liddell\\" and the \\"Little Liddell,\\" which Amazon seems to have jumbled together.Liddell & Scott's Greek-English Lexicon is a monument to lexicography. Methodologically, though, it needs a complete redo. Whether anyone will ever accomplish this is a good question. I have seen the suggestion in a scholarly article that the most feasible way to create a new comprehensive lexicon of Ancient Greek is to compile it online, in the fashion of the Perseus Project. Such a project would be the ideal source for a new printed Greek lexicon with up-to-date principles of organization, not to mention modern English equivalents to replace the large number of thoroughly antiquated equivalents found in L&S.;This lexicon is certainly indispensable for serious students of Classical Greek literature. It is also useful for reading the Septuagint (Greek Old Testament) and patristic writers (for the latter, see alsoA Patristic Greek Lexicon). Another use which many might not have considered is for reading Coptic literature. Coptic is the latest form of the Ancient Egyptian language, and a great deal of religious literature was written in it during the first millennium or so of the Christian era. A good deal was translated from Greek as well. Whether translated or original Coptic, it made free use of Greek borrowings, much as English does. There is no lexicon devoted to literary Coptic Greek, but Liddell & Scott often have the meanings of words found in Coptic Greek, even if it's the 20th one in the list! Unless and until a complete dictionary of Coptic Greek is prepared, L&S; will continue to be a necessary tool of Coptic scholars as well as classicists."},{"Title":"A Lexicon Abridged from Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon","review":"Excellent resource.

This Oxford University Press publication still sports an archaic but crystal clear typeface. Each entry has at least one English definition but often many more, Greek contexts, and citations from the literature in which the word is found.As with any classic, critics abound. LSJ, it is alleged, is too dependent on debunked etymology, too slanted towards a certain sector of the literature, too pass&eacute; in its linguistics, etc.No matter.

The full lexicon was also offered with the supplement included ............ That discount is no longer offered but this dictionary is still the cheapest major, standard lexicon of any language available...there is no bigger English-Greek lexicon. Eventually, any Greek student who wants to read beyond the elementary authors in the curriculum will need at least to consult this volume. It is unwieldy...like all major dictionaries...and can be annoying to use on the eyes. Sadly, there are no other choices at present...though we yearn for the day when computer technology will replace the printed codex and allow for (a much needed, but immensely difficult) a thorough revision of the lexicon. Its etymological notes are obviously valueless today. Beginning students will better appreciate the intermediate version of this book which lists irregular principal parts of verbs separately.

It truly is the premier work of its kind. But it has a few drawbacks.1 - The sheer weight and bulk of this tome makes it a dedicated desk reference. In fact, you might consider building a special shelf or desk just to hold the book.2 - The offset printing flaws mentioned by other reviewers is a significant problem. Portions of some entries are not even legible.The Big Liddell is the kind of book that would be much more valuable in digital format than in print.

The &quot;little Liddel&quot; is the best version for the beginner since it contains, e.g., irregular forms of verbs whose aorist and/or perfect principal parts cannot be predicted from the present principal part. The &quot;middle Liddel&quot; contains fewer entries but provides more room for etymological information, thus making the little Liddel best for use during Greek exams and the middle Liddel best for those whose interest includes a knowledge of the history of a word's usage. The big Liddel (the book for which this review is written) is an excellent reference on account of its completeness and the coherent way in which the entries are written. Although the Liddel and Scott Lexicon is a work of scholarship located in the tradition of late 19th century classics scholarship, that is, the editors regularly give the Latin translation of the Greek before the English (since until recently it was assumed that a study of Latin would accompany a study of Greek), the work has enduring value to both scholars and those for whom an interest in Greek is merely an enjoyment. The big Liddel will not disappoint if you're willing to make the financial investment."},{"Title":"A Lexicon Abridged from Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon","review":"Excellent resource.

When I took a class where we read &quot;The Apology of Socrates&quot; by Plato, my professor recommended avoiding the Intermediate edition. At first I thought perhaps he was wrong, and I used it to translate some passages. After spending a lot of time sorting through it, I found that I agreed with him. The Intermediate Liddell does have locations of word use in original sources, and has slightly more vocabulary, but for the beginning and intermediate Greek reader, the Abridged Liddell is preferable. Navigating through the abridged edition is far easier and it often assumes a lesser knowledge of Greek, thus it includes some conjugated forms, which then point you to the correct verb. So as you can see, the abridged edition should suit the needs of most classical Greek students. Also, the editors took care to make sure that virtually every New Testament word is included.Are there drawbacks to the Liddell-Scott? The Victorian English often gets frustrating. We rarely use words like hither and thither anymore. Also, when more morally explicit Greek words are defined, their definition is in Latin. Also, the original printing abnormalities, such as certain parts of letters being cut off from words, remain.Learning Greek is a rewarding, but daunting task. The task is often made more difficult by grammars and lexicons that assume the reader knows more than he or she does. The abridged Liddell is perfect for the average student. When you want to dive in deeper, learn word origins, search sources, or just want to say you own the most complete Lexicon out there, you should buy the full size Liddell-Scott. Until then, the abridged edition works!"},{"Title":"A Lexicon Abridged from Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon","review":"The &quot;big&quot; Liddell &amp; Scott is the one to buy when you're about to do your doctorate.

The Intermediate has a much clearer typeface and many students find its material more easily accessible.The ninth edition of the &quot;big&quot; Liddell &amp; Scott has been offset so many times that the print is faint and verging on the illegible. My copy actually has pieces of print missing. The Clarendon Press ought really to have the whole thing revised and reset. But what a daunting task!

Though I will point out that it is invaluable to anyone who has completed the fundamentals and finds themselves reading multiple dialects. The gentleman is right again in saying that a little Liddell, or Middle Liddell is more appropriate for the beginning Greek reader; there is absolutely no reason to spring for the full Lexicon at that point. A reader who has, however, stuck out two or three years and moved beyond the fundamentals should make all efforts to aquire this Lexicon. The 3 rules of Greek reading [1. know your Principle parts they will save your sanity 2. the Lexicon is your friend and 3. above all else, the first thing to do when encountering any Greek is to supress panic] don't change whether you've read two years or twenty, but you can outgrow your lexicon, and any serious readers (if you've stuck it out for three years or more, your serious) should invest in this lexicon. It is the standard and a necessity."},{"Title":"A Lexicon Abridged from Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon","review":"As an ageing student of Greek, an aged pensioner only half way through the second year of a university course in the subject, I decided to ask my wife to give me the big lexicon for Christmas. Some say it is best to wait until more advanced study is required, but waiting several years at my age is perhaps overly optimistic. Generally I find the Intermediate version very useful, and I have it sitting on top of the Big One. I am sure the large version will be of considerable use, but it won't be travelling with me. I also have the small version which fits well into my luggage.The use of Victorian English does not worry me (we can all change \\"hither\\" and \\"thither\\" into more likely expressions), but the smallness of the print and its lack of clarity is a bit of a problem. I have decided that when I use the unabridged edition it will be in the daytime, and on sunny days at that! I am very thankful for a little magnifying set-up that I made when using Reading Greek as a textbook- very clear but very small print. My spectacles help too of course!A CD-ROM version may be useful to some people, but I much prefer books for frequent use. The computer is in a different room from where I do my real work. I couldn't stand having one of these monstrosities looking at me as I study Greek.So far I am very positive about the large version of the lexicon. It can hardly have five stars because it has some inadequacies, but it is better to have it than not. I might write another review in a year's time and give a revised view.................................................................Now, almost one year later I can say that I have found it very useful, especially with post-classical words, and more especially with some vocabulary found on inscriptions and papyri."},{"Title":"A Lexicon Abridged from Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon","review":"The problem is photolithography. Reading some reprints can be like looking at a photograph of a photograph. You might consider finding an older typeset copy of the LSJ. Although this means buying a used book, it may be easier on your eyes.You cannot, however, identify a typeset copy by edition number, publication date, or ISBN. I browsed a copy of the 9th Edition (0198642148) published in 1961 and printed in 1992. It was offset and looked like the printer was running out of ink. I purchased a copy of this same 1961 edition printed in 1978. My copy is typeset. It looks fine.Whether a copy of the book is offset or typeset seems to depend upon who printed the book and when it was printed. At one time the University of Oxford printed its own books. My LSJ states on the copyright page \\"Printed in Great Britain at the University Press, Oxford by Eric Buckley, printer to the University.\\" My old copy of Denniston says the same thing except for the name of the printer.It seems that new books from the Oxford University Press are printed by a variety of firms located anywhere between Bristol and Hong Kong. I don't know when the University stopped printing its books, but I don't think that any copies of the 9th Revised (1996) Edition of the LSJ (0198642261) were printed by the University.I can't say as a hard and fast rule that all copies printed by and at the University are typeset; however, before purchasing and shipping anything this big and expensive, I would contact the seller and ask the seller where and by whom that copy was printed."},{"Title":"A Lexicon Abridged from Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon","review":"Logos Research software has now made this edition in electronic form, all the supplements are integrated in the main text.

It even includes Linear B Mycenaean Greek entries. This gargantuan work is the definitive Greek-English dictionary. I was not able to read Pindar or the Lyric poets easily without the Big Liddle. My major gripe is that it is rather poorly made. The edges of the very thin pages stuck together and each page had to be separated by hand or flicking the pages. The paper is sliver thin, and some of it was creased in the binding - upsetting in a $160 book. On reviewing the front, I noted that it was printed and bound in China and can't help feeling that if it were printed in Europe or the US it might have been better quality. Eventually, the pages separated and I am now able to use it without problems (although the few creased pages still irritate me).Regard this review as five stars for content but three for the quality of binding/manufacture."},{"Title":"A Lexicon Abridged from Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon","review":"This is a review of the smallest version of Liddell & Scott's lexicon (\\"Little Liddell\\"). I've long felt it inadequate, but today let's try a controlled experiment. Can we use it to read the first two pages of Xenophon's Anabasis?(Xenophon's \\"Anabasis\\" has a reputation as a straightforward narrative written in a very clear style--it's what schoolboys used to cut their teeth on, before teachers grew worried that it was too boring to keep students interested in Greek.)In these first two pages (OCT edition), here are three basic questions about words that are not very clearly answered by the abridged lexicon. Page 1: lines 15-16, epi is used with the dative to mean \\"in the power of\\" someone, a meaning omitted by the abridged lexicon. Page 2: line 19, the accented form of the reflexive pronoun hoi is used, but the abridged lexicon gives only the enclitic form; line 23, amphi is used with the accusative in an only vaguely local sense (made clear in the intermediate lexicon, s.v., A/C/5, but impossible to guess from the \\"Little Liddell\\").If you can't read the opening of Xenophon's Anabasis with it, then, somebody has to say it, so I will: this book is NOT VERY USEFUL FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE. Spend seven more dollars and resign yourself to the extra weight and size of the intermediate.

This book is absolutely terrible, terrible, terrible.First and foremost, let me just say that I am an experienced C++, Objective-C, PHP, and MySQL developer. I am learning Perl for the purpose of undergraduate research relating to bioinformatics. My problems with this book lay not in my technical ignorance.The book is absolutely ridden with typos and errors. I'd say a good 40% of the examples don't work correctly. One of the more egregious errors is the repeated use of the decrement operator, -- (that's 2 minuses). Throughout the book, the author references it as being just - (that's one minus). I'm guessing the author typed this book up in MicroSoft Word or some other editor (double minuses followed by a character create an em dash) which screwed up all of the syntax. Furthermore, the book's website does not acknowledge these errors at all. Also, many of the coded examples are accompanied by screenshots giving you the expected output. Unfortunately, these screenshots oftentimes offer results far different from what the printed code outputs.To sum up problems with the book:1) Lots of typos2) Syntactical errors3) Mismatched code and expected output4) Lack of corrections on the book's website5) There are better books out there6) Don't buy this book7) Overly repetitive and verbose"},{"Title":"Mastering Perl 5 (Mastering)","review":"Hi Eric,I emailed you some weeks back re Sender.pm and your book.

Author explains ideas and concepts with clear examples. I highly recommend this book for beginners or advanced programmers."},{"Title":"Mastering Perl 5 (Mastering)","review":"If there were a way to give negative stars, this book would get -5Here are my reasons:1. The source code in example listings contains numerous errors such as missing quotes, mismatched single and double quotes, missing semicolons, and improper function calls containing two sets of semicolons, ie : subroutineOne ()();2. The Companion Web Site contains text listings of programs from the book, all containing the SAME programming errors.3. Learning a programming language requires that the book examples are syntactically correct and will execute. With this book, it will be a mystery whether your programs fail because of you or because of your teacher (this includes the samples listed in the book).4. There is no listed Errata on the book's site, and although corrections have been emailed to the author, no errata listings have been posted. Corrective steps are necessary and no one is taking care of it. All you get is a reply mail from the author saying &quot;Oh, that wasn't caught before publishing. That should say...&quot; but only for that specific error.5. How can you rely on someone to teach you advanced programming principles when their simple examples are full of errors?Additionally, I believe the other reviewers have been far to kind. If you want specific examples, I can give you page numbers citing at least a dozen errors located before you get halfway through the book. A friend of mine mentioned that at least I won't make the errors the author did when I write my own code. He's right, but I don't consider that part of an instructional book's purpose.The SysAdmin at my company would have a field day on an author like this. I consider my comments conservative.In summary, a programming book whose simple source code does NOT execute has already lost trust. If the source on the website also contains the same errors, it has doomed itself. I personally would never buy a book written by this author again, and I strongly feel that you should not buy this one."},{"Title":"Mastering Perl 5 (Mastering)","review":"This is a great reference if you need to find out how a function is used in a context because of its numerous complete example programs and subroutines which you can also use as a base for your own programs. However, if you want to learn Perl from the ground up, I would recommend the slightly humorous and very well written &quot;Programmering Perl&quot; by Larry Wall (the inventor of the Perl programming language) et all. The latter is great as a study book and the instruction list it features answers every question you could possibly ask about Perl.&quot;Programming Perl&quot; is the book I always reach for, but I do not regret buying this one.

Also, the author does not mention a few very useful functions which I had to look up elsewhere, for example, glob.If you want to use this book, you need a good reference book on Perl as well."},{"Title":"Mastering Perl 5 (Mastering)","review":"Serious problems...

However, the layout of the book is not well-designed at all. Many a time you find yourself jumping back and forth between chapters searching for the answers to some language features used in the examples, yet at times you found yourself reading duplicate materials in different chapters. For example, the author taught you some scalar variable usages in chapter 3, then the (nearly) same topic was covered in chapter 5, leaving the rules for scalar variable naming conventions duplicated in both chapters (hash is another topic that was repeated in different chapters). Another example is that the author referred to appendix A repeatedly, yet either due to author's cryptic writing or negligence (or my lack of effort?), I was not able to find it. The author seems to be trying to give you an overall taste of Perl program flavor in the first few chapters then begin to lay down language foundations systematically, yet his intention and writing were confusing enough to turn me away from this book to &quot;Programming Perl&quot; from O'Reilly.I had learned a few interpreted or compiled languages before (though not Perl) so I was looking for finishing this book rather quickly. However it is the writing not the content that repeatedly got in my way. This book has the right content. Had this book been MUCH better orgnized, it'd been an excellent beginner book. For its current edition, though, it's pretty mediocre.

Only after using the book for some time have I gradually gotten use to it. I wonder how some of the people that have reviewed this book as excellent came to that conclusion.

However, he was also a historian of mysticism and the occult, and A Guide to Magic, Sorcery, and the Paranormal, which was first published almost 100 years ago, was the only non-fiction book Rohmer ever wrote. Through this work he wanted to tell the layman about his interest, and as a result of this he never digs very deep into his subjects, but throughout the book writes enough to make the reader interested and inspired to make his or her own research.So what, then, is it that Rohmer writes about? Well, as the title says, magic, sorcery, and the paranormal, seen through a historical perspective, focusing on some of the most prominent characters ever to have explored the occult. Rohmer mentions, among other individuals, Michel de Notre Dame (also known as Nostradamus), Dr. John Dee, count Cagliostro, and founder of theosophy Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. It's very obvious that the book is indeed written to the layman, since Rohmer repeatedly assures his reader that he's not going to dig too deep into his subject matter, and except for a few instances he never offers any thorough description of rituals and methods.There's not a complete lack of scepticism, but on the other hand, it's not very apparent, but then again, A Guide to Magic, Sorcery, and the Paranormal never claims to be a book by a skeptic for a skeptic. It's, just like the back of it says, an introduction to magic, sorcery, and the paranormal, but it's by far not the best introduction out there. There are tons of newer, better, and especially cheaper books available these days, but it was definitely worth reading and I truly did appreciate it.But it's not a cheap experience, though. The price is quite high, and many people might find it a bit too much for a book that really doesn't have anything extraordinary to say. However, any serious collector of books about the occult should grab it immediately, and I'm very proud to have it in my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Shakespeare of London","review":"We know very little about William Shakespeare. He wrote in a time after the invention of the printing press, but before the invention of newspapers and magazines, so the sort of journalism which we rely on today to tell us more than we want to know about the inner lives of show-business figures did not exist during his lifetime.Anyone who wants to write a full-length biography of this man, one of the greatest writers of our planet, has two choices. She can either make up stuff along the way, as countless Shakespeare biographers have done since the 1600s, or she can stick to the fragmentary facts and fit them into a picture of the social structure and life that Shakespeare lived in. This is what Chute does in her now out-of-print classic, and as readers of this review can see, I think she did a superb job.Chute's book is superb not only because she is a vivid writer, not only because she tells us why certain things were the way they were, but because she respects the people she is writing about. When she tells us why Elizabethan &quot;players&quot; and their property managers liked tawny-orange dye for their costumes, she not only tells us why they liked it (it was a &quot;color-fast&quot; dye which would not fade) but conveys to us some of the combination of freedom and limits which made up Elizabethan society. The men and women of London were people who, on the one hand, could not buy the color-stable, wash-and-wear clothes we wear without a thought today, but on the other hand, if they could find a good dye or could afford to wear a bright color, they could gaudy themselves up in a way which grownups are too shy to do nowadays. As always, something has been lost and something has been gained, and Chute knows this and doesn't write history on the basis of &quot;look at how many mistakes those poor little people made&quot; or &quot;look at all those great heroes of the past.&quot; They are men and women and children who could have learned from us, and we can learn from them. All of them, Shakespeare first among them but not the only one."},{"Title":"Shakespeare of London","review":"For some reason I have been obtaining and reading biographies of William Shakespeare lately. This book, and the recent biography by Peter Levi, are the ones I have been most satisfied with.The real strength of Professor Chute's book is her insistence on placing Shakespeare accurately as one of the most famous ACTORS of his day. On lists of the companies of players he often appears first or second. Now, as Prof. Chute makes clearer than anyone else, this tells us a lot about the man. Prominent actors not only had to be healthy and athletic, they had to be great fencers... the audience expected to see incredible swordplay, not fakery... wonderful dancers... the performance always ended with the cast doing elaborate ensemble dances as well as individual specialties... and expert instrumentalists or singers... the play began with a concert lasting about half an hour. All this in addition to being able to play well a variety of parts (including several parts in the same performance) on very short notice and with very short preparation.Prof. Chute is sound and grounded about many aspects of Shakespeare's life that lead other biographers to wild surmises. I suspect she is about the only biographer to understand how Shakespeare's marriage worked. No matter how much you have read about Shakespeare, you will find many new insights and perspectives in this book."},{"Title":"Shakespeare of London","review":"Chute has written a terrific account of a difficult life. Biographies of Shakespeare are difficult in that there is so little known of his life. This is unusual -- and somewhat ironic, given the subject matter -- when one takes into account the Elizabethan's propensity for journaling. But Chute is able to place Shakespeare firmly within his time, making few assumptions, but presenting the known facts of Shakespeare's life in a lively and fascinating manner. She strongly establishes the assumption that Shakespeare was considered one of London's finest actors and also places context around the performance of the plays. What is most fascinating is how Chute gives a glimpse into the contemporary response to Shakespeare's writings. While Shakespeare's \\"competitors\\" -- that is, his contemporary playwrights -- may have appreciated the breadth and scale of his writing, to a certain extent, they looked down upon the popularity of his plays. Just like today, the so-called elite of our society tend to overlook those writings or performances that are appreciated by a mass audience.Where Chute falls down somewhat is that, like so many biographers, she over-apologizes for her subject. In Chute's vivid description, Shakespeare, seemingly, could do no wrong. Time and again, Chute refutes the contemporary criticisms that were made of Shakespeare's writings. Fault can be found in geniuses, as well as hacks.Her book ends perhaps one chapter too late. After Shakespeare was finished professionally, he retired to a quiet life in Stratford. The only extant writing that refers to Shakespeare's final years are lawsuits that appear with his name. While it does give a minimal sense of Shakespeare's activities, it does not make for very interesting reading and, in fact, places an overemphasis on perhaps meaningless records. But this minimal criticism aside, Chute's book overall gives a wonderful sense of a fascinating person living in a fascinating time."},{"Title":"Shakespeare of London","review":"I thought Shakespeare of London by Marchette Chute was an excellent biography for several reasons. She wrote in a very readable, engaging style which was easy to follow and understand. Prior to reading this book, I had read a lot of information about Shakespeare. Initially, when I started reading this book I was a little put off by the \\"just-the-facts-mam\\" style, but the more I read the more I appreciated the biographer telling the facts she knew without overindulging in assumptions based on these facts, as other more recent biographers have done. I also really appreciated how she fully grounded Shakespeare in his time and place and vocation. As a lit student in college, all I ever heard about was Shakespeare's literary genius as a playwright; the fact that he remained a prominant actor in his company during the entire time he was writing plays was completely glossed over. This book, which never disregards Shakespeare as an actor, was something of a revelation to me. At times I felt her potrayal of Shakespeare as a person may have been a bit naive because she never attributed any remotely bad characteristic to him, but overall, I thought the biography was exceptionally well done. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants solid, unbiased information about the Shakespeare of London."},{"Title":"Shakespeare of London","review":"Note: date of this review should read \\"15 December 2012\\".It has been suggested (I forget who said it) that Chute should have titled the book, \\"The London of Shakespeare\\". That sums it up. I've read practically every book-length bio (nearly 50) of William Shaksper of Stratford and Chute's is one of the emptiest biographically speaking, though that means (to here credit) she added less than the usual amount of speculation. Frankly, I find it among the most boring of the genre. As a description of London and the theater at the time it may not be bad, but it is certainly not the best book on that subject either."},{"Title":"Shakespeare of London","review":"We English-speakers are so pelted with the name Shakespeare from earliest recollections, and so over-exposed to scenes and lines from his plays, that many of us (including me, who took a course titled Shakespeare in college) become after a time benumbed and uninterested in anything bearing the too, too familiar appellation. Neverthess, I was curious to see what a non-literary bio of the man might reveal, and was pleased to find much in this book of fresh interest about him and his times. You might be surprised, as I was, for example, to learn how common it was in Elizabethan England for the ordinary man to be involved in lawsuits, or that London sported a two-storey shopping mall. But the choisest plum -- by my peculiar lights -- is a subjunctive-mood classic angrily uttered by the Bard's aged partner at the New Globe Theatre, on the occasion of his being disburdened of the day's ticket receipts by thugs in the employ of creditors: \\"If my son come, he will thump you hence!\\""},{"Title":"Alma Mater: A College Homecoming","review":"As a professor at a small college (Muhlenberg, in Allentown, PA), I found these descriptions of Kenyon to be instantly transferrable. When Alma Mater was sweeping Muhlenberg a few years ago, my faculty colleagues swore that Kluge must have been hiding behind the drapes, so perfectly did he capture the scene here. Of course, friends on other campuses said the same. Kluge has hit upon something universal about what it means to be a faculty member at a liberal arts college in a book that is at once funny, moving, and spot-on accurate.Every autumn, I make a point of pulling Alma Mater off the shelf to recharge my professorial batteries. In so doing, I remind myself of both the peculiarities and the nobility of this profession. And I remind myself, as well, of what excellent writing sounds like."},{"Title":"Alma Mater: A College Homecoming","review":"Liberal arts colleges evoke a certain image in the American imagination: ivy-laced little cities on a thousand different hills; places rich in tradition, where teachers teach, students learn, and smallness encourages community and accountability. As compared to big research universities, their professors are less likely to be distracted by big-city pretensions and obsequious grad students. The small-college ideal is what much of America likes to think higher education once was and should be again.Kluge, in this touching, sardonic reconsideration of his own alma mater, Kenyon College (the book is essentially a diary of the year he spent back in Gambier, Ohio, as a visiting professor), shows us that the reality of a real liberal arts college -- its ghosts, aspirations, conceits, compromises -- is far more complicated. Its history and traditions are as much a curse as a blessing. The dignified, self-knowing exterior it presents to prospective students and the public may mask self-doubts, intrigues, identity crises. For faculty as well as students, small size and intimacy means academic and cultural debates are more difficult to avoid, the stakes higher, the joys and sorrows more intensely personal.Though not the author's primary purpose, Alma Mater provides a rich and interpretive portrait of contemporary American academic culture. Today a college like Kenyon, isolated though it may be by geography, is awash in the same turmoils as the biggest and most unwieldy Research I institution: race, gender, fraternities, curriculum, faculty roles and rewards, and, as always, money. Just as TV and computers have virtually wiped out traditional regional cultures, so journals, conferences, and faculty mobility assure that professors in vastly different settings will be wrestling with the same ideas, controversies, and alienations.Kluge's vivid, indeed exquisite, writing draws out larger truths behind quotidian events and observations. Office corridors strangely dark and deserted in the middle of a weekday become a metaphor for faculty overspecialization (increasingly treated like free agents, professors ply their little projects in solitude from home) and the consequent loss of campus collegiality and sense of community. Figures at a faculty meeting seem to come from some central casting of academic types and images. And anyone who has taught a college course would empathize with Kluge's take on grading: &quot;Splattering comments on papers, you sense you are working harder on grading than they ever did on writing, that you are obliged to take seriously what they took casually.&quot;To his bemusement, Kluge, ultimately discovers he can't go home again. But he gives us a loving and richly detailed portrait of the inner life of a college he still loves, a &quot;good place,&quot; and we understand why."},{"Title":"Alma Mater: A College Homecoming","review":"This book is a great look at small liberal arts colleges through the eyes of a past graduate returning to teach at his alma mater. The book provides insight into the inner workings of a college both from an administrative and academic point of view. Kluge's reflections are always though-provoking and yet the prose is so wonderfully simple. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Alma Mater: A College Homecoming","review":"Professor Kluge has written a beautifully written and insightful look at the educational process at a small liberal arts college. However, much of what he discusses reflects the tensions and issues which buffet all of higher education in the 1990s -- gender studies, co-education, fund raising, teaching vs. research. He has personalized the story through in-depth profiles of administrators, teachers, and students. Kluge compares his experience in the early 1960s with the life of the college in the 1990s which I think will resonate with other &quot;old grads&quot;."},{"Title":"Alma Mater: A College Homecoming","review":"Good Book. Used for a class. Will keep in my collection. Pretty good for Student Development Professional reading. I thought the story line was ok.

I used to look at chapters about grading and student attitudes when I was teaching at a university, to see how Kluge's experiences matched mine.

He looks at the admissions, grades, decisions, teaching expectations/styles,tenures, fraternities, etc., that make this college click and draw in more students. He discusses his contributions and his interaction with other professors and departments. Being a college instructor myself, I found that much of what he expressed so well, could apply to my Micronesian college. Good writer and accurate in his observations and conclusions. I liked it and have recommended it to other professor-types."},{"Title":"Alma Mater: A College Homecoming","review":"Professors, even visiting ones, have one rare luxury. They live and work in a place where everyone stops and listens to their opinions. Did P.F. forget to mention all the fawning adoration that was his lot in tiny Gambier? Tough life. This book was accurate in what it did record (I was there too, after all), but by synecdoche presented a part to be taken for the whole. An easy for example; it's convenient to present anecdotal evidence that the entire student body was lazy and spoiled, since this excuses the professor(s) from having to pay attention to or bother about the ones who are not either of those things. And it gives an old fellow something to gripe about and be nostalgic for. There's excellent mileage in such an opinion, without a doubt. Maybe even a book. And, after all, Alma Mater is on my bookshelf, reminding me of my undergraduate days and of the coot on Middle Path who used to reply to my passing &quot;good morning&quot; with outraged glares and once a tirade about perfectly decent looking young women who chose to dress like hoboes. Ah, nostalgia. Who gets that much bang for the buck in a big city? Such thoughts are a comfort while paying student loans. If you are connected with Kenyon, this is an amusing read which raises corollary questions about the relative laziness or degree of spoilation found in the professors at a small, expensive liberal arts college."},{"Title":"Conjugate duality and optimization (Regional conference series in applied mathematics)","review":"This monograph presents an excellent introduction to convex duality. If you want to understand duality via perturbations and its connection to lagrangian functions this is a great way to start. The book \\"Convex analysis\\" (by the same author) is probably more accurate and it has more material, but it was written in an ecyclopedic style, which is more useful as a reference.One of the best things of this monograph, is that duality theory is introduced with several examples and applications: nonlinear programming, semi-infinite programming, Chebyshev approximation, stochastic programming, calculus of variations, etc. These examples are developed, in such a way that the reader can practice the theory that was previously introduced.Also, the chapter of integral functionals is extremely useful for people interested in calculus of variations and optimal control.Real and functional analysis is required (measure theory and basic Banach space theory), though. All in all, a great book."},{"Title":"Seals the Warrior Breed: Enduring Freedom","review":"\\"Enduring Freedom,\\" by H. Jay Riker, is the story of a team of Navy SEALs whose duty takes them on a mission to Afghanistan after the 9/11 terrorist attack against the United States. The book's title references Operation Enduring Freedom, the military campaign against the Taliban regime and the Al Qaeda terrorist organization. In an afterword dated Spring 2005, the author states, \\"This is a work of fiction, based on real-world events.\\" A blurb on the back cover notes that this novel is book ten in the \\"SEALs The Warrior Breed\\" series; the preceding volumes are listed inside the front cover, and include such titles as \\"Medal of Honor\\" and \\"Silver Star.\\" \\"Enduring Freedom\\" opens with a prologue dated September 11, 2001; the rest of the sections of the narrative are also dated, and span from December 27, 2001 to January 1, 2002.Riker is a good storyteller; although this novel is substantial in size at 426 pages, it is a fast and entertaining read. The book does have its flaws. At times the narration and dialogue struck me as being corny or cliched. Also, a debate between two characters on the purpose of the war in Afghanistan is poorly developed by the author. But overall I was impressed at how Riker intelligently incorporated some important themes into the adventure narrative. Particularly interesting is the theme of SEALs dealing with issues of cross-cultural insight as they operate in foreign environments; Riker's SEALs are challenged to use their intellect and diplomatic skill in addition to their muscles and prowess with weapons. Also significant is the book's critique of the \\"Rumsfeld Doctrine\\" of warfare. Riker also explores the mechanics by which different organizations--SEALs, the CIA, anti-Taliban Afghans, etc.--work together in combat operations. And while the book presents an overall positive image of the U.S. military, Riker also touches on the potential moral ambiguities of the Afghanistan campaign.The book covers action not just in Afghanistan, but also in other locales, and at times has an entertaining sort of \\"James Bond\\" flavor. There is plenty of explosive combat action. I liked how Riker incorporated real-world events and people into the story--U.S. President George Bush even becomes a \\"character\\" in the book via his televised addresses to the nation in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Also worthy of note is the detailed attention Riker pays to the hardware used by his SEALs for combat, communication, and intel gathering--it's a feast for fans of technical talk. But who is H. Jay Riker? I believe the answer lies in the anthology \\"Future Wars,\\" edited by Martin H. Greenberg and Larry Segriff (DAW Books, 2003). One of the anthology's contributors is William H. Keith, Jr., and a short paragraph notes of Keith, \\"Writing under the pseudonym of H. Jay Riker, he's responsible for the extremely popular _SEALS: The Warrior Breed_ series.\\""},{"Title":"Seals the Warrior Breed: Enduring Freedom","review":"This wasn't the best in the series, but it was pretty good.

Egads!"},{"Title":"The Hermit of Eyton Forest (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was dull, boring, had a slow start but had a thrilling ending"},{"Title":"The Hermit of Eyton Forest (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As with several other entries in the Chronicles of Brother Cadfael, at the center of this book stands one of the younger members of the community of the Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul, and his relationship to the community versus his romantic relationships in the world outside. But this time the youngster isn't a novice who made a mistaken commitment to the cloister after a love affair gone wrong, nor even an embittered older man seeking solace after a disastrous marriage.No, Richard Ludel (his father's namesake and only child) is ten years old, doesn't yet see any use for girls, and is happy enough to be one of the handful of students boarded at the monastery, well away from his formidable grandmother's plans to marry him off to the heiress of a neighbouring manor - \\"quite old\\", being past twenty, and a nuisance rather than a person from Richard's point of view. This makes an oblique, fairly subtle contrast to the events of the ongoing civil war between the empress and the king - the empress, like Richard's intended, is years older than her husband, tied to him in a marriage with little love lost, as demonstrated when Geoffrey of Anjou not only refuses to send so much as a single soldier to her aid while she is under siege in Oxford, but has lured away her half-brother and best general to help *him* with the battles for the Norman lands in contention in the struggle for the throne.Upon the death of the elder Richard Ludel (still young, but never recovered from wounds suffered in the battle of Lincoln), Richard's elders plan to let matters proceed according to their settled routine - but there's a disagreement about what that routine is. Hugh Beringar as sheriff has no wish to antagonize the loyal Ludels by interfering with Richard's inheritance, despite his being a minor; his only concern is that the Ludels' steward should be competent and loyal. Abbot Radulfus (by charter the boy's guardian until he comes of age), intends for the boy to stay in school - as Radulfus objects to children being handed over as infant oblates into monastic vows before they can consent, he also objects to children being bound in marriage, without any designs on pressuring the boy into becoming a monk. But Dame Dionisia Ludel's idea of the status quo is to continue with her campaign to marry the boy off, beginning by playing on public sympathy for a poor bereaved widow, cruelly kept from bringing her grandson home for a visit (and backing it up with judicious threats of taking the abbey to law).Even as Dame Dionisia piously installs the hermit Cuthred in a long-empty hermitage in Eyton forest - who unlike the brothers of Shrewsbury would be under vows to remain solitary and enclosed in his hermitage, with only a youngster acting as his errand boy for regular company - the lady at first seems piously resigned, though she sees no use in having him educated and a *lot* of use in getting the neighbouring manors of Wroxiter and Leighton joined with the Ludel's manor of Eaton. Curiously, events then seem to conspire against the brothers, as accidents become disturbingly frequent in the abbey lands near Eaton, and the hermit (through his errand boy, the mischievous Hyacinth) issues a public warning to the abbey that perhaps these signs of nature in revolt should be taken as a sign that Richard should not unnaturally be kept away from his only remaining blood kin.Despite this, young Richard immediately takes to Hyacinth, after waylaying him upon Hyacinth's delivery of the message, and the much older Hyacinth is happy enough to give Richard all the information his elders have been withholding from him, in exchange for being put in the picture about Richard's own situation. So when Richard later overhears an abbey guest in pursuit of a runaway villein being informed that Hyacinth matches the runaway's description, he immediately sets out for the hermitage at Eyton to warn his friend, naturally leaving no word at the abbey that he's playing truant, let alone venturing into his grandmother's reach.But Richard fails to return to the abbey (and as his fellow students cover up for him into the next day, his absence isn't discovered until many hours have passed). Well aware of Dame Dionisia's plans for the boy, the lands in her care are searched thoroughly - but with no trace of the boy, and as the manor folk are more loyal to the boy than to her, it's hard to see where he could've been hidden - or how he can be rescued before being browbeaten into saying vows and signing marriage settlements.As always, I recommend the unabridged recording narrated by Stephen Thorne. And as usual in Cadfael novels, there *are* love stories amid the pair of loveless arranged marriages for joining lands and titles featured in the story of the civil war and the private war over Richard's future. My congratuations to the reader who manages to spot *all* the puzzles to be solved, and not to be distracted by the enjoyable drama and romance that accompany them. Not least, one of the most dramatic episodes of the war - King Stephen's siege of Oxford, with total victory almost within his grasp as the empress is trapped within the castle - is playing out as the people of Shropshire are concerned with events nearer home.Drive-in totals:- Three disappearances (counting the mystery of the missing villein, being hunted ruthlessly by his former masters).- Three deaths (counting Richard's father).- Three love stories (the most dramatic of which is played out entirely off-stage, but no less affecting for that)."},{"Title":"The Hermit of Eyton Forest (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"In October of 1142, Empress Maud is still besieged in the town of Oxford, surrounded by the forces of King Stephen. She sends an emissary bearing jewels and money to her brother, begging him for help, but the man's horse is found with the leathers bloodstained and, of course, with no sign of the money or jewels. A local Lord and father of Richard, one of the young pupils at the Abbey of St.Peter and St.Paul dies and Brother Cadfael is charged with the duty of escorting the boy to his home to attend the funeral. The boy's grandmother, a harsh and grasping woman, wishes to force Richard into a marriage with an older girl, the daughter of a neighbour, so that the lands may be conjoined, but the 10 year old wants only to return with Cadfael to the Abbey and his friends. A minor, local landowner stays as a guest at the Abbey while mounting a search for his missing villein and enlists the reluctant help of Sheriff Hugh Beringar who agrees to help with the search, knowing that the man is a brutal master who treats his servants very badly. A series of events causes Richard to be kidnapped and forced into a marriage by his grandmother and Cuthred, a local hermit and holy man. Yet another stranger arrives at the Abbey with a slight wound and so is taken to be treated by Cadfael who makes his usual assessment of all the events and uses his insatiable curiosity to tie all the loose ends together for a very satisfactory conclusion."},{"Title":"The Hermit of Eyton Forest (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"THE HERMIT OF EYTON FOREST is another installment in Ellis Peters' popular Brother Cadfael series. I've read most of them and fully intend to read the rest. Clearly, I'm something of a fan. Not because the mysteries are so riveting. They aren't. In fact, most of them are fairly transparent. The how and why might not always be so obvious, but the who isn't usually too hard to figure out. The suspicious characters are rarely difficult to identify.Further, the picture Ellis paints of life in the eleventh century is sanitized for our enjoyment. Despite the violence of the civil war raging in the background, life in Shrewsbury is slow-paced, calm, and ordered. Filth, squalor, brutality, disease and the appallingly short life expectancy of the period rarely intrude here.Despite this (or perhaps because of it), the stories are engaging, the characters charming, and Peters' idyllic vision of the time is very attractive. Her prose has an elegant, graceful quality that enhances the pleasure of the overall experience, making these books a delight to read. I never fail to enjoy them, and THE HERMIT OF EYTON FOREST is certainly no exception."},{"Title":"The Hermit of Eyton Forest (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The fourteenth Cadfael book I have read and it was as enjoyable as the first thirteen. I admit that some of the plots have been predictable, but this is easily overlooked because Peters does such an expert job at bringing the 12th century to life, and Cadfael is such an entertaining character.This particular installment happens to be one of the better mysteries in the series. Like the previous thirteen, it is a well-written and finely crafted story, but there are also some clever surprises. It is a cut above the average Cadfael book, but doesn't quite reach the five star qualities of the first two (Morbid Taste for Bones and One Corpse Too Many) that are true mystery classics."},{"Title":"The Hermit of Eyton Forest (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is number 14 in the Cadfael series by Ellis Peters. In this book, with the 12th century English civil war in the background, several unhappy events take place in and around Shrewsbury and beyond. Peters fits these seemingly unrelated events together for readers making for a good story.As the book opens, the Lord of Eaton finally dies due to battle wounds; his son and heir named Richard is ten years old and in school at the abbey in Shrewsbury. The boy's grandmother is determined to take him home and marry him off right away to a neighbor who has only a daughter and very good lands. She is thwarted in her plans by the abbot, since the boy was put into his charge by the boy's father who wanted him educated.At the Lord of Eaton's funeral, readers get the first glimpse of the hermit for whom the book is named. The grandmother installs this hermit in a small dwelling in a forest on Eaton land. Soon after, some disasters take place nearby on abbey land which are reported to the abbot. Not long after this, the hermit's servant appears at the abbey to announce that the hermit believes the disasters are God tying to tell the abbot to send Richard back to his grandmother. The abbot is not convinced.Somewhere around this point in the book, news concerning some treasure of the Empress Maude's that has apparently been stolen comes to Shrewsbury. The messenger carrying this treasure is presumed dead given the condition of his horse when found. This turns out to be very important in the story.A very unpleasant man named Bosiet shows up to lodge at the abbey. He is in search of a bondman of his who has run off - apparently for good reason. Bosiet shows up dead in the forest not long afterward. It looks like the hermit's servant is the missing bondsman.The servant has made friends with the boy Richard. The boy finds out that Bosiet is heading off to find the servant, so he goes off to warn him, and does so, but disappears on the way back to the abbey. A massive search is started for the servant now suspected of the murder and for the boy.As the story progresses, the boy is found, the hermit is killed and the mystery of the missing treasure is solved. The details are left out here so as not to spoil the plot.I figured out what happened before it was actually revealed by the book, but only about a page or so beforehand. It is always exciting when that happens. I mean figuring it out ahead of time, but only at the last moment, so the book was indeed worth finishing.Cadfael played a major part in this book, but he was not involved in several scenes. This may be why this book was not used for the TV series, which is a shame because it tells a very good story.Anyway, if you like the Cadfael series, certainly give this one a try."},{"Title":"The Hermit of Eyton Forest (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Many a twist and turn - no one is who they seem. The ending may be too neat and tidy, but still a great cast of characters and Peter's charming telling make this a good read."},{"Title":"The Hermit of Eyton Forest (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Richard Ludel inherits his father's estate at the age of 10. The boy has lived at the Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul since he was five years old, and he hardly knows either his father or his overbearing grandmother, from whom the widowed elder Ludel wanted to shield his son. That is why young Richard is being schooled at the Abbey, and it's also why his father appointed Abbot Radulphus to become the boy's guardian in the event of the father's death. But Richard's grandmother loses no time, after her son's death, in trying to gain both legal control over and physical custody of her grandson. She threatens the Abbot with legal action, when Radulphus makes it plain that he intends to fulfill the wishes of the boy's father - which were that Radulphus continue as his guardian until Richard comes of age, and that Richard continue to live and study at the Abbey.Dame Dionisia has taken up patronage of a hermit recently arrived in the area, a man called Cuthred. Cuthred also urges Abbot Radulphus to turn young Richard over to his grandmother, sending his \\"boy\\" - actually a young man of about 20, called Hyacinth - to deliver his opinion on the matter. On his way back to Cuthred carrying the Abbot's reply, Hyacinth rescues the Abbey's forester from where a falling tree has pinned the man in a rising stream. Hyacinth promptly falls in love with the forester's daughter. The young man answers all too well to the description of a fugitive serf being sought by his angry master, who calls on Lord Sheriff Hugh Beringar to find and return the fugitive. Riding out alone to investigate the matter for himself, the master instead winds up murdered. At which point Brother Cadfael, already intrigued by the mysterious Hyacinth and sharing his abbot's concern about Richard, begins trying to put the puzzle together - only to be faced with another and more urgent mystery when Richard vanishes. Has his grandmother kidnapped him? And if so, can his friends find and rescue the boy before his grandmother can force him into marriage with an heiress more than a decade his senior?As usual in the later Cadfael books, medieval politics provides much of the story's background and part of its framework. Ellis Peters does a superb job of writing children as they really are, not as adults sometimes fondly wish they might be. Young Richard is entirely believable, and sympathetic without being the least bit saccharine. The plot's final twist also works well. The sort of book I read straight through if time allows, because I hate being forced to put it down.--Reviewed by Nina M.

Without it, the mystery would not stand, and by far that makes the telling the weaker. There are several nice twists to arrive at a conclusion but that we need something that touches the war between Maud and Stephen seems a stretch once again.Ellis is gone and Cadfael shall have no new mysteries in the canon, but with the knowledge of others in the field, the violent times of the dark ages should more than lend itself to murders without the need for princes and kings. The Abbey and Shrewsbury have more than an abundant wealth of detail that we have seen previously to support a rich environment for mayhem.This story and the mystery seem to stem from just such an environment, but the murders that come about end up being related once more to our civil war and the impetus of life going on in spite of such a war is denied."},{"Title":"The Hermit of Eyton Forest (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I am a Brother Cadfael junkie. Ms. Peters depth of detail brings the period to life. The social structure and mores of both England in 1041 and the Benetictine order are a facinating contrast to today.

It is an excellent overview of the great religions placing them in three categories based on three possible reponses to the natural world. I use these grouping in my classes: religions of India, religions of east Asia, and religions of the Middle East. I particularly like the balance between history and belief systems.I have often recommended this book to others and now I realize that I'll have to let them know that it is out of print.

She is much eager to snatch her late husband's hidden money rather than to mourn for him, and she want to use Mason as a tool. And did she kill her husband cold-bloodedly? Mason fights for the unpleasant client at the risk of being disbarred and/or imprisoned. Lawyer is a hard business.The most charming point of Perry Mason mysteries is how to reveal the real murderer and/or the real facts convincingly. Also in this book, the thrilling and dramatic revelation of what really happened is splendid! And the the murderer's identity is completely unpredictable and surprising.I also enjoy quite a few spectacular scenes; D.A. Burger launches his fist at Mason, Mason is sentenced for contempt of court and so on."},{"Title":"The case of the fugitive nurse","review":"The Case of the Fugitive NurseThe 'Foreword' is dedicated to Dr. Samuel R. Gerber, the coroner of Cuyahoga County, Ohio. He is a pioneer in the field of public disaster, where there is a need to quickly identify many bodies to solve legal problems, such as insurance, wills, marital relationships, etc. Dr. Gerber studied traffic deaths, accident prevention, and the effects of alcohol. His percentages on alcohol in the blood have become the accepted standard.Perry Mason receives a visit from Mrs. Stefanie Malden, the newly widowed spouse of Dr. Summerfield Malden (a plane crash). This very young widow says Dr. Malden was being investigated by the IRS as to income tax. Gladys Foss, his head nurse and office manager, has disappeared - it may not be a coincidence. Stefanie found strange keys, hired a private detective, and learned where her husband spent time. Stefanie is concerned that her husband could have outwitted her! The IRS investigation was over cash income that was lower than expected. Stefanie wants Perry to take care of settling the estate for her. But complications arise from Perry's investigation. Did Perry walk into a cunningly baited trap?Gladys Foss explains the strains for a medical man. The patients vary as to symptoms and condition, but a doctor must be able to handle any complication. Bookkeeping is an unneeded complication that is usually handled by a nurse. There is a cash shortage due to a lack of records. Could Gladys have taken some of the funds to play the horses? Could Dr. Malden's mechanic been involved in the plane crash? Was Dr. Malden's young wife seeing this mechanic? Then Perry learns that Mrs. Malden and the mechanic Ramon Castella were arrested by the Narcotics squad. When Perry arrives at the Hall of Justice a photographer takes him aside to take a posed photograph. There is quite a dramatic scene (Chapter 6)!One important fact is that a car windshield was spattered with bugs, so the driver didn't stop for gas where the attendant would have washed them off (Chapter 7). A gasoline credit card can be used to track a person's purchases. Perry gets information on Gladys Foss' losses from the horse's mouth. Perry visits Stefanie in prison to get the truth (Chapter 9). Is there a commodity that Stefanie doesn't recognize? Perry explains his strategy for the preliminary examination (Chapter 10). Testimony from a criminalist tells how they could trace narcotics sold to a doctor, and the contents of a whisky flask. The preliminary hearing covers the main points, and is the longest chapter. [Did you begin to suspect the solution?] Since the prosecution can't meet Perry's objection, the case is dismissed and Stefanie is released from custody. Perry tells her how to leave, what to do, and where to go. Perry summarizes the case for Della [and the reader]. New evidence is found and Stefanie is re-arrested. Perry continues his investigation (Chapter 15).District Attorney Burger returns to Los Angeles, but loses the publicity to Perry (Chapter 16). Darwin Kirby drank from that flask and soon fell asleep (Chapter 17). The dentist who last worked on Dr. Malden could not positively identify the body. Dr. Malden had been using fluorides to prevent dental caries (Chapter 18). Perry's subpoena of a witness backfires and leads to a contempt citation; but Perry explains how \\"nothing\\" would be proved by this witness! Perry surmises the truthful identity of this witness. In Chapter 19 Perry explains this case.There may have been some humor in Gardner's dedication of this book to Dr. Gerber. Coroner Gerber accused Dr. Sam Sheppard of murdering his wife and ruined Dr. Sam's life."},{"Title":"Sun StarOffice 5.1 for Linux","review":"Good introduction into StarOffice useage.

Most fishing and floating guidebooks tend to concentrate on one or the other but Ingram does justice to both types of recreation. The chapters each cover a short float of from two and a half to twelve and a half miles. They include: a map of the area to be floated; put in and take out points; types of water including rapids; species of fish available, where they might be, and recommended lures. In addition, each chapter is a running narrative to help you enjoy all the sights, the landmarks and of course, includes some history. The author touches on all species of fish but this book would be especially helpful to Smallmouth Bass anglers. There are details on selecting the right lure and then how to fish it in different types of water. Even for canoeists who don't fish, this is a handy book to plan trips and be able to recognize any hazards in advance. This fellow enjoys everything about the river and even provides some camera and photography tips for those who want to record their trips. His love for the river is infectious making this a very enjoyable and helpful book and I would recommend it to anyone who plans to spend time on or around the James River. The author said it all in the introduction. \\" I am a fisherman, canoeist, bird watcher, photographer, and conservationist. My happiest times are spent in the outdoors.

It's not just nuts and bolts; it's the soul of fishing, and especially of being on a river as beautiful and as full of huge smallmouth as the James. I can read three or four pages and it's as if I'm been to church, chugged a large coffee, hit the gym, and had a good meal all that the same time. I'm filled with thoughts of lures to buy, of how to work the canoe, of that odd mix of exhaustion and joy that comes from leaving for a fishing trip at 4:30 in the morning. I'm restored, and I can deal with it all again until I can make it back to the river.At $14, this book is the deal of a lifetime."},{"Title":"It's All About The Moon When The Sun Ain't Shining","review":"Ernest Hill has done what every author desires - to capture his reader's attention from the FRONT COVER (not the first page, but the front cover) to the very LAST PAGE of this MASTERPIECE. You gotta be mesmerized by his title in anticipation of something very special. I have read all of Hill's novels and have come to expect the best and he keeps bringing it on! His literary vision has made me appreciate greatness. It's All About the Moon When the Sun Ain't Shining is (sigh) &quot;Wow!&quot;The characters are real people in real situations (I don't care if it is fiction - I feel like I know these people)struggling to love, struggling to survive, battling with inner conflicts, clashing with outer interferences. Maurice has to make a life altering decision that conflicts with his heart and his head. He knows what he feels but he also knows what is right. Does he allow emotions to take him over the top or does he allow a level head to propel him to the next level? Who other than a dear mother has plenty to say about this matter? The woman he endears, Omenita, well let's just say, her goal is to seek happiness at all cost and to deal with the consequences later . . . Of course, there are folks involved in each of their lives that &quot;knows what is best&quot; for each of them and doesn't hesitate to &quot;share.&quot; Sounds interesting? Well, trust me it is the NOVEL TO READ. I can't fathom taking the bite out of this novel by giving you any more clues. It is a must read -one line at a time. Oh, did I mention, when I finished the last word, I immediately flipped to the front and started over?The complexity of the subject matter (exquisitely written, I must add) - love is dealt with in such a beautiful, compassionate manner from the point of view of all involved. There should be a money back guarantee on this one!Finally, Mr. ERNEST HILL leaves you salivating for more. Somebody with authority needs to tell Mr. Hill to give us a sequel . . . if not a sequel, please write another book real soooooooooon! Mr. Hill, sure hope you are listening!!"},{"Title":"It's All About The Moon When The Sun Ain't Shining","review":"I am a member of \\"Booklovers\\" Trinity Book Club where we had the pleasure of having Mr. Ernest Hill present to discuss the book. I enjoyed the book immensely. I felt that I knew each character personally. I have seen many Miss Audreys. It was great to see Maurice grow from boyhood to manhood. It really made one see the difference between 'love' and 'being in love.' It also makes one realize that there are choices to be made and that they should not be made hastily. I would love to read a sequel to this book. What happens to Maurice and Danielle? If a relationship develops, how does this affect all families? What will the friends and neighbors say? Does Omenita become the jealous, outraged ex-girlfriend who tries to win Maurice back? I have read all of Mr. Hill's books, and by far, this was the best. Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"It's All About The Moon When The Sun Ain't Shining","review":"I have recently read and been in a discussion group that included the author of this wonderful book. I appreciated the shift in theme from the others he has written and I believe that it is his best effort to date.One can actually feel the growth of the character, Maurice, as he comes to terms with trying to strike a compromise with the two important women in his life--his mother and the women he loves. He has to choose between them, but greater than this, between giving up perhaps his life's greatest opportunity or an ordinary, hum-drum existence.I especially appreciate how Mr. Hill developed memorable characters like Miss Audrey, Grandpa and Omenita--everybody knows someone like each one, and the powerful expressions of emotion in Maurice. This, I have rarely noticed in a man, but he is not demished by this exhibition. I liked the sprinklings of humor from the diner workers, also. The book is really well worth the time I spent with it. I didn't want to let it go.Audrey F. Martin"},{"Title":"It's All About The Moon When The Sun Ain't Shining","review":"This book is great. Sometimes you just need something to entertain the soul. There are days when you are feeling down and out and you need a moment to explore the world of others. A world that is delightful; a world that offers a glimpse at the way others view life. I picked up It's All About The Moon When The Sun Ain't Shining as a book club adventure and forgot I had problems. I enjoyed this book so much. I laughed, I cried and I started talking to the characters. Does that mean I am losing it? I cheered them on and gave them advice when I thought they were making mistakes. Guess what, the characters had it all figured out! All I had to do is continue reading!I want to thank this author for giving me an escape. In fact, I think that is what a great book should do - allow you to escape and journey into the lives of others. I liked these people and wish they were my neighbors . . . everybody except Omenita. Okay, maybe she could live in the neighborhood but not next door. Maurice has to decide on whether he is going to give his heart away to a young lady that can be wonderful but has issues. You will have to read this to believe it. Fantastic. This is a wonderful love story. Yes, it is about people trying to find out what is best for them and if they are best for each other. Sounds simple -- it isn't. There are so many wonderful characters and twists and turns in this novel that you will be surprised that there are so many wonderful lessons weaved throughout the novel. One thing I do know for sure, I didn't expect the end results. I was fooled! Great ending.This is a great book to take on a plane ride or just to the beach. Take it anywhere - but make sure you read it. I am glad our book club has chosen it to read."},{"Title":"It's All About The Moon When The Sun Ain't Shining","review":"What an incredible message! ERNEST HILL is a gifted and insightful author. This book deals cleverly with an age old theme (love and relationships)in such a contemporary way. The protagonist, Maurice has been challenged to be a man and to make a decision that will impact him for life. Maurice is in love and has been with the same girl for as long as he can remember. But there is the possibility she just might not be the right one for him because their relationship is based on a series of ultimatums, but the pitter patter of his heart tells him he loves her and can't do without her. Omenita, is his girl. She is not satisfied waiting on Maurice to get his life together(Maurice wants to go to law school). She wants him to marry her within days to prove his love to her and help them escape Brownsville and their folks. But Maurice's momma refuses to let any of this happen. After all, she is a mother( and has some words of wisdom to impart). She does not want her son to waste his life on the wrong girl. Talking about fireworks in a matter of days!This novel is excellent. The novel is so vividly written and the characters are so very real. I can't get the various characters out of my head! The book explores the depths of being in tumultous relationships, coping with emotions and the dilemma of determining what's good for the heart may not always be good for the soul. Mr. Hill allows his characters to offer solutions via wonderful dialogue and creatively mapping out life through everyday situations. This NOVEL is FRESH AND VERY UPLIFTING. LOVE HAS NO BOUNDARIES. Can you imagine how Maurice handled all of these emotions and manages to find out how what being a man really entails? Well, you better start reading. This novel is very intriguing.Thank you Mr. Ernest Hill for slapping us in the face with proof that there are ways to solve problems and given time, most people will make the best decisions based on their circumstances. I loved the characters. I keep thinking could this be my son or daughter? I wonder if I would act like Maurice's mother? I am not telling! Your novels always offer meaningful messages. Keep writing, we need authors that write with a purpose. You entertain and teach us how to be better people through your creative endeavors. I am SUGGESTING THIS BOOK FOR FAMILIES TO READ AND DISCUSS. BOOK CLUBS, IF YOU NEED to have a GREAT DISCUSSION - HERE'S THE ONE. This was a fun and interesting book. If you miss reading this one, you have missed the best book of the summer!"},{"Title":"It's All About The Moon When The Sun Ain't Shining","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.It was recommend by my teacher to read. she couldn't have picked a better book. once i started to read it i couldn't stop. it deals with real life situations. i also had a chance to meet Ernest Hill he did a discussion on the book and broke in down. He's the best. This is a good book to read."},{"Title":"It's All About The Moon When The Sun Ain't Shining","review":"My wife and i loved the book. Once you start reading the book you can't stop from beginning to end. the characters in the book were unique individuals. my favorite part of the book is when Maurice confronts Omenita and Gerald outside the diner. I'm glad that he did not marry the chick because she was crazy. This book clearly shows that love is blind. It will take over your mind.the boy was ready to give up his family and career for that female."},{"Title":"It's All About The Moon When The Sun Ain't Shining","review":"Minus the whole you-know-who-saves-the-day ending, I liked this book. I thought the more was annoying until I really took the time to open my eyes and see what she was talking about. I enjoyed the interaction between the young, black male college student and his father, grandfather, and the dishwashers. Omenita bugged me A WHOLE LOT because she reminded me of an old friend I had who said something as stupid as \\"If I have to get a job, then what does my husband need me for?\\" This character was totally as stupid as she was/is and there were times I had to sit this book to the side because it made me think of her. Ugh. And the make-a-plate scene blew my mind. It showed how confused sistas can be when it comes to being independent, working women and housewives. There is a midpoint that Omenita and the stupid friend I used to have just don't understand. It's okay to be a good host and work too. Taking someone away from their education for your own selfish reasons is something I'll never understand, then again, no dreamers do. This book hit really close to home for me, but I enjoyed it. I did learn that I was disgusted that Danielle was in the story at all, but that's my own personal problem."},{"Title":"It's All About The Moon When The Sun Ain't Shining","review":"Old wisdon with Southern charm.

It's the story of a young man who finds himself in jam. He's got a scholarship to go to law school and a girlfriend who's made it clear to him that she won't wait for him while he's studying. What does our young hero do? Does he run towards a future without his girlfriend or does he hang on to the past in the name of love?The characters in this book are wonderfully written. All of them talk and react as real people would. I really cared about the hero and cheered when he discovers that growing up isn't all about doing as you please.Ernest Hill has created a really excellent book."},{"Title":"It's All About The Moon When The Sun Ain't Shining","review":"In our lives we come through many crossroards that determine who we become in the future. Maurice Dupree is returning from college and has also received a scholarship for law school--a wonderful opportunity which he could only dream about. Unfortunately, he has a few things holding him back and/or determining his thoughts on how she should proceed with his life. There is his girlfriend Omenita who is tired of the small town they grew up in and tired of waiting on him to marry her and take her away from her oppressive life. She basically tells him that the time is up for school and he needs to be a husband to her and get a job and take her away from her misery. On the other side of the spectrum is his loving mother who is proud that her son is the first in their family to attend college and has a chance to make a career as a lawyer. Yet, she doesn't afford him the space to make his own decision regarding the things in his life. There is a definite problem when neither likes the other and Maurice must again make a choice between two things very dear to him.The interactions between mother and son and potential wife and son were engaging and interesting. Additionally, Maurice's father and grandfather both offer him pearls of wisdom regarding life, becoming a man, love and marriage. They are the strength of the book, what gave it its allure. The reader is also given a peek inside the lives of the family in which Maurice's mom provides housekeeping service. It is through the daughter of the family, Danielle, that Maurice is afforded the strength to make a necessary decision as the story unfolds.With strong character development and characters that you'll either love or hate, I thought this was going to be one of those \\"can't put down\\" books, but instead, I found myself getting tired just from reading the dialogue. I'm one that admittantly hates repetition, but it seems the characters continually repeated everything. I'm sure it was intentional to make a point, but this took away something from the book as it made it predictable and a bit tedious to keep reading the same thing over and over again. What really made this book memorable for me was the love the grandfather had for his deceased wife. It was a perfect example of what love and marriage should be able.This is my first Ernest Hill book and while I do plan to eventually read the other(s), I'm not sure that this was a good introduction for me.Reviewed by Tee C. Royalof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"It's All About The Moon When The Sun Ain't Shining","review":"I have just closed the cover after finishing Mr. Hill's latest novel. I have not read such a book in a very long time. It made me laugh until I cried, and it made me sad enough to crytime after time. The characters became friends; I sat with them in their homes and work places and learned to think of them as people I knew. Mr. Hill's character development is superb. He made me change my mind about the characters several times. His insights into the meanings of love, family, and the pain of change are remarkable. The wisdom of the people brings new wisdom to the reader as well. This is a remarkable story about remarkable people. I thank the author for sharing. I only hope I get to go to Brownsville again."},{"Title":"It's All About The Moon When The Sun Ain't Shining","review":"WOW, that's all I could say after reading Hill's newest book. This is the story of a man who had to choose what he thought was best for all, while thinking how it was going to affect him. What does a man do when he has to decide between love of a woman and a proper education!Hill has created a literary work of art, a moving storyline. The book is very thought-provoking.

It dragged on and on and on...most of the characters were unlikeable. Love can definitely be blind."},{"Title":"It's All About The Moon When The Sun Ain't Shining","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I flew through the pages to find out what Maurice was going to do about Omenita. His love for her was a perfect example of \\"love is blind\\". Fortunately, the scriptures read by Maurice's Grandpa Luke opened up Maurice's mind and his insight and at the last minute he avoided the mistake of his life. Notice I have been vague about my comments. That is because you need to read the story and see what happens. It is certainly worth your time."},{"Title":"It's All About The Moon When The Sun Ain't Shining","review":"Ernest Hill really went over the top with this book.

I felt engaged to it form the first down to the last chapter. Mr. Hill has a way with words. I feel there were some underline sexist approaches through out the book, but still never the less a great book. I saw that Love can and will be blinding to those who don't want to open their eyes to reality. I am glad Maurice mad the decision he mad, but upset with Omenita. I believed in her potential in growing from her past, and desired her to think differently of her surroundings. A key point that was made early on in the novel that we all should take heed to, was never let who you came from nor what people think of you control your destiny. As an individual you decide what you will endure so choose what is meant for you instead of another's burdens. I am a proud fan of Mr. Hill's novels and anticipating upcoming readings."},{"Title":"It's All About The Moon When The Sun Ain't Shining","review":"I must say that I truly enjoyed this book. When I started reading the book, it kind of threw me off but I kept reading. As I got deeper and deeper it got better. It was so many ways that one could interpret this book. But after reading it and then meeting the author he shined a whole new light on it. It's one of those books where it can make or break you. Now, that I've read and understood this book; I can honestly say that I'll buy anything that this authors writes. I just want to say I wish you much more success and thank you for such a wonderful book."},{"Title":"It's All About The Moon When The Sun Ain't Shining","review":"After reading ten chapters of the book, it's pretty obvious that the relationship between Maurice and Omenita wasn't going anywhere nor was it going to be happily ever after.It is pathetic that, as African-Americans, we still hold each other back because of fear and selfishness. Omenita possessed a great deal of selfishness, unhappines and ignorance. She worried about what others were thinking, failed to make better for herself, and expected Maurice to carry the weight she was carrying from her dysfunctional family.Maurice has two loving parents who worked hard to secure his future and well-being. Audrey, Maurice's mother, had every right to resent her because she didn't know how to carry herself as a lady and an adult. Maurice saw that Omenita was all about herself but he rebelled against his mother to prove to her that by being a man, he would marry her.Marriage and sex do not make a man. It is character and worth and Maurice has good character and worth that would make any woman want to be his wife. Omenita needed a reality check and Maurice was not her ticket to gaining her self-worth.Growing up does hurt but making foolish decisions hurts even more."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself UNIX 4th Edition","review":"The fourth edition is very helpful. The style is clear and plain, but overall this book would be improved by more attention paid to actual tasks than to commands per se, especially since some of these commands (to a newcomer) are cryptic. Nevertheless by taking notes and highlighting the index, it's easy enough to navigate this book. There's a helpful listing of major UNIX commands in the back. The book covers \\"getting started\\" (logging on and off, etc.), file and directory basics, UNIX tools (basic 'vi' stuff - the text editor), command customization, C/Korn/Bash shells, multitasking, the Internet and e-mail, FTP, shell and C++ programming basics, and system administration.As the authors state, the book is kept brief (397 pages) to ensure simple delivery of what's most needed to get started pushing buttons. The format is similar to Who's Afraid of C++? in that it tries to be user-friendly by supplying small quizzes and simple tasks at each chapter's conclusion to ensure you've grasped the basic ideas presented. This book can prove to be a life saver in any situation involving molecular orbital calculations involving UNIX navigation (C shell). Overall, this is a sympathetic and clear-cut introduction to UNIX."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself UNIX 4th Edition","review":"This is a great book to introdce newbies to the world of Unix.

The pool is very deep, and something lives at the bottom.That *thing* ensures that the residents stay wealthy and successful ...as long as it receives its periodic sacrifice.I've read quite a few of Gary Brandner's novels, and every one of them was solid.It's a shame he doesn't publish anymore.There was a six year gap between his last new paperback and \\"The Boiling Pool\\", then a four year wait for his limited-edition hardcover \\"Rot.\\" He hasn't had a new book since.(He did reissue his novels \\"Carrion\\" and \\"Floater\\" as trade paperbacks in the year 2000, though.)I heard that the premises for \\"The Resort\\" by Bentley Little and \\"Sacrifice\\" by John Farris may be similar, but I can't comment on that because I haven't read either book yet.Also recommended: \\"Salvation\\" by W.A.

The speaker in the poem \\"Urban Renewal\\" describes a long ago summer when he \\"watched a mother straddle a stoop . . . fingering rows dark as alleys on a young girl's head,' then explains that he \\"pledged [his] life right then to braiding her lines to mine, to anointing streets I love with all my mind's wit.\\" (3) Even if this isn't a reference to something Major Jackson himself experienced, it is an important clue to Jackson's own impetus to write.Judging from \\"Urban Renewal\\" and many other poems in \\"Leaving Saturn,\\" Major Jackson's main motivation in writing poetry is love-for his family, for his community and for the details of his world. Later in the poem \\"Urban Renewal\\", after describing an urban block party made possible by \\"woofers stacked to pillars,\\" Jackson asks \\"what amount of love can express enough gratitude?\\" (10) Indeed, Jackson's poetry reveals gratitude and deep appreciation for the urban landscape where he blossomed.Jackson's poetry is peppered heavily with details, some of them beautiful, like \\"a Baptist preacher stroking the dark underside of God's wet tongue\\" in \\"Some Kind of Crazy\\"(29), some of them ugly, like \\"a doorway that smelled like piss\\" in \\"Blunts\\" (24) and some of them disturbing, like the seven year old boy whose head was beaten into \\"a pulp of bad cabbage!\\" in \\"Don Pullen at the Zanzibar Blue Jazz Caf&eacute; (44), but all of them interesting. With \\"Leaving Saturn,\\" Major Jackson has done a notable job of anointing the streets he loves with all of his mind's remarkable wit."},{"Title":"Leaving Saturn (The Cave Canem Poetry Prize)","review":"This book is great, Major Jackson really has a way with words.

Its focus is on the gentle arc of islands stretching from Anguilla to Trinidad. Sugar, bananas, and oil are among the commodities that have and continue to play a role in the economic life of the region. The author gives us a brief history of the Caribbean's past reliance on the slave trade to support its agricultural economy and the sometimes bloody uprisings prior to its eventual abolition in the nineteenth century. It is the kind of information you will not find in Fodor's or most travel brochures (I write this note standing at a Curacao resort photographing an idealized mural of healthy black servants - the second I have seen today). Of greater interest to the curious North American may be the history of colonial involvement which has left its ethnic mark on the islands' culture along British, French, and Dutch lines. Anglo-Canadians will almost certainly be amused to recall that it was in the Treaty of 1763 that Britain opted to retain Canada - dismissed by Voltaire as a \\"few acres of snow\\". In exchange, the delighted French retained a dotted cluster of islands that for all its imagined similarity to paradise is extraordinarily difficult to locate on any map - Guadeloupe. The impact of tourism is tremendous in the Caribbean today and it seems only destined to grow with cheap airfares and travel 'channels' of information breathlessly promoting the regions' splendid climate and recreational amenities. While some voice reservations about the cultural or ecological impact of this recent 'invasion', others might argue that the material benefits imparted to the island economies are real, needed, benign, and re-occurring. Each island's cultural identity is a dynamic asset that can be protected but not totally controlled from change with civic planning and an eye toward promoting the preservation of local traditions. In this way tourism and local identity can evolve together. The cultural impact of tourism, the development of off-shore banking enterprises, an ever-present awareness of the United States (the CNN Effect) get little attention and are generally beyond the scope of this book. The sinister threat of the drug trade moving through the islands is noted (A vacationing Amsterdam physician tells me to read SNEEUW OVER CURACAO, J.van den Heuvel [untranslated]). These are topics that warrant serious attention. Reading Ferguson's introduction is a reasonable place to prepare for that more serious study."},{"Title":"Man Who Knew Too Much: The Strange & Inventive Life of Robert Hooke 1635-1703","review":"Towards the end of his life, Robert Hooke was worried that many of his inventions would be claimed by others, as had already started to happen. This volume gives much credit to the man who is often overshadowed and almost forgotten - because he was born in an era of many extremely talented individuals.Stephen Inwood has drawn extensively on material from Hooke's era and more recently to build up a picture of a very busy man, who is now remembered if at all for his work on springs (\\"Hooke's Law\\") and his arguments with Isaac Newton. Probably Newton's most famous words (\\"standing on the shoulders of giants\\") were written in a letter to Hooke. The weight of history sees the deified Newton crushing to oblivion some of those he stood upon. This was orchestrated more by his ardent admirers than Newton himself, although the father of gravity does not emerge from his debates with Hooke totally exonerated.There are good insights into the Coffee House culture that was present in the last half of the 17th Century, and the workings of the newly formed Royal Society. Hooke was a pivotal individual in the early years of this august body, and his regular papers and experimental demonstrations were extremely prominent in their weekly meetings for 30 years. Hooke had a grand dream about the usefulness of science, and the expectation that everything would be explainable in the fullness of time, even if not in his lifetime. In short, he had a limitless confidence in the problem solving ability of science, turning his back on superstition that was so prevalent around him.History has dealt with Robert Hooke too severely, and Inwood helps to address the balance. I am left a little breathless at the speed and scope of the tasks undertaken by Mr Hooke. Hindsight is a treacherous teacher, and can make the obvious trivial, whilst inappropriately assigning connections. Even allowing for the these tendencies, it seems that the legacy of Hooke is far reaching. He was ahead of his time, and could rightly claim to have done the founding work in many important areas [stellar parallax, watches, windmill, barometers, respiratory investigation, vivisection, celestial motion, telescopes, microscopes, navigation, light .......]. In some areas, his pioneering work was lost, and the advances not made again for 150 years.The book would have benefited from some diagrams of the matters discussed; the mechanisms for watches, or the differences between reflecting and refracting telescopes, for example. This aside, the author does not hide Hooke's flaws, but dispels his reputation of being a bad tempered complainer. Hooke did have several major disagreements with learned gentlemen (Newton, Huygens, Hevelius). However Isaac Newton had similar disputes. What is important is that Hooke also had a large circle of friends, and several individuals with whom he worked successfully for many years (Sir Christopher Wren, Halley, Tompion and Harry Hunt).Hooke is destined to be forever the bridesmaid, and never the bride. He was TOO busy, and if he started a train of thought, it was as if he had completed it in his own eyes. Many items of investigation were left unfinished, and only restarted when a rival had almost come upon a new or similar solution. This was the cause of many of his difficulties over establishing precedence in scientific matters. Not given the necessary credit, Hooke's work played the part of a catalyst to those in the wider community that was based around the Royal Society.The final irony is that Hooke accused many at of the time of blatant plagiarism. He did not foresee that a significant number of buildings that he designed (and in many instances, oversaw the construction of) would be attributed others. There is much talk of \\"Wren churches\\" rebuilt after the disastrous fire of 1666. Hooke worked on not a few of these. Inwood details his working relationship with Wren, and rightly acknowledges his large contribution to both building design and the \`project management' of getting a building completed. For most people, the contribution of Hooke to building would have been more than enough for a lifetime.Peter Morgan, Bath, UK (...)"},{"Title":"Man Who Knew Too Much: The Strange & Inventive Life of Robert Hooke 1635-1703","review":"The Man Who Knew Too Much: The strange and inventive life of Robert Hooke 1635-1703,By Stephen Inwood, Macmillan, 2002, 514 ff.This is a comprehensive biography of one of the most versatile of the early scientists. Although few of his discoveries and inventions are known to us today in the form in which Hooke discovered or devised them, since other scientists completed, refined or expanded on his early work, his work formed the foundation of scientific developments in many different fields. Stephen Inwood is a former lecturer in history and now a full-time writer.Inwood takes us in painstaking detail through all aspects of Hooke's life and the very many projects in which he was involved: sometimes I felt that this degree of detail obscured the significance of some of Hooke's achievements. His principal employer throughout his life was the then newly founded Royal Society; but he worked also at Gresham College and was personal assistant to another famous scientist, Robert Boyle. Hooke was a contemporary of Isaac Newton, but Hooke was not strong in mathematics, so this is where Newton triumphed. Hooke was involved in so very many projects that he usually did not have the time to complete many of them.Hooke favoured the wave theory of light while Newton thought of light as particles, and the wave theory was subsequently (until Einstein's work) to dominate. Hooke devised an early thermometer, barometer, hygrometer and pocket watch. It was he who designed and built the equipment that Boyle used to establish the gas law named after him; and Hooke established his own law of elasticity in strings and springs. His treatise \\"Micrographia\\" is a seminal work, not only on microscopy but dealing with geology and astronomy as well. He realised that fossils were the remains of previously living creatures and that geological formations had not been static since Creation (Hooke was nominally a Christian); only a century or so after Copernicus, Hooke was one of the first to attribute the orbits of the planets around the sun to gravity. In addition to the massive amount of scientific work he achieved, Hooke was also a competent architect and assistant to Christopher Wren in the rebuilding of London after the Great Fire of 1666. It was Hooke who designed and oversaw the building of the Monument to the Great Fire in London.This book gives scientific detail only in the broadest terms, so it is quite accessible to non-scientists. It also gives a fascinating picture of London life at the time of the Great Plague and Great Fire, and many of Hooke's contemporaries, like Newton, John Locke, Thomas Hobbes and Samuel Pepys are met in context. For those interested in the history of science or the social history of the time, this is an invaluable book. There is a substantial list of Notes and References and an Index."},{"Title":"Man Who Knew Too Much: The Strange & Inventive Life of Robert Hooke 1635-1703","review":"Ones who want to enjoy an amazing lecture about the origins of current science and scientific methods, about the pillars of modern theories and the dark side of some fathers of science are very welcome to read this book."},{"Title":"The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Freud's Papers on Technique (Vol. Book I) (The Seminar of Jacques Lacan)","review":"reports that the works of jacques lacan are difficult reading ring true, especially his first seminar. but, gentle reader, remember the seminars were talks, some of them interactive, and each seminar delivered over a period of 20 weeks for the training and edification of french speaking psychoanalysts, and the curiousity of the noted french intellectuals of the day and numerous students in attendance. the average american reader of the works of lacan is probably more interested in literary studies than psychiatry, psychoanalysis and psychology. and not without reason. in addition to explicating the word and works of freud, lacan, a voracious reader, sent to our shores, caught up in his texts, what could only be phrased as an enormous reading list of poets, philosophers, literary masterpieces, greek dramas, books of the bible, and the maxims of famous authorsthe first 7 chapters, the first 7 weeks, aren't of much interest for the \`american reader' searching for knowledge of the legend of lacan. but in the 8th week, the 8th chapter of the book, ms lefort shares a case of her own about a male infant hospitalized for various childhood illnesses in 25 different institutions for children before his 4th birthday before arriving at the denfert repository, confined \`on account of an unclearly defined para-psychotic state,' to be treated by ms lefort. here lacan, and those in attendance, are presented with a case of a seminar's participant's own account, and it's her asking lacan for a diagnosis and the discussion which follows, that should remind the \`american reader' of the purpose of the seminar(s), which it's sometimes easy to forget during the scintillating webbing of words spun by lacan.as difficult as the text is, the seminars are the best introduction to lacan and his work, and worth the effort needed to get thru the first seminar for anyone truly in interested in lacan's work. once one learns the psychoanalytic terminology and the topics discussed and reads the texts suggested by lacan, reading the other seminars becomes easier.jacques lacan presided over 27 seminars. his intention was to have his seminars published. lacan passed the publishing task on to jacques-alain miller. so far miller has published more than half of the seminars in french. english translations have proceeded at a slower pace. with the recent publication of seminar 17, the total seminars in print, under the norton heading, counting the \`four fundamental concepts of psychoanalysis' and \`on feminine sexuality, the limits of love and knowledge', bring the number to 7. 7 translations by 6 translators. in the acknowledgements following the text of the 7th seminar the editor, jacques-alain miller welcomes any readers who would like to collaborate in the revision of texts for publication. unfortunately, jacques lacan's seminars have not found its james strachey. those of us who do not speak french can hope mr miller's invitation finds more ears attuned to french and english."},{"Title":"The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Freud's Papers on Technique (Vol. Book I) (The Seminar of Jacques Lacan)","review":"There are still traces of Kojeve in the Lacan's first seminar, and Kojeve mixed with sociobiology (pigeons and the imaginary) and the ego and the id. The imaginary will at this point play a larger role than it will later, as will the ego (formed out of the imaginary and the mirror stage), but at the same time the origin of negativity and aggression, located in an alienating picture of ourselves. But is not negativity ultimately located in language (and even more specifically, in the word &quot;not&quot;), the word &quot;elephant&quot; that is more deadly to the the elephants than any machete? The word as the murder of the thing? It is curious that Lacan and Kojeve once planned to write a book on Freud, and Kojeve and Strauss planned a book on Hobbes and Hegel. The intersection is the state of nature, the humble theoretical origin of Kojeve's desire of another's desire."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I enjoyed this book very much.

Amelia describes almost word for word the emotions and feeling of her characters rather than their appearances. Alot of her characters are described in every way. My favorite is Aubrey. In Amelia's first book she described him as rude, and mean, and just Aubrey. But in this book she descibes how he cares for a human and falls in love with her. All the girls in my reading class are in love with him. We all agreed that Amelia needs to start a series of books on him starting from his birth to the end of his vampiric life.

I look forward to reading more of Atwaters books, and hearing alot more about Aubrey."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I will say that I found this book inspiring but not in the same way as any other great book that I would read. The reason for this are all of the \`for a teen' reviews. I will admit that for a teen Miss Atwater-Rhodes shows promise in her writing, but at the moment she is seriously lacking some key qualities that a real author should have.One of the main things that I missed in this book were these things called \`surprises'. Typically authors like to put them in their novels to keep the reader on their toes. But I didn't find them in Demon in My View. It was a straight read with nothing that totally twisted the meaning of the story around, and I don't know about you but there is nothing more enjoying than saying \\"I didn't see that coming\\" when you are in the middle of a novel.Number two, length. I know quantity does not equal quality, but I feel that this novel was a bit short for the story it told.Number three, a good villain. There are none at all in this book. I personally think that the kind of Vampires that are in these books are kind of wimpy, but even given that there is something wrong in this book. That is that the main antagonist (the vampire Fala) is weaker than most of the other characters. Through out the whole book Miss Atwater-Rhodes says time and time again that Aubrey is a very powerful vampire so you know that if Fala does try anything she's not going to succeed, the villain should always be the strongest (and Aubrey was a middle character in this book so he doesn't count).Fourth, the ending. It was just kind of a let down. I really would have liked to see something more than what happened, something more original and unexpected for sure.Now, back to the whole point; Inspiration. When I read this book it made me what to go out and write a novel that would be considered good by common standards and not just \`for a teen', so that people will finally know that us teens can do some things as well as adults can. Not the common way that you are inspired to write but oh well that's how I felt about this book. I truly hope that Miss Atwater-Rhodes next novel will be considered great for an adult author and not just \`for a teen'.I would not recommend buying this book at the moment because of it's price and shortness, wait until it comes out in paperback if you really want your own copy or if you just want to read it then see if you can't borrow it."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Jessica Allodola, a senior at Ramsa High School, is not your average teenager. Under the pen name Ash Night, Jessica has already published a vampire novel entitled TIGER, TIGER. She also has a pretty mean spirit, goes mostly ignored by her fellow students, and acts mostly indignantly towards her adopted mother.The problem is that with the arrival of two new students in school, Caryn and Alex, her book seems to be coming to life. Caryn claims to be a witch, descended from the Smoke line that Jessica wrote about in her book. Alex, a spitting image for her anti-hero, Aubrey, might very well be a vampire. And suddenly life starts to get a whole lot more confusing.DEMON IN MY VIEW is an entertaining vampire story, but it never gains the potential it might have if the story was fleshed out a bit more. Although Jessica's fiction begins to merge with real life, the chapters of the book are short, and the characters, though interesting, aren't as well-rounded as they could have been. What really irritated me about the book was the ending.--SPOILER--SPOILER--SPOILER--Aubrey turns Jessica into a vampire to save her life, but there's no resolution after that. Wham..she's a vampire..the end.

AAR goes for interest, writing about circumstances similar to her own. A teenage author, writing about a world of vampires (the same vampires within AAR's novels, even). Sounds interesting, right?Jessica Allodola, the narrator, remains predictable throughout the novel. Not once was I surprised by her actions or thoughts, which frustrated me. Aubrey, the would-be antagonist who emerges as quite the protagonist, is truly the moving force within the novel.

The writing, whilst not bad for a fifteen year old, is still far more juvenile, unstructured and ill thought out than one might expect from a published novelist. I resented paying full price for this book...if the author's only half the age of your average writer (and her writing definitely reflects this) then surely I should only have to pay half the average price for the book!Younger teens will probably like this incredibly short book (so short that I finished it in just a few hours). It wasn't too bad. But it wasn't brilliant either. Still, most vampire books I've read lately have been poorly written pap, so by comparison to the rest of its genre, I suppose this actually fares quite well.I would be interested in reading this author's later works, just to see if she's matured since writing this. But I won't be paying full price for them, not based on what I've already read in this book. It just wouldn't be worth it."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I'll admit to having read three of Atwater-Rhodes' books, the best of which I liked being Hawksong. This book, however--like most of her others--seems to lack something. It's not that she isn't creative or that she lacks the talent to weave a good story. Perhaps it's only that she lacks the practice and years of experience that other authors do.Jessica seems to be a bit flat for a main character. She feels a great deal of disdain not only for her adoptive mother but for her fellow classmates at school. Considering that they treat her like she carries some horrible, contagious disease, it's really no great surprise. But her constant sarcasm and blatant disdain for the people around her aren't really attractive qualities. It's refreshing to see a \\"heroine\\" (I use that term lightly) who has some kind of spunk and backbone, but she's overwhelmed with it. Another author also suggested below that it's a blatant Mary Sue. Although I can't quite agree with that--Mary Sues tend to embody perfection--I have to agree that it feels like a serious plug-in to me.Aubrey, the vampire \\"hero\\" of this story didn't spark a whole lot of interest in me. He seemed alot like the typical vamp to me. Cold, uncaring, ruthless... until he meets Jessica, someone who isn't what I'd call a ray of sunshine, and by page 104 (end of chapter 19) ends up kissing her. I might be wrong, but I think hundreds of years of previous behavior aren't going to change over night.The one thing I really do appreciate about Atwater-Rhodes's story telling is the amount of detail that she puts into describing her characters. In comparison, it leaves the rest of the story feeling drab. It would be nice if she could learn to maybe concentrate some more on other things. Another surprise--her chapters, on average, are no more than a few pages long at the very least. It's not that I'm asking for a tome of work here, but I can finish off her books in less than an hour if I'm not concentrating. I suppose her style is also a lot more simplistic than what I'm used to, but when you constantly write chapters that last a maximum of five-six pages (and often end between two and three) it's a little pitiful.One other thing I'd like to remark on that I found ironic and irritating is the symbol of the \\"black rose\\" for the vampires. Begging your pardon, though, but didn't L.J. Smith use a black/violet rose to symbolize the Night World in her series? Those books were written quite some time ago, but it wasn't so long ago that she couldn't have been familiar with that series. She's only three years older than I am, and I was crazy about those books when I was younger. I'm not accusing anyone of plagiarism, but I just find it a bit hard to swallow.So I guess, all in all, that although the book itself isn't horrible, it could use some work. There are probably better books to spend your money on, though, folks. I'm hoping that despite the redundant character personalities Amelia uses, Snakecharm will be better, at least. The title's catchier, anyhow."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I did and didn't care for this novel. I had been loaned it by my fiance's sister, who has read all of Atwater-Rhodes' books and loved them. I'm not much for young adult fiction, but I'll read just about anything put in front of me.One thing I did enjoy was that it did pick up on one of the characters of her first novel, the vampire Aubrey, and it expanded him a little more. You get a better view of the all vampire town, and what makes it tick. However, that was really my favorite part of the book.I didn't mind the plot itself, I find it better than her debut novel, but it's still not quite up to par. When I read the first few pages I actually groaned, it sounded like a self-insertion story, much like the ones you commonly see in Fan Fiction. However, after a couple chapters I realized it wasn't.Jessica is a lonely, sullen, high school senior who just happens to be a published author. Her first novel Tyger, Tyger is a story about a 300 year old vampire and her fight with another vampire she believes killed her brother. Sound familiar? When she starts her last year of high school she encounters a boy who could be a dead ringer for Aubrey, the male main character of her novel.It turns out it is indeed Aubrey, and he's come to her high school to check out the writer that's single handedly revealing all the vampire secrets to the world. If she's a threat, he's supposed to get rid of her, to prevent her from revealing anymore secrets. On the other end of the spectrum is a girl named Caryn, who comes from a long line of witches devoted to keeping the vampires from taking over.Once pieces of the plot fall into place, you figure out why Jessica knows so much about the vampires. That's kind of a disappointment too, it reminds me of a very poor vampire novel I read last fall. There's a side plot about a girl born to a former vampire, much like this one.While this one has more detail than the first book, I think it's my least favorite of the three I've read. It's a good start, but I think more story could have made this better."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"In this book, I believe Amelia does a much better job of writing than when she wrote In the Forests of the Night. She puts more character into the figures in the book and that really makes it flow. However, like all books, there are a few flaws.Jessica is the school outcast. People instinctively avoid her and she does not get along with her foster mom, Anne. She spends a lot of her free time in her room writing under the pen name, Ash Night. Then, Alex a.k.a. Aubrey-very powerful vampire, shows up at her school. She's attracted to him and thinks he looks just like the character, Aubrey from her book. Little does she know that Alex and Aubrey are one and the same and the words that she has been putting down on paper about the vampire community is true! The villainess in this story, Fala, wants her dead so she will stop writing about her kind, but Aubrey, returning Jessica's attraction, prevents her from doing so. Then, Anne's neck is snapped by a vampire sent from Fala in the church yard in broad daylight and Jessica wants revenge. She moves in with a line of witches and the woman she hates, Dominique Vida, most powerful witch and campire hunter shows up and warns Jessica that if she chooses the vampires, she will not protect her. Jessica wanders into New Mayhem, the vampire community, twice in the book. After the first time, Aubrey kisses her. After the second, a vampiress gets into trouble and Aubrey has to leave Jessica alone for a minute. But when he comes back, Jessica is gone...and so is Fala. Will Aubrey be in time to save Jessica or will Fala kill her and stop Jessica's revealing literature? All will be revealed in: DEMON IN MY VIEW."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"The book was in great condition upon arrival. It was also one of the most exciting books that I have ever read and would recommend this book to anybody. That is why I gave this book a 5 star rating."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I first read it when I was a kid and recently bought the hard cover to it, just to have it on my book shelf. The book is a quick read but will have you on your toes. Atwater-rhodes wrote this when she was a teenager, and it doesn't show. The characters have development along the short length of it, and the story has real progression, and a plotline that doesn't seem to get lost amongst character interaction. Overall, like I said, this is my favorite book even now as an adult. I totally recommend this to anyone that likes Anne Rice style vampires, The Vampire Diaries, or just dark and intriguing vampires."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Amazing.

She is original and not afraid to put real emotion into her work.However, I read The Kiesha'ra series before reading any of her earlier works. This was something of a mistake on my own part. Demon in My View was a very interesting perspective in a teenagers aspect. I liked the main character and her resolute personality traits.But I simply couldn't get into the story. It was really interesting, but it lacked a pull. I had little to guess at.It was a good read for a lazy day."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Demon in my View is the perfect taste of vampire, romance, darkness, and gothic. I've read many many many vampire novels in my time, and most of them seem the same. But, I do come across a few every now and then that strike me as odd, or different. This is one of those kinds of stories. It has vivid descriptions of the people and places to where you could possibly imagine that you've been there, or maybe even met one of the characters. The story line is out of this world with different rules and structures to an unknown society. The main character is buried in a mystery that, for the life of me, I would have never seen coming. I suggest this book to anyone, young and old. It's worth your time AND you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Demon in my view is an amazing book in my opinion! If you have read the first book In the forest of the night then you will understand the characters a little better..trust me i read shattered mirror and back tracked lol by the time i got to the first book i was like \\"OOOO i get it now\\"! but this book is still good i would recomend it to some people but its better for a early teen than an adult to read..still a short read but i enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"\\"Demon in My View\\" is the second book by one of my favorite authors, Amelia Atwater-Rhodes. Although I am arguably too old for teen books, I re-read this one recently and still found it enjoyable.The story follows Jessica, a writer of vampire novels. What she doesn't realize is that her stories are true, and they may get her into big trouble with the denizens of the night. Despite the fact that Jessica is clearly based on the author herself, I still found the story to be interesting and not to \\"Mary-Sue-ish\\". I know alot of other reviewers have complained about this problem, but it really doesn't bother me. I know it isn't realistic for characters to all be beautiful and perfect, but sometimes it's fun to read a story with dark, sexy, cool characters. It's just a bit of self-indulgent fun sometimes. Anyway, despite the fact that the last time I read this book was in Middle School (many many years ago), I still found the story to be entertaining. The dark atmosphere of Amelia's books really draws you in and keeps you glued to the pages.Another thing I'd like to mention is the references to the previous book, \\"In the Forests of the Night\\". I really enjoyed the connection to the previous story, because it helps you feel that the stories are all intertwined within the same world. There's even a short reference to Jessica in \\"In the Forests of the Night\\", which is a nice \\"easter egg\\"-type surprise for those who have read the book either before or after reading \\"Demon in My View\\".\\"Demon in My View\\" is perhaps my favorite of Amelia's books. So, I'd definitely recommend this book to teens and even adults who are fans of vampire novels."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I recently read this book and its predecessor \\"In the forests of the Night\\" and I absolutely loved them. \\"Demon in my View\\" was a fast paced thrilling narrative about a girl,Jessica, who is shunned by her peers due to her dark attitude and dress. Along come two new students. One, Caryn, who's annoying and bubbly who Jessica absolutely loathes and Alex, a dashing, just as dark and brooding guy. Jessica is a talented writer and has published a book Tiger, Tiger under a pen name to avoid the unnecessary attention. What she realizes though with these new students is that know more about her than any other person really. She starts to realize that the characters in her book are strikingly similar to her new real life friends and acquaintances.The whole book is a non stop race to get to the truth. For a small short book the story evolves well. Atwater-Rhodes finds such creative ways to advance her story and they sure throw you a curve ball once in a while. The characters are vivid and intriguing with a touch of passion and romance. I especially loved Jessica. Her character is so strong and passionate and it sends a great message to little girls who read these stories."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"The concept in this book was interesting. I need to go back and read In The Forests of the Night as I think Jessica makes her initial cameo in that book and I hope you learn more about Aubrey. The story kept me going right to the end but everything seems to happen so abruptly. In the space of 176 pages you meet Jessica, learn she dreams are reality of the vampire community, meets Aubrey, falls in love and then chooses to become a vampire. The book really glosses over her reasons for being so eager to become a vampire that it is a little shocking. Considering the author wrote this at such a young age though it was a good book to read if you enjoyed The Vampire Diaries by LJ Smith and Twilight by Stephenie Meyer."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book just over uses the whole vampire and human being fall for each other thing. Amelia streotypes the whole outcast thing making them all out as cynical think they are better then everyone.The writer who happens to be writing the exact events in exchange . . . see where I am going. This book is full of originality and no thought up ideas by her own creative mind. This book doesn't evn show a creative atmosphere. I admit the vampire being able to survive in the sunlight is fine but i think if she was going to change that se should at least tried to change the world a little rathe then setting it in our world using modern world science fiction.I can't think od anyone who could relate to her character: Jessica. I know plenty of outcast who love writing but they aren't cold and heartless. She doesn't have have a soul. This book is crap. I have never read something so inexperienced by someone my age. I have read better."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I'd draw the comparisons between Amelia and I, just to show that I can relate. I'm a 15 year old aspiring writer who also has a penchant for otherworldly creatures (vampires, etc), but Demon in my View is much like all the other horror/fanfiction stories online, and doesn't deserve to be published anymore than they do.For one, I find it ridiculous that Jessica is &quot;Drop dead gorgeous, has a body to kill for, etc.&quot; while she is unpopular. No matter how cynical, no matter how bitchy one is, I have found the beautiful ones are always popular.The characters are all vaguely defined spare for the oh so modest autobiographical Jessica, who sounds like she is written to sound too cynical.Seriously, this book was worse than an episode of Dawson's Creek. And that is very bad indeed. Predictable.In the Forests of the Night was by far better, although short, and still not worthy of publication. Yet Risika was more well-defined, and the novel had a solid if a bit digressive story line.Amelia chose to focus on using words that will make her sound like an adult rather than focus on the developing plot and description. Aubrey wasn't even the antagonist. She did in every way possible to just try and make him suave, which made me vomit.In short, it's acceptable writing, perhaps a pale imitation of 40-year old writers who write teen novels (Pascal, Pike, Stine, etc.) Like a bad episode of Dawson's Creek, irritable characters surface everywhere, the plot is predictable, full of teen angst and not even any witty lines (that you might see in buffy, at least.)Acceptable, but not good."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I will admit that I thought this book was better than than In the Forests of the Night, yet it still did not stand well on its own. As a book written by someone in her teens, it is better than passing. As a piece of fiction on its own, it is a little contrived and unoriginal. Though I like the character Jessica, I liked her more the first times I saw her, as Alisa in The Last Vampire series and Anita from the Anita Blake mysteries. If you have read any of the books from either of those series, you will see the... shall we say similarities? If it were not for the novelty of the author's age, and her obvious, but still to be developed, talent, I would say don't read this. But this book IS interesting, in its own way. If contradictory. And a bit unoriginal. But still, interesting. Try it."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Though, this book is slightly longer than the first one, I was still disapointed. First of all, the authors writing style seems to not have improved at all, and her voice sounds like that of Anne Rice and a blend of several other writers, thus denying the quality of uniqueness that makes you want to jump in and gobble up every word. Not only that, but the story is rather unoriginal as well. If you have ever read &quot;The Last Vampire&quot; by Christopher Pike, then you will see that the relationship between Jessica and Aubrey is very similar to that of Sita and Seymour (Seymour also writes true stories about vampires). Still, it's worth a read to make your own opinion. I would have given this book a two and a half if I could have."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Don't let the summary fool you. It sounds interesting, but it's horrible. The plot is pointless, the characterizations are unrealistic, and the main character is definitely not likeable. The entire time I was reading the book, I kept waiting for the good part to start, and then I read the last page and realized it never came. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"The demon in the title through me off, I'm not into reading \\"demon\\" books. Well, it's not, instead this one contains vampires and the witches who kill them.It was strange feeling a connection to the obvious \\"bad guys.\\" The vampires are evil and they do kill to feed. The witches are good and they risk their lives and family to stop them. This is not a book about that fight. The witches are more in the background, but leave an obvious impression. There like a shadow that leaves the main characters more colorful and bright. Jessica knows she is different. Kids at school skitter away from her even as she approaches and she doesn't have the best relationship with her adoptive mother. Her only release, her only freedom is the books she writes and her all black room is stacked with her manuscripts. She is only 17 and, as of only two weeks ago, published her first novel about vampires. Her second one is at the publishers right now.Alex is the new boy at school, but he has a secret. He's not there for an education, but to kill the author publishing his history as the vampire, Aubrey. He doesn't know how she knows all his intermost secrets, but she must die. Only when he meets her face to face, he doesn't, and he doesn't even understands why.Caryn is also a new girl at school and she's there looking for Jessica, too. But for a different reason than Aubrey. Caryn is a witch and it is her life duty to protect Jessica, even if she doesn't want protection.Very well written book. It is a short read: I finished in only a couple of hours, but very satifying. I'm looking forward to reading more books by Atwater-Rhodes."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I didn't really like this book. While the writing is decent for a fifteen-year old, the plot and characterization left much to be desired. Jessica Allodola is spunky but I couldn't stand her after a while. The way the author dwells on her looks reminds me a little too much of a Mary Sue in a bad fanfic, and I heavily dislike Sues. Also, her rejection from normal high-schoolers did not really endear her to me, mainly because very little of her behavior made me feel sympathetic for her situation. Caryn Smoke was also annoying in her goody-two-shoe way. There are ways to make goody-two-shoes bearable, but Amelia gives her little depth so I liked her only sometimes, and I spent most of the book disliking her. I wonder if that's intentional. Aubrey in no way frightened me. Sure he's Jessica's protector, but isn't he supposed to be a ALMIGHTY VAMPIRE? Jeez, my mom could kick his butt in about ten seconds so I'm not as surprised about this Risika person kicking his butt as I'm supposed to be. Aubrey and the rest of the vampires lacked real personality and complexity. As for Jessica's real mother, what kind of person in whatever time period she came from would name their child Jazlyn? That in no way resembles an old-fashioned name. The witches were annoying, and I disliked them which leaves no character left for me to love. The plot was decent, and there were a few things I liked. Still, I was so bored that I didn't read the last chapter.I give this two stars. The only reason I didn't give it one was because of decent writing and a few interesting plot elements."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book just over uses the whole vampire and human being fall for each other thing.

I waited two weeks, and forced myself to get all the way through it. The thing I found least exciting about this book is that she wrote the book about her books! Only a writer down on her luck writes like that. Also, every character was dark, gloomly, the same. I LOVED her last book, In the Forest of the Night. Then in this book, the vampires turned from superman strong to can't kill a girl. I was disappointed at this. When I was finished with this book I thought, I can write better then this.

The imagery in both novels is just breathtaking; she describes every detail so vividly that I swear I know her characters personally. My favourite character would have to be Aubrey. I am truly in love with this character. He's mysterious and dangerous, yet oh so seductive and sexy. I was thrilled when it turned out that he was in this second novel as well, and now cannot wait for the third book to be published.

Enchanting, delightful, captiviating. Having re-read Demon in My View last night (up to twelve thirty), I can't complain. Amelia Atwater-Rhodes has miracously avoided the sophomore curse that other great writers have suffered from, producing an intricate, tension-filled, bloody, downright splendid work of art. This is not a novel, it's a work of art. Though In The Forests of the Night, Atwater-Rhodes' debut novel published at the age of thirteen (?), was quite good, and lays down the mortar for future books to hopefully come, Demon in My View blew me away. Starting with the poem by Edgar Allen Poe, it sets the mood. Move onto the book, it gives the reader a feeling of eerieness, and slight smugness, because they know the truth behind Caryn Rashida and Alex Remington, while Jessica is annoyed by one, and despertaly trying to find an alternative (&quot;an obsessed fan?&quot;) for the other's behavior, respectively. The tension between Aubrey and Jessica is great, and I truly do hope that we see them again in a future work of art from Amelia. She is a fantastic writer. Demon in My View is her best."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I LOVE this book. It is one of my all time favorites!

I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I read Demon in My View expecting it to be annoying and trite, but was surprised to find that Amelia Atwater-Rhodes is a superb writer.The story is about Jessica, a girl who writes vampire novels under the pen name Ash Night. When two new students transfer to her school, her life changes dramatically. Alex (one of the new students) is there to kill her, and Caryn (the other new student) wants to protect her. But the thing is, Jessica feels a familiarity with Alex, and soon realizes that he is not Alex, but Aubrey: one of the powerful vampires she has written about in her novels. Suddenly everything she had thought was fiction is true, and the vampires are angry that their lives are being read about by the public.I enjoyed Demon in My View very much, but there were a few things that brought my rating down from 5 stars. First of all, Jessica, the 'protagonist,' is really not all that likeable. She's rather mean to her peers, and seems unnaturally withdrawn and dark. In her room the only thing that isn't black is a purple pillow. And despite the fact that nobody likes her, Jessica can still look in the mirror and know that she has 'a body and face to die for.' Her character did not appeal to me at all.Nevertheless, Demon in My View is a worthwhile read, especially if you like vampires and romance. Amelia Atwater-Rhodes is a wonderful writer, and she will only get better with time. I commend her on a job well done, and I look forward to more books by her in the future."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"An averagly done sequel.

But I believe that 'Demon in My View' is the most inspiring book for teen because it tell you to follow your heart and most of all, that reading and writing is power and those who read and write have the power! This statement proves that it is true when Jessica's stories that she writes have a power over her very existence because some very angry vampires come to have revenge on Ash Night (Jessica's auther name). And during this time of heroism,fear,adventure and amazingly love, a familiar characters are mentioned. Aubrey is one of the vampiers that play a very importaint role in Jessica's adventure. So saying this I very much suggest that you find out for yourself how you feel about this breathtaking story."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I love books based on the supernatrual, and this book definatly hits my top 10 fave books. Im 15, and read Amelia's first book, In the Forest of the Night, about 5 months ago, but was only able to buy this great sequal recently. And let me tell ya, I love it. I prefer it better then the 1st book, which had a great story, but this one... In the middle of reading it I thought &quot;Oh no! Im almost done with it! It can't be.&quot; I wouldn't suggest this book to guys though, becuase it's mainly about a romance, between a hot hunk of a vampire, and mortal girl. So girls, GO FOR IT! You wont be dissapointed. I just finished this book ten minutes ago! And I am soo glad shes coming out with a new book. I was almost worried she wasn't. Agian, GREAT BOOK. She is definatly the Anne Rice of a new Generation."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I think that the writing was impressive, especailly on a 16-year-old. The story was pretty good but something was missing. I liked seeing Aubery return and lots of charecter devolpement in his direction. But I found a few things strange about it. It almost felt like the author was putting herself in the lead charecter spot. And with the whole Aubery story-lline was like reading &quot;Daughters of Darkness.&quot; He reminds me way to much of Ash, an evil charecter in the first book but he has a change of heart in the second when he meets his soulmate. I'm looking forward to her next book, I hope her writing will mature along with her age."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Atwater-Rhodes as sucessfully created another masterpiece. But,unfortuneatly, this one was also short and left me craving more. Iread it within two hours immedtiatlly after I bought it today. What bothered me a bit, is that Risika didn't show up. If Amelia writes another in this series I'd love to know more about Jessica and Aubrey and all the others. Both books are outstanding. Keep it up!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Jessica's story ideas come to her in dreams. She dreams of vampires: how they're changed, their fights, their love, even their secret hide out. She doesn't really believe in vampires. She doesn't know that her dreams are all real. But the vampires do and they're ticked. Aubrey is sent to kill her but he just cant. So Fala gives him a choice: kill her or change her."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I agree with the \\"reader from the USA\\". Yes, this chick is very talented and all that, but this book proved very much otherwise. It was a cute story at first but then it just started to become plain boring and cliche. What kind of vampire would go into high-school just to kill some girl? Why not be smart and attack her while she's asleep or typing on her computer? And he doesn't kill her because she can stare into his eyes? It's just a vampire/human love story gone wrong."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Every true writer loves the language he works with. Some go as far as to become poets, linguists, philologists. Others become fluent in obscure languages to acquaint themselves with the literary legacies of long-gone peoples (and understand Enya's lyrics in the process). Word by word, each one crafts his peculiar voice, the quality that makes the author's writing unmistakable. Precocious Amelia has no such voice of her own. She uses short words, and she uses long words, but no matter how hard she tries, her writing stays flat on the page, as lifeless and uninvolving as any other hack writer's.This is a key point: Atwater-Rhodes is a real writer. She has the mechanical skill, and her prose reads quickly and evenly (partly because of the size of the print and the extremely small pages). But she simply does not challenge herself. Amelia can gauge her abilities, and does not overextend (unlike, say, the young Anselm Audley, whose unpremeditated foray into the world of multivolume fantasy has produced a lumbering disaster), but her second novel is written entirely on auto-pilot. One YA cliche dictates another, and before the 100-odd-page book shows a glimmer of meaning, it is over. \\"Demon In My View\\" is easily the most contrived and artificial read in recent memory. No character is explored in any depth, no relationship is substantiated, no idea is given legs to stand on. Her millennia-old vampires act like sulky teens, and no rambling about proud bloodlines and anaesthetic saliva can change that. The author seems intent on destroying any possible suspense. The very moment sporty teenage agents of darkness move into Ramsa High, the narration switches over to their perspective, so we can listen in on the telepathic conversations and find out the backstory.The heavy lugubrium is easily funnier. The characters are never established as personalities, and they simply cannot be taken seriously as they amble about, spitting paltry curses (\\"Bite me!\\") and tightly-wadded bits of dialog that positively drips with sarcasm. This is especially funny during a combat scene that lasts fully two chapters.In other authors' work you can find evidence of rich, full lives, obscure kowledge, professional tidbits, personal insights. As David Gerrold confides in his \\"The Martian Child\\", even the earthquake that has just destroyed your house is source material for a writer. \\"Demon In My View\\", on the other hand, could have been pulled out of thin air, and probably was. Dull, inane, meaningless.P.S.: Every novel of this sort must include a line of vicarious gratification. Here is Amelia's - \\"Jessica well knew she had a body and a face to die for.\\" And, as another reviewer has noted, the way Jessica ignores her mother's death is absolutely disgusting."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I read this book after reading Atwater-Rhodes first book In the Forests of the Night. Demon in my View is defintely Rhodes best work.This follow up to the young writers first novel is sure to find its way into the backpacks of young adults everywhere.This great author has found new ways of making the vampiric world in her books seem as real as you or me. Anyone who starts reading this book will not be able to put it down.It starts out with a young highschool outcast named Jessica who writes vampire books.There is a short discription of Jessica's life, then it goes to a young man named Alex Remington who in reality is Aubrey the villan from In the Forests of the Night the two come to find theirselves in eachothers company quite often through out the novel.Through Aubrey, Jessica learns that the world she writes about is real. The point is this is a great book and your sure to love it so I strongly urge you to buy it today."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Amelia Atwater-Rhodes's sophomore book, Demon In My View, intriguingly displays her excellent writing skills and the many ways she has matured with time. The anti-social protagonist, Jessica, who has released fictional vampire stories under the pseudonym Ash night, soon realizes that her accounts/stories are far from fiction. Coming face to face with her own characters, Jessica soon finds herself cheating death and falling for her novel's devil-may-care-but-I-don't vampire, Aubrey. Rhodes combines the right amount of suspense with the perfect dash of romance to polish off a down-right good scary story."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Okay, all you Amelia Atwater-Rhodes fans, don't jump all over me! ;) We are all allowed to have our own opinions. I was expecting a lot more from this book, and was truly hoping that the author would have matured more since her first book.Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. Although longer than the first book, there still wasn't much to sink your teeth into, so to speak. I also found this book to be a little self-indulgent, on the author's part, similar to what Anne Rice does on occasion (not in a good way). I am sorry if my opinion does not mesh with yours, but I am entitled to it. I gave Amelia two chances, and even though I am a fan of horror, I probably won't read the next one."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"One of my biggest nitpicks, besides the obvious self-insertion, is the fact that somehow, Amelia has picked up the idea that bigger and longer (in some ways, \\"fancier,\\" if you will) are better. What I mean is, Amelia puts in description after description, adjective after adjective. Yes, description is good...but there is a limit, and unfortunately, the author crosses it time and time again. Is it really necessary to say that the alarm clock's numbers glow SADISTICALLY? Amelia seems a bit too in love with tacking on adjectives, adverbs, and the like into her sentences--almost as if she skimmed over her words and marked all places that, in her opinion, did not have enough description.Plus, Amelia has obviously never heard about the misusing of \\"said\\" substitutes. What do I mean? Well, it's simple. In the story, her characters pretty much mumble, plead, snarl, ask, answer, mutter, or snap...but they don't SAY. Or, when they do, it's normally accompanied by a--*gasp*--adverb! Or some other form of \\"embellishment.\\" Any writer should avoid this common pitfall of overusing these substitute words. Say it with me--\\"said\\" is your friend. You WANT to \\"say\\" things.Demon in My View is a classic example of why embellishment is not always good. In fact, it can be downright nasty. Unfortunately, Amelia doesn't seem to know this...and some reviewers might mistaken her different, more fanciful style as a teenager with above-average writing skills. But, in reality, it's just an example of a kid trying too hard...and failing miserably."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This is Amelia Atwater-Rhodes' second vampire novel, a story of the progress of a woman who finds herself writing compulsively about the creatures of the night. Jessica Allodola, a senior I high school has already published one novel, and is awaiting the release of her second, but her computer is filled with an entire mythology. One that comes to her at night like a dream that will not let go.Suddenly the tales become real, and Jessica is confronted with the reality of Aubrey, the vampire at the center of her tales. Both the vampires and the witches that hunt them are real, and Jessica realizes that she knows far too much for her life to continue as before. Jessica's need for isolation prevents her from reaching out to witches like Caryn Rashida, and soon her life becomes a turmoil of shadow and threat. Jessica is strong, but is she a match for those that would seek her death?Although many of its themes are borrowed from the works of other writers in this genre, this story still displays some creativity in the nature of vampires and how they live among humans. The plot is really neither romance nor horror story, but runs closer to a third person diary. As such, the characters never quite develop to any depth. If the reader is looking for the strong feelings and prose of Anne Rice, or the action and violence of a Buffy story, then 'Demon in My View' will fail to satisfy.Because of Atwater-Rhodes' age (15) at the time of writing this, it is tempting to be overly forgiving. However, I believe that kind of condescension is a disservice to both the writer and the reader. The truth is that, while well composed, the story lacks what is needed to bring it to life. I fault the story more for its emotional distance than it's somewhat stagy plotting.As an interior tale, I found it a watercolor masquerading as a drama. While the author avoids the trap of depending entirely on action, she moves her characters as a chess player would. It is a bit too sparse for me, and I feel the book underestimates its intended audience. On the other hand, it is hardly a failure, and promises much for the future."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but I disliked it even worse than the first. Reader from the Great Lakes is correct: This book is extremely teen-y, very full of teen attitude. I am a teen, but I hate all of the literature that features an &quot;ordinary&quot; teen bunch. And yes, the vampires WERE enough, they didn't need witches in addition to it.And she seems to be turning back on her own mythology (which is why it's a good idea to have it at least partially structured BEFORE you write). Her exploration of Aubrey and turning him into a more caring person kind of wrecked the one character of hers that I liked.In addition to that, the plot kind of felt... forced. A gorgeous teen vampire-fiction writer being stalked by a gorgeous bunch of vampires? Aubrey being mysteriously drawn to her? It's boring where it's not unoriginal.The entire book seemed somewhat narcissistic. Not only does the idea of inserting oneself into a book make me cringe (I only do that when I satirize myself--such as my funny run) but Atwater-Rhodes even talks about how her alter-ego Jessica has a body and face &quot;to die for,&quot; about how graceful and brave and strong and beautiful and attractive she is.And, of course, she is a misunderstood, cynical outcast--apparently the amazing body and face don't add anything to her charm at an &quot;ordinary&quot; high school *heavy sarcasm*. I began hoping that Fala WOULD kill Jessica. The ending and explanation almost made me laugh, it was so self-indulgent.In addition to this, I once thought I'd like to meet Miss Atwater-Rhodes. But if she is like Jessica, no longer. Jessica is obnoxious, selfish, and self-absorbed--the only person she seems to think about in the book other than herself is Aubrey, and half the time it's because HE's to die for.And in an effort to make herself sound more &quot;gwown-up,&quot; she also chose words that were... bad. They didn't fit with the tame teen-horror flick plotline. (And was the bisexual vampire REALLY necessary? Felt like &quot;look at me, I'm mature for my age!&quot;)Fala was so cookie-cutter I cringed, and Caryn... well, I hate to say this, but she was kinda wimpy. And though I liked the poem, for heaven's sake, it wasn't even hers!I know many teens who can write much better than this, without becoming painfully self-indulgent. She simply doesn't have enough talent to merit the adulation she's getting. She is not an inspiration to me, because I aspire to publish material that is truly timeless.This book is very bad. Read something by Vivan Vande Velde, but not this. I hope not to read anything by this author in future. Good night."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I love vampire stories. I will obsess over a good one. I will slam a bad one, and I'm afraid to say this is a bad one.The problem with this story is that it takes a long time to get to nowhere. Plot elements that could've been interesting just take too long to get to, and the manner in which they are presented makes it seem like nothing has happened at all. There is a climax, but it practically doesn't exist. The only point when it even started to get interesting was the end, and that's probably only because of the possibilities. What would really happen if she had continued the story would be a series of missed opportunities.The protagonist has the personality of a dead fish, and although her origins are interesting I would not like to have another go with this character. The vampires are little better, they have personality all right, the personalities have a depth a grade schooler could have come up with. There is the blood obsessed vampire and then there is the usual misunderstood hot vampire boy. Then the witches, who are just generally pathetic. Even the \\"vampire hunter\\" witch is a yawn, not to mention abnormally annoying.When I heard the writer was only 16 (not sure really but somewhere in that range) the quality of the writing made sense. This is the product of a developing writer who will get much better with practice. What really astounds me is that the publishing house actually saw this book fit to be published. It's a bore, overwritten and messy. There is a market for all things dark and vampiric but they can't seriously expect that audience to be so idiotic."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book caught my attention when I heard she was chosen as one of the top teen that would change the world in Teen People, but apparently didn't read it until someone suggested it. So, I decided to read her first book, which is sadly better, then this novel, or shall I say \\"novella\\" since it is nowhere near the size of an average novel. Only consisting around 30,000-50,000 words on average. That's how short this book is about, something that would take a middle school kid to read within an hour or two.I've read novellas before and I have read good ones, but this was one of the terrible.Starting with Jessica, our heroine who is this supposed \\"tough girl\\" with a bad attitude. She's mean and cynical and sounds like one of the characters from Dawson's Creek, this is due to the overdrive of sarcasm. The sarcasm is what immediately annoyed me. I hate Dawson's Creek and listening to teens talk like that.Next up, clich&eacute;s such as \\"boy toy\\" also irritated me. This novel was piled up of clich&eacute;s.Anyway, moving back to Jessica, how was she treated badly? Her foster mother was a good person, the only reason she made Jessica's life hell was due to Jessica's snobbery. Overall, the one reason why she had no friends was due to her insensitivity and judgmental nature. All this character did was criticize the \\"beautiful\\" people when she's one of them. She tends to make these vampires out as power beings, but never convinces me of it. They seem weak as a mortal, only cocky about their strength.Now, here come the vampires, are they really vampires? Vampires are known as what? Creatures of the darkness. The mystery was taken out when she decided to create these beings by day. No holy objects harmed them, nor can stakes kill them, their only vulnerability is magic. WTF?! I would have been more convinced if she gave these creatures a different name. The only similarity to the vampire is the fact they drink blood.Aubrey is one of these vampires and like Jessica he is \\"hot\\" so hot that she falls in love with him at instant of glance. That's another thing the romance was far fetched. She fell for him within a few days. AAR never got deep with the relationship. All we knew was that she's annoyed with him one second and the next, poof, she's in his arms.Now comes the person we love to hate, the villain... well, I liked her. There was nothing vicious about this villain. I thought it was hilarious when AAR stated she was one of the \\"weakest.\\" So, you know Fala is going to lose. Wow, how predictable. From what people have taught me, never make the villain the weakest character. Even when I was seven I knew that.The point about Jessica being of vampiric lineage didn't shock me at all, actually, I didn't find it a bit interesting. Those dream sequences bored me, those were the passages I skimmed through just to keep awake.The elements of a novel are all missed here, characterization, apparently middle school students consider one chapter of Jessica's description \\"good character development\\" and apparently only those who have no skill in telling those apart will fall for that. Everything else from plot structure to choopy time space, mainly failed.She moved too quickly into the story without even introducing us. A lot of people have been saying this plot is similar to a Christopher Pike book, yes, that is true and I understand she reads C. Pike, well, big surprise. The plot was terribly unoriginal along with every other element.By the end, I was begging Fala to kill the heroine.With a good agent, anyone can get published and that's how she came about this = luck. Her writing is dreadfully inexperienced, but most teen readers will not care to notice. If it sounds like a vampire story clashed with a teen genre then they'll love it. While it annoys others such as I."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book starts off well, but somehow goes down. I personally enjoyed Ms. Atwater-Rhodes' previous book, which was quick yet satisfying. I somewhat wish that she would go back and revisit the premise with Risika and go into more depth.The book is good and has much potential, but Rhodes simply doesn't delve too deeply into giving us insight to her characters. They do act like spoiled teenagers, when they've lived for thousands of years. The characters barely interact, and when they do, they're fighting. I have to admit, in &quot;Demon&quot; the interaction amongst the characters was a bit more evident, but the fact that Jessica is a &quot;teen vampire author&quot; makes everything seem a bit faked and forced.Aubrey's personality could be more developed, and so could Jessica's. I enjoy Ms. Rhodes' maturing writing, but her books seem half-baked and too short. The ending could have had much more fulfilling and in-depth. The real meat of her stories is pallid, and leaves much unexplained. Rhodes also repeats much of what has already been said, which can get annoying after awhile. I really want to know more about the characters, but her writing style seems too forced to fit in much imagination. There isn't even much explanation why the students hate Jessica so much.Spend your money on this book if you want a quick read."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This is a great book that is in a way a sequel to Atwater-Rhodes's first novel.

She thinks that what she writes is fiction, but when she meets Alex, who has an uncanny resemblence to the powerful vampire, Aubrey (a character that readers will recognize from the first book) she begins to realize that what she wrote was not at all fiction. This is a very suspensuful novel that readers will enjoy even more after reading her first book, In The Forests of the Night.

The writing is clever and if you're a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you may find you like this book as well. I don't want to give off the wrong connotation however, this book is not in the same light, humorous vein (no vampire puns were injured in the making of this review) as BtVS.This is more of a young Anne Rice turning the corner and bumping into Stephen King. Now that's a heady air I liken this book to and I do not mean to imply Ms. Atwater-Rhodes is in that realm but she has come a long way in character development, although at some points I felt the plot was getting away from her. She has to believably tie in the protagonist with a fictional character the protagonist has created to the world the protagonist lives in.

Since there isnt a summery thing on the back of this book, I'll tell a little about it. Its about Aubrey, a vampire (I think hes like 3,000 years old, I cant remember), and Jessica, an author who writes stories about vampires. She doesnt know it, but her stories are true. Aubrey is one of the strongest, most feared vampires, and he is sopposed to kill Jessica so she cant tell their stories anymore. One problem: They fall in love.... I loved reading about how Aubrey, this big, bad vampire, falls in love with a human. The ending was great, and I am now reading &quot;Shattered Mirror&quot;.

It's as simple as that.First of all, there were no likable or sympathetic characters. Gothic, vampiric Jessica was a stereotypical disaffected teen who expresses that through Gothic/vampire get up.The story was kind of stupid. First of all, Jessica is a seemingly unknown author who writes under the nom de plume, &quot;Ash Night.&quot; Her novels spring to life in the characters of classmate Aubrey/Alex, who is pure evil and his group of vampiric monsters.Caryn and her mother are white witches on a mission to warn Jessica of Alex' evil, he really is the Aubrey of her novel, &quot;Tiger, Tiger,&quot; a vampire's tale.The story just plain makes no sense. There are too many coincidences, too clearly drawn stereotypes to make it feel convincing. If this was a western, Jessica and the vampire bunch, especially that revolting Fala would be wearing black hats and Caryn and her mother would be the ones with white hats. Other kids shy away from Jessica; the girl radiates pure evil like her seemingly &quot;novel&quot; characters. Jessica even has an all black bedroom and dresses in black.Although it is quite impressive that a teen wrote and published this book, it is rather unsettling that she harbors such dark fantasies. Many people would find such a thing alarming and wonder if penning such stories was a cry for help.I personally disliked this book, but the author is to be commended for breaking into the business at such a tender age."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I didn't like this book at all.

By using this girl, they not only rake in loads of money, but they also get a ton of media attention. It might not be this girl's fault either that she's being used like a rag.

I don't give her any more than two stars because she HAS NO REAL EXPERIENCE IN WRITING. I've been reading adult/young adult fiction for going on three years now and I know the plots can be drippy and shallow - especially for the fantasy genre. But this... this is beyond shallow. I read it in an hour and a half (which completely kills my habit of reading a book in the wee hours of the night to the wee hours of the morning). The characters have no personalities. The plot is predictable, boring, and something that ANY high schooler could have written. I admit, I see potential. I would advise Amelia Atwater-Rhodes to fine tune that potential, take a writing course, and then her next novella will be better. She could be the next Ann Rice.

Her vocabulary is impressive, yes, but that doesn't compensate for her lack of story flow. Sure, she's got one up on me, because she very obviously can finish a story, and if I could, I'd certainly be in the literature market. However, this girl, talented though she may be, is an Anne Rice wannabe who makes writing look hard. The whole reason such books as Interview With a Vampire are so wonderful is because they flow and are not cramped and forced. This writing makes me cringe; it is obviously written to conform to someone's idea of a &quot;good&quot; book, and that just doesn't work. Ideas and stories need to come on their own, they can't be beaten out with a stick. I am being a bit harsh, I know, but I was so angry and dissapointed at the misrepresentation of the writing youth. Believe me, we do not all glorify material objects and adventure and death. Yes, vampirism and witchcraft are powerful subjects- but what Atwater-Rhodes and my entire generation's gothic sub-culture don't realize is that when you play around with a serious subject, you water it down until it is no better than the pop culture you are trying to escape from.Yes, this novel is an okay start for a young writer, but the only reason it was published was because the market is open for cheap occult tales, which this so obviously is."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Ms. Atwater-Rhodes' second book is not quite as effective as the first one. This is due I believe to her introduction of a character representing herself who then encounters her own literary creations. This makes for a less compelling story because the reader is constantly confronted with issues of whether the narrator completely believes in the story. Contrast the first book wherein no such device was used and the uncluttered story was much more powerful. However - having said this - I am also quite convinced that this young writer has a great deal of talent and I fully intend to read her next vampire book. My daughter Sarah, who is 12, introduced me to this author. She also feels this book is not quite as good as the first one, in which the story was told from a vampire's point of view and the characters (she feels) were more exciting. However it should also be noted that she has read this book 7 times and the first one, In the Forests of the Night, 12 times so - there is no question that Ms. Atwater-Rhodes is her favorite writer. Parents take note: here is a readable and exciting young author to whom you might want to introduce your kids around my daughter's age. I myself have enjoyed both of Ms. Atwater-Rhodes's books and look forward to more, as does my daughter who can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"After reading forests of the night i searched for more books by Amelia but finding none i gradually gave up my search, but when i found Demon in my View i was thrilled. Amelia is an excellant author and makes the carachters feelings and themselves very realistic. she almost had me convinced in vampires. Jessica is a dark, angry senior in Ramsa High and although none of them know it she has written a book which many of them have read under the pen name Ash Night. Most of the students try and ignore, her but when sunny Caryn Smoke and dark, mysterious Alex Remington arrive they both seem very interested in her both in very differents ways. When Jessica discovers that in fact Alex is Aubrey from her book she deepens into his and many other vampires lives causing mayhem where she goes as she is attacked by Fala an age old vampire and drawn to Aubrey in a way she has never felt before. As the plot thickens Jessica is lead into the lifes of the vampires she has written about and the dangerous game of cat and mouse with Aubrey/Alex. Aubrey not sure whether he wants to kill or love her has to choose and in it he drastically changes hers and his life."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I really loved reading this book.

I could but this book down not even for a minute."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Yet another intriguing psychological thriller from the tireless Rendell, who once more gives us a frighteningly disturbed individual with some major skeletons in his closet. An obsessively neat and efficient recluse with a penchant for strangling a shop window mannequin in his cellar, Arthur Johnson has spent 20 years in a flat in a seedy part of town. Enter Anthony Johnson, a handsome, intelligent student of psychology who moves into the room downstairs, changing both of their lives forever. When Anthony accidentally destroys Arthur's prized mannequin, Arthur responds with a hideous act of revenge. As Arthur's murderous impulses are denied release, his psyche begins to deteriorate. Rendell finishes off the story with her signature twist ending, a jolting twist that is totally logical, ironic, and completely unpredictable, where everyone gets what they deserve, if not in the way they expect.This is a fairly quick read, and despite the dark exploration of Arthur's twisted mind it remains considerably light for Rendell. Neither as suspenseful nor as chillingly perfect as its successor, A JUDGEMENT IN STONE, but nevertheless, a prime example of the type of story that no one does better than Rendell: the investigation of two different people's lives which suddenly collide--and the volatile and often grim results."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"THIS BOOK TAKES YOUR EYES AND THEN YOUR MIND INTO THE THINKING OF A TRULY TWISTED FIEND.

A GOOD AND VERY FRIGHTENING BOOK."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"After hearing the praise about this young woman I was impressed, by her success--not novel. Actually, the novel disgusted me horribly, this is the great writer? She displayed unoriginality and poor writing skills, writing is a skill, not a talent, therefore she needs to study writing more.The main character Jessica seemed too cocky and confident for the average teen. She has a body to die for, big deal and she has no friends, should I feel sorry for her? Someone who acts as immature as Jessica wouldn't have friends.Aubrey on the other hand just annoyed me, he didn't even bother to kill her at all.The plot was shallow and thin, by the end of the book I had no idea who these characters were. One minute Jessica is rude and mean and when Aubrey pops in she is Miss Mary Sunshine. The only character I could relate to was Caryn, I'm not even nowhere near the character in that perpective.Amelia is obviously being exploited for her age and not her skill, another reason why I am disgusted by RH.For those who assume she is the best writer since Anne Rice I suggest you look up more vampire writers because she is not the best since Miss Anne Rice. This is the perfect way to brainwash young teens thinking they know the difference between skill and an amatuer."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book is stupid... the romance... the vampires... everything and why did she use that poem? Amelia never actually stated if these vampires are demon or not. They hold emotions of love and that doesn't make 'em demon..."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Of course this is a popular book for drab, confused teens and those adults who still haven't recovered. The story is more of a wishful tale of the author's fantasies that are shared by many who think like this. Far from her best and most likely in saying her first isn't her worst but all the rest are."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I read Forests of the Night a couple days ago and was intrigued enough to read Demon in My View. I was hoping Amelia's writing would have matured more than it did over the course of two years. The first couple of chapters were very off-putting, as it felt like an in-your-face, look at me, I made it! to anyone who may have disliked the author in real life. Jessica's character is not just dark, she's hostile, and I had to stop and consider whether or not to put up with her attitude long enough to finish the book.I decided I would, and overall I guess I'm glad. This isn't a significant book by any standards except that it was written by a 17-year-old. In some ways it was reminiscent of Christopher Pike's Master of Murder, a book about a high-school boy writing teen horror books under a pen name...but the books turn out to be nonfiction. Amelia's Jessica writes books that are true, even though she doesn't realize it.Caryn, a healing Witch, and Aubrey the vampire suddenly show up in Jessica's school and involve themselves in her life. Once she realizes her books are true, Jessica has other decisions to face--which side does she join, the Witches or the vampires? And what happens when she decides?Amelia's writing hasn't matured as much since the first book as I would have expected; the flow is still too choppy, and she seems unaware of some of the subtler techniques employed in fiction (though I found one delightful piece of unintentional irony: the teacher calls Jessica's name for attendance. \\"Here,\\" Jessica answered absently.\\")This was a decent sequel to a decent first novel, though I would have liked more about vampire Risika and the intriguing Witch Alex from Forests. I don't plan to buy this book or any of Amelia's other books, but they are worth checking out from the library, and good for a couple hours of entertainment. I'm sure I will read the next two when my library buys them."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Author, Amelia Atwater - RlodesPublisher, Laurel, LeafsPg, 192He tilted his head to the side quizzily\\"Are you trying to posin yourself?\\"\\" Oh bite me\\" the words left her mouth before the ironic of them set inBut Aubrey tuck her word and in a graceful movement rounded the bar and slipped his hand around the back of her neck gently pulling her to him\\" A tempting offer\\" her said brushing the hollow of her thought with the thumb of his free hand.\\" You whodunit dare\\" she stated, she felt his lips on her throte\\"It wouldn't accrue to you to be scared ?\\" He though to her\\" If you wanted to kill me you would of done it long ago\\" she projected through her mind knowing he could here herHe paused \\" are you sure?\\"Jessica always felt the dark was woven through her, Butiful but bitter by time she often looked deep into her self, Searching for the pisical imperfection the made her peers despise her so much.

This reputation has set her up for the vicious attacks of critics and the unfair standards she is expected to meet.Demon in My View is an imaginative take on young adult vampire fiction. The author's writing style is fresh and clever.It is intended for a younger audience and caters to them. The book *is* short and the reader *is* left with many questions, as critical reviewers have noted. However, the unanswered questions lend a sense of mystery to the series, with each book divulging a bit more of the back story and of the characters' motivations.Don't let negative reviews turn you away from a budding new writer. She may be young, she may be learning, but she has caught the knack for how to write an interesting book full of charismatic characters."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"When I first saw the cover of this book i was like: wow hottie! I thought this was a wonderful book especially cause of my love for the supernatural. It was great!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Picking up this book i expected for it to be better than the first since the author had matured some. Boy, was I wrong. Where does she think up this trash? First, there is Jessica,who has no basis whatsoever for being heartless and cold. In the end,there was no need to make this chick into a vampire because she was one from the beginning. It is quite hard to believe that a girl who is supossedly that good-looking is a complete outcast. Carlyn, who overly angelic and sunny is weak and serves little purpose, even her healing Jessica was completely in vain since the girl was going to be made into a vampire anyway. None of these characters are well developed and the only one that had potential was Aubrey(but she messed him up as well). Although he was the typical \\"bad boy\\", his seductive wiles and attractive physique draws the reader to him. One expects that with his mesmerizing charm he could easily to seduce and kill but instead he goes soft and in the end is the one to be seduced. The least Amelia could have done was kill off the character Fala who was not a true vampire in my eyes since she could so easily be defeated by Jessica, one who is not even trained in the slaying of vampires. Which brings me to one point that I must make. Why is it that all of Amelia's vampires, being \\"born before the aztecs\\" and some nearly 5000 years old be utterly weak and decrepit? In the previous book Aubrey,an ancient 5000 year old vampire gets his a** kicked by Risika, who is only 300 years old at the most. I found this dissapointing not only because I liked Aubrey but because that does not makes sense. What kind of vampires are they? I mean if she is going to rip off certain charateristics of anne rice's vampires then she could atleast make the old ones stronger than the younger ones, or humans at the most. She also tries much too hard to be dismal and gothic. For god's sake, even Anne rice and C. pike vampire's had a sense of humor. The fact that Amelia's vampires are mostly filled with sadistic thoughts of gloom and doom makes them out to be 2 dimensional. Even if they have been a vampire for a long time they have to have some personality from their mortal lives. This only shows that she does does not know how to develope and mold a character into a real person. In order to do that, one must have history, motives, personality and feeling. She has none of these. From now on I think that I will stick to reading books written by authors who have experience, thank you."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Amelia Atwater-Rhodes is one of the best authers of all time!

She's actually Ash Night, the author of Tiger, Tiger. Tiger, Tiger is a best-seller that's popular among teens- but they aren't the only things that know about this book.Welcome to the world of New Mayhem, where some of the oldest and most powerful vampires come to see there own kind. New Mayhem is so close to Jessica's town that it's no wonder that they hear about this new novel. Aubrey, the main character in Tiger, Tiger isn't just in Jessica's imangination. Neither are Fala, Risika, Caryn Smoke, and so many others that are not known by humans.When Aubrey meets Jessica, he stops himself from killing her because he's confused by her. At the same time, Caryn Smoke, a daughter of Macht; meets Jessica too. Although Jessica shuns Caryn, and finds her annoying, she's at first interested in Aubrey (Alex Remington). But Fala's hate for her and her true mother reveals her past... and a future as uncertain.I liked this book, but not as much as the other novels that Amelia Atwater-Rhodes has written. One thing, Jessica is too strong. She can escape Fala's mind, stop Aubrey from killing her just because she just...Jessica. But one of the best things of the books is because of her dreams. At first you don't understand, but then it becomes clear that Jazlyn is somehow related to Jessica, even though it's sort of obvious that Jazlyn is Jessica's mother right from the start."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This is another great book by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, even if it's not my favorite book by her.

Lots of characters that come in other books appear here, so it's easy to connect with her other novels."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This is a fabulous book by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes...her first was great and her second (this one) was PHENOMANAL and no offense but I didn't like her third, Shattered Mirror...the whole 'scarring' thing I felt was highly inappropriate and unnecessary, except for the fact that it added to the EVILness that most of her vampires lack. Nich(k)olas was ok though, why isn't he in her other books?But about THIS book...This is her best by far...Jessica is annoying, moody, a rather stereotypical teenager, and true, I would never want to be her friend. But I think she is supposed to appear that way--otherwise she wouldn't be a social outcast, obviously!And will people give it up on how Aubrey has turned 'good' suddenly!!! Isn't it obvious! In \\"Forests of the Night\\" Aubrey comes across as evil because he is Risika's enemy. In \\"Demon in My View\\", he's on Jessica's side, so he looks 'good'. Isn't it obvious?!By the way Aubrey is sooooo cool and I can't believe he's not in any of the others, not even the new one \\"Hawksong\\". When will she actually write the real-world equivalent of \\"Dark Flame\\", Aubrey's biography mentioned in \\"Demon\\"???

I'm not a firm believer in the supernatural, but I would rather believe Amelia's Ideas of vampires then Buffy the vampire slayer.She put's a new idea to it and makes vampires belivable instead of the old tales of how Vampires can't come out in the daylight.I've read both Demon in my view and Shattered Mirror, and just beginning to read Midnight Predator.I think it is much easier for people to read and understand books such as Demon in my view when they are younger and still believe in things like that."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This is my 2nd favorite book in the series. 1st being Shattered Mirror, But this one is really good.

I love Aubery because he is dark, Mysterious and powerful. Jessica knows thta Alex looks like Aubery but refuses to accept the fact that it may be true.

Though, normally an author is at least in their twenties. Amelia gives us a slight entrance on how she saw the world... when she was fifteen, and well, I'm not that fond of teenagers.I discussed a bit my opinion on this talented, though, still (at least in this book) immature writer when I reviewed her first book, so, I will skip that part.One of the big improvements on Amelia's story telling from her first book to this (her second): Her characters have depth. Now, her characters are beginning to look real, with complexities, with likes and dislikes, with defects and virtues.The bad part, it is TERRIBLY cheesy, and quite predictable. You have the vampire that is terribly attracted to a human, and not any human, but one who he has to kill.Still, she is talented, and I am hoping to finish the rest of her books."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Demon in my view was an amazing book aubrey was just the right amount of everything.

I hated to put it down. Amelia Atwater Rhode's world of vampires is original and captivating.I really wanted more details and wished to know more about how the character's were feeling. I felt a little distant from the story."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Amelia Atwater-Rhodes'sIn the Forests of the Nightwas written when she was only 13 years old. In it, she chronicled the unlife of Risika and her tangles with Aubrey, a fellow vampire whom she believes killed her human brother. In Demon in My View, several characters from her debut novel are back, with Aubrey front and center. This time, the novel's protagonist is Jessica, a conveniently depressed Goth who secretly publishes fantasy novels under the pen name Ash Night that revolve around vampire culture. The inspiration for her characters comes to her in her dreams, or rather, her nightmares. Adopted Jessica is a loner and quick to anger, so when a new boy enrolls at school who looks, sounds, and acts just like Aubrey, her world is thrown into confusion.Atwater-Rhodes displays skill at building atmosphere and of creating a viable backstory and genealogy for her vampires. However, the plot is thin at best, and the writing of the flashbacks seem stilted and juvenile. The many secondary characters are fleeting at best; we're never really given their motivations, such as the brief appearances and disappearances of vampire hunter Dominique Vida and witch Hasana Rashida. The vampires' lives are much more fleshed-out than the humans, including Caryn and her family, witches and descendants of powerful Healers. As I've read elsewhere, there is no clear motivation for introducing Wicca, as spells are never cast nor is magick brought up.Although Atwater-Rhodes attempts to create a standalone universe through her vampire and witch genealogies, but the writing felt juvenile at at times self-centered (gorgeous teen author has a body to die for and is talented, strong...we get it already!), and many plot twists were predictable (her uneven attempt at foreshadowing gave away one of the major \\"surprises\\" early on). However, it was a quick, entertaining read (I breezed through it in about 45 minutes) that, although not original, was generally well-written, especially from one so young; it's certainly no worse than a lot of young adult vampire series on the market."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Im very well into vampires, and witches, werewolves and things of that nature. I'm always looking for new and interesting stories to red, and movies to watch where they re all over scene and completely throughout the book, or movie. I really loved this book \\"Demon In My View\\". I just wish it could have been a little longer, stretched out a little more. I wish that Jessica and Fala could have had that fight. I wish the book would have ended with perhaps Aubrey, and Jessica hunting together, and maybe being more romantic with each other, since it was clearly obvious that they were attracted to each other, and was connected on that level. I wish the book would have gone into talking about what happens to Caryn after she went home. Are her and Jessica friends now? do they talk since the incident. Seeing as Caryn is the true reason that she is indeed alive. What happens now? Jessica has been changed, Caryn has done something her mother will surely disapprove of. Will she tell her? or will her mom pick it up. Will Jessica ever talk to Caryn again? Will Jessica and Aubrey be long lasting lovers, and grow to have kids of their own one day. I think \\"Demon In My View\\" is a great beginner book, of many sequels to come. A great foundation and the author Amelia Atwater-Rhodes should take it and run. We only know through Jessica writings all the things that happened in the past with Aubrey, siete, her mother, and the other vampires. but now we have the chance to actually follow it book by book, and watch the whole thing unrattles. This could be an extraordinary foundation, and the beginning for many many eye bolting, end of the chair, very high anticipation, and mental hunger for other books to follow using these characters. Overall without given too much of the book away hopefully. This book is amazing. Though im far from a teenager, I will be looking out for books that have Amelia Atwater-Rhodes name as the author. She is a talented writer indeed, and I hope she will be able to keep it up in the years to come. AWESOME BOOK...!!!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Once again, Amelia Atwater-Rhodes delivers in \\"Demon in My View\\". With every new book, her characters grow and evolve into people we could relate to. Though still young, she has potential to create amazing works like \\"Shattered Mirror\\" and the \\"Kiesha'Ra\\" series. Highly recommended, one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I am once again impressed by Amelia's writing. While it does lack a certain depth, it captures your attention from page one and is filled with action throughout. Both this book and her first, In The Forests Of The Night are worth reading."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This is perhaps my favorite of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes' books (and I have read them all), perhaps because Aubrey is one of my favorite of her characters (Zane and Danica are my two other favorites). \\"Demon in My View\\" is not a fabulous book or even a terribly well-written book, however it is entertaining and will keep a reader happily engaged for a couple hours.The story surrounds a high school senior named Jessica, a virtual leper at her high school, who, it just so happens, is a published author in the vampire genre. This is what most people find annoying about this particual book--how much it mirrors the author's own life. Jessica begins to realize that the characters of her books are not made up; they are in fact real, and they are not happy that she has been writing their stories for the whole world to read. Aubrey is the vampire who has volunteered to \\"take care\\" of the Jessica \\"problem.\\" However, he becomes intrigued by the young author, and that is where the story begins to get interesting.This book is really for fans of Ms. Atwater-Rhodes' vampire novels. I wish she would bring Aubrey back. Her writing gets better with each novel that she writes, so if this one is not completely to your liking, it is possible you may enjoy one her more recent publications."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book was so wonderful I couldn't put it down. Atwater-Rhodes did it again, she topped herself and I can not wait for the next book. In \\"Demon in my View\\" an average social misfit, high school student, Jessica, writes novels under a pen name. When two new students start at her school she notices a lot of similarities to one of the characters in her book. She is intrigued at the qualities he possesses because they match what she is writing in her newest book. Is the new kid for real? What happens when you fall in love with your writing? To find out pick up this book, it will be worth your time. I recommend this book to anyone who loves horror and vampires, but is also a sucker for a good love story. This book combines the best of the two worlds leaving out all the sappy stuff of a romance novel that makes you physically ill, and includes all the cool things you can find in a horror novel, like vampires. A must read, as i'm sure all her future books will be. I'm totally hooked; Atwater-Rhodes is number one."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"i admit her writing has improved, but i wasn't interested in Jessica's problems at all. she seemed very cynical and always whined. plus, aar had stereotyped the typical loner, as cold hearted and feeling hatred against the world. aubrey sounded like a jock, while fala seemed to be the only character i was interested in. i give her one star for writing it and another for being published so young -- in the end that's the only reason she's being praised. her writing level is below average, i have seen better. this is pitiful and it's sad to see so many young writers look up to her."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I like this book it is very interesting and kept me interested. I think that Amelia will make it as an author and is very good at what she does. I love thid book I have read it 3 times"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Did any of you ever go to a role-playing chat room where everyone states their characters but no one mingles? I have, and it is usually very tiring. Amelia's characters are there in the book, but they do not seem to connect. Going along the lines of an RPG, she describes their clothing much, like when Jessica meets Aubrey, which I think is kinda shallow. Although her vocabulary and descriptions are amazing, the plot does not seem to weave itself into a good old ghost/vampire story full of suspenseful twists and turns..."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"As a teacher of middle-level gifted students, I was thrilled to see a book written by an adolescent receive such widespread praise. Based on both student and publisher reviews, I was quick to order &quot;A Demon in my View.&quot; When the book arrived, I eagerly read it in one sitting (a little over an hour). While a good read, the book was a disappointment.The text is entirely too short for such a story. Atwater-Rhodes could have had a much better (and more involved story) had she chosen to develop her characters further. As is, the book is an extremely fast read and lacks any depth. I'd rather she combined her first two (or three) short novels into a longer, more involved (and explanatory) one.I wanted to know more about the main characters. Their histories, when discussed, are short and shallow. Their conversations are basic and unimaginative. The one redeeming quality of the book was in how Atwater-Rhodes handled the main character's dream sequences. Albeit short, they are almost poetic.I look forward, actually, to reading more of Atwater-Rhodes' books and I do think, to this point, that her works are acceptable. However, would an author with an age of &quot;30&quot; have received such positive reviews? Doubtful. For an adolescent (teenager? young adult?), Atwater-Rhodes does a commendable job. As she grows up and matures, though, I sincerely hope her books gain depth and length."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Jessica is a teenage girl who writes novels under the pen name Ash Night. Her inspiration for writing comes to her in spouts- usually in dreams. Yet when a new guy, Alex, visits her high school, he uncannily resembles the main character of her novels-a vampire Abrey Jessica finds out that what she writes is true, and she has offended many because of her books. Soon, Jessica is enveloped in a paradoxical world of realism and fantasy, and she finds out that she no longer has control over whether she lives or dies.Overall, I found the book easy to read and the content easy to understand. The plot was interesting, and I enjoyed how it seemed the book would be about a loner teenage writer, and then another story formed within that. So it is something of a story in a story. However, there are not any clues of her past preceding the climax of the story. Jessica finds out why she is like she is by simply asking someone and connecting it with a dream- not very exciting. The book was too unsurprising, even if it was a good read. At times, the author just fed the reader the facts, and at other times she led up to them. Overall, a good book for a quick read."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I read In the forests of the night before I read this. Both are the best books I have ever read. Just like her first, Atwater-Rhodes throws all of the old vampire myths out the window. Jessica is a teen writer, she happens to write about vampires, and everything she writes is true! Of course she has no idea until a new student arrives. No matter how hard she tries, she can not shake the felling that the new kid is a character from her books. When things get dangerous she learns more about vampires than she wants to."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This is a very very great book for young teens that are interested in books with many characters and lots and lots of suspens!&quot;Demon In My View&quot; is on of the best books i have ever read aand i would reffer it to anyone who likes to read &quot;a long but short book&quot;in my words wich means for readers like me who like to read but not forever this is a great book.The book has lots of meaning to it,plus a lot of comedy and seriousness.Around every corner there is something new and suprising.After reading this book i have gained a joy for reading.It's not just boring anymore because when i got done with the book i wanted to readit again.So i am!Most books i read i get bored with but this one kept me glued to my seat.So please read this book u wont regret it!If you like to read about magic and surpries you'll have to give this book a try."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Amelia Atwater-Rhodes is a talented writer but she is still pretty young and her stories reflect that. &quot;In the Forests of the Night&quot; was an enjoyable, if rather un-original vampire story.However Demon in My View is more obnoxious because the whole Mary-Sue like similarites between Amelia and the protagonist Jessica-basically she seems to have written this book so that she could fall in love with Aubrey and become a vampire herself. Amelia's talent for writing keeps the book afloat but it still not that great. Hopefully she will improve her plots as she gets older."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I bought this book after reading In the Forests of the Night, which I thought was a really great book (a little sad but still good). I finshed this book in one day, because it's impossible to put down. At first I hated Aubrey, because of what he did to Risika in the first book. But in the second book he seemed actually vulnerable. I loved this book and hope that Amelia Atwater-Rhodes produces more books."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book caught my attention and I purchased it; interested in reading what a teen author would write about. I'm in my 20's so I knew that it would be for the younger set, but I'll read any book about vampires.The plot was good, but I did have trouble with the flow of her words. I kept having to re-read sentences that were meant to be poetic I suppose. I also felt that the characters were not developed strongly enough to suit my tastes. I had trouble caring about the main character Jessica.Anyway, I felt like the book was too short, and her editor should have left the parts in that obviously had been taken out. Otherwise it's a good book for the pre-teenagers."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Excellent! pretty much sums up this book.Young Amelia Atwater Rhodes does it again.If your not familar with her then you need to read In the forest of the night!A great literary work dealing with supernatural twist.This book contains witches,vampires,and vampire hunters.Youd be nuts to miss out on this novel. [....]"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I know that there are already a lot of reviews for this book, so I will make mine short and sweet. I liked this book even better than the author's first, which was great as well. This book incorporates the world of man and vampire, suspense, action and love. I highly recommend this book to anyone who read and liked In the Forests of the Night."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Aubrey. What a great charcter. He was described perfectly, with a hint of hatred for his own kind. In The Forests of the Night was excellent, but I despised Aubrey like he was all demon. In Demon in My View, he has human emotions that weaken him. He loves Jessica, and changes her because he wants to be with her. In the begining, he was afraid to amit it to himself. This is my favorite book, and I think you should read it! When my friend Alyssa introduced me to Amelia Atwater-Rhode's books I took not one moments hasitation to read it all in one ay. Which I did. Atwater-Rhodes is my favorite auther. Keep writing Amelia!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I don't like to read, I will tell you that. I am more into video games and such, but when I say this book in the hands of my friend, something made me ask to borrow it. I read a bit, and imedeiatly I started to love it. I laid in my bed with my cat for a few hours tonight and read the whole book. I just couldn't stop reading!!!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Demon in My View is a DEFINITE (Double underlined, bold lettered, italisized, double exclamation point!!) MUST read! Anyone that appreciates fiction, sci-fi, fantasy, etc. will certainly love this book written by a fabulous author!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Well, I must say that I am impressed. I mean, I was impressed with In The Forest of The Night, but it read like an amatuer long short story. This though, was quite a bit different.Jessica strikes close to home for me. A reject who loves to wear black, not because she worships satan, but because she likes the color. A pile of unpublished manuscripts about one universe of characters, and a room with only a single bulb to illuminate it. This strikes a cord with us lonely teenage types quite well.Right after I read In the Forest of the Night, I was convinced that I could wait for Demon in My View to come out in Paperback. I mean, Forest was good, but not 10 bucks good. Then, I found fifteen bucks on a table in the mall. Decided, what the hell. What I found, was amazing increases in skill by Amelia, definite growth. This book is definitely worth 10 dollars."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"first of all, the whole idea of someone coming true out of her own book is totally unique, and cool, and the whole walking in daylight? why not? ive read tons of books on vampires, and in not one of them can they not walk in the sunlight. these books are modern, not black and white clasics, the rules have changed."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I loved it! It kept my attention the whooooooole time. Please Amelia Atwater-Rhodes write another book! Everyone will totally fall for it. Anelia again inspires me to write more at a young age! PLEASE READ IT!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I just came here to check up on this young writer and see if she had anew book out.And obviously she does.... That is a great accomplishmentfor a girl at that age....I personally liked it. If you liked &quot;Inthe Forests of the Night&quot; you'll like this one.She may not be The Anne Rice YET but she shows promise and I say go buy it! Support the writers of the future."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"After the first chapter even just about Jessica and her school, I was drawn in. The humor, anger, and danger between the vampires and Jessica and Caryn and all good and evil is tensing and the growing feelings between Jessica and Aubrey produce the best book I've read. Go Amelia! Us teens rule!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I finished this book with in one day. I loved it so much i could not put it down. It was interesting to see this side of Aubrey. But i recomend reading her first book in order to understand better what she is writing. I commend her on her great work. She has inspired me to be more expressive in my writing."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"In my opinion, Demon in my View was a great book. Aside from the occasional lack of description, there is excellent storytelling and content. The characters are well developed and the plot is very thought out."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"It was well written for a teenager, but so much more could have been done to make the story more complete and interesting to the reader. The one flawless thing in this book( others would agree) is Aubrey. He really brings something to the book and that if not there would of made the book so much worse, he ties Jessica's stories into the true life of a vampire. The only thing that I really had a problem with was Jessica's past and how that ties into her writing. It needed to be explained and be made a more major part of the book. All and all though great if you have time for just a fast read."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I kept hearing about Amelia in all of my magazines and decided to find out what all the fuss was about. I just bought and read In The Forests Of The Night and Demon In My View and I loved both of them! The book was very well written. I could picture the setting vividly and she made everything seem so believable! I think most will enjoy this book (except for maybe a few modern day Witches who are probably turning their noses up on the potrayal of them). Beautiful job Ms. Atwater-Rhodes, and thanks for inspiring young writers (like myself)!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I picked up this book looking for something interesting to read.And I must say I was a bit jealous to find that this author is a year younger than I am and has an array of books published.But you know what? I'm no longer jealous. Because a retarded monkey could come up with better character developments and plots than Ms. Atwater-Rhodes has put in this novel.I barely got halfway through this book when I threw it across the room, finished with the drivel that she called a story. It immediately earned a place next to Foxfire and To Ride a Silver Broomstick in my collection of \\"Books I would never sell to anyone for I would not want them to suffer by reading this crap.\\"Save yourself some time and buy anything by LJ Smith, Kelley Armstrong, or (dare I say it) Anne Rice. Even Ms. Rice is better than this girl, and I hate that woman."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book is many times more shallow then I would have expected from such a praised writer. For all the magazines (Teen, Y.M etc...) I expected to read a story with some depth.Not one with simple, personalitiless characters that easily fall into cliches. But this is not the only problem the entire concept is done in an amaturish manner.It's obvious within minutes of starting the story it was written by someone without any real-world-experience.The only thing that this book accomplished was to prove that Hype can't make a story."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Detail but not depth. That is exactly the phrase that came into my mind as I finished reading 'Demon in my View'. I know some people are being forgiving because of the age of the author, 15 at the time, but age really is no excuse. Being a 16 year old myself and also a writer I have no problem pointing out the washed-out plotline Rhodes portrays.What is commendable is her detail, she describes the setting beautifully, almost hauntingly, but loses it when it comes to true fleshing out of characters. The emotional level, which is intended to be high, is wooden and you end up feeling as though your watching a bad soap opera.The plot is simple, but not in a good way. You can predict it from the very beginning and the main character is all too predictable as well. Beautiful, misunderstood, smart, courageous when it counts. All that rot.Rhodes should have given her characters flaws and worked from there, she should have made them believeble by not being perfect. She should have come up with a vampire theme that was her own, instead of just copying so many others.For the detail I do have to give the book 3 stars, but for lack of feeling, I subtracted two."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Though the story wasn't deep and complex, I love some of the young author's ideas. I love reading about vampires, and reading about Jessica and Aubrey's relationship was enjoyable. I love the simple yet poetic language that she used.She makes the characters, like Aubrey and &quot;Ash Night&quot; very real. As a student in high school, I can relate to the character of Ash Night aka Jessica. The ending was a bit predictable, but I still liked it a lot. It closed the story really nicely. The story was a joy to read, and I can't wait to read more of her work in the future. She shows that writing about vampire doesn't have to involve being an expert on the Undead, or putting complex feelings into them, like Louis in Interview with the Vampire. Vampires can have human feelings, too. Aubrey has just that. Long live young people! She is leading a campaign that states that teenagers are not lazy or dumb, but creative and possess a lot of opportunity."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I bought this book with high expectations because In the Forests of the Night was a page turner. Though this book was even better for it had a thicker plot. The book takes place in Ramsa home to the vampire novelist Jessica a.k.a Ash Night.She thinks her stories are just figments of her imagination until she meets a mystrious boy by the name of Alex who really turns out to be the villian from her novel Tiger Tiger. If you read In the Forests of the Night you remember him as a manipulative badass who loves to torment people but now you see a whole other side of him as he tries to protect Jessica from those of his kind who are not very happy about her works."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Amelia Atwater-Rhodes is such a great wrighter!

They interest me. I normally don't get interested in a book. I usually feed a couple chapters then get a new book but this one was so interesting that I couldn't put it down. I read it from cover to cover. If it were a serious I would definetly read all the books. I wish there was a part two to it. I am a big fan of the book and would recommend to anyone that you read it if you like vampires and mystery."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Ok, I was more than surprised how much I liked this book, is so easy to read, Aubrey is sexy oh so sexy, but he is also very funny. I found Jessica's humor very amuzing, I think is a great book.And the Jazlyn story starts to mix in untill it actually makes sense!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I first read this book after I picked it up in the Library. It was very suspensefull and compelling. I like how Amelia creates this sureal atmosphere in her books. You can actually imagine what's happening word for word. But the world Amelia creates strays from the cliches of witches and vampires. Vampires don't turn into bats and fly away and witches do not have pimples all over their green noses or fly on broomstick. It gives us a new image of vampires and doesn't make them seem so monsterous as fairy tales do."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Demond in my View is the bast book I have ever read. Amelia Atwater-Rhodes is my favoret auther and her books are amazing. I have read this book 6 times trough and love it every time. I have fallen in love with Aubry and his story, I hope soon there will be another. This book has inspired works of my own and some of my best at that. I am a TV person and when I finished reading this book for the first time I wanted to do anything but watch TV if that gives you a slight idea of the power this book gives. I dream of being as strond as Jessica and wishto have the power Aubry has. I have learned so much from this book because this book shows so much about the world. Amelia is a genius."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I've read Hawksong and Shattered Mirror in addition to this, and I have to say, I thought this was the best of the three. Jessica is more interesting than the main characters in the others, but she is still a bit too aloof, as are her other characters.Aubrey (the 'is-he-bad-or-good' character) is mildly interesting. The rest are pretty two-dimensional, and they don't develop satisfactorily.The plot is mainly hinged on the action, which is done pretty well. I wouldn't say it was a waste of money because I did enjoy it, but it's the kind of thing you read in one night and never really think about again."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Demon in my View was written by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes when she was only 15. The books main character's name is Jessica Allodola. She hates her mother Anne, hates her school and the town that she lives in. the only thing that she loves is writting. Going by the name of Ash Night she had one book published. It was about Aubrey, a very old, good looking, vampire. Jessica doesn't know that she has some kind of connection to the vampire world and that everything she writes is true. Some are trying to get her to stop writting and if that means killing her they will. Jessica only has one hope of getting through this and it comes from an unexpected place.If you haven't read this one pick it up. It is a great read."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Demon in My View is my favorite book that I have ever read. The author describes everything to the last detail so you really get a picture in your mind of all the characters. I atill can hardly belive that she wrote thiswhen she was only fifteen! Especially because it is better than some books that adults have written. I also like this book because it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's the kind of book I can't stop reading.My favorite part of Demon in My View is when Jessica slices open Fala's arm durring their fight so Fala leaves. I like this part becauseif she wouldn't have done that Aubrey would have never found her and Fala would have killed her.This whole book is very vivid. She used very discriptive languageso everything was very clear.For example she discribes Jessica down to the last detail. She even discribesexactly how deep of a green Jessicas eyes are and \\"hair the color of raven feathers\\" to describe Aubrey. She couldn't possibly have been any more discriptive and that is one of the reasons why I like this book."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book was really good. I had read Shattered Mirror and that really got me intruiged in her writing. But then i read this and thought it was just-amazing! I'm doing a book report on it right now and ill add how awesome it was. I like all the details it gave, kinda reminds me of my writing. Anybody interested in reading stuff out of the box--this is the book for you! Vampires Rock!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"A Demon in My View is a great book. It is suspensful so it makes you want to continue to read. It deals with vampires, witches, and has a strange twist. Once you finsih the book, you just want to go to the next book."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This is the best book, in my opinion, by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes. In this tale of horror and romance, Amelia gives to you Jessica, an average teen with a problem. No one wants to be her friend, everyone is taken aback from her. The day Caryn Smoke moves to her class, is the day her life changes forever. Caryn attempts being her friend, but fails, too scared from Jessica's rudeness to her.Soon 'Alex' moves into her class, and is quite similar to a character in a book she wrote; 'Tiger, Tiger'. As time goes on she finds out that all the fiction she wrote in her books, are actually true, and it's a threat to her life. She must face a decision that will change her life forever.This is my favorite book by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, and my favorite character is Aubrey, the vampire. If it's a picture of him on the cover, he's cute too. Well, I think ever teen horror fan should read this. It's really a worthy read!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I was greatly impressed with this book. It has a nice flow that sucks you in and won't let you out. Probably the only thing \\"bad\\" about this book is the length. I would have liked it to be a little bit longer. Amelia has shown tremendous writing skill with her vivid yet simple and easy to understand descriptions. I believe she will become the next Anne Rice. I look forward to reading her other works."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book, for me, was the best by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes. She is indeed a great author and in this story \\"Demon in my View,\\" she gives you Jessica, a high-schooler who has no friends. She is haunting, and scares away all those who try to become her friend. She writes books, and wishes for the characters in her book to come out. But this can never happen...or can it? This book is a book that'll have you at the edge of your seat. Let's give this author some MAJOR credit. She wrote her first book at my age! Age 13!! Other books you should read by this amazing author : In the Forest of the Night, Shattered Mirror, and Night Predator. READ ALL HER BOOKS!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Well, I was a little bit disapointed, but this was a good book, no matter what my expectations were. I couldn't really relate to Jessica that much, just because she had such a nasty disposition, and she wasn't an incredibly complex character either. I found Caryn kind of annoying. But I liked the vampires. Aubrey--whoa! He was really sexy. He just radiated with strength. I hated Fala--but that was only because Ms. Atwater-Rhodes did such an excellent job of making her vicious and hateable.Jessica is a senior who writes books under the pen name Ash Night. Kind of cool, huh? Her classmates don't think so. Something about her repels them. Then Caryn and Alex enroll at her school. Jessica immediately dislikes Caryn, but is drawn to Alex because of a strong sense of familiarity. She soon discovers that the books that she writes are true, and Alex--Aubrey, actually-- was sent to kill her because of the things she wrote, while Caryn is a witch here to protect her. Something about Jessica appeals to Aubrey, and he doesn't want to kill her. He resolves to protect her from other vampires. It all leads up to a vicious fight between Fala and Jessica.While I really did enjoy this book, I have a few bones to pick with it. The dialogue between Jessica and Caryn, especially in the beginning, is not realistic at all. And how is it that Aubrey, so strong in Ms. Atwater-Rhodes' first book and even in the beginning of this one, goes all weak-kneed and sissy over Jessica? His aura of vicious power just suddenly shut down or something. And last--I promise this is last--this book was entirely too short. All in all, it really was a good book. Ms. A-R has a lot of potential as a writer. Four stars for a job pretty well done."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I was stunned at how well this book was written, with much more action and description than the last book, and the introduction to a few more of the other vampires, and an introduction to witches. Jessica, an adopted brat, writes stories about vampires that she sees in her dreams. She remembers all of her dreams vividly, and write about these interesting creatures. There is one thing that Jessica does not know though: these stories are true. These stories about dangerous vampires all are true, and she had chosen to lay bare the secrets that many of them have tried to conceal. First it was Tiger, Tiger, a fictional version of Atwater-Rhodes' first book, In The Forests of the Night. Now, it is Dark Flame, a book that tells of the life of one of the most dangerous of the vampires: Aubrey. She tells of the few humiliations that he had had in his powerful life, and this angers him, and the other vampires, who also have a problem with her books, let Aubrey deal with it. But Aubrey gets caught in a trap that he did not anticipate: he began to like Jessica. The rest of the book catapults through action so fast that I found myself flipping through the pages, only wanting to find out what happened. Any fan of vampires should rush out and grab this book, and anything else by Atwater-Rhodes."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book was wonderful and could not be put down. I almost found myself falling for the spell of Aubrey and I loved Jessica's character. Aubrey was quite the character, an evil Romeo if you will, again non-existant in Today's online guys. The story hit excellent conspiracy, i.e. this Jazyn being Jessica's mother making her somewhat a vampire. Vampires in itself intrigue me and Ms. Atwood has encouraged me to go about reading more of this \\"fictional\\" character. At a younger age, I wanted to write a book, become an author, I gave up years ago. But maybe, Ms. Atwood has encourged me that I could try again."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I thought Demon in my View was far better than her first book, In the Forests of the Night. Her main character, Jessica, is a human writer who doesn't know that her stories about vampires are true. She exposes the past of a very dangerous vampire named Aubrey and it could get her killed.Aubrey is actually one of my favorite characters, even from In the Forests of the Night(where he was the villian), and I've grown quite attached to him and I hope to see him again in some of Amelia's other books. I liked the ending, as I have a bit of a dark side, and the character Jessica fits the ending as well.I think Amelia is a very talented author whose next book keeps getting better than the previous ones.

Don't go ripping on her just because she's young. Anybody who thinks she's a horrible writer must be jealous 'cause they can't do as good. Being a teenage writer myself, it's hard to break into the writing field. Plus, being as critical as I am about my own books, I'm never satisfied, so of course it's going to be hard for us teen writers to break into the mold, considering we aren't in college yet. And the adults who criticize, cut her some slack. She tried. And, all in all, it was an enjoyable read. I know I had fun reading it. Aubrey should beat the poop out of Fala. I hated her.

The author had a much more twisted plot with many threads that she wound together in the end, and some, she hopefully will bring back in other books.I cannot wait for her next book and her next book tour!

He's dark, somewhat evil (laughs malevolently), and from Atwater-Rhodes' description of him, the hottest of the Undead (suffice it to say I wouldn't mind having him sink his teeth into me). But enough about Aubrey, there *are* more characters (and a plot) that are worth a read. I was shocked at how much 17-year-old Jessica (dark, cynical, friendless, and a published author) reminded me of myself.

Jessica is a young writer who writes about vampires, witches, and things that hunt in the night. Writing under the name of Ash Night, she has published one novel so far, with a second on the way. Where she gets her ideas from, she doesn't know - they seem to spring effortlessly from her imagination straight to her laptop, where entire worlds of vampires, witches, and other creatures of the night take form. What Jessica doesn't realize is that what she is writing is not fiction; somehow, someway, she is chronicling of creatures that really exist; creatures that do NOT want their stories told, their presence amongst humans revealed. And not a few of them are VERY angry that Jessica - a mere human! - has chosen to share their secrets with the world; secrets she has no buiness knowing in the first place . . .Among the most upset is Aubrey, one of the oldest and most vicious of the vampires, whose entire background and life story Jessica has pretty much revealed in her fiction. Aubrey, the hated enemy of the heroine Risika from &quot;In the Forests of the Night&quot;, appoints himself Jessica's executioner, and sets out to stop her before she can write anymore about his life and world.I liked this book even better than the first. You can tell Atwater-Rhodes had grown aLOT in the two years in between the writing of these two short novels, as in this one the pacing and characterization and even style are more assured. Also, the ending is much more complete and satisfying here than in the first, and I felt alot more comraderie with and compassion for Jessica than I ever did with Risika. My only complaint would be the odd names (especially last names) the author comes up with for some of her characters, at least her human ones; sometimes they throw you for a moment out of the spell of the book.That said, it is still AMAZING that this young adult novel was written by a 15-year-old! Atwater-Rhodes truly has a gift, and in 5-10 years could give Anne Rice a run for her money. I hope she continues to write, and grow as a writer, and I eagerly look forward to reading &quot;Shattered Mirror&quot;, the next in the series.

Jessica, the main character, seems a pretty average, unpopular teen at first glance. But she's actually published a vampire novel under a pen name. When a new boy enrolls at her school, he reminds her a great deal of Aubrey, the vampire villian from her novel. It turns out that he really is Aubrey, come to kill her. However, things become complicated when the two fall in love. Both of these characters appeared in In the Forests of the Night, and I was glad Miss Atwater-Rhodes chose to write more about them. Jessica was only briefly mentioned in the first book, but I thought right away that she would be a neat character. And I never liked Aubrey much in the first book (although he was definitley a cool villian!), but meeting Jessica certainly improved his personality. I highly reccomend this wonderful novel to fans of horror and vampire novels. The author is extremely talented, and I think it is wonderful that she has become a published author while she is still a teenager. I hope she continues to write more wonderful books like this one."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Written By: Amelia Atwater-RhodesCover Art By: N/APublished: 2000Published By: Dell Laurel-LeafPages: 176Extras: Expert from \\"Shattered Mirror.\\"Summary:N/ACover Art Review:I can tell it's Aubrey on the cover because of the tattoos. He's holding a black rose. It's alright cool but not as cool as the cover for In the Forests of the Night.Overall: 3 (1-10) It has a _very_ loose tie to the story, but it is some what insterting to look at.Book Review:I think it's all agreed that Atwater-Rhodes has good spring-board ideas. However, her chacters, plot line, and how she ties up the plot all fail. Aubrey, a good chacter when he was in the author's first book, has apparently gone through the \\"plot device\\" machine. Instead of using his extremely supernatural powers to kill Jessica and cover it up, he spies on her as a high school student. Why? This is not explained.Jessica is best described as a Mary Sue. For anyone who doesn't know, a Mary Sue is the author inserting herself into her story and making herself perfect. Even a Mary Sue's \\"flaws\\" are calculated. Jessica has a body \\"to die for.\\" (The author wastes a paragraph where Jessica stands in front of a mirror basically worshipping herself.) She's a good writer (so good that only after a week of being out, people are reading her book and she believes that \\"Alex\\" is an crazy fan) and a good artist to boot. Yet everyone at her school \\"flees\\" from Jessica and some are even violent towards her. (Yet all we (the reader) see are a few looks and a group of girls leaving after Jessica snaps at them.) When the new girl Caryn approaches her, Jessica doesn't even try to make a friend. She claims to not want friends, but Jessica harps to much on the fact that everyone \\"runs\\" from her for that to be true.It should be noted that a high school friend of the author was the one who suggested the plot of the book.The plot, while predictable, was defiantly inserting. Unless you're five, it will come to no surprise that Jessica becomes a vampire and Ann dies. It is after the latter event that the book goes from a mindless read to a bad book. Jessica hates Dominique on sight because she's killed vampires she has \\"known.\\" Dominique only kills vampires who kill people. She rightly states that vampires don't need to kill to survive. Jessica her that at least vampires don't \\"preach the morality of their killing.\\" Uh, hello? A vampire just killed your mother, the woman who adopted you. The only person who \\"truly cared about you.\\" The vampire didn't need to eat, he just killed her in cold blood. The author makes no attempt to show both sides. In her mind, vampires are good, witches are bad.As I said in the review for In the Forest of the Night, Atwater-Rhodes' vampires are too powerful. The reader needs to be given some hope that, if they came across one of her vampires, they can escape. There is now tension in who is going to win, human or vampire. In fact, the weakest vampire is Fala, who happens to be the villain as well. As it was pointed out before, this is not a good idea. There is no tension because the villain is too afraid to go against the hero.I will end this long review on one note. I would like Amelia Atwater-Rhodes to write a witch version of In the Forest of the Night. Yes, I know about Shattered Mirror, but that, in the end, turned out to be a vampire good, witches evil story.Overall: 2 (1-10) 1 for the plot about Jazzlyn, the second for Caryn. I would like the author to write a witches good, vampires bad story. Read the beginning if you like mindless dribble, but by no means think is a good book."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"After hearing all the great reviews upon this novel I decided to give it a try. I admit I was disappointed from the moment I picked the novel up, it seemed to be kind of thin, meaning: TOO SHORT. But looking over that I decided the book must be really that good looking past the length.Well, it took me less then two hours to read and by the end I was wondering if I picked the wrong book up. This couldn't be the book written by the praised teen. Overall, it was below average, mainly: D.It had no depth at all. Who is Jessica and Aubrey, you know very little about them, even after reading In the Forest of the Night this morning I still had no idea who Aubrey was. Though I admired the creative and poetic style the book seemed like she rushed and didn't edit that often. There were tons of plot holes and there wasn't a conclusion except for Jessica's transformation into a night creature.Why don't they just kill Fala? If I were Aubrey I would had snapped her neck at instant.Amelia has a lot of work to do, being three stars is average I ive her two. One for effort and two for style, other then that it lacked everythin a novel is made of.Would I recommend it? If you're an inspirational writer, yes, so you can analyze the mistakes a teen writer would make with much inexperience. It helps not to make the same mistake twice.It's like addictive pop music, anyone who likes quick action with sarcasm that matches an annoying teen drama will devour this novel. I hate pop music and I hate sarcasm to the point it irritates you, so I wouldn't read this novel again. But the writer truly has potential.The skill of writing can be learned, therefore she needs to practice more before she tries any other stuff. I am sad that she allows herself to be publicized like that, as the next Anne Rice. If I were her I wouldn't had given out my age, instead wait and see if I could succeed under alias.Anyway 2 stars, maybe more if her writing does improve."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"The reason i picked up this book is because I saw my friend reading it and she said that it was one of the best vampire books she has ever read. Being as how i am, liking to read horror/romance stories and all, i gave the book a try. However, to my great disappointment, the book wasn't what i thought it was.The cover and title seems intriguing enough, but the content was dull, and very dry. But I didn't expect much from a 15 year old at this time.Amelia, in my view, is probably one of the most overrated vampire author i have heard about. Everyone loves her in my school, but i find her repeating patterns and trends to be annoying.First of all, she always put a /beautiful/ and /strong/ main character in every book, for this one it's Jessica A. a goth who met this supposedly powerful vampire Aubrey and fell in love with him. This theme is so obvious, that it's not even fun to read anymore, a goth (person who adores black and wears obsessive amount of dark makeup) falling for a vampire(a dark creature of the night) this pairing was suspected from the beginning, so that gives the reader the whole plot.In addition, Amelia's wording vexes me, she uses the word /sadist/ a lot of times, in this book and other books by her, like its her favorite word. And the way she potrays the fighting scenes, its increduously unrealistic. She does put a valiant effort into trying to make the story seems /dark/ and romantic to her reader. This fails miserably in my opinion, the theme makes it seems like one of those old vampire wannabe books.The depth of the characters in this story wasn't provided clearly enough either (the only character that has much depth was probably the witch Caryn) if you're looking for a deep vampire book with its characters realistic, and not just beautiful and flawless, then pick up an Anne Rice novel. Amelia is only for if you're looking to read short stories.The ending was the most dissapointing, it was, as i stated before, expected, so the thrill of finishing a book and finding out the /big/ twist dies the moment you read the last chapter in this book. However, i must say, this book strangely draws you into it and makes you keep wanting to read it. Although it isn't good, it wasn't one of the worst i've read."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I read and enjoyed Amelia Atwater-Rhodes first book, but i did think her writing needed a bit more development. This book definitly shows an advancement in her writing. I had been awaiting the release of her second book for a while, so you can imagine what an *ss I felt like when I realized that the book came out a month before I found it. Though I had to restrain myself from reading the entire book within the very evening that I got it, it was a lot of fun to read and -alright, I'll admit it- exciting at times. It has action- let's just say it wouldn't have as many stars if didn't have a couple fights- and the romance was vague- just the way i like it if there has to be any at all.But she still hasn't reached the pinnacle of her writing ability, though she has the potential, which is why i didn't give her only 4 stars. I think she has still has the tendency to be a bit superficial- not going too in depth- and her originality is well done but not spectacular. I even found in a few cases that actual text in the book was nearly identical to another book i've read (my favorite)- I know this for a fact since i've read that favorable book 9 times. (No, its not one of The Last Vampire books.) But, either way, its a very good book, and better and worse than the last book in different ways. Rock on, Amelia."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Amelia Atwater-Rhodes' second book is a great one. Somewhat different from the first, the book includes alot of ideas linking her first book to her second. In the book Demon in my View, it tells about a girl, Jessica, griefly mentioned in her first book, is a teenage outcast. Nobody likes her in her her school untill two new students enroll into Ramsa High. One is an annoying girl who thinks Jessica's inner child needs a friend. The second student is a dark, handsome, mysterious boy, who looks an awful like Aubrey. He is a vampire in Jessica's book Dark Flame. From his pendents from his tatoos, he is exactly like Aubrey. He is sent on a killing mission of the author, untill he falls deeply in love. What will happen? Read Demon In My View by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes and find out for your self."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Beautiful but misunderstood heroine, sexy vampire love interest, good-natured. optimistic Wiccan, I really liked this story... when it was called \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\".Even judging this by young adult standards it's a poor excuse for a novel. Heck, by fan-fiction standards this is a poor excuse for a novel. Contradictions abound and the author seems makes up vampire lore as she goes, usually to get herself some corner she's written herself into. I won't rehash the plot, as many other reviews have done so much better then I could have, and without the smart remarks I no doubt would have been driven to make.While I will grant that Atwater Rhodes writes well for her age, any promise she might have shown in 'Forest of the Night' just got flushed down the same drain as the money you spent on this fluff. She takes characters from her first novel and turns them into caricatures (shadowy menace becomes puppy love with fangs) and the ones she introduces are about as well developed as a prepubescent child, including the one based on herself!At one point Amelia...I'm sorry I mean *Jessica*...can't understand why someone as gorgeous and talented as her has such a hard time being accepted. Here's a clue: you're vain, vapid and shallow, and when someone tries to be nice and make friends with you, you act more like a witch than an actual Wiccan.Don't believe me? With all these glowing reviews I can't blame you, so if you absolutely must satisfy your curiosity might I suggest the following?1. Check this out of the library2. Find the 45 minutes it will take you to speed through this pothole-laced highway of a book3. Take a long hot shower to wash away the dirty feeling it gives you4. Resist urge to set book on fire5. Spend your money on Laurell K. Hamilton or a 'Buffy' Novel instead"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I had been wanting to read this book for a long time. Word reached my ears that it was amazing.Well, I was sourly disapointed.In the book a \\"flawless\\" girl named Jessica has a talent for writing vampire storys and thinks thats all that they are- storys.Then the relization kicks in on how her storys are actually real and vampires want to kill her, one falls in love with her, typico!I found myself hating this Jessica. Too perfect was she, the author should have created some flaws to make her less dry and boring.The book was so pridictable that at one point I put it down and didn't come back to it for a week, already knowing what was going to happen.To me, it was dry and tastless. yet, for a fifteen year old I think if she stives towards making her charatures more interesting, she could come out with a good one.It honestly didn't do it for me, and if your still debating on wether or not to read it I say go for it. Just, be prepared for disapointment."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book was awesome. I was completely into this book because I really like vampire and I have read my fair share of vampire books, especially Amelia's books. I recommend this book very much, especially to people, maybe around teenage girls, that like vampires a lot.Demon in my View is a thrilling book on fear, love, and fighting. In this book I love that Jessica, a young novelist, is sent in an utter confusion when on of her character from her book comes to real life and he shows up at her school as a new student.Aubrey, my favorite character, an enchanting vampire, and the main character of her chapter book, falls in love with Jessica after he realizes her love for the black at night. But no sooner that he falls in love with her, Jessica has made a few enemies along with her writing. Fala, a vampire, strong, yet not a strong Aubrey, is seen to seem weak in the book Jessica has written."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Amelia Atwater-Rhodes does not write great fiction--at least, not yet. She does, however, have something definitely in her favor: story-telling skills. She can weave a pleasant little story, like a minstrel that hasn't yet become a bard, but will someday.Jessica Allodola is a high school senior who hates her foster mother and her peers. She also hates Ramsa, her town, and most of the people in it. But the one thing she doesn't hate is the vampires she writes about. Jessica is a published author; her first book, \\"Tiger, Tiger\\" came out a week ago in the story under her pen name, Ash Night. So things are going fine for Jessica, until two characters from her book pop out of nowhere and start watching her.Aubrey is a vampire, one of the most feared of his kind. He has come to do away with the author Ash Night, because her book describes in humiliating detail the only fight he ever lost. In order to get at her, he enrolls in high school. He's angry enough to kill her on sight, but her attitude and complete ignorance of the truth of her stories draws him in almost against his will.Caryn Smoke is a witch, a healer, to be exact. The Smoke line hasn't killed a vampire in ages, but when Domonique Vida sends Caryn and her mother to keep an eye on Jessica, they go. Caryn enrolls in school and tries to watch Jessica. Unfortunately for Caryn, Jessica's dark nature is the complete opposite of Caryn's sunny one, so they don't get along.Jessica is at first ignorant of the truth behind her tales. She recognizes Aubrey on sight, but refuses to believe that \\"Alex\\"--Aubrey's high school name--could really be who she thinks he is. Until he identifies her as Ash Night, and Caryn reveals her true identity.Jessica falls for Aubrey, and he for her, but trouble ensues. Aubrey no longer wants to kill Jessica, but Fala, an evil vampire with a grudge against Jessica, does. And Fala loves pain, and loves to cause it, and may stop at nothing to bring Jessica down...This was a pretty decent story. Yes, I noticed that the aouthor seemed to be doing some self-insertion. Atwater-Rhodes seems to write very casually and quickly, and I imagine Demon in My View was just a little game for her, nothing serious. The difference between her and most authors is that they don't publish what they write when they feel like writing stupid stuff.Another problem was Aubrey. He seemed a lot less convincing than he did in the first book; many things weren't explained, such as why he wanted to enroll in high school. But then, I suppose you have to allow her some creative license; without him enrolling, the story wouldn't really exist.I got a bit tired of Jessica's snapping, but the reason for the is revealed in the end (her mother--hint, hint). As for all the complaints about Jessica worshipping herself, yeah, I guess she did; but she was trying to figure out what was wrong with her. The writing was a bit rushed and choppy, and the ending came too quickly, but again, Atwater-Rhodes was still a kid when she wrote this.The fight scene was fine, although it could use some improvement. Atwater-Rhodes didn't seem to know what she was talking about with her hitting and kicking. Again, I think one can attribute that to her youth.One last thing--the chapter divisions seemed a bit unnecessary. Her division skills needed work. I've read Hawksong, though, and they are fine there, so I'm not going to harp.All in all, a decent story, if not a Great Book. Good job, Ms. Atwater-Rhodes!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I have read many books about Vampires and science fiction, but never have I read such an intrigueing book on this subject. The author, being as young as she is, has magnifinclty toled the story of a young author who discovers that the characters she has written about are real. I was sooooo amazed by this story of a somewhat fiction romance. I have read this book twice, both times in one day. After I was done reading it the first time, I just kept thinking about and picturing everything that happend in the book in my mind. So I had to read it again, it was even better the second time. I love how the &quot;touh&quot; guy in this book turns into a totaly different guy. It may be, it may be about vampires and witchs, but it is a GREAT book!!!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Jessica is a secluded teenager who has a passion for writing, darkness... and vampires. Her first book, &quot;Tiger, Tiger&quot; has caused quite a stir, both in her world and the world of her characters, who turn out to be all to real for her safety. When she meets two new students in her school, she can't stand over-happy Caryn, but is drawn to Alex, who is frighteningly familiar to Aubrey, the seductive, yet deadly vilian of &quot;Tiger, Tiger&quot;. This can't be true,of course. Vampires don't exist... or do they? What Jessica finds out will change her point of view forever, that is if she lives long enough to tell about it."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I thought Ms. Rhodes had better character development with this story, and I admire her writing style, but I was disappointed with the story. I'm sorry to those who enjoyed it, but I didn't care much for the main character and didn't care whether she lived or died. I thought it unrealistic for Aubrey to fall for Jessica and be such a wimp in the story and sacrifice so much to save her when he's supposed to be this feared and mean character. I hope her third story is better than this one and has more believable actions by the characters. But keep writing, Amelia! I'm sure with time her writing will get better."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I've read better material by preschoolers. How superficial is Amelia? Every character is good looking and her writing experience ...terriblyWhere do all these good reviews come from? Gosh, if she didn't give out her age critics and fans would be bashing her with bad reviews, as someone said in one of the reviews. I agree, her work is terribly written."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Jessica Allodola is far from your average 17 year old girl. She is shunned and ignored by her classmates. Sometimes they seem to shy away from her without even knowing it. But that doesn't matter to much to Jessica. She'd much rather spend hours in her room churning out the vampire novels that she has been writing for the past few years. Jessica very much so prefers the company of her undead charecters than her peers. But everything Jessica's ever believed is about to change. Enter two new high school students. They introduce themselves as Caryn Rashida and Alex Remington. While Jessica immediately snubs Caryn, who is secretly a witch, she is drawn to the darkly handsome and mysterious Alex. Jessica recognized him the first time she saw him as Aubrey but, she knew that couldn't be true because Aubrey is a vampire. One that she created. Aubrey is dead set on getting rid of the author who published a book about the one fight he lost to his rival, Risika, and who is about to publish another book about his history. But things go awry for him when he falls in love with her. But Aubrey isn't the only vampire who wants Jessica dead. What will happen? Will Aubrey be able to protect Jessica?This was MY FAVORITE BOOK by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes. God, Aubrey is soo HOTT! Jessica is soo lucky. Amelia has the whole sexy and evil vampire thing down pat. Another EXCELLENT read!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I'm fourteen years old and a wannabe writer, but my work is nowhere as near as good as this beautifully dark story. I'vre read other reveiws of this book. Some of the low-starred ones I had to agree with, but others simply were confusing and hypocritical.This book, Demon In My View, stars Jessica Allodola, a senior high school student who is shunned and scorned by her fellow classmates. There is something about her that makes them want to draw away from her. Little do they know, Jessica is also Ash Night, the author of a rather popular vampire book called &quot;Tiger, Tiger&quot;.Meanwhile, some very angry vampires are out for Jessica's life, for all of her stories, her books, including the published one, is true. Every vampire is furious as they see vampire hunters know exactly who and where to find them.Then, two new students come to Jessica's school-Alex, a darkly handsome boy who reminds her stongly of Aubrey, the villian in her books, and Caryn, who's overly friendly but has a secret reason for being that way-a reason that could save Jessica.This book is a very good one. This is a freash, new novel worth reading."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Ms. Atwater-Rhodes' second book is not quite as effective as the first one. This is due I believe to her introduction of a character representing herself who then encounters her own literary creations. This makes for a less compelling story because the reader is constantly confronted with issues of whether the narrator completely believes in the story. Contrast the first book wherein no such device was used and the uncluttered story was much more powerful. However - having said this - I am also quite convinced that this young writer has a great deal of talent and I fully intend to read her next vampire book. My daughter Sarah, who is 12, introduced me to this author. She also feels this book is not quite as good as the first one, in which the story was told from a vampire's point of view and the characters (she feels) were more exciting. However it should also be noted that she has read this book 7 times and the first one, In the Forests of the Night, 12 times so - there is no question that Ms. Atwater-Rhodes is her favorite writer. Parents take note: here is a readable and exciting young author to whom you might want to introduce your kids around my daughter's age. I myself have enjoyed both of Ms. Atwater-Rhodes's books and look forward to more, as does my daughter who can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I read \\"In the Forest of the Night\\" and I was impressed with the thirteen year olds debut, but then came the sequel, which I was utterly disgusted by. I was disgusted by the leading female, Jessica who is hateful against everyone including her foster mother.It isn't as well written as her first novel which was also co-wroted by someone. This book was a cross of Dawson's Creek and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which is not a good thing. Being the annoying sarcasm and teenie atmosphere. The book itself was annoying to read.The book is too short for taste with many plot holes and questions to be answered:Why does Aubrey fall for a hateful girl?Why does Jessica fall for Aubrey and not other \\"hot\\" males? She suddenly flirts with him like any other male.Why doesn't she react to her mother's death?Why does she hate the world?How come we don't see any classmates aggravate her? She did note the kids are hostile, I saw no hostility in these kids, only weird stares.Why is it In the Forest of the Night says she lives in Concord and here she lives in Ramsa?A very stupid choice to make is the outcast very good looking to the point she could easily be a popular-outcast wannabe. Amelia spends several passages with her character worshipping her own body and it's quite nauseating.This is an example of a good looking girl being chased by good looking vampire.BIGGEST MISTAKE: Making the villain weaker to the heroine. Fala being the weakest vampire. You never make your villain weaker then everyone else then you know she will definitely lose.Is this the same Aubrey from the first book? He's not as mysterious or strong as the guy in the first novel.The ending: very unoriginal and predictable just by reading the synopsis. You don't even have to read the book to predict what will happen. An ending that is very overused.This book is not something I would recommend. it gives out a bad message and should be burnt off the bookshelves. Like many sequels, this one sucks."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I loved her first novel and her third was okay but this was pure [bad]. It was the most superficial book I have ever read. It was rushed and she lacks many story elements.First off Jessica is a girl who writes books based on dreams she has. Sounds like a rip off of C. Pike. The book is very predictable just by reading the synopsis. The book is very unoriginal and she takes away the vampire myth by making them walk the day. Vampires are night creatures not day creatures.Jessica is cynical, mean towards her foster mother, \\"has a body to die for\\", hates the world and everyone in it. She is annoying to the point I wished Aubery would had snapped her neck.Now Aubery is so very hot! As the female characters say, so everyone is a model taken from a J. Crew catalogue. Aubery was evil in the first book but here he is a feeble minded wuss. He lets his emotions take over and falls for this ruthless female? I don't understand his thing i guess it's girls who can bad mouth their foster parents.Fala is the only character I actually can relate to. Like her I wanted this writer killed. I was rooting Fala on but no, the villian always loses.Amelia rushed on this book writing it was poor as a writer could possibly. She could had taken the time to edit since she has all that time. She has a book coming out once a year, I could had wrote something that thick within a month, why is it that she doesn't take her time and edit? Now if she had a book series going on with a book coming out every month I would understaqnd but this is ridiculous.There were many elements missing i wouldn't give anymore then one star since she did write it atleast."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I'm a &quot;teen&quot;, still (I'm 18) and I read this book because I do like to read children's fiction, and well, frankly, I was disappointed. Her language attempts at having a poetic cadence which it cannot always match in maturity. Her world-building is decent but inconsistent. The story was okay; there was one plot wrinkle I didn't guess ahead of time, but her attempts at foreshadowing did not work. I spotted her token symbolism, and her characterization was maudlin, juvenile, and underdone. Stock characters are okay, but not when every single character is a stock character: the black-haired misfit anti-social type, the religious wanna-be do-gooder, the gorgeous vampire who can't HELP but fall in love with the strong-willed female protagonist. She kept reusing the same phrases over and over: &quot;the weakest of all&quot; or something along those lines recurred innumerable times. I seriously hope Miss Atwater-Rhodes has invested in a copy of _The Elements of Style_ (Strunk &amp; White), because I saw flaws in her writing style which could have been corrected by a little patient application of this book. Another reviewer made the comment that it was too short, and I agree: had she used more &quot;showing&quot; and less &quot;telling&quot;, as the English teachers say, I think it could have gone over two hundred pages. All in all, I probably will read the other books she writes, but I don't think I'll take them seriously until Miss Atwater-Rhodes hits twenty-one or so. As for whether one should invest in this book or not: if you are an aspiring writer, and under the age of college, this book is a must-have, partially for the inspiring story of the fifteen-year-old writer, and partially to see what works and what doesn't work. I think I would wait until the paperback came out, though, too."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book was amazingly good. Amelia Atwater Rhodes can really write.

I think that the writer(Amelia Atwater-Rhodes) has an extremely creative mind. I would recommend this book to anyone into action, adventure, mystical, imaginative, and strangely romantic books. The reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because I absolutely loved the book, but there was a small amount of the parts of the book were almost hard to follow, like the blood lines (for instance).This book is about a girl named Jessica. Jessica is a very odd girl who lives with her aunt, and she loves to write and create mystic stories. Every day she goes to school as the outcast type and doesn't have any friends, but she has learned to live with it. One day a girl named Caryn comes to Jessica's school and tries to be her friend, but Jessica will not let her, and tells her to go away. A few days later a hot new guy, named Aubrey, comes to her school, and is exactly like one of the characters in her books. She has a huge crush on him instantly, and he soon becomes her friend. Little did she know there was something very particular about this boy, something that is very odd to even imagine, and whatever it is Caryn doesn't like him for it, and he doesn't like her neither... so I will let you read this awesome book and discover it for yourself(it\`s a real page turner)."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I am a big fan of Amelia Atwate-Rhodes, and this book is my favorite in the series. She just out does herself, and I think the result is tremendous, especially because she wrote this book when she was 15.The main character is Jessica Allodola, an adopted girl who is considered an outcast at her school, Ramsa High. Unbeknownst to her peers, however, she is the author of a popular book called Tiger, Tiger. To keep her identity secret, she uses the pseudonym of Ash Night on all of her publications.However, things start getting confusing when 2 new students show up at her school. The first, Caryn, is almost disturbingly sympathetic towards Jessica and tries to become her friend-- exactly what Jessica doesn't want. But there's more to her then first glance, and she proves to be an important character.The other new student proves to be much more disturbing. Calling himself \\"Andrew\\", this new boy is extremely good looking, and also extremely resembles Jessica's fictional vampire Aubrey, right down to the tattoos and necklace. But Jessica knows this can't be Aubrey. Vampires are fictional, right?My only bone to pick with this book is I wanted a stronger relationship between Aubrey and Jessica. Being the hopeless romantic that I am, I expected more... but oh well, what I consider good romance is often too mushy for others. Anyway, read this book! It is an excellant read for Vampire fans, as well as others who aren't crazy about blood-suckers."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Demon in my view was awesome one of my fav from aar's collection, real page turner!

I liked to think of him as the powerful, never loving, traditional vampire, but when he gets his crush on Jessica, it gets kind of unreal. The ending, although good, was a bit predictable. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to all."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Okay, this was soooooo good! It's the sequel of In the Forests of the Night (which was also so good!).It's about Jessica Allodola who is an young author and her first book about vampires called Tiger, Tiger just got published a week or so before under her pen name of Ash Night.When Jessica goes to school one day, she's confronted by a new girl, Caryn Smoke, who turns out to be in a long line of witches and guy that, if she didn't know better and if she knew that fiction wasn't real, she'd think he was Aubrey, a character in Tiger, Tiger and the main character in her next book, Dark Flame. Everything about him and Aubrey are the same. From the necklace to the wolf tattoo on his right wrist.As Jessica soon learns, the new guy IS Aubrey and everything she wrote about was true. Including the secret vampire base in the United States: New Mayhem. And with the release of Tiger, Tiger, all of the witches know where to find the vampires and kill them, for the witches thought that when Mayhem was burnt down three hundred years earlier, it was gone forever. And the vampires aren't too happy about that piece of information. They want to find Ash Night...and kill her.Amelia is such a great author! You should totally read this book (after you've read In the Forests of the Night, of course).
