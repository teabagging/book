It's not the most action-packed, event-filled book ever written, but it's an incredible study of human behavior and chocked to the brim with excellent mood, symbolism, and atmosphere. It's the type of book a person can really sink their teeth into. The plot and meaning isn't just laid out for you, but nor does it take a rocket scientist to find. Fitzgerald writes in an excellent style that is both intelligent and enjoyable, an oft rare combination that few authors have truly mastered."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It is superficial to dismiss the Great Gatsby as a 'period piece', a perfect description of the roaring twenties - but holding little value to the modern reader. Yet, the Great Gatsby is harbor to themes and concepts that transcend its setting, and still can be meaningful to a reader today. The Great Gatsby analyzes the destructive impacts of society and wealth on people - certainly, society today has not changed so much that is no longer damages the psyches of people would get dragged beneath its current. And today, we must still be believe in the potential for life and dreams - like Gatsby, a poor boy turned rich because he believed in the orgastic future."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This novel is an extremly remarkable book that has so much to do with devotion and trying to attain a goal that any cheesy romance reader should love it. Gatsby believed in the green light, and he knew that one day he would have Daisy, and the symbolism precribing to this is wonderful! However, it is not mush that you can read without thinking, otherwise it would be a cheesy romance novel. If you are involved with the novel you are reading, it will come to you with a bang, the true meaning leaving a smile on your face. Great job by one of the greatest American novelists of all time!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This was a pretty good book about the sad and corrupt people of the 1920s. Don't be bullied by William T. Vogt's review, though, read it for yourself and form your own opinion. It is easy not to have any sympathy for the characters because of faults such as greed, brutality, and arrogance. But it is important that you look beyond those characteristics when reading. You must remember this is the 1920s, you must take into consideration the background of each character and their motivations (every scene is important), then you will understand them more and perhaps gain a bit of sympathy if not like for the character. Even the Great Gatsby has his faults (don't be fooled by the title). When reading the story, a question that you should try to answer is if this is truly a love story or the story of two people who think their in love (consider motivation and character). Another question to ask is why this is titled the Great Gatsby. Overall, this is an excellent commentary on 1920s life through the eyes of Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"There's something about the American literary critic that seems to equate short and lowbrow with good. At least that's the feeling you get in school when forced to read novels like this one and by authors like Steinbeck and Hemingway. The interesting prose and slathered-thick symbolism livened up this tale of a man who is DETERMINED to have everything. The reason I didn't care about his struggle is because this nouveau riche tycoon just wants the standard stuff: acceptance, $$$ and girls. I guess the moral of the story is that being shallow and possessive can lead to tragic consequences, but duh!, you're already supposed to know that."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I read this book in high school. That was only three yearsago. I am not rich, not a social climber, but my sympathy for Gatsbyis utter and unbreakable. He is perhaps the most American hero in all of American literature--both a triumph of diligence and ingenuity and a tragedy of naivete and unrequitable striving. Make no mistake, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is a classic. I don't mind if other readers don't like it, but I wish they would read the book with a little more empathy."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"There is a reason it is one of the most beloved books of the 20th century. . . Absolutely perfect."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I read this masterpiece when I was a kid. Reading it as an adult demonstrated to me why \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is revered as a classic. I have to concur that although a quick read it is most enjoyable. F. Scott pours his artistry into his work and it shows that he was indeed a great artist."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald portrays through this book the life of the wealthy during the 1920s. Gatsby fell in love with Daisy, a wealthy young woman, when he was placed at Louisiana as a soldier. However, due to his poorness, he let Daisy go. Gatsby does not give up on her and becomes rich through the job of bootlegging. Knowing that Daisy lives at East Egg, Gatsby moves to West Egg where he can watch her without suspicion. However, Daisy is married to a wealthy guy named Tom Buchanon. Still, Gatsby holds party every Saturday, hoping someday Daisy will come to the party and realize Gatsby's wealth. He gets the chance when Nick, the narrator of the story, moves next door to him. Nick is the cousin of Daisy. By acquainting Nick and doing favors to him, Gatsby is able to meet Daisy through Nick. Daisy, impressed by Gatsby's success, falls in love with him again. However, as Tom finds out about this affair, a dilemma occurs. Fitzgerald illustrates through this book that while people seek wealth as the only route to gaining one's desires, wealth ironically destroys the portals to happiness. The plot of the book is easy to follow, and Fitzgerald effectively portrays the corrupt side of 1920s, when the Unites States was prospering and everything seemed to be perfect."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I read this book in high school, and I loved the prose. Fitzgerald paints really amazing pictures with his words.However, this book was much more powerful when I read it again as an adult. For me, the theme of the book was that you can't escape your past, and you have to be careful what you wish for in your future. It really drives home the point that you can't depend on other people for your happiness. You just don't know when one of those solid people that you trust turns out to be one of the shallow people instead.This book is a tragedy, and it seems more powerful than the Greek tragedies I've read. In Greek tragedy, so much of what happens seems to happen as a whim of the gods and there is nothing anyone can do to escape their fate. Fate takes control for Gatsby, but he doesn't have the gods to blame. It makes it a much more tragic story.I strongly recommend reading this book, even if (or maybe especially if) you've read it before. It's a much more powerful book to read once you've been in the position to have lost some of your dreams, to see the shallowness of the real world outside of high school or college."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Truly one of the classics.Well written and as a \\"classic\\" a book that does not want to be left alone.A great study of human nature at that time."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"_The Great Gatsby_ has a lot to offer: high society parties, lost love, infedelity, murder and suicide written in an elegant, flowing prose. The story revolves around a summer spent in a resort community outside of NYC, and the lavish lifestyle of the title character. While the characters have few redeeming qualities and Fitzgerald's stinging critque of the upper classes is off-putting to some, it remains a classic for a reason: like it or not, admit it or not, we are all to some extent like Jay Gatsby: inventions and reinventions of ourselves.On a more superficial level, Fitzgerald does a tremendous job of recreating a picture in time and, for a brief moment, allowing us to visit that time and place. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I've read this book twice, once when they forced me in school and later when I was about 27 years old. In my later reading, I fully appreciated the language of this book and view it as one of the most entrancing books I've ever read, equal in might only to The Grapes of Wrath. Will it change your life, probably not. But it brings you to a far off place, in an era that the author brings to life vivdly. I read this book a few times a year, and it never loses its power."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I thought this was an excellent book. Given that I hadn't the opportunity to read it during high school, I took it up at the age of 23.While some of the story jumps a little unexpectedly from time to time, the story is quite exquisite, covering the fatal flaws of imagery and desire. This is a complex story, who's inner workings remind me something of Fight Club, whose narrator has a love/hate feeling for the character he works with, and whose compatriate really doesn't care all too greatly, as his personal dealings are rather obscured and placed aside.I finished reading the book two days ago, I had a better review otherwise..."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The book was okay, it had a good plot, but could have been shorter. It was a little bit too political for me. It seemed to take a long time for things to happen. The book is very descriptive when it comes to the setting. Every little detail is described, along with thoughts and feelings and I don't like too much detail, I am more of a short and to the point kind of guy. I had a hard time keeping my attention focused. There was a lot of confusion as to what was going on with who, where and mainly what was going on. Many parts of the book I had to go back and re-read to get a full understanding of it and even after I reread it I still didn't get it. The plot was decent, aimed more towards romantics than others. At times it seemed like one big soap. Overall if you have to read it, it is readable, if you are interested in life and the times, you'll like it, if your more into action and adventure, which I am, you won't find it here, however it's not a total waste of time to read. The Great Gatsby is a very dramatic book, and it holds a lot of truth. The main reason I read it is because I heard a lot about it and how F. Scott Fitzgerald is a great author. Many of the things discussed in it reflect on even today's society. So overall it was okay, I personally didn't enjoy it too much but again if you like stuff like this, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"You were probably assigned this book as a teenager, for school, like every other teenager in America. I know I was. But if you were like me you were totally unable to appreciate it. More recently (read: 10 years later) I re-read the book. I don't need to say it's the greatest American novel ever written, since so many before me said it much more eloquently.All I can add to the chorus of praise is that this book is much more meaningful when you're a little older and able to appreciate it, and it's actually a very quick read. The experience of reading this in your 20s (or later) is extremely pleasant and rewarding.Enjoy! :)"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Can we all agree that this is the Great American Novel?It captures, perfectly, the spirit and sounds of the Twenties. Fitzgerald's characters are so well imagined that they take on a life of their own - so much so that turning the book into a film is well nigh impossible. Even though it has been done a number of times, the casting is usually wrong, at least in part.We have such a vividly personal idea of whom Tom and Daisy, Nick and Jordan and yes, Gatsby are, that no one actor or actress can quite satisfy on the screen. So too with the symbols, from the light at the end of the dock to the billowy room and those ever- watchful eyes...This book is worth keeping near by, and re-reading often. Say, once a year. It really is a modern marvel - and o so much more than a snapshot of its time.Fitzgerald got it so right in this novel that it remains his tragic fate that he never quite equaled his genius elsewhere. Perhaps because the people are real people, aren't they? We can, for instance, say that Nick and Gatsby are the two personas of F Scott and that Daisy is pretty much Zelda Sayre, and when we do, we will appreciate them more, not less.Read it for the romance, read it for the razzmatazz, read it for the historicity, read it for the tragedy, read it for fun and read it for consolation. Gatsby really is Great.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I've just reread THE GREAT GATSBY for the first time since high school. It's amazing we had to read it in high school. How could a teenager understand all this stuff about adultery and materialism? I remember my eleventh grade teacher said that F. Scott Fitzgerald, &quot;wasn't a first rate writer, but he was a very good second rate writer.&quot; Even in eleventh grade, I found that horrific. Why labor at all to write a book in the first place, pouring all your life blood into writing what would become a 20th century classic, just to have some high school English teacher dub you &quot;a very good second rate writer&quot;?In my English teacher's defense, we were a very trying class. She was trying to get us to elucidate the symbolic meaning in the scene where Jay Gatsby stands on his dock and stares at the green light across the water. She said, &quot;The dock scene . . . what comes to your mind?&quot; The jocks who sat in the back of the class yelled, &quot;Hickory Dickory Dock.&quot; The poor woman literally banged her head into the brick wall of our classroom.Rereading THE GREAT GATSBY all these years later, I am struck with how fresh and utterly relevant it is. In essence, it isn't dated at all. What happened in West Egg in the Long Island Sound in 1923 could just as well have happened in Silicon Valley in the Dot Com Nineties. There are many Jay Gatsbys. Fitzgerald created an essential American archetype with Jay Gatz, the boy from North Dakota who wanted to reinvent himself and turn himself into something grand, based on the dreams he had for his life when he was 17. We catch a poignant glimpse of him as a thirty-year-old man who woos and impresses his long lost love with his swank mansion and his English tailored shirts. All glitter and glamour, the most important thing is that gaudy surface and facade that dazzles the eye. It says a lot about our culture, about the quintessential American dream."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I've probably read this book 3 times, listened to it on audio tape once, and read it aloud while on a car trip. What can you say about such a powerful and classic book, a book that has come to be symbolic of the Jazz Age with all of its excess and smarmy decadence? The enigmatic and subtly evil Jay Gatsby, self-made man and millionaire, and his passion for Daisy, the wife of the man who lives across the bay from him, are at the center of this novel, which is told from the point of view of Nick, an occasional guest and neighbor on East Egg, who is able to tell the story, eventually, with some degree of detachment and cynicism. There is the inevitability of a Greek drama to the cadences and pacing of The Great Gatsby, a tragedy lying in wait for all involved.Exquisite and spare prose, tight plot, and wonderful characters. It's as good as a novel gets."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I had heard much about this book but had never (unbelieveably) read anything by Fitzgerald.

As another reviewer mentioned, it is even better to read later in life, even if you read it back in school, it will 'land' differently now.The story is timeless and very American. The self created master of the universe, still looking out and coveting from his gilded perch.We live in a world full of greedy strivers and wannabes, grasping for success at all costs and often achieving it; who create their identities out of whole cloth, and who we then look up to admiringly, unaware of any seedy backstory.This book is as contemporary now as it was almost 90 years ago when it was written, and probably will continue to be, so long as humans continue to be the greedy schemers they have been to date!And it is written so beautifully.

I wanted to get reacquainted with it before the movie comes out and I'm so glad that I did. When I was younger, I was so enamored by the lavish, 20's lifestyle that these characters lived- almost as if I was an outsider invited to tag along with them, just like our narrator, Nick. Reading it now, I have a much more skeptical but mature reaction. I felt sad for how lonely and stuck all of these characters were in their life choices. The only person who was able to realize this early on, and know when to say when, was Nick.While ultimately a sad story, I really did enjoy it and happy that I reintroduced myself to Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book is a classic and when I read it I instantly knew why.The writing is poetic and so are the characters.I had been meaning to read this for a long time and jumped on it when it went on sale.

F. Scott Fitzgerald did a great job of bringing to life the characters in his novel and making them have flaws like everyone has from time to time.

I would recommend :)"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Wonderfully enchanting. Definitely illustrates the parallels of love and especially money. TRAGICALLY beautiful , although, it was a bit slow"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Whenever this book is discussed, the american dream and the jazz age are the first things to be mentioned. I never understood this because, for me, the emotional core of the novel is understanding the extent to which men are willing to fabricate and chase illusions. This slim beast of a novel allows us to walk in the shoes of a man determined to recreate the past and shape reality to his wishes. Everything Jay Gatsby does is designed to win back his love, but time, social status, and reality stand between him and his dreams. By empathizing with Jay Gatsby, we understand our own desires to recapture the past and our own tendencies to objectify the people we cared about. It is for this reason that this is a great piece of literature worthy of reading and rereading.For those out there who find the characters unsympathetic, please note that the same negative traits found in the characters are the same traits we all have. Gatsby, Daisy, etc... are not supposed to be role models, they're supposed to highlight our own desires and flaws. While we might not find them euphoric to be around, we certainly learn more about ourselves by being with them. And besides, I actually like Gatsby.Also, Fitzgerald writes with abundant wit and sarcasm that is truly charming."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"For years I listened to people talk about this book but never understood what the storyline was, I thought about giving it a chance and I'm glad I did!

He doesn't disappoint from beginning to end, I recommend to any book lover out there or anyone looking for something to keep them occupied. One of the greatest era to write about in the greatest city in America!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"By some quirk in my personal history, I'd never read GATSBY. It has many beautifully written, poetic passages, and Gatsby's demise retains an ineffable sadness that moved me in the final pages. The absence of mourners at his funeral was particularly poignant. Fitzgerald's theme of pursuing an incompletely realized dream is universal, with the corollary that if one's timing is off, the dream may forever remain out of reach. Add to this a crushing irony: in order to win Daisy, Gatsby strove to make himself a member of her wealthy Long Island society, but she is shallow and frivolous and her husband is brutish and racist. The others in their group show no loyalty to Gatsby, the man who'd thrown them lavish parties, by deserting him in death.I'll comment briefly on the poetic nature of Fitzgerald's prose. He uses two metaphors involving water that are linked inextricably to the action of the novel. At the beginning of the story, the narrator, Nick, notes that \\"Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes...\\" comparing conduct to an edifice that can be built on a solid base (\\"hard rock\\") or a tenuous one (\\"wet marshes\\"). Foreshadowing is at work here as Gatsby's springboard into affluent society turns out to be a yacht in a dangerously shallow mooring. Unfortunately, Gatsby is floating in his pool at the end when he is shot to death. The novel concludes with another \\"wet\\" metaphor in the justly famous line \\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\" Humans are boats struggling to row into the future, while all the while carried backward by Time's river. Figures of speech are only effective if they complement the surrounding language and action.Another vivid display of language occurs at the beginning of Chapter III with a 2 1/2 page description of the preparations for and beginning of a typical Gatsby party. \\"On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold.\\" Later, the narrator notes, \\"The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.\\" A milieu built on the \\"wet marshes\\" indeed."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Reading The Great Gatsby in high school almost seems like an American rite of passage. When I read it years ago in high school, I didn't care for it. Actually, I hated it. But after seeing that title pop up over and over again among lists of the greatest novels, I wanted to try it again. Did I like it any more the second time around? Nope.First, there is the language. Most people will tell you that that is what they love about the book, that The Great Gatsby is the prime example of exquisite and beautiful language. Maybe it works for you, but reading Fitzgerald's words leaves me scratching my head wondering, \\"What is he trying to say?\\"Let's take a relatively unimportant line from Chapter 1 as an example. Fitzgerald writes, \\"Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on.\\" Okay, what does that mean? I get the second half of the sentence - that the narrator doesn't care how one's conduct, i.e., one's behavior, is founded - that it doesn't matter whether you were brought up with great advantages or if you were brought up without them. But why hard rock? Why wet marshes? What does that mean? Hard rock? Wet marshes? Maybe you have a great answer for me, and I'm just not getting it. That's entirely plausible. But without a straight answer, I'm just left struggling. And this happens all over the place in this novel - words that conjure up images that float in the sky without any meaning to ground them.Second, there are the wholly unlikeable characters. What more needs to be said? The characters are wholly unlikeable. All of them.Third, through the narrator Nick Carraway, we are treated to a love/hate relationship with the wealthy class of the time period. We are to be in love, in awe, and in constant fascination with this one percent (to use today's language) for no reason other than the fact that they have lots of money. We are to be envious of and hopelessly attracted to high society. And although Fitzgerald paints these one percent characters as wholly unlikeable, he falls short of actually condemning their behavior. It's not a scathing satire. In the end, you still see the glimmers of attraction. And this, I cannot stand. I cannot stand the pathetic fawning over of the one percent. Cue eye roll. Get a backbone and find some self-worth. Please.Why two stars instead of one? My hatred of this novel bordered on obsession. I kept wondering why I disliked it so much. Those thoughts kept churning and churning in my head. And so, two stars instead of one, because evoking this level of obsession is worth something."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The whole story appears to revolve around this huge \\"love triangle\\" of Gatsby trying to get Daisy to come back to him and leave Tom.

Maybe I'm not ready for it yet, I don't know (I had to read it for English class). Fitzgerald's writing was very vague. At times, a novel calls for vague writing, and it works. In this case, it did not. He just skimmed over the important parts and honed in on pointless details. The entire book had a very ghostly quality; I always felt like something was there, but it was mostly undetectable. Still, it has its good points - I liked the way Fitzgerald protrayed Gatsby's fair-weather friends, and the tragic ending that could be compared to a Shakespearean tragedy, when no one is left but the narrator :).

In that, it is a velvet covered table upon which a small band of bored and privileged jazz-agers appear under the entertainer's deft hands. It is a metaphor of its age and an uncanny prognostication of our current malaise. What makes this book magical? When one steps back from the book, there's no plot, the characters are rather bland, they don't do anything particularly interesting, and what they do accomplish in the very short timespan we spend with them is so trivial or mean that we are left wondering why we enjoyed the book so much.

It is easy to become enthralled with the lavishness and mystery of Gatsby, but the center of the book remains with the protagonist's analysis and understanding of human nature.Most great writers embed their thoughts, experiences, and musings into their work, and The Great Gatsby is a perfect example. What you find in the book will differ, some will say it's an accurate portrayal of the shallowness of the 20's, others will find a deep feeling of sadness: that no one is ever be truely happy, whether you are a beautiful woman, a football star, a millionaire, or if a famous woman is attracted to you and you live in West Egg.The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the book seemed a little flat. Perhaps it is a side effect of being concise, but I felt very little attachment towards any of the characters, and although Fitzgerald gave them some dimension, it's been done far better.The Great Gatsby is a book I would recommend none-the-less."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a story about a group of characters that all see things in the wrong perspective. Gatsby, the main character, lives an illegal life for the love of a silly married rich girl named Daisy. Daisy thinks that ignorance will get women far in life. In my opinion she is pretty ignorant her self. Tom, Daisy's husband, thinks that money and power gives him the right to do what he wishes to do, including hit women and cheat on his wife with Myrtle Wilson. Myrtle is also married and hopes to one day live a glamorous life with Tom, but Tom is lying when he said he would leave his wife for Myrtle. Myrtle's husband, George Wilson, is a depressed man that looks at life as though it were covered in ashes. The others live in West Egg also known as New York, the city of sin. These confused individuals all have one thing in common and that is that their outlook on life is all wrong.In the story I found that F. Scott Fitzgerald used colors to help express the characters. He did this by using the green light outside Gatsby's house to show that he had money; he used white dresses that Daisy, Daisy's daughter, and Jordan wore to show they were rich. The Valley of Ashes is a symbol of a gray gloomy dark depressed place. The author did this to describe the setting more clearly to the reader. I enjoyed the color coordination in the book. The colors make this book more interesting and unique.The characters in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; were overall selfish people that really did not care much about anyone else. Gatsby's love for Daisy clouds his mind and the thoughts about how Daisy is married already and has a child. Their love affair could jeopardize Tom and Daisy's marriage and the daughter. Tom cheats on his wife regardless that there is a child involved. No one in the story really mentions anything about the welfare of the child. Everyone seems to be much too involved in other things. George just wants to up and leave so bad that he overlooks Myrtle's feelings. Myrtle hurts George to the point of depression, and won't even go to a church when his friend suggests it to him. Daisy leads Gatsby on, knowing that she can't and won't leave Tom. Nick's need to be friendly to everyone blinds him to the point were he can't prevent the tragedies that occur when it's possible to do so.If I could change on thing about the book The Great Gatsby it would be Gatsby's love for Daisy. The whole love thing between Gatsby and Daisy dose not make sense at all. I would change this because Gatsby's love for her leads to tragedy. Gatsby could have done better. Gatsby was a strange guy that did too much for too little. Gatsby let himself be taken for granted.I would recommend this book to anyone that is selfish or someone that looks at love, money, power, or dreaming as though this means everything in the world. These things may be good to have but, like in The Great Gatsby, too much can lead a person to his end. This is a book that made me really think about the consequences that result from selfish actions. This book has a great message about life."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The movie version of The Great Gatsby, was very concise with the book. I was surprised that the lines were said word for word. It made the book become real, and I was finally able to see certain places that I couldn't picture in my head while reading the book. I believe that while the settings and events were accurate some of the actors that played their character could have been chosen better to fit the part.The performance of Nick played by Paul Rudd did an excellent job with his character. In the book I was always picturing Nick to be this man that was relatively quiet, boring, and the most normal of all the Great Gatsby characters. In the movie that's exactly what he played. He did a good job looking very glum throughout the book, and I believed his character very much.As for Gatsby, who was played by Toby Stephens, I feel they could have found someone that would have played the part better. I pictured a character that looked older, and wasn't so perfect looking, (hair, teeth, etc.). I just feel that he didn't play up to his role, and when he spoke I didn't feel as though the movie was as real anymore, because I don't think he fit the character. I also think it could be due to the fact that finding an actor for the role of Gatsby would be difficult because Gatsby is such a hard character to play.The movies accuracy to the book was extremely concise, and fitting. I totally believed it, and the director, (Robert Markowitz) did an excellent job keeping things parallel with the book, instead of putting a Hollywood spin on things. The characters were mostly played well and were accurate with the exception of Tom, whom I thought would be a much heavier and stouter character, and Myrtle, whom, I thought would have more beauty to her than she did. Even though she played such a small role, I though that Tom and Daisy's little girl would have been a blonde haired cute little thing, and turned out to have brownish/blackish WILD curly hair. Of course Gatsby, who I felt didn't fit his character well at all.The production of the film was very well done. The settings and places in the book were extremely concise in matching up with the book. The tone and the feel of the movie were well done also. The book, to me, felt dark and depressing, and surprisingly enough the movie gave off that vibe too.Mr. M made us watch this movie."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is a story of a man who tries to impress a girl, by showing her he can be apart of the upper class in New York City. The story is narrated by Nick Carraway, who met the main character, Jay Gatsby at one of Gatsby's parties. Gatsby, whose real name is James Gatz, has moved from North Dakota to New York City to prosper as a wealthy stock broker. That is a very different change, even if it's in the 1920's.Gatsby has one intention throughout the story that is to get Daisy back. She is a past fling that took place in Louisville, Kentucky. Daisy is married to Tom, who is very wealthy. Tom, unlike Gatsby, has had wealth in his family that dates back several generations. Tom says, \\".....\\" Tom is having an affair with Myrtle Wilson.Nick meets Jordan Baker, whose name represents Lexus or Mercedes in current times because both Jordan and Baker were popular automobiles during the time. Nick invites Gatsby and Daisy over to his home so they can meet up with each other again. This makes Tom jealous because Gatsby and Daisy fall in love again.Tom invites the whole crew out to eat and accuses Gatsby of causing trouble with him and Daisy. They tell everyone that they are in love and leave. George Wilson, Myrtle's husband, also gets into a fight and she leaves, only to be hit by the car that Daisy is driving. Tom tells George that Gatsby is responsible for the Myrtle's death and George goes to Gatsby's home and kills Gatsby, but then turns and shoots himself. Nobody shows up to Gatsby's funeral in the end, which I perceive as you can change the outside of a person, but not the inside."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"If we define the greatest American novel as that which most completely captures the American ideology of a certain place and time in our history, then &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; might very well be the greatest American novel in existence. However, is &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; the most enjoyable book I've ever read, or even the best written? No. This falls pretty low on my list of favorites, but I can't deny Fitzgerald's wonderful talent in putting it together. In a way, this novel is the literary equivalent of &quot;Casablanca&quot; for me---I can acknowledge how well made it is, but distanced from the unique set of social circumstances in which it was first experienced, I can't quite understand the effect it seems to have on so many people."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This slim novel of simple prose by F. Scott Fitzgerald is considered by many to be the greatest American story, the tale of what an empty life one can lead if one adheres too strongly to the American Dream. Jay Gatsby has risen to prominence in a method seeming to be right out of a Horatio Alger novel. Born a Westerner of no consequence, Gatsby has acquired his millions, moved to a Long Island mansion, and thrown lavish parties nightly. Only later we learn that he has done all this for the single goal of marrying Daisy Buchanan, a woman he romanced for a month in his youth.However, Gatsby's single-mindedness is his downfall. Every action, every acquaintance, every acquisition over a five-year span has only helped him to romanticize his quest. Gatsby fails to question whether he wants to belong to Daisy's world, and he cannot comprehend that Daisy's daily concerns about her wealth may temper her love for him.Through the eyes of Nick Carraway, another misplaced Westerner, but one with his feet firmly planted in the less-manicured lawns of reality, Fitzgerald weaves a tapestry of the excesses of New York in the Jazz Age. It is a world of people bonded together by \\"their money or their vast carelessness\\" who \\"let other people clean up the mess they had made.\\" Gatsby could not find fulfillment in his elaborate hoax because he is too honest to enjoy the illusion he created."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book is a fine example of books that will be entertaining to those who like to read and those that are inapropriate for School purposes. this is a more pature book and i believe that it was writen with great passion and this is shown in Mr. Gatsby himself. with all the tragety in this book and the love story that is displayed, i would recommend this to anyone who wants to read a classic but not to anyone looking for just any old book and doesn't give it the respect it deserves.

Now, however, I understand the folly of chasing castles in the sky. In Gatsby you see a man who could have done so much but wasted his precious life chasing an illusion. Daisy embodied everything he thought he wanted: beauty, wealth, and a name. Yet we see (and I don't think Gatsby ever understood) that it was all a mirage. For all of their wealth and breeding, Daisy and Tom were vapid, shallow, cruel people who deserved each other.Anyone unfortunate enough to enter their sphere would be crushed and cast aside."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This was a memorable way to \\"read\\" the F.

Thank God for Amazon and it's incredible books at reasonable prices. Amazon makes reading the classics easy, accessible and affordable. What more could I ask for?"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Ah, THE GREAT GATSBY. The defining novel of the Jazz Age. Fitzgerald's masterpiece. The Great American Novel. I first read this in High School and then again in a College course called \\"Literature of the Jazz Age\\" which also featured Hemingway'sA Moveable Feast. Hem and Scott were friends who despised one another. Hem once crushed a glass in his bare hand and in a fit of machismo said, \\"Scott can you do that?\\" Fitzgerald answered, \\"Hem, you're such an @$$40/#.\\" Hem, on his side, thought Scott was a \\"powder puff.\\"Having re-read it several times since, I'll say that THE GREAT GATSBY is great. It is a beautifully crafted prose poem in which every word serves a purpose; there's no excess here.If you haven't read it, it is the story of Jay Gatsby, a Long Island millionaire who is hopelessly in love with Daisy, married to Tom Buchanan, as told to us through the eyes of Nick Carraway, who watches as their insular world unravels.Almost everybody who dislikes this book seems to focus on the negativity of the characters. They miss the point. The characters ARE negative and shallow by design: Tom is cruel, Daisy is a b**ch, Jordan is vapid, and Jay is a phony. They aren't supposed to be likeable. THE GREAT GATSBY's only sympathetic character is Nick. If you read this book carefully, you'll see that this is Carraway's autobiography. Notice that Carraway walks away from all the false glitter of Gatsby's time, leaving behind all the wreckage the others have caused.Another huge complaint I see in the reviews is how BORING the book is, and how impenetrable it seems. The atmosphere of the story is one of stultifying heaviness. With all their money, the characters have no idea how to exist, much less live and thrive. At one point Daisy asks a general question about having plans with friends, \\"What do people plan?\\" Jay, Daisy, Tom and the others are suffocating, and it is a mark of this book's excellence that that airlessness impacts the reader. Some readers may, however, find it a slog.Is Carraway Fitzgerald? Very possibly. As a younger man, he fell in love with his future wife, the less-than-stable Zelda, and suffered through her various crazinesses. He strove to impress her and satisfy her endless wants (much like Gatsby with Daisy). THE GREAT GATSBY (originally titled AMONG THE ASH-HEAPS AND THE MILLIONAIRES) is in part a recounting of his own maturation.AMENDED REVIEW 10/7/10"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"First and foremost, this is a great book. Anyone who enjoys literature will fall in love with Fitzgerald's examined manipulation of the English language that can be called nothing else but art. Every word speaks volumes in this tale of minimal pages but endless emotions. It is a book to be savored and one that continues to get better with age."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I have heard it said that English is not a beautiful sounding language and that American prose in particular seems tone-deaf. I submit that people that say these things have never read Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby.\\"But if the beautiful sentences were simply that, the book would not work on the deeper level that gripped me within a couple pages. There has been criticism of, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" that its overly romantic but I think the book is tapping into something more than that. It embodies and presents the American yearning for identity which is part wealth, part status, part beauty and part awe. This yearning goes beyond anything attainable and into the dangerous realm of self-delusion to which even someone as strong and decent as Gatsby succumbs.Gatsby isn't a tragic hero because want he seeks isn't monumental - the adulterous love of Daisy but the way he pursues her is heroic because it consumes his whole life. Everything he is and does is aimed at gaining access to the social strata in which she lives. And the novel shows that elite society to be superficial, empty and thoughtless but Gatsby can't see that because he is so consumed with obtaining Daisy.And someone could write an entire dissertation (and probably several people have) on the role of the automobile in Great Gatsby. When the book was written in 1923-24, the automobile was just on its way to becoming mainstream. They weren't a luxury but neither had they yet become commonplace. Fitzgerald was able to see the car not just as a symbol of his character's reckless disregard but as embodying both the rush to freedom and the ugly ruin of American life. The ash heaps and haunting eyes staring out from of the Dr. T.J. Eeckleburg billboard is where autos refill and where a pedestrian is run over by Gatsby's car. The automobile allowed the characters impulsively decide to drive to New Yok City for drinks they don't even consume but to do so they must travel through industrial and commercial blight. Isn't this the devil's bargain we have all surrendered to?"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"4 stars means: It was a great book and I would recommend it to almost anyone.This novel best epitomizes the 1920s in New York and the U.S. as a whole. Although it starts moderately slow, as a lot of 'classics' sometimes do, at least to the modern reader, it is a engaging read with genuinely interesting and extremely complex characters.On the characters: Few novels manage to create this depth of personality in such a large number of characters over so few pages. You come to, if not like, at least be interested in the fate of everyone in the novel. Although there are very few people you could honestly root for this becomes part of the fun of the book.The party scene is a seminal moment in fiction. It is one of the best captured moments through so few words.The prose is not fluffy but well crafted and meaningful. Fitzgerald manages to illuminate deeper issues in the plot through brilliant diction and subtle analogies.This and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button are the only works of Fitzgerald which I have read, but both have made me want to enjoy more of them.

Taking place in the giant city of New York a young bachelor named Nick Carraway finds his neighbor to be one of great wealth and mystery. He has never met his neighbor but there are always wild parties in the gigantic house next to his. One evening after returning from a small dinner party at his friends Tom and Daisy Buckhannon's house; Mr. Gatsby emerges from the shadows next door and greets Nick mysteriously. The next afternoon Nick is invited to one of Gatsby's great parties. Nick and Gatsby become good friends throughout the book. One evening Gatsby confesses to Nick that he has loved Daisy Buckhannon for a long time. So Nick sets up a tea party with the two and, they fall in love behind Tom Buckhannon's back. That's only the beginning it gets much more interesting from there.Personally I didn't like this book, because its just not the type of book I like to read. I think that over all the entire book was interesting and had a good plot. However I couldn't familiarize myself with the characters. I didn't really understand were they were coming from or why they did certain things. For example I never understood why Mr. Gatsby threw big parties because he was always quite and no one really knew who he was or where he came from. Also I didn't like that the author only described the characters once. It was hard to get a mental picture of what the characters looked like. The author also introduces new characters more than halfway into the book and I didn't really know who they were. I started to get confused with the characters. For example the author introduces a man named Michaelis for about 15 pages and then he is gone from the book.

I was assigned F. Scott Fitzgerald's &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; in grade 11. And after reading it over, I concluded that if Mr. Fitzgerald's personality was reflected in his characters, it is quite understandable that Zelda Fitzgerald ended up in an asylum (sp?). That book was the poorest excuse for literature I ever had the displeasure of reading. I did read it twice, but each time, I was disgusted with it. The characters in the story were worthless wastes of human flesh. Daisy was a ditz, Gatsby himself was a possessive stalker and everyone else didn't have enough brains to realize that they were all being used!!Tom, Daisy's idiot husband, actually took Nick to meet Tom's mistress! How much more stupid is that? Yes, I'm sure everyone with a brain cell wants his wife's family to know he's having an affair. And his mistress, well, all she wanted was to seem important, when everyone knew she wasn't.Nick was used by everyone, but he did nothing about it. Tom used him, Daisy used him and even Gatsby used him. And all the while, he thought Gatsby was God. He worshiped him.I wrote my report on the novel and passed it into my professor. I wish I still had a copy of it, because I would post it here. Unfortuneatly, I do not.In the end, I would recommend this book only to the person who likes to read about stupid people sleeping with each other just to seem important.

But crimony. Read the thing. I've read the thing. I don't understand what the big deal is about. This isn't good prose. It's self-help. It's also pretty insulting. How agonizingly elementary does symbolism have to be before a reader realizes that the author has taken him for a fool? Fitzgerald writes with all the subtlety of a locomotive. He sounds like he's trying way too hard, and in the end, what was intended as verbal sweep and style reads as tackiness. &quot;Gatsby&quot; is the work of a bad juggler--it would have been so much better if he'd tried fewer balls. (If you want to see a man drop twenty metaphors on a page and actually get away with it, thanks to God-given writing genius, read Shakespeare or Robert Penn Warren's &quot;All the King's Men.&quot;)What we have here is a book that for some strange reason has been ranked for all time with &quot;The Sun Also Rises,&quot; &quot;The Sound and the Fury,&quot; and &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; I think it's enough to acknowledge that Hemingway, Faulkner, and Steinbeck weren't the only American writers of their day--there was also a lightweight pretender named F.

The Great Gatsby provided a nice window for looking at the pre-depression era of the 1920s lifestyle on the east coast, and also portrayed a vibrant narrative of a love-stricken psychotic fool within all of us given the right circumstances.

I have no sympathy for Jay Gatsby and in my opinion all the characters in this book are arrogant, rich stuck up snobs, who have nothing better to do than be caught up in the cruel pettiness of their own lives.Perhaps I am giving my review of this book too much of a Marxist slant, it is possible that someone else may become more emotionally involved in this novel than I did.

Nick has a cousin, Daisy Buchanan, who he goes visits and meets her husband Tom along with beautiful Jordan Baker. Every night Nick is amazed to see his neighbors' popularity and hear about his infamous parties. One night, he is surprised to find out the Gatsby has personally invited him to one of his entertaining parties. After going to Gatsby's parties many nights he was unsuccessful at meeting him until one night he sparks an interesting conversation with a young man who turns out to be Jay Gatsby. One afternoon Nick had lunch with Miss. Baker who admits to him that Gatsby is in love with his cousin Daisy. Gatsby's intension was to confess his long lost love to Daisy and win her over like he had done five years before. After Gatsby's reunites with Daisy they decide to proclaim their love to Tom, but obstacles keep them from being together.In this book there are many themes that coincide to make an interesting story that turns out to be a tragedy. Love, greed, money, ambition, jealousy, and betrayal are all human attributes that are subtly sporadic throughout the novel. Gatsby represented money and ambition and determination along with love while the woman he loved represented greed and betrayal. Gatsby did everything in his power to get his love while Daisy was undetermined to what she wanted and whom she truly loved. The love interest between Nick and Miss. Baker ends in a unsettled dispute because of betrayal and jealousy. All the characters in the Great Gatsby are tied to these rudiments in one form or the other.These elements combined gave The Great Gatsby a great ending and made reading it worth while. Although extremely slow paced in the beginning for my taste, I was intrigued by about page 100, it satisfied me by the end. It was a surprising tragic ending that made every boring page before was worth reading. Ever since I started high school I had heard about this book and it's elegant style of the 1920's, I was extremely disappointed when I started reading it because it was nothing what it was hyped up to be. I gave the reading 3 stars because half of the book was extremely boring to me but the other half was extremely well written and thought out. I would recommend this book to any one of my friends if they have the patience to a slow start but a great ending."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I read this book only because I had to for a literature class...this book may be good for some. I have to talked with friends and things that have said that they enjoy it, however I had a hard time getting into it!However a side from all of that! It gives a great depiction of the Rolling 20's and the shallowness of all people. I would recomend it to someone who loves to read about 10 books a week and wouldn't mind wasting their time to read one more. But as for me I didn't care for it!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I am not certain why this book is considered a classic. There's not one likeable character to relate to. Selfish, self-involved, shallow people. The first half was rough going to read through. The second half, a little better. I found this very disappointing after hearing for so long that it was a must-read. So many other more special books to spend one's time with."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is the unfortunate case of the reputation making the novel, rather than the other way around. I found \\"the Great Gatsby\\" very dissapointing. Its said to be the greatest American novel of all time, yet I found it largely uninteresting and poorly written (in light of its reputation, that is). The characters are not dymanic, and the novel's apparent focus -- that the wealthy, petty, aloof inhabitants of both East and West Egg are interchangeable -- is made evident during the first chapter. The novel centers on a host of blase characters - Gatsby chief among them -- whose lavish parties are attended by strangers, and whose funerals are attended by nobody.This is not the \\"Great American Novel\\" - actually, its far too short to qualify as a NOVEL. Novella, maybe. Limerick, more like it. only limericks are at least amusing.Theme One: Old money, new money, the perceived difference in the have's and have more's. Whether East Egg, West Egg or Fried Egg, its nothing more than a distinction without difference. I found the same message in Dr. Seusss's story of the Sneeches - and at least that rhymed.Theme 2: You can't escape the past. Thanks, Nostradummy. The past repeats itself. Much like Fitzgerald's tired themes and characters.Theme 3: Love = jealousy. There is no great romance here. This much is evident when Gatsby admits to Daisy that it is not her love that he desires, but for to have loved no other, even in the past. The much-lauded green light at the end of the dock? Just another symbol of petty jealousy, not the sign of \\"hope\\" as some commentators believe.But is not the bland characters that make this novel unworthy of its reputation; it is the fact that the characters are fully fleshed out by page 20, and remain static throughout the remainder of the novel. Read Dr. Seuss instead. You'll read the same themes in the same amount of time, and if you're going to write on the level of a 6-year-old, you may as well do it intentionally."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great GatsbyPublished in 1925, The Great Gatsby had a certain amount of success, fulfilling F. Scott Fitzgerald's expectations and promoting an authorial pride within him. Years later, while being read by a different generation, Fitzgerald's novel exclaims a different effect. With a tense plot and extreme characters, The Great Gatsby produces a complete grip upon its readers but as the character moves through his summer complications, one can witness Fitzgerald's desperation to create a novel.Set in Long Island, New York, F. Scott introduces a decent but uninteresting man, Nick Caraway, who decides to visit a second cousin but instead, becomes entangled in the past, present and future interactions of this woman's life. By not emphasizing Nick's personality, Fitzgerald helps the reader to focus on everyone else's. The second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, endures a pressured marriage as he commits adultery. Aware of her husband's disloyalty, Daisy only bothers to disguise her knowing. This opens the novel to theories of immoral behaviour and irony. For Nick's neighbour, Jay Gatsby, happens to be the past love of Daisy and is set on returning her to himself. F. Scott. gives his title character an obsessive yet submissive personality that revolves around Mrs. Buchanan. At certain points within the novel, this can become an annoyance. Gatsby's persistence on obtaining Daisy's affection only causes him damage. Such a plot can induce a reaction from the reader which deserves some praise until Fitzgerald forgets to place a period.Eventually the novel climaxes with tension and complication. Had Fitzgerald not involved such a tense plot with his writing, the novel would've been an actual bore. His constant babbling and unnecessary explanations can lead one into a deep sleep. Though he was unable to write without ranting on, Fitzgerald does deserve to be complimented on his diversion of personality and East Egg versus West Egg (old rich vs. new) dilemma; a diversion from the all too cliched rich vs. poor. Unfortunately the ending suffers most because it was too verbose. Fitzgerald leaves no suspense, which to some can be a good thing, but it takes too long to get to the results of the climactic events, thus one slowly becomes disappointed.The Great Gatsby is an otherwise decent novel; not to be called a great American classic, rather a book good when produced during its time. Fitzgerald had struggled in his production and caused ruin to the word format. His ideas, however, were of good enough quality, maybe what suffices for it to be called a great novel; then again, Bukowski also holds that title."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Off the top, i have to admit that i started this book last summer, found it very dry, and gave up before the end of the first chapter. i have never done this before but at the time i was sure that &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was just not the book for me. Then i was asked to read it for my english class at school, so, i started again still convinced i would never reach the end. The beginning i found to be quite slow abd the overall plot never reaching a point of greatness. Even thouhgh this was not my favourite novel, i found something that i did enjoy. F.Scott Fitzgerald's style of writing cauhgt my attention on a number of occasions. He used a great deal of well placed symbolism in forms fo location, colours, the time period and also names. i am sure that a lot of thought nust have gone into this book before writing it. Fitzgerald did an excellent job of giving evreything a significant meaning, but he could have added his &quot;special tough&quot; to the situations throughout. This is a book recommended for those who enjoy a simple plot and the search for a deeper meaning."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald captures Americas &quot;roaring twenties&quot; with great detail in this classic novel. The story takes many twists and turns and keeps the reader in the dark about Gatsby. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read an American masterpiece."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I currently finished reading the novel The Great Gatsby for the first time. I found it to be a novel which opened my eyes and made me realize the kind of society we are living in. With all of the friends Gatsby has, very few payed respect to him. Is that what society is coming to? Don't get me wrong, I was extremly confused during the first few chapters of the novel but don't give up, keep reading. After you have finished the book, go back to the first few chapters and read through them, everything will tie together. With a little help from a teacher I was able to appreciate the novel more. Read it once, twice and then a third time. You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is an incredible book and is truly a classic. It starts out slow and then the action hits you like a cannon ball. Fitzgerald's themes and characterization are remarkable. The emotion felt reading the book is overwhelming. Fitzgerald offers a unique view on life and society. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who is a romantic or who wants to reevaluate life."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book is great. I saw the movie in my 20th Century American Literature class last year as well as reading it over the summer for my AP English class. The two are not even close to being the same. At first I didn't know what to think of the book, it was strange and confusing and then it was romantic. Over all it was a very emotional book for me. After reading the book I did a research project for the book. I discovered that this book is so similar to Fitzgerald's life. He reminded me of each one of the male characters in some sort of way. Tom had the affair just as he(Fitzgerald) did. Gatsby felt left out at all the infamous parties just as Fitzgerald did. This book is definetly worthy of reading! I suggest it to all!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby's deceptively ephemeral story is not so much the deserved masterpiece of one of our most gifted writers as it is the stunning illusion of a great magician. In that, it is a literary portal that allows us to peer into the narrow lives of a small band of the bored and privileged. It is both a metaphor of its age and an uncanny prognostication of our current malaise. So where's the magic? When one steps back from the book, there's no plot, the characters are rather bland, they don't do anything particularly interesting, and what they do accomplish in the very short timespan we spend with them is so trivial or mean that we are left wondering why we enjoyed the book so much. The answer lies in the fact that magic is never about the rabbit; rather, it is about the empty hat. Fitzgerald The Great's magic wand is the English language, his scarf the shadows cast by limelight, and we, his vaudville audience in our straw hats and bowlers, are mesmerized by his amazing show."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Upon reading The Great Gatsby, I loved it! I was forced to read it for my AP English class, and don't regret it one bit! Fitzgerald has a way of drawing you into the book, so that you can't seem to put it down! My emotions were constantly changing...anger when I learned of Tom's affair, mystery of the man known as Gatsby (before he is introduced by Nick), and hope when it seems that Nick and Jordan might just hit it off. It seemed a bit strange that you never really know how Daisy is feeling, but Fitzgerald obviously wanted it that way. Once I learned how much the book really related to his [Fitzgerald's] life, it took on a whole new meaning...in my opinion fulfilling the comment that it's his greatest work ever. I recommend this book to all! Two thumbs up!!!!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Truly outstanding. Memorable in many ways: characters, symbolism, writing style. While this book isn't as memorable to me as Lord of the Rings, because I read this at an older age and it didn't effect my life in the same way, there are no books BETTER than this. If you have any hesitations, read it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I'd like to emphasize that The Great Gatsby is not the best or greatest American Novel, but that it is a perfect one. Contradiction? Not really, because The Great Gatsby completely encapsulates what it is like to be American, particularly in the 1920s. It perfectly illustrates all the qualities that people fear and admire in the American people: ambition, power, privilege. Its flaws don't qualify it as the &quot;greatest,&quot; but it is still pretty amazing! A lot of reviewers dissed this novel because of the &quot;ordinary&quot; plot, supposedly reminiscent of a soap opera. Well, where do you think all those soap operas (and movies, etc.) got their plots from? For better or worse, Fitzgerald and his contemporaries recreated the modern novel, just as Shakespeare (another high school nemesis, I'm sure) recreated theatre. Without Fitzgerald, we wouldn't have Douglas Coupland, or Jack Kerouac, or a host of other writers who, directly or indirectly, were influenced by Fitzgerald's clear writing, time-line crossing, sense of emotion. Granted, many inferior writers (like the soap opera ones, and by the way, how do you know soap opera plots, anyway?) have taken Fitzgerald's innovations and created awful versions. But what can you do? Originals always spawn copies."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald did with Great Gatsby in literature what Orson Welles did with Citizen Kane in film: he made something sweet and sublime and simple and complex and brilliant. Fitzgerald effectively describes with a few words what other authors would squander pages on, and his prose still manages to be smooth and flowing. And what's not to understand? The love, the murder, the partying? You can find the same things at your average weekend kegger. The difference is, in THe Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald shows the American people for what they were, and still are today- greedy excessive, and self-centered. Which is why Gatsby is still a great novel."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgeralsssd's The Great Gatsby is a commentary on the human pysche. What reasonable man would host expensive parties for an extended period of time, in the hopes a woman would hear about it and come? Did Gatsby need a shrink? I think so. I know that love will make you do strange things, but after Daisy ran over the woman in the road and insisted on going to her own home instead of Gatsby's, my man should have cut his losses. Gatsby vowed to take the blame for the hit-and-run, waiting in the pool for Daisy to call. Had he not met Daisy as a young man, what would he have lived for? It was sad to see someone's life so empty."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a complicated tale comprised of many themes which are all linked together in a very clever fashion. Nick Carraway is the title character, who is from Minnesota. The setting is the 1920s, and Nick has just moved East, to Long Island. His neighbor is man by the name Jay Gatsby, but as he later finds out, that name is false. Although Nick lives in the West Egg, his friends live in the higher-class East Egg. Daisy, his cousin, lives with her husband there. Nick discovers that Tom, Daisy's husband, is cheating on her, with a woman across town, Myrtle. Both Myrtle's husband and Daisy know nothing of the affair. Nick meets Jordan Baker via Tom and Daisy, and they have an intimate relationship. As the story progresses, more information is revealed about Gatsby, and how he knew Daisy from a long time ago. In fact the sole reason that he moved to New York was to be near Daisy. Gatsby's complex emotions are that of a man who obsesses with power and wealth. His vision is to achieve power and wealth, which he has done illegally, and to achieve Daisy, who symbolizes power and wealth. Tom finds out about Gatsby's affair with his wife and asserts himself; Daisy does go back with Tom. While Daisy was driving home with Gatsby, she ran down and killed Myrtle, her husband's lover. Gatsby took the rap for her, as he still loved her. Myrtle's husband got word of who made him a widower and then tracked down Gatsby and shot him. He also killed himself. Nick tried to hold a funeral for Gatsby, but hardly anyone attended. Thus, he realized that New York was no place for him and moved back to Minnesota.\\\\The most prevalent theme present in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is: \\"The grass isn't always greener on the other side.\\" Nick moved to Long Island in hopes of getting rich. However, he couldn't see past the mask of fame and fortune to the low level of morality. In the end, he realized that he would rather live a simple, honest life than get tangled up in a web of deceit in New York. This idea is enough to make anyone think, and so did I. I have always thought it would be cool to live in an extravagant life in a big city. Being from a rural Midwest town, such as Nick and Gatsby, I often ponder the opposite lifestyle. However, like the characters in the book, I am not sure that I could sacrafice my morals an honesty just for a mansion, a BMW, and a yacht. At first thought, I would say that, \\"yeah,\\" I could do without to get ahead, but after analyzing it, I bet I probably couldn't. This type of situation involving \\"the American Dream,\\" really does depend on the strength of the person who is put into it. In the case of Gatsby and Nick Carraway, they could not handle it.When looking at the \\"The Great Gatsby\\" for the first time, the reader does not know that the title is actually quite ironic. Gatsby was acutally the opposite of great. He lied about his past to almost everyone he met, he changed his name, and he became a criminal just to get ahead. This is not a person who is great. Contradictorily, he was great in the eyes of the people who perceived him. Even Nick, who knew the whole story, still had a feeling of respect and liking towards Gatsby after his death. The ending was good in that it reflected the themes of the book. It was fairly complex and complicated, but it did finalize the story.I would recommend this book to more advanced readers. It contains a heavier vocabulary, and the theme are presented somewhat abstractly, but the story is great. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a classic book, and no one has an excuse not to read it. It really is an excellent story."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I first read this novel in high school. I found it slow, the characterizations fuzzy, and the plot uninvolving. Recently, I came across a copy that my stepdaughter had been required to read in high school. I decided to try it again.It is, of course, quite wonderful. Magical, Keatsian prose; masterful management of a complex narrative structure: wonderful impressionistic characterizations (The women are especially vivid.)

While I may not enjoy the plot, it is realistic and brings across the point of the book- to show how many americans had begun to veiw the world. While the bleak ending may not be my cup of tea, it was the way the story had to conclude. A happy ending would not have been a natural ending to the story. The Great Gatsby was one of the first books of its kind.

And, after reading the short but incredible novel, I will have to agree with this assertion. The story is vivid and colourful, and the narration truly engages the reader and makes him/her feel that s/he is living the story. You will feel the pain of long lost love, the shallowness of the urban-socialite community, and respect and admiration for an incredibly well written novel.

I had to re-read paragraphs to get a grip on the story a little better but I assume the book reads like that because it was written so long ago using the &quot;language&quot; of that era. I read this along with my daughter as suggested by her English teacher. The book did spark conversation about the early 1900s and some of the &quot;symbolism&quot; in the story, which was enjoyable.

The book in my opinion was not entertaining in its first parts, when the characters are introduced and you begin to know each one of the lives of the different main characters. When I could overtake half of it, my opinion towards the book started changing, because as the different events started to be introduced in the story, I began to involve myself more and more with the book.

Scott Fitzgerald proved that if you only live life for today you won't be able to cope with tomorrow. The book went extremely slow paced in the beginning until I reached 40 pages from the end of it. Fitzgerald did a great job getting the reader into the story. He used so much description and image word choice that I kept half interested. As soon as you get to that one point in the book, it just moves so fast that you can barely keep track of everything happening even. The story is a total depiction of the 1920s with the unsuccessful and unfaithful relationships, the partying that went on constantly, and the unexpected consequences of living life for today. The characters only did what they wanted to make that day the best it could be. They never once thought of what would and/or could have happened to them. They didn't think there was anything wrong with what they were doing. People living in the 1920s didn't believe anything would go wrong in their society, but just look what happened. Can you say, &quot;DEPRESSION?&quot; Depression is not exactly the word I would use to describe what happened to Fitzgerald's characters in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; after their lives backfired.

I'll admit the first couple chapters are boring, but it's worth it if you stick it out!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald, the GREAT GATSBY is a traditional classic. I give the book two thumbs up. The book is about a wealthy, lonely bachelor, who will not rest until he gets the love of his life. The book has a sad ending, but I will leave that for you to read about. The author brilliantly shows how being wealthy doesn't necessarily make you happy. Wealth can bring about isolation, and lonliness. The morality of the story refects very heavily on society today. People are always criticizing the wealthy instead of congratulating them for their accomplishments. This book gives great insight on the &quot;snobby&quot; rich, and the &quot;down to earth&quot; rich individuals. Once again I highly recommend this novel and I really hope you like it. And if you don't like it, then I don't know whats wrong with you."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby was one of the greatest novels ever written. The way that F.

Gatsby learned that the hard way. If your into drama, action, and romance please read this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is the first novel I have read by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and I really enjoyed it, although the story was sad. I liked how he wrote the story from the observations of a neighbor. I like the way he wrote the novel. I could picture some of the events and conversations taking place. This novel painted a picture that seemed more real to me than many other novels I have read. The plot was also good.What happened? Nick Carraway was the neighbor to Jay Gatsby. Gatsby owns a large house and throws extravegant parties. His ambition is to have his former love, who is now married, attend one of his parties, and so renew their former relationship. The women Gatsby loved has an unfaithful husband and some of the novel deals with his mistress. There are also many twists in the novel, that kept me interested and allowed me to finish the book in one night. I encourage you to read this book. It is not long and is very well written."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's later novels symbolize decadence, expatriate hedonism, and excess. His first novel, This Side of Paradise, tells a story (rather biographical) of a hopeful young man in college, on the verge of transcendence and moral epiphany. One might conclude that something happened along the way, that, how could an author, so interested in classical morality, come to end writing about rich drunks living in Europe.The Great Gatsby fills in such disparity, as if Fitzgerald himself learned the lesson that all readers learn, in writing this gloriously sad and righteous book. Perhaps it was impossible to take any hero seriously, after creating Jay Gatsby.Jay Gatsby loves without judgment, without conquest or need. The sad irony is that the object of such noble sentiment is a shallow yet benign Daisy, a lethargic, bored, and wealthy philistine. Gatsby is not a wise hero, otherwise this novel would be pedantic and obvious. Gatsby shares the shallowness of modern society, and its belief system of material possession. Gatsby is, simply put, \`unaffected', pure, a blind unabashed dreamer.

Scott Fitzgerald's later novels symbolize decadence, expatriate hedonism, and excess. His first novel, This Side of Paradise, tells a story (rather biographical) of a hopeful young man in college, on the verge of transcendence and moral epiphany. One might conclude that something happened along the way, that, how could an author, so interested in classical morality, come to end writing about rich drunks living in Europe.The Great Gatsby fills in such disparity, as if Fitzgerald himself learned the lesson that all readers learn, in writing this gloriously sad and righteous book. Perhaps it was impossible to take any hero seriously, after creating Jay Gatsby.Jay Gatsby loves without judgment, without conquest or need. The sad irony is that the object of such noble sentiment is a shallow yet benign Daisy, a lethargic, bored, and wealthy philistine. Gatsby is not a wise hero, otherwise this novel would be pedantic and obvious. Gatsby shares the shallowness of modern society, and its belief system of material possession. Gatsby is, simply put, \`unaffected', pure, a blind unabashed dreamer. Jay and his friends, all rather crass and shallow except for our narrator and moral moderator, Nick Calloway, go back and forth between cocktail parties, driving under T.J Eckleberg's Eyes, an abandoned billboard optometry advertisement. Themes of T.S. Eliot's hauntingly prophetic Wasteland are echoed.

Other works in this same category include Invisible Man, anything by Dostoyevsky, anything by Tolstoy... well you get the idea.Gatsby, with its tight almost terse language, complex relationships, and subtle imagery places it among the great works of American literature. Its subject, wanting and loss, are feelings with which Fitzgerald was intimately familiar. Tragically, many people were turned off to this work as teens when they could not yet understand its multi layered emotional landscape. Hopefully, some of them return to the book as adults so that they can experience a real reading pleasure. Fitzgerald died young, but he left the world a master work."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"A great read! If you love the roaring 20's or just a good flowing novel read this.It is one of those books that you just can't put down. F. Scott Fitgerald makes you want to finish the book in one night, you want to know what happens next.If you don't know much about the author, you will after reading this book. He incorparated so much of his life into this story. That was what made me so interested.I think it is a must read, especially if you keep hearing good things about it like i do. Pick it up!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I wanted to start reading this book because I kept hearing about how good it was and all. And sure enough after reading it I thought it was more than great it was awsome! The characters are so real and unique. And its very exciting to read at well. I thought that last few pages of the book were so beutifuly wrriten. The ending is very sad and I just dont know what kind of mind would write something like that. But it was a really great book. After reading it I went out and rented Robert Redfords version of the movie. I found that the book was much better than the movie as most of you other reviewers say and it is very true."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Perhaps the reason that no film adaptation of Gatsby has been well-received is that no director could possibly compete with the pictures Fitzgerald paints in the reader's mind. If you haven't already, read this and lose yourself in this Jazz age Greek tragedy. And enjoy the movie in your mind."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It was at least four decades ago that I first read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald.I must confess it was a greater pleasure this time as an elective, rather than required reading.It is beautifully plotted and full of lyrical writing, intriguing dialogue and extremely rich and fully developed characters.The reader is magically transported into the Jazz Age by first person narrator Nick Carraway.The feature players Jay Gatsby, Tom and Daisy Buchanan and Jordan Baker are involved in a mystery comprising greed, ambition, and a love triangle.It truly is a novel whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts.Absolutely a classic.Reward yourself by reading or rereading \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" It is time well spent."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby starts off as kind of a boring book, book but it ends up being a good book. The story starts off slowly, but has a lot of plot to make you want to keep reading. The story is interesting because the whole picture comes together as you read. The story is a bit complicated if you skim through it, so it is a book you have to read in its entirety in order to understand the stories plot twists and to understand the characters. The characters way of speaking gives the book its early 1900's feel, and the clothes they wear also help. The book is in a way a love story, and is the focus, but there is a lot more than just the focus on Gatsby wanting to be with Daisy. There are the relationships between Daisy and Tom, Tom and Myrtle, and the relationship between Myrtle and George. These relationships create examples of the characters are, conflict, and plot in the story are shown through dioulouge and situations. Example for showing that Tom was a violent person was when Myrtle shouted the name of his wife,\\"Daisy, Daisy, Daisy!\\" Tom hits Myrtle in the face and breaks her nose.Why I recommend this book be because it is an interesting story. It's interesting in the way that truth slowly surfaces throughout the book. The story about Gatsby and who he really is makes you want to keep reading, and also to see if he achieves his goal. The book successfully covers how Gatsby uses the American Dream, power and money, to try and achieve his goal of winning back Daisy. The way Gatsby gets his power and money, bootlegging alcohol, fits in perfect due to the time period that the story takes place because there is a prohibition going on.One thing I didn't like about the book is that the book is very detailed, especially about the characheters. I found it difficult to come back to the book after not reading it for a week. I went back several times to remember the story and recent developments. Other than that one minor difficulty the book is very good and is recommended."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald's most notable work, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; defined a generation; that of the Jazz Age (1920's upper-crust America). Told in first-person through the young, middle-class metaphor Nick Carraway, the story has one of the most overarching themes I have ever encountered. On one level a tragic love triangle between Daisy Buchanan, Tom Miller, and Jay Gatsby. On another, it tells the story of New York's middle- and upper-classes, and the aftereffects of a lavish lifestyle on both societies.The narrative unfolds in a straightforward manner, and the language is beautiful, the prose intricately crafted with the care of a master gardener.The novel also touches briefly on the theme of war as well; Gatsby returns to find his idea of feminine perfection, Daisy, has married the bellicose Tom Buchanan. Gatsby becomes infatuated with the acquisition of wealth, material possessions and appearances the centerpoint of his existence. Which makes his ending all the more powerful; in the end, Gatsby is undone by his greed and egocentrism.There is much, much more to the book--including the character of Jordan Baker, the significance of Gatsby's surname, and Meyer Wolfsheim--but there is not nearly enough space to discuss this masterpiece of American Literature.Yes, it has been the hallmark of high school English classes, but that should not be it's grave; indeed, it is the foundation of modern literature and the defining moment for an entire generation."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is a well written novel that portrays life in the 1920s in America. It reveals many of the dishonest motivators present in that time period and also present in today's society. Some of these motivators are lust, greed, money, and love. Fitzgerald causes the readed to reflect on how ethical these influencers are. This is a very worth while book to read. It caused me to question what motivates me in my own life. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Yes, The Great Gatsby is a true classic. It is such a beautiful little novel, and its themes transcend the century.Most people know the story. Nick, who narrates, has just moved to New York, and his life becomes entangled with that of his mysterious neighbor, the rich, self-made Jay Gatsby. Jay Gatsby is in love with Daisy Buchanan, Nick's cousin, who is married to Tom Buchanan. The plot follows the telling events that take place between this small group of the Jazz Age elite.The entire novel is so exquisitely constructed. The prose is beautiful, the plot is an emotionally moving degenerative tragedy, and the symbols are intricately woven in to deftly illustrate the theme. And that theme is so relevant as Fitzgerald laments over the fall of the American Dream. He reveals the wasteland that is, the America made hollow by the embrace of materialism and a set of false ideals to adhere to their materialistic longings. There is so much that Fitzgerald says, and reading the work, one feels that the Jazz Age has yet to end. We are still reeling in the languish Fitzgerald described."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"and I stayed up crying for hours after the ending!

If you want an example of excellent literature, this is it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"During the hedonistic go-go years following the end of the First World War, F. Scott Fitzgerald was plainly alarmed by the cultural and financial excesses that marked America's new and what was for him, a perverted interest in the historically rooted American dream. In this dream, begun by Ben Franklin in his autobiography, he lists, as does Jay Gatsby in THE GREAT GATSBY, a shopping list of virtues whose goal it is to inculcate those values that both Franklin and Gatsby thought would lead to material success. The difference between Ben Franklin and Jay Gatsby has more to say about the use of those virtues than their origin. With Gatsby, the American Dream is not simply pulling himself up by his bootstraps from poverty to riches, but in his warped vision of that dream, Gatsby symbolizes what can go wrong when any upwardly mobile American allows another to recast that dream according to the competing dreams of another.Gatsby believes that he loves the incredibly alluring Daisy Fay, a teenage society deb--beautiful, sexy, elegant--whom he sees as the ultimate goal for his life. They meet, they fall in love (or do they? This is arguable) and they break up because Gatsby is too poor for her to marry. Up to the point that they meet, Gatsby is pursuing the Franklinian version of the American ideal, which can be summed up as hard work + true grit = material success. Gatsby wants success, but he wants it for himself. After meeting and being rejected by Daisy, Gatsby now sees his dream as the means to achieve a higher dream: securing the affections of a woman whose limitations in taste and fidelity were obvious to all but him. During the years of their separation, Gatsby worked hard to build his criminal empire that brought him the money and possessions that he truly saw as the missing variable in the romantic equation that would convince Daisy to be by his side. Gatsby is wrong is so many ways that the reader is not sure whether to laugh at him for his emotional myopia or to pity him for the same reason.Those critics who analyze Gatsby's role in the perversion of the American dream tend to focus on the Gatsby side of the equation, yet to understand the inner tragedy of this dream's deconstruction, one must also examine Daisy's role. Exactly who is this Daisy Fay? To begin with, consider her last name, which is an aberrant spelling of 'fey,' which means a doomed vision. Those who connect with her, both Gatsby and her brute husband Tom, are doomed to a life of trying to relate to a woman who cannot return basic human kindness. Daisy is shallow, frivolous, and easily impressed by the very qualities that Tom showers her with (a $350,000 ring) and Gatsby shows her (those silk shirts that cause her to weep). It is almost as if Daisy is auctioning herself off to the highest bidder. Daisy's dream is the flipside of Franklin's. She wants the rewards of hard work without incurring the demands of the work itself. In the collision between these contrasting dreams, it comes as no surprise that buried somewhere in Daisy's soul is just enough of a link to harsh reality to remind her that Tom, despite his affairs and animalistic nature, is still preferable to a Gatsby, who offers only the illusion, not the reality of love. When Nick tells Gatsby that the past cannot be reborn and reshaped into a present more to his liking, Gatsby stuns both Nick and the reader by saying, \\"Of course it can.\\" Gatsby's entire life and by extension his dream of success that is to include the questionable charms of Daisy, is seen as so flawed that whenever his dream meets a competing dream that has at least some root in reality, his dream of a green light that can blink into any color he wants will crash into a tragedy that resounds even today."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Although I am not exactly old enough to read some of the other classics, The Great Gatsby is my favorite book of all time. Its plot is tightly knit, so when Fitzgerald goes out on what seems to be a tanget, he knits it back into the story miraculously. Gatsby himself is one, if not the, most memorable charater in all of literature.The Great Gatsby has it all- drama, suspense, irony, romance, and comedy. The reader can see how the past affects the future and how amazing and sometimes foolish human nature can be."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"'The Great Gatsby' is the best book I've ever read.

Fitzgerald's words flow off the page seemingly effortlessly.'Gatsby' is the story of a man, Gatsby, who never gives up his love for a woman, Daisy. It is narrated by Gatsby's neighbor and Daisy's relative Nick. Other colorful characters weave their way in and out of the story.

Whether in business, science, athletics or world affairs, Americans imagine and seek the best. Though we often stumble and fall short; though we often cut corners to achieve our dreams - striving for greatness is the essence of America. In Gatsby, we feel what it is like to want something so badly, to succeed in reaching it and to ultimately fail. How many of us have not shared these experiences in some way or another? American writings today, such as David Ebershoff's Pasadena (2002) and Scott Gaille's The Law Review (2002), continue to explore Gatsby's central theme of obsession with greatness.

I had not realized at the time that this is considered an important piece of American literature. However it is a charming and well crafted work of art that deserves recognition.

Great plot, interesting characters, I just wish the book could be longer and more in depth."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Not being American, I never studied this book in high school. Which was probably just as well. Because like the vast of majority of the classics of English language literature, such a book is way beyond the comprehension of the twentieth or twenty first century teenager. And so, a complete waste of a good book. After only a brief look at reviews of this novel on Good Reads or Amazon it is glaringly obvious that readers either passionately adore it or hate it with a frightening fervour - and for most it was compulsory school reading. Now take a look at the trailer for the Baz Luhrmann film due to be released in May of this year. It brings the novel to life in such a way that no high school English teacher could ever have done! And perhaps nowadays that is how we perceive a 'Classic' novel such as this. Filmed five times previously only shows how truly timeless the novel is, and how each generation tweaks it for current relevance.This novel is so timeless it has been compared to a Greek tragedy with its classic love triangle - Gatsby, Daisy and Tom; secondary but essential characters who tip the balance into madness - George and Myrtle Wilson; and the Chorus - Nick Carraway who is a distant cousin of Daisy and becomes Gatsby's neighbour for the summer. Into this mix are thrown and stirred the greed, ambition and hedonism of the very rich in 1920s America. And above all perhaps boredom - these people have so little point to their lives, are so self absorbed, and have so little purpose that it is no wonder trouble results. Be careful what you wish for...There is little point in doing a plot summary as the story is so well known and the plot is so accessible via the Net. But you don't read a book just for the plot. At just 190 pages, this is a short 'Classic' read, written with such vividness you can feel the heat of the New York summer, the cool lushness of Long Island, the despair in Gatsby's heart, the emptiness in Daisy. With the doorstops that nowadays pass for 'Classic' novels, it is a true joy to read something written with such finesse and restraint. It may not be rewarding reading for a teenager but for an adult, most definitely."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I decided to read this in preparation for the movie, and I have to say it was great.

A generation of readers have explored only the most topical of its themes, the symbolism of the green light, the excesses of the Jazz Age, the positioning of the narrator. To students of serious literature, The Great Gatsby is seen as more of an introduction than an immersion. A excellent book by a gifted, yet misguided writer. Nothing more.However, Fitzgerald proves more adept than thought. By the magical end of the novel, his topical Jazz Age themes grow into ruminations on the importance of money and love and the dissapation of the American Dream. The characters transform from stereotypical players in a fable to archetypal representatives of human fraility. The structure, despite the shortness of the novel, is compelling. Nine distinct scenes flow and weave together effortlessly through narrative and flashback. The chronological discrepencies drift away; just as Fitzgerald's prose seems to drift in, wondrous and ephemeral.Fitzgerald plays no stylistic gymnastics or ouija board gambits with his novel, and perhaps this is why it often is found lacking in comparison to the works of Faulkner, Joyce, and Hemingway. Fitzgerald did not invent the &quot;iceburg theory&quot; or pen a novel of the length and scope of Ulysses. But, The Great Gatsby possesses the unmistakable qualities of excellence; able to be read in one sitting, it leaves the reader breathless and emotionally spent pondering themes as eloquent as any in literature and as timely today as they were during the Roaring Twenties. Every time the radio blares the Boss and &quot;Glory Days&quot; or Simon and Garfunkel and &quot;Mrs. Robinson,&quot; it echoes the sentiments of Fitzgerald's book. In painting a nation afraid to relinguish its storied past, The Great Gatsby searches for that &quot;one fine morning . . .&quot; when we are able to come to grips with who we were and concentrate on who we are and will become. No other book so wonderfully crystallizes the struggle of man and his infinite ability to dream with the parameters of time. The Great Gatsby is a marvelous achievement; just because you read it as a child, do not hesitate to read it again.

Fitzgerald captures so much of human attitude in his characters and the telling of the story that each reading brings a fresh insight not only to the story, but to its relevancy in the late 20th century.Two particular comments: doesn't it strike you that our current inhabitants of the White House are Daisy and Tom Buchannon? Easy to be friend with, but they are not friends on whom you can rely. They use people not deliberately, one suspects, but rather innocently, as Daisy and Tom do. Though I voted for Bill in primaries and general elections, it's been an interesting revelation to me to see the Buchannons come alive in Whitewater, Paula Jones, personal aides left dangling before committee investigations, and the like.Second comment: this edition is the best I've seen. I purchased it several years ago and Bruccoli's insight is wonderful. After reading his discussion of time and Fitzgerald's use of time tables, time of day (both painstakingly accurate and terribly casual), and even how the chapters in the final version never quite made sense, I enjoyed a stronger sense of the mastery of the work.Enough.

There are other themes and topics in Gatsby: greed, corruption, the Jazz Age, the American Dream gone sadly off course. But the compelling message of Gatsby is the romanticism within us all - that there is an incorruptible truth out there somewhere, if only we can maintain the focus to seek it out and the courage to embrace it when we stumble across its path.

In the novel, Nick Carraway tells the story of his neighbor Jay Gatsby, a handsome bachelor who has amassed a fortune as a racketeer in order to build a Long Island mansion and give fabulous parties that he hopes will enable him to win back the love of the married Daisy Buchanan.This book is a story of the American dream and Fitzgerald's basic belief that the dream has been degraded and corrupted until it almost seems to be foolish to aspire to that dream because it would just make one morally derelict. The lower orders that aspire to infinite and instant wealth are trying to adopt the values and standards of the established rich class, which are already corrupt. Fitzgerald felt that American idealism had been corrupted by embracing materialism as its means. Fitzgerald believed that we are in a vicious circle, that the established wealth is corrupt but the new rich adopt to the same ideals as the old rich and they become corrupt and join the established wealth and then the new group aspires to the established rich values and so on.A strong statement of the author's personal values and beliefs, it is also a highly entertaining read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald is considered to be an important early 20th century American writer. I bought and read Fitzgerald's five major novels (\\"This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and the Damned, The Great Gatsby, Tender is the Night, and The Last Tycoon\\") plus one book of short stories plus the biography \\"Some Sort of Epic Grandeur\\" by Matthew Broccoli.His first major novel, \\"This Side of Paradise,\\" along with \\"Gatsby\\" and \\"Tender is the Night\\" are considered to be great novels, and I enjoyed the reads. The other two have serious flaws. Interestingly, the Bloomsbury Guide does not rate any of the five well known Fitzgerald novels as masterpieces. His best or most complicated work is \\"Tender is the Night,\\" but it is less well known than \\"Gatsby\\" which became a successful film.Fitzgerald wrote about half a dozen novels and over 100 short stories between approximately 1917 and 1940. The short stories were done largely to make money to support his life style. In later years, he worked on a number of Hollywood film scripts. He died poor in Hollywood in 1940 at an age of just 44, leaving an insurance policy as his main asset.Riding on the success of \\"This Side of Paradise,\\" Fitzgerald created the rambling novel \\"The Beautiful and the Damned.\\" That novel has good prose but is a step down from his first novel. It was not a commercial success. Fitzgerald wrote the next novel - \\"Gatsby\\" - with an eye on creating another commercial best seller.\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a much shorter novel than his prior two: just half the length. It is compact, polished, and contains beautiful prose. It is written largely in the first person by a young man who describes the life of his neighbour \\"Gatsby\\" on New York's long Island. It takes place during a warm New York summer, and like many other Fitzgerald works, there is a fascination with wealthy Americans. The story reflects some of the elements of the author's own life, and accordingly the protagonists have advanced in age to people in their twenties and thirties - no longer recent university graduates as in his prior two novels - and they are roughly the same age as the author.This is Fitzgerald's shortest and his most polished novel. Some think it is not as good as the more elaborate \\"Tender is the Night\\" or his breakout novel \\"This Side of Paradise.\\"This is an excellent but short read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"A book I first read as a seventeen year old and revisit with religious like regularity, The Great Gatsby is a flawless diamond that never diminishes in quality and wonder. It's long been an academic staple for its multiple dimensions of genius. Like any literary darling, Gatsby gives the high minded, hegemonic, and painfully over-analytical professor types all the symbolism, theme, and structure they can possibly digest. More importantly, however, for us mere mortals of literary appreciation, is the intensity of the story itself. Unlike other stuffy old books of high literature merit, you'll be quickly and irrevocably engrossed. Fitzgerald's effortless writing and rapturous poetic ability is nothing short of breathtaking; one of those books that need to be accompanied by a highlighter. Truly spectactular.\\"Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.\\""},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's sterling 'The Great Gatsby' (1925) is broadly considered the greatest American work of fiction of the twentieth century; with Twain's 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' (1885), it is one of two viable candidates for the mythic title of the Great American Novel. Coming on the heels of the glib, hilarious 'This Side of Paradise' (1920) and the overextended 'The Beautiful And The Damned' (1922), 'The Great Gatsby' represented both an immense step forward in Fitzgerald's artistry and the kind of achievement only a handful of writers are capable of producing over the course of a lifetime.What makes 'The Great Gatsby' all the more remarkable is the fact that the economically-written novel is built upon a thin, almost predictable plot which concerns itself exclusively with crass, spiritually coarse people.With the exception of hopeful, naive narrator Nick Carraway, almost all of the characters are frayed personalities existing in a depthless, moment to moment world which lacks values, substance, and any inherent quality worth living for.Magnificently wealthy Tom Buchanan is an earthy, brutish man who believes that \\"might makes right,\\" while his attractive wife Daisy is a skittish, shallow, and unintentionally callous woman apt to go with whatever the wind blows her way. Their friend Jordan Baker, a jaded sportswoman with a talent for shrewd social observation, illustrates the novel's cynical view of both humanity and the American way of life. Jay Gatsby, whose flaws are somewhat easier to sympathize with, stands in contrast to these diversion-seeking characters.Gatsby is a delusional man with a benevolent God complex, a manipulative, calculating individual who falteringly believes that the past--and the truth--can be obliterated and permanently transcended by sheer force of will. Unlike the Buchanans and Jordan, Gatsby has more than filled the empty void of the universe with his fantasies of romantic fulfillment. But Tom, Daisy, and Jordan eventually show signs of human feeling and moral awareness, however briefly, while Gatsby, who is also exceedingly wealthy, clearly reflects their superficial vision in some of his own choices, actions, and values.The genius of 'Th'e Great Gatsby' is evident in the manner in which Fitzgerald subtly underscores and illustrates the motivators that drive and define the American psyche. In an America that is both a relatively new country as well as a capitalistic one, Gatsby and Tom are concerned with recreating themselves and achieving self - esteem, social respect, and power through the attainment and maintenance of wealth, the single recognized indicator of success in their world.A distorting-mirror image of the American Dream, 'The Great Gatsby' illustrates how a sincere desire for evolved selfhood can instead devolve into a nightmare scenario of the nouveau riche. To his credit, the pseudo-heroic Gatsby has a larger, if impossibly imagined, goal beyond the accumulation of wealth, property, and friends.The novel is also a meditation on how the American desire to achieve a socially respected, successful identity usually requires moral compromise and a series of carefully - constructed fabrications, which in turn may lead directly to self delusion. Jay Gatsby may be American literature's most famous chameleon, though one ultimately lacking the nimble antisocial personality to successfully pull off his charade.Interestingly, few establishment critics have commented at length on Gatsby's youthful relationship with wealthy, older mentor Dan Cody, a suspect relationship that Nick rightly refers to \\"strange.\\"As a striking but penniless young man, Gatsby has been employed by Cody \\"in a vague personal capacity\\" while he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary and even jailor.\\" Having traveled together three times around the world by yacht, their long idle comes to end when Cody's wife Ella suddenly comes \\"on board\\" and puts a stop to their companionship. Then Cody--bereft of Gatsby's company--suddenly dies.As an adult, Gatsby keeps a portrait of Cody prominently displayed in his mansion, which Nick calls \\"a token of forgotten violence.\\" Is Gatsby, despite his troubadour-like obsession with Daisy, in fact bisexually inclined? Or has his relationship with Cody merely been an opportunistic means to an end? Or one of honest mentoring?When Gatsby invites Daisy to see his palatial estate, Nick is surprised to suddenly come upon Klipspringer, a man Gatsby refers to as his \\"boarder.\\" Klipspringer, who has never previously been mentioned in the narrative and who promptly disappears back to wherever he came from, is discovered \\"in pajamas\\" \\"doing liver exercises on the floor\\" in one of the spare bedrooms. Nick then recalls that he has seen the mysterious Klipspringer \\"wandering hungrily about the beach\\" earlier that morning.During an uncomfortable lapse in conversation, Gatsby lights on the idea of having \\"Klipspringer play the piano,\\" and calls out \\"Ewing!\\" Entering, Klipspringer is described as \\"an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair.\\" Sitting at the piano, Klipspringer plays a song of his own choosing, tellingly called \\"The Love Nest.\\"Fitzgerald makes it evident that Klipspringer is both 'artistic' and subordinate to Gatsby's whims. Curiously, Nick, who is fascinated by the enigmatic Gatsby's motivations, never raises the question of Klipspringer again. Is the fashion conscious, antique-loving Jay Gatsby, like Holden Caulfield, one of American literature's encrypted homosexual figures?In a novel as concerned with questions of identity as this, the Dan Cody and Klipspringer episodes are impossible to overlook and can hardly be accidental. Later in the story, the cuckolded George Wilson says, \\"God sees everything.\\" Is the reader intended to \\"see everything\\" about Gatsby as well? It's worth noting that both of Fitzgerald's previous books feature shrill, effete male characters whose antics border on high camp.Less than hugely successful upon publication, it wasn't until the fifties that 'The Great Gatsby' was fully recognized as the masterpiece it is. Balanced and poetically realized throughout, with 'The Great Gatsby' Fitzgerald mastered the art of revealing the soulful tragedy inherent in both the complex and commonplace members of mankind."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is one of the best books of its time. F. Scott Fitzgerald's tale of American values in the jazz age of the 1920s is one of the great classics of 20th-century literature. The novel is written about Nick Carraway's sum up of his summer in New York where things aren't what they appear to be in the life of luxury. He visits his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom in their lavish home only to discover how unhappy she is. He returns from his visit to his home to see the figure of his mysterious neighbor Jay Gatsby. From that moment, Nick's life became more engaged in Gatsby's life than he could possibly imagine.This novel describes each character with great detail. Detailed facts about each person's personality appeal to a wide variety of readers. This allows them to have a better understanding of the situation they are put through. Readers are able to put themselves in the characters' positions and wonder what they'll do next.The Great Gatsby, however, shatters the American dream. During that time period, people came to America to earn an honest living. While reading through it, it was evident that this idea was shattered by greed. Any person with much wealth gained a great deal of power. For example, Meyer Wolfsheim, a bootlegger and Gatsby's friend, became wealthy by being a criminal. He exclaims about how he fixed the 1919 World Series with the utmost pride. He was capable of such things because of his wealth through illegal activity. Fitzgerald destroyed the vision for the common people.The book is wonderful for a high school level. The classic deals with topics like alcohol that students in the middle school shouldn't be reading. Another topic is that of adultery. Tom Buchanan was having an affair during that story. Elementary school and middle school children might not understand that it's wrong. Beyond the story, the vocabulary and terms used are quite difficult to grasp. Some readers might need a dictionary for a better understanding. This is excellent for study to achieve better word usage.I loved Fitzgerald's style of writing. He describes the time period so well of the Jazz Age. The parties that take place at Gatsby's home are great account of the 1920s. Things were lively and full of entertainment and this novel explains it so well. The setting and environment is brilliant; I'm sure many will love it, too.F. Scott Fitzgerald truly did write a new story that would defy odds of excellence. It's a wonderful book that many enjoy for as long as it is published."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"While Fitzgerald's writing style is wonderful, his colorful descriptions truely being artwork in themselves, the story itself seems lacking. While I understood the concept he was getting at (we read this in English, and we discussed this book until I was sick of it) it still failed to truely interest me. This is a story of the shallow twenties, when the rich threw glamorous parties to flaunt their wealth, and those that went to the parties went to flaunt their own. In the middle of this stands Gatsby, trying to find his lost love, and the narrator, who finds himself drawn up in the relationships between Gatsby and his companions, which rapidly degrade due to Gatsby's delusions of himself and the world around him.I liked what Fitzgerald was getting at, yet the story itself of Gatsby and Daisy and all the rest just bored me. At no point in the story did I care about what happened to any of the characters because, as another reviewer said, they were very shallow, as Fitzgerald may or may not have intended. Overall this is a good book to read for fans of the classics, but for the casual reader, it's probably one to skip over."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald accomplished exactly what he set out to do with this novel. He wrote a simple and beautiful tale about sustaining the American dream.Fitzgerald offers us Jay Gatsby the overly confident, charismatic portrait of excess who falls in love with something beyond his reach, Daisy Buchanan. It is a classic love gone wrong story that embodies itself on the theory that we always want what we cannot have. Once money is added to the calculation the pursuit becomes all the more desperate.This novel is a must read if only for its classic status. It is an easy summer day exploration into the mind of greed, lust and all that it leads to. Fitzgerald managed to write something simple minded with great prose and compassion. But while uncomplicated it is also written with terrific insight questioning the concept of greatness at its very core."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is an highly enjoyable, very rich book. Although the story will not be easy at all times, it is still lyrically and powerfully written. Fitzgerald is at height of his powers in this novel and creates characters that resonate far beyond the page."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"it was a good novel...it drew me into its settings, and it had a good plot, with SOME excellent characters, but i couldn't really connect myself with Gatsby, who was arguably the central character.

It is an easy book to get into, and gets into the plot quite quickly, keeping a perfect pace and suspensefulness, which is an art in itself. great to read for the simple pleasure of reading, but i didn't draw anything out of it, and it didnt haunt me like great novels do. To me it read like a well written magazine article, a pleasure, but not entirely purposeful."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is justly termed one of the greatest literary works of the twentieth century. This relatively short novel is a biting commentary on the nature of class distinctions in American society in the early 1900s. Gatsby, the 'hero,' is an extremely rich man who lives in a mansion and throws extravagant parties. But he has not always been that way. Once he was a pauper.Gatsby is in love with Daisy, a married woman who comes from a wealthy family. Though Gatsby now has money, he has 'new money'--in other words, he has not come from a long line of wealthy individuals. This, in some ways, makes him inferior, at least in the eyes of Daisy and her husband. The power of this novel, the lasting appeal it has, lies in Fitzgerald's poignant commentary on American upper-class mentality.Nick, the narrator, comments that the rich are often \\"careless people,\\" and that they \\"smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back to their money...and let other people clean up the mess they made.\\" What makes Gatsby great is his driving ambition, his burning desire to penetrate the upper social strata and get the heart of the woman he loves.This novel is very tragic, but Gatsby himself seems to be more of a pathetic hero. This is one of the things which gives the novel its appeal, and which makes Gatsby 'great'--he can be seen as the underdog clawing and fighting his way to the top, only to realize he isn't welcome there. Besides being beautifully written, well told, and enjoyable to read, the Great Gatsby has a very important message to convey--sometimes (unfortunately), money IS everything."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It's interesting to notice the one common thread in all of the negative reviews of Gatsby. They all criticize the &quot;lack of action&quot;. It's indicative of the American need for a definite ending, either good has to win, or evil has to win, and the American reader must always be told exactly what is happening in clear omniscient narrative.It's the same with movies. American movies are so packed with effects and plot, there is hardly any room for the viewer to make his own assessment of the nature of the characters. Notice that foreign/Independent American films concentrate on the CHARACTERS, whereas Hollywood studio films concentrate on the PLOT (and usually a few explosions thrown in and some gratuitious sex too).The beauty of this book, as with Fitzgerald's other works, as with Faulkner's works, as with Hemingway's works, lies in the development of the characters... complexity to the point that each reader takes something slightly different from the book, as each reader has had different experiences."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Gatsby is the quintessential American novel for me. It defines American lit. The story itself is intriguing. Fitzgerald's writing is stylized and amazing. It's hard to say anything that hasn't already been said before about this book, but it's definitely one of my favorite all time books."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I've read so much literature in my life and \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is one of the best pieces of American literature I have ever read; it's touching, it's dramatic, and it speaks to people of any background.

Long live Gatsby!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"And so we revisit the official novel of high school English, the only F. Scott Fitzgerald most people will ever read. Does it live up to the hype? It's in the highest category of literature where no book can.The novel concerns a number of extremely rich people, all of whom feel unloved and all of whom are unfulfilled. Through the eyes of Nick Carraway, the main character, we see these characters' destruction like a slow-motion, 180-page train wreck. To a limited degree, the reader is also sucked into this amoral morass.I also note that there are some obvious similarities in the endings between this book and Sunset Boulevard, which was of course written later.Fitzgerald was unquestionably a talented writer, and quite often his imagery and metaphors are excellent. However, here and there the reader gets the feeling that he's trying too hard, as sentences and phrases come across as stilted or contrived.So what does The Great Gatsby do for us today? No real redemption occurs here for any of the characters (this is different from a happy ending; I'm not complaining because it doesn't have a happy ending). Certainly it is a cautionary tale against materialism, but no hope is ever presented for any of the characters.I wanted to bump this to 4 stars/recommended, but I couldn't in good conscience do it.TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"When I read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" a few years ago I confess that I didn't really care for it very much. This summer I gave it another chance, and I'm glad that I did because it has given me a whole new perspective on the classic novel. Reading it as an eighteen-year old, I was annoyed by how the book seems to be a frivolous glimpse into the foibles of frivolous characters living in the fashionable society of 1920s New York. Reading it as a twenty-five year old, however, made me catch on to what those seemingly frivolous characters are meant to represent and how their fates seem to make a bleak statement about the future of the American dream, and of society in general. Other reviews have delved into Gatsby's themes pretty well, so I will spare you from yet another interpretation; what I will implore readers to do is this: for those of you who have disliked Gatsby in the past, give it another chance and look closer this time. You might be surprised by what you see. For those of you who are going to be reading Gatsby for the first time, soak it in - don't just give this book a distracted look-through at the beach. If you don't you may find yourself in the former group a few years down the road. I sure did.Grade: A"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book is a perfect summer read - I know, a bold statement to make about such a classic book. But I discovered The Great Gatsby in the beginning of a lazy, hot summer when I could identify with Fitzgerald's irony and disenchantment with young, wealthy partygoers. The book itself takes place during the summer, and many times throughout the book, the oppressive heat and atmosphere are palpable. I know many people read this book in school on required reading lists, but I invite you to pick it up (again!) and discover it in a new light!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This famous novel mixes a serious critique of the excesses of the 1920's Jazz age with a tragic tale of hypocrisy, jealousy, ambition and greed. Narrator Nick Carraway views his ritzy neighbor Jake Gatsby with a mix of disdain and admiration. Gatsby enjoys the good life of high society parties and fast living, plus pursuing a non-admirable woman (Daisy) who happens to be married. Not surprisingly, events come to a head later in the book. Author F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940) had a strong feel for the excesses and hypocrisy of high society, and one suspects the story's modest anti-Semitism and racism reflect something Fitzgerald both disdained and indulged in. Readers are advised that this book is better understood with a basic knowledge of the 1920's with its booming postwar economy, riches, prohibition, and new inventions.Some say the author was his own Gatsby, a talented young writer with a society wife (Zelda) whose fast living and alcoholism led to an early demise."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"One would have to be rather pedantic not recognize that F. Scott Fitzgerald was an important novelistic voice of the Jazz Age in post World War I America. Certainly nobody has chronicled the end of the age of American innocence signaled by the Jazz Age better than Fitzgerald.Fitzgerald certainly was not the only voice of that age but the voice that best exemplified the tensions between the mores of \`old wealth' and the emerging sources of \`new wealth' that were produced by the huge amount of money available, mainly through government contracts, as result of the war or riches gained through the illegal liquor trade. That is the sociological underpinning that drives Fitzgerald's work.There is no better example of those tensions than Jay Gatsby. If nothing else it is a dramatic enactment of the strivings of the new money to \`make it' in the world of high society, one way or another. And what better way to do that than in the age old tradition of buying one's way into that society through marriage. This is the modern American version of that story.And the story itself? One Jay Gatsby, the former Jimmy Ganz, freshly reinventing himself after indeterminate service in the American military in World War I and loaded with cash from questionable financial resources, attempts to win, or rather re-win the affections of one Daisy Buchanan his vision of the perfect life companion and exemplar of the \`old money' crowd that he wishes to crash. One little complication, however, gets in the way. She has found herself married to a brutish but very wealthy member of that \`old money' crowd. Gatsby's lavish but fumbling attempts to lure her away from the high society of Long Island, then the summer watering hole of the \`old money', forms the core of the story.Gatsby's trial and tribulations on the way as narrated by Nick Carroway (and Gatsby's somewhat unwitting accomplice in the Daisy matter) keeps the story line going until the final deadly ending. The morale- the very rich are indeed very different from you or I. Moreover, someone else will always have to pick up the messes they have made for themselves. They merely move on. This may serve as a cautionary tale for that time and possibly today.A word on literary merits. According to the inevitable changes in literary fashion as well as literary politics Fitzgerald, for long a leading figure in the canon of American literature, has been somewhat eclipsed by other more post-modernist trends. While I firmly believe that the Western canon is in dire need of expansion to include \`third world', woman and minority voices Fitzgerald's literary merits stand on their own. His tightly- crafted story line, his sense of language and the flat-out fact that that he knew the subject matter that formed the basis of his expositions merit renewed consideration by today's reader.Simply put, if you want to understand part of what was going on in America in the 1920's before the Great Crash of 1929 then you simply have to read the man. If nothing else read the last few pages of Gatsby. If there is a better literary expression of the promise of America as seem by the early Dutch settlers of New York as the last best hope of civilization and the failure of that promise at the hands of the \`robber barons' and their descendents I have not read it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I just read this book in English class. I couldn't believe that none of my friends liked it. I thought it was such an intricately-woven story and a biting social commentary. It was so illustrative of 1920s culture and society. Almost every little detail in this book is symbolic of some aspect of someone's personality or past or of human nature in general. I could go on and on about why this book is worthwhile, but I suppose that the main reason is that it's a sad but fascinating story."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"We all are attracted to glamor;some of us live in the past.

Fitzgerald's prose is flawless, arrestingly beautiful at times. This may be a quick, easy read (fewer than 200 pages) but don't be fooled - despite its relatively thin binding, there is a lot going on in The Great Gatsby. This is a complex and tragic novel, ripe with irony.I was surprised to find relatively few reviews posted for this novel (which is widely considered one of the best novels -if not THE best novel- of the 20th Century). I suspect the fact that the novel is something of a \`downer' has thwarted its mass appeal. The Great Gatsby tells us that you can't recapture the past no matter how hard you try, that dreams and aspirations are doomed to failure, and that the morally bankrupt, self indulgent privileged class will inevitably prevail at the expense of others.Despite its grim message, the Great Gatsby is well worth reading (or re-reading if you were forced to read it in high school).

The Great Gatsby is less than 200 pages long in most editions, yet it contains so much of Fitzgerald's outlook on the world around him. The novel's portrayal of the emptiness, brutality and meanness of the \\"Jazz Age\\" has made it one of the most famous English language books of the 20th century. It is so packed with ideas that every reviewer has a different opinion on the themes of the book, as well as the main point. The best thing is to read it for yourself, it only takes a few hours.Essentially the book is about a few meagre happenings narrated by Nick, an outsider to the world of upper class suburban New York. He encounters crime, infidelity, tragedy and an obsessive desire for keeping up pretences; but it is the deeper motivations of characters such as Gatsby, Tom and Daisy that are most fascinating.The book is very visual, possibly because the large number of movies about this era make it easy to visualise the settings in a rich manner. And although it has a sense of nostalgia for the past, I did not find myself nostalgic for the bygone era at all. Fitzgerald pulled one of the great nihilistic pieces of the century."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald had set out write a simple novel depicting the Jazz Age's misinterpreted lifestyles and emptiness. Not only did he complete this task, but he did so within the bounds of a simplistic literary masterpiece.

Spoken in retrospect, we only recieve one view of the people and places described outside of dialogue. This is important in realizing what sort of person Jay Gatsby was, as we only see him through Nick's eyes, he may have established himself as different sort to his other 'friends.'Nick moves himself to West Egg Staton Island after military obligations and into the house neighboring one Jay Gatsby, who shared the ranks with Nick in the first World War. The Great Gatsby throws extravagant parties and rarely do his guest take time to acknowledge their host. Nick finds himself caught in the line of love, when Gatsby reveals his purpose for the house on the sound and the life of parties. They were all a lure, a bait, to bring one Daisy Buchanon to his home. Daisy happens also to be Nick's cousin.

Scott was showing the negative impace of advertising on society. Notice the crime and pain caused by the eyes of the billboard. Perhaps without commercials, we would be a much greater nation. The eyes represented a big brother captalistic attitude surrounding the commercialism with that society.Pay close attention to the symbolism in this work. Thousands of high school students read this each year, oblivious to Fitzgerald's dreary prediction to a marketing society. Sadly, it is these young men and women who make it possible for Britany Spears to sell Pepsi...Commercialism and Fitzgerald make a great paper topic. I ought to know."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"What is there not to be able to say about The Great Gatsby, except that it was a fantastic book. When I first read it, it was for a class assignment, the next couple of times I read it, it was for pure and unadulterated pleasure. I'm not sure it's even legal to fall in love with a piece of literature that isn't a romance novel, nor a sonnet, nor words of love written to you, the way I fell in love with this literary masterpiece. Up until recently, I had forgotten how much of an impact the words within this piece had on my life. And not to say that Gatsby will be that awe-inspiring to everyone who is fortunate enough to pick up this book and begin to read it, but for me, I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. Fitzgerald conveys so many things in this book, it amazes me just how deep everything is...it's almost as if nothing is really what it appears on the surface, everything down to the ditch, and the billboard, and the &quot;chance&quot; meeting with Owl-Eyes...everything has a deeper meaning and extrodinary effect on the outcome of the book as well as the reader. To sum up my point of view of this book, I cannot praise it enough. It is definitely (in my eyes and library) one of the 5 greatest pieces of literature ever written. Falling somewhere between the Bible and perhaps The Richest Man in Babylon."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This 1925 novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, set in the year 1922, is a literary classic and I can well understand why. A mere 205 pages, it's a book that has everything - story, theme, symbolism, moral drama and great characters. No wonder it's stood the test of time.The early 1920s was a very special time in American history. The Great War was over, and it was a time of celebration. Prohibition was the law of the land and bootleggers and gamblers were making fortunes as everybody partied with illegal booze and speculated in the stock market. In retrospect, we readers know that it all came to a crashing end later, but that was after the book was published and so the book captures the era in its own time.The narrator is Nick Carraway, a young man who, like Fitzgerald himself, was raised in the mid-west and is working in the stock market in New York City. His own financial circumstances are modest but he rents a house in Long Island next door to the flamboyant and wealthy Jay Gatsby, who throws lavish parties and whose background is shrouded in mystery. As a New Yorker myself I must say I cringed at his geography, but the rest of the book transcends these minor physical details.Slowly, we learn of Jay Gatsby's obsessive love for the wealthy Daisy, now married to the snobbish Tom Buchanan who is having an affair with a garage owner's wife. Nick is a friend of this cast of characters, participating in their lives but yet standing back and observing. He's a man of his times as well as a person who understands human character and foibles. How the story plays out is a complex drama filled with passion and tragedy and including elements worthy of Shakespeare or classic Greek theater. This is more than just a good story. It's an emotional ride in expensive cars to an era filled with people we can all identify with.I give this book by highest recommendation. It rises above a mere good read and dwells in the realm of great literature."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a true classic, which you will enjoy is you are a fan of books containing love and tragedy. The book is very well written, and I loved The Great Gatsby because the story held my attention. The setting for The Great Gatsby is outside New York City, in the 1920s. The story is told by Nick Carraway, who is visiting his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom. When you read the book, you have something in common with most of the characters. At the beginning of the story, no one knows who Gatsby even is. That is a mystery everyone is trying to find out, and once you solve the mystery of Gatsby, you uncover a new mystery. This mystery includes Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan. To solve these mysteries, you should read The Great Gatsby. F. Scott Fitzgerald did an excelent job with details. Everything that is described in the book, you can easily form a mental picture of; especially such things as Gatsby's house and Mr. Wilson's Garage. The Great Gatsby, somewhat, reminds me of Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte. Both Books involve the return of a long lost love, which was slightly secretive. Wuthering Heights is a little harder to follow then the Great Gatsby, but I enjoyed both of them. I recomend reading The Great Gatsby if you enjoy books that are exciting, suspensful, amusing, and tragic. What more could you ask for in a book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I've just finished reading this book in my 10th grade Honors American Lit. class.

The language might be a little difficult to understand, but that's why there are dictionaries.The Great Gatsby was written 80 years ago, and it is still around today. If it was such an appalling novel, it would never have made it this far.

Some parts were pretty boring but other parts were really good! So read the book if you want! I was forced to read it at school!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Looking over the other responses, I have to include my own two cents and agree with the reviewer who said that anyone who gave this book less than 4 stars is completely oblivious. I first read this book about 15 years ago - when I was 14 and had to read it for my junior high English class. At that time, I too didn't &quot;get&quot; the book, thought it was boring, and couldn't see what all the hype was about. Then I re-read it a few years ago. I was simply amazed at how well-crafted, insightful, and yet SUBTLE the book is. The reviewer who remarked that GG's structure is flawed is especially misguided and probably didn't pay enough attention while reading. In fact, the structure of this book is pretty close to being perfect. The reviewer thought the narration of the events through the point of view of the neighbor is a &quot;crutch&quot; and a worn-out device. Not so! The WHOLE POINT of the novel is NOT, in fact, Gatsby's pursuit of Daisy, as everyone seems to think, but the question: who IS Jay Gatsby? Not only literally, i.e., what is his identity, but also figuratively, who IS he as a person. The story is remarkable in that we never see Gatsby directly; instead, his character is filtered through the views of the people around him. Therefore, the narration of the neighbor fits in perfectly with the overarching theme of the novel: he is left to sort out his impressions of Gatsby much in the same way that the reader is. If the story were told from Gatsby's point of view, we would get too close, know too much about him, and the entire effect would be ruined. As it stands, however, the novel becomes a comment on identity: who we really are, and how other people perceive or misperceive us. (I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't read the book yet, but once you do read it, make this connection and you'll see how perfect the structure is.) That other reviewer also made the comment that a great work of art should cause us to think, question ourselves, etc., etc. GG does exactly this, but as I pointed out, Fitzgerald's technique is very subtle - with the result that some of the nuances may be lost on inattentive readers. To those who gave the novel less than four stars: read it again, and this time pay attention and look beyond the surface!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"More than anything, a meticulously crafted tale about TIME: its insufferable pace, its disruption, and the fallacy of controlling it. In the end, everyone is human--but Gatsby is worth more than all the &quot;rest of 'em put together&quot;. Alas, reality never lives up to the promises of the green light: there is certain loss in having. A metaphor for Fitzgerald's time, our time, and all time.--Justin Laird Weaver"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Before reading the Great Gatsby I considered all the reviews were probably just hype. I finally decided to pick it up after the modern library listed as the number 2 book in the 19th century. I can see now why it is a classic. Fitzgerald's magnificent mastery of story telling had me entranced. This simple story set in the 20's moved me emotionally, and turned me into a Gatsby fan. This was a beautiful book about a misunderstood man, and it touched me. I am sincerely glad that I finally read it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I am a junior in high school, and we recently completed reading \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" I have to say, it is by far the greatest book I have ever read.

I am 23 now, and still remember reading Gatsby in high school. Of course, I read Shakespeare for pleasure, I always liked reading. When you grow up poor books are a great friend! I may have never read this if it hadn't been assigned. Its short, and its a classic. Perhaps those trashing it should reread it when they are mature enough to handle it?"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The story takes place in the early 1920's on Long Island. The narrator is Nick Carraway who has just arrived from the Midwest to work as a bond salesman. He visits his cousin Daisy who is married to a wealthy college acquaintance named Tom Buchanan. Nick also soon meets his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who has made a fortune through questionable means and has moved to Long Island in an attempt to revive an old romance with Daisy.Gatsby knew Daisy before World War I.At Gatsby's suggestion, Nick arranges a reunion between the two former lovers. As the romance is rekindled a tragedy unfolds involving Gatsby, Nick, Daisy, Tom and Tom's mistress as well as her husband.THE GREAT GATSBY is a short book but Fitzgerald manages to create some complicated and interesting characters. Of course the most intriguing is Gatsby who is an incorrigible romantic dreamer with an insane desire to relive the past.THE GREAT GATSBY is also an entertaining book which deserves its high rank among American novels written during the early part of the last century."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I bought this book last year, but I just hadn't got around to read it. But for my holiday, I rounded up 3-4 of those \\"must reads\\" that was waiting on the shelf and took off. And what a great read this was! I loved \\"The Great Gatsby\\" from the very first page.Written in the 1920'ies one would think that this novel would be outdated by now. But a book doesn't get the label \\"a great classic\\" for no good reason. Fitzgerald, with \\"The Great Gatsby\\", has written a novel with a timeless message.The story's narrator, Nick Carraway, is the neighbour to the novel's protagonist Jay Gatsby. We enter the story when Jay has transformed from being a poor officer to a self made millionaire. He is throwing fantastic parties every weekend on his mansion on Long Island. Lots of people, lit garden, swimming pool and the full nine yards. Gatsby is a self-invented person, no one really knows him, what he does, or where he's from, but they all come to his parties. One of the other protagonists, Daisy Buchanan is married to Tom, but Daisy used to go out with Jay Gatsby. Back then when he was a poor guy and a no-body. When Jay went to serve overseas, Daisy married Tom. Tom is an incredibly rich young man. Brutal, low moral, arrogant and you name it.. but extraordinary rich..So that's the scene setting for this novel. This book has everything, the (impossible) love story, money and wealth, greed, affairs, jealousy and obsessions. Fitzgerald's writing style is vivid and eloquent. Simply an elegant use of the language! His language reminds me of Hemingway, one of my other favourites. The different characters are extraordinary well developed. I especially liked the cynical narrator of the story, Nick Carraway.Fitzgerald has written one of the best books I have ever read. This is a short book, and I read it in 50-page gulps at the time. A great book, ready to be re-read any day!!PS. Make sure to get this edition, as it has a great preface written by Matthew Bruccoli. The preface contains valuable information about the author and background information on the story itself. Read the preface first, you will benefit from it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is one of those books that has become immortal because it perfectly captures an era. The 1920's were perhaps the most exciting decade of the previous century in America (rivaled only by the 1960's), and this book showcases its excesses in all their glory. We see the rich person, and what money can do to you. We see how love can not only change a man's life, but also take it away from him. We see interactions between different social classes. We see how the amounts of excess in the 20's reached such a zenith that people would actually hold huge parties for multitudes of people at their houses that they not only didn't know, but would never even meet. This book, on the surface, is a love story, but it also has deeper revertebrations. It's a tragedy. It's poetry. It's a warning about the false luster of the American dream. The plot in this story is wonderful and perfectly thought out. The writing style is very, very smooth and actually acutely beautiful. It's a beautifully written book - almost like prose at times, but very literate. It's probably Fitzgerald's masterpiece. This is a book that you can't afford to skip over when reading your way through the American classics."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's life is somewhat paralleled by the character (Jay Gatsby) he creates in his most famous novel, The Great Gatsby. Gatsby throws lavish parties and lives one of the most extreme lifestyles fictionalized during the Jazz Age. Although Fitzgerald's life was tragic at times, he seems to have drawn the content of the novel from his creative literary genius as well. Because of its amazing story and craftsmanship, The Great Gatsby is the type of novel that deserves to stay in print for as long as people are reading books.The novel is a bit of a love story gone wrong, mixed with the budding friendship of a common bond salesman (Nick Carraway) with the notorious underground gambler and namesake of the novel (Jay Gatsby). The two are somewhat confidants, yet the audience never knows if Gatsby is totally truthful with Carraway. Gatsby finds that Carraway's distant cousin (Daisy Buchanan) is a lost love who has married another man (Tom Buchanan). It seems as though his pursuit is worthless, but the soap-opera feel of the book helps the story continue to flow. Tom is also having an affair; his mistress is a low-class woman named Myrtle Wilson who lives in a gas station halfway between the two major areas that set the novel (East Egg and West Egg). Gatsby goes on a mission to reclaim the love of his life, almost an attempt to eternally grasp happiness. Carraway also has a somewhat love interest, a lady golfer who often lands herself in trouble. A novel is complete without unexpected disaster and The Great Gatsby is no exception. Twists of fates and other accidents play into the story as the reader's heart beats faster and is too involved to close the book.Other plot elements allow Fitzgerald's novel to be highly esteemed. He magically mixes carefully crafted symbolism, dramatic irony, complex plot, figurative language, and vivid descriptions in such a bold yet intriguing way. A fantastic cast of characters work together move the story forward, although one man (Carraway) does the actual narration. After reading this amazing novel, any reader would wish to travel back to the 1920s and attend one of Gatsby's wild parties or befriend one of the other characters."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I was first assigned \\"The Great Gatsby\\" in college but I hate being \\"assigned\\" a book and held off reading it until now.I am very happy I came back to this book, truly a classic. It is not your classic love story and Fiztgerald captures the snobby life of these rich people perfectly. He brings them down to human levels despite all their riches and shows how we all suffer the same regardless of our monetary value.The first chapter or two can be a bit of a challenge to get through since it deals mostly with the setting up of their snobby environments, but if you stick with it puts everything into perspective further in the book.Without giving anything away, it had one of the best ending I have ever seen (or read rather). You read this book and never truly know how you felt about the characters, wether you loved them or hated them, at the end, all you can do it pity people like them."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This masterpiece take place in the 1920's in New York's West Egg Village, a suburb of New York City. The narrator of the story is Nick Carraway, a young man quietly carving out a living selling bonds and securities. Nick moves into a meager house located next door to the great Gatsby mansion. Nick is in awe of the fabulous Gatsby home. Lavish parties are the norm there, with prominent guests coming and going, and music and laughter filling the Long Island air. Jay Gatsby, however, is a mystery to Nick.Soon Nick receives an invitation from Gatsby himself to attend one of his parties. People are filled with uncertainty about Jay Gatsby. How did he become so wealthy? Where was he from? Who was he? Gossip stirred and rumors abounded.Although they were not from the same social circle, Jay Gatsby took an immediate liking to Nick Carraway and befriended him. But he had other motives too. Nick was cousin to the beautiful married Daisy Buchanan, a woman who Gatsby once loved and lost. Through Nick, Gatsby desperately tries to rekindle the romance with Daisy. At one point Nick tells Gatsby that the past cannot be repeated. Gatsby's reply is, &quot;Can't repeat the past? Why of course you can!&quot;The characters in this book (with the exception of Nick) all share one common thread. They are striving for more of everything...love, success, money, notoriety, and a sense of self-worth. Yet they chase after their ambitions blindly. Feelings are hurt, friendships are destroyed, and tragic events unfold. What they thought would bring happiness only brings sorrow.Fitzgerald's insight into social interactions is profound. Through the voice and eyes of Nick, he helps the reader empathize with even the most loathsome characters. The prose is beautiful and oftentimes heartwrenching. Even after 75 years, the keen observations made by Fitzgerald (Nick) about people and society ring true today. History changes, but the human condition holds steadfast. Unforgettable..."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"No wonder this book was rated #2 on the top 100 American novels of the century. This is a true gem. Although not a fast paced book, the beauty of the story is the way it flows. The naration is written with pure emotion. The ending is true literary magic. This novel will capture you unless you refuse it with stubborn thoughts of boredom. Keep in mind before you decide to read this book that it is not an adventure or sci-fi blitz. If you miss the art of the writting, the way Fitzgerald selects specific words for specific intentions, you will miss the heart of this novel. This is a novel that should be read for it's art but don't be fooled, there is nothing boring about this book. It sets the bar that all novel should be judged by. Without a doubt the absolute best of the American classics that i have read to date. Highest possible recommendation."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It is generally assumed by many that a book being considered a 'classic' is good enough reason to readit. This frequently is not the case, as everyone's idea of a classic is different. However, in the case of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, I would state that this book should be read by all.It tells the seperate stories of a number of people, but its focal point is the hidden love Jay Gatsby holds for Dasiy Buchanan - married, elegant and charismatic. As Gatsby pursues shady deals and his doomed obsession with Daisy, F. Scott Fitzgerald distills the essence of the Jazz Age and the empty heart of the American Dream.

What starts off as an adventurous festive tale turns into a troubling and deeply sad story."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald tells us the life story of a Mr. Jay Gatsby. However, don't expect the narrator, Nick Carraway, to tell everything up front, he leaves plenty of room for the imagination. The Great Gatsby is filled with dramatic love triangles and the ever-present truth looming over Gatsby. Keep in mind the central theme of not everything is always as it seems.Written in 1924, The Great Gatsby is one of America's most recognized literary works of art. F. Scott Fitzgerald has eternalized the glory of the \\"roaring twenties\\" and has captivated his audience for over 85 years. The \\"roaring twenties\\" plays host to the Prohibition movement and creates an air of hysterics among the characters. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote five novels and over twenty short stories. His works have been translated into many other languages and continue to be adapted into plays, films, and other forms of entertainment.Fitzgerald presents this short novel in a way that leaves the audience wondering about the truth behind every single character. Each character has his or her own agenda and rarely forgets who number one is. Don't be fooled by the brevity of this novel, it is packed to the brim with double meanings and truths to be discovered. The Great Gatsby breathes life into the past and makes you want to be a part of it. The way Fitzgerald describes Mr. Gatsby's parties makes you wish you were there to experience such a fun and never ending night. In a way, it perfectly describes the themes of love throughout the novel, fun, seemingly never ending, and yet never turning out the way you thought they would. The glitz and the glamour that is present throughout the novel would make anyone want to crash one of Mr. Gatsby's parties.What is truly remarkable is that Fitzgerald manages to make a love story into a suspense novel by always making Gatsby have to be a half step in front of the truth. A \\"truth\\" that Gatsby weaves so intricately, even he second-guesses it. I would have to say that my favorite aspect of this novel is that Fitzgerald never tells a scene with all the information up front. This novel really makes you think and recall information in order to keep up with the story line.I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys having to put together a puzzle without knowing the bigger picture. The Great Gatsby is commonly used in high school curriculums across the United States, but is a novel that everyone should read with or without a requirement attached. This novel is intriguing, lively and full of entertainment. The only draw back is that it is extremely short for a novel. I feel that it could have been expanded a great deal, but who am I to argue with F. Scott Fitzgerald and the story lengths that made money in his time. Overall, I would agree with the masses that this is literary classic. Make sure to watch out for the fifth film adaption of The Great Gatsby in 2013, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby and Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is one of my favorites because the prose is beautiful and the twists of the story are natural. So often authors kill off characters in an attempt to make the story more compelling and dramatic, but it comes across as unfitting and trite.

Truly a masterpiece that deserves to be read and studied for centuries.-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"it is one of the most beautiful pages ever written.

Gatsby is that rarest of Americans, a rags-to-riches self-made man. He worked his way up from poverty. But he isn't happy. Why? Because he did it all for Daisy, and yet the web of American society (a supposedly classless place) prevents him from ever having her. Thus he is tragic. Gatsby may be amoral, but why is he so? He was born poor but ambitious and then he became successful and it killed him. The very top is out of reach, even if you get there. It's a fool's game. If Gatsby were set in today's world he might aspire to be a Donald Trump-like character. The tragedy (and farce) of our society, which Fitzgerald realizes, is that Donald Trump was born rich.People who read this novel as a love story are missing the point. Gatsby is not in love, he is infatuated with Daisy because of what she represents. Many people confuse this with love (in literature and in life) but that is a terrible mistake."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Even though I have not gotten very far in the book, the quality of the book is brand new, it has a decent price, and it came in the mail just in a few days."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I first read this book about 25 years ago, it was great then and still great now.

It's one of my all time favorites, the paradigmatic story of romantic obsession (which, like all true romances, ends in betrayal or death--in this case, both). What raises this romance far above the genre is its profound insights into both human nature and America as an ideal and a culture, and the quality of Fitzgerald's writing: from his masterly employment of literary tropes and his gorgeous prose to his unforgettable characters and evocative descriptions of places and events, Fitgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby\\" sets unsurpassed standards for great fiction. It has a permanent place on my bookshelves and in my heart."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald lived in such a different world than we did, but his characters and their dreams as well as their flaws are still applicable today.

I love the tale of Daisy Buchanan and her love for the young James Gatz, before he became Jay Gatsby, the lonlely beyond-rich aristocrat who lives nexxt door to Daisy's cousin, Nick Carraway. The ending is truly a tragic event as most of the characters have all been so self-absorbed with their own happiness which includes mass amounts of money.

I find myself going back to it, rereading passages and discovering something new each time. I found the book totally relevant to our time; apparently decadence and ignorance are timeless human qualities. ; )As for the characters, they are tremendously engaging and presented in an un-heavyhanded way by Fitzgerald. They are almost like puzzles to be solved by the reader, in our own personal way.I myself have mixed feelings for them all. I don't trust any of them; least of all Nick, who as narrator definitely has an advantage in shaping our opinions of the other characters. His \\"are you or aren't you\\" engaged status is revealed at the beginning of the book, and led me to immediately take his musings with a grain of salt. His treatment of Jordan smacks of milque-toast-style hypocrisy as well. Consequently, his \\"you're better than all of them\\" claim to Gatsby doesn't win me over; I found Gatsby to be a rather unlikable and shallow fellow. Gatsby was clearly in over his head in courting Daisy, but continued to do it, full throttle. Real love, or pie-in-the-sky hubris? He admitted that the fact that Daisy was desired by so many other men made him want her even more. This, and his inability to accept that Daisy may have loved Tom at some point hints that he is not really a man in love with a real woman, but rather a shallow twit infatuated with an ideal. And to think, that having money is all that matters, and not how one makes it. . . again, is Gatsby a scoundrel, or just naive?I only wish the book could have been longer and more fleshed out, but its streamlined approach seems to be exactly what the author intended."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Story of the great gatsby is very good. It's a short book, so you fast readers out there will have it done in a short while. It's definitely one of my favorite older books, but it seems a little stale to me compared to newer books."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald1922, West Egg New York; After returning from \\"That delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War\\", Nick decides to leave his family roots in the Middle West behind and try his hand at being at the Bond Business in New York City. Nick rents a small cottage which unbeknownst to him is located next to door to the areas social Mecca. Jay Gatsby, the local legend throws extravagant parties all the time and all of the areas upper crust take full advantage of their gracious host even though no one seems to really know who he is or why he constantly extends hospitality to all of these strangers. Surely it can't be without cause. The reason eventually makes itself known to Nick and his cousin Daisy Buchanan who lives on the opposite side of the bay...I try to throw in a classic every now and again. I find that many don't age well but Gatsby was actually a great read. Fitzgerald captures the embodiment of an era in this superbly written book.The Good: F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing is what makes this story. The story itself while interesting and having its share of twist and turns is successful because of its delivery. Written by most other authors this could have been bland and uninteresting. Fitzgerald's prose and his examination of this time period are where the real interest lies.The bad: Nothing memorable.Overall: A great read and worthy of the moniker \\"Classic\\""},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I have been slowly and fitfully working my way through the classic novels I last read in high school and college, in order to enjoy them without a term paper or final exam hanging over my head. In rereading The Great Gatsby, I was less concerned with the symbolic meaning of the gigantic eyes of T. J. Ecklesburg and more struck by the alien landscape of the ash field those eyes looked down upon. I was less worried about what the green light at the end of Daisy's dock meant exactly and just knocked down by the image of romantic futility painted by Gatsby waving his arms at that dock. In other words, I was more open to the experience of the novel as a great story, rather than great literature. I feel like Daisy and Tom, with their vapid shallowness and complete lack of compassion for other people, are as relevant representations of our culture today as they were of Fitzgerald's then. The American dream is still a powerful and myth that has not yet been debunked, and Gatsby could have been as easily victimized by it in the early 21st century as he was in the premiere age of the nouveau riche. The mark of a true classic is not that it is still being taught in college classrooms, but that it is still a recognizable and moving story decades after it was written."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Of course, reading the Great Gatsby is something every American owe's to himself. I was never good about reading the assigned literature in high school, but I read this. It introduced me to a world of poetry and prose, people and plot, and all elements of writing that have enthralled readers for as long as writing has existed. The language makes me want to weep. Authors don't write like this anymore, they might not be capable of it. Though the book presents itself as a tragedy through a portrait of our nation's most riotous decade, it is soothing in abstract ways. I love this book dearly and I'll never love another one more. If you haven't read Fitzgerald's Gatsby yet, read it. It belongs in the pantheon of classic books one must read before they die."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I have probably read this book 20 times and it seems to get better with time. The first time I read it was in high school and I couldn't fully appreciate or understand it. Then as an Education major in college, I taught it to my students when I did my student teaching and had to know every nuance about it. What do I love so much? Mostly Nick Carroway's narration and the way Fitzgerald describes things as the writer. He uses such rich imagery that you can just picture the scenes and characters in your mind. And yes, all of the characters are shallow and mostly immoral, except for Nick, the narrator. To me, this is a story about love, longing for something you want so badly and will do anything to have, how money doesn't buy happiness or fulfillment if you don't have love, how people will use others for money, and how money can ruin people. It's also an interesting portrait of the east coast and rich people during the 20's. Every time I read it, I get so lost in the descriptions of Daisy, Gatsby, Jordan, Gatsby's parties and the guests at his parties, the sprawling mansions, etc. Overall it's a very romantic book about wanting something you can't have - and then getting it only to have it not fully meet your expectations. I will admit, the ending is depressing and sometimes I stop reading before the book ends because it's just not pleasant. But this will still go down as my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Why do I love this book.

(Goodreads is an online reading club/website) I felt a little stunned when reading this book as well. It wasn't at all what I expected. For starters is only 180 pages.The Great Gatsby - To me the title is sarcastic, condescending, and empathetic. It's a story about a man who \\"...paid a high price for living too long with a single dream.\\"Gatsby told lies about his life to win Daisy. He then created a life to make those lies a reality. In the end nothing mattered. I was all a lie. Gatsby was a disturbed, obsessed man. The fact that no one attended his funeral showed that everything had been made up, superficial - he lived a life of smoke and mirrors.I'm glad I read this and may pick it up again some day. I'm afraid my reaction to it was based on preconceived notions."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"the underside of the American Dream laid bare by a master of modern prose. Daisy Buchanan, beautiful, utterly superficial, parisitical symbolizes the bankruptcy of the American Dream. Many came up after but no-one described the glaring, loud, cruel 1920s better."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This was, of course, not the first time I have read this classic - it is probably the fourth. I have to say that I was not as blown away this time as I have been in the past, but it is still a great book, a classic, a stellar example of the Great American Novel. It is also a very teachable book, with many interesting points for readers - the glamor, the romance, the wealth, the dreaming and longing for somebody to love. But what struck me hardest this time was that the book is primarily about loss and illusion and defeat. Gatsby, as great as he was, did not get what he wanted. He may have even wanted something that could never have existed for him. It is a deeply disillusioned book, with a bleak view of romance. In this story, unlike in Wharton's \\"The Age of Innocence\\", true romance does stand a chance against the crushing weight of social pressure. In fact, despite all the romancing that is going on, there does not seem to be much real love between any of the characters, except for Gatsby's obsessive love for Daisy (she responds to the power of his passion and personality, but how does she really feel?), and the camraderie between Gatsby and the narrator.The whole story is as fascinating to me as it ever was. 'Fitzgerald was capable of writing some of the most graceful and beguiling prose that anyone has written. And the character of Gatsby, that embodiment of American dreaming, that rags to riches guy, that smooth gangster with a nave and loving heart - he was probably FSF's greatest creation, and one of the greatest creations in American literature."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"As readers of my reviews know, I rarely bother to make comments about classics. However, I recently read an interview with Jill Abramson, the executive editor of The New York Times. She commented that her \\"favorite occupation\\" is rereading The Great Gatsby every year. I haven't read Fitzgerald in probably 20 years, but I was inspired to read this again. I was amazed to be reminded how magnificent this book is. Simultaneously of its time and timeless, it is a masterpiece of prose style. I may not reread it every year, but I will read it many times again, I'm sure."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is one of the most exquisite books I have ever read to date that deals with most if not all aspects of love and the challenges of life. There is so much to learn especially for us in this modern world where so many people use the word \\"love\\" without really knowing what it truly means. The author is so descriptive that I sometimes felt as if I was in the story. He made it easy for readers to penetrate the souls of the characters and relate to their lives.The character development is prodigious, while prose is outstanding. I felt as much for Gatsby as I have for any other character. He had always had high aspirations, but his dreams were taken away from him by the fact the he had to fight a war, and he could never be the same again. Gatsby's ambition is to have his former love, who is now married to an unfaithful husband, a quest that saw outstanding twist and turns in the story to make it the great read we have heard so much about. This book is truly inspirational for everyone irrespective of race, gender, age or occupation.Recommended stories are Disciples of Fortune, The Scarlet Letter, Why The Caged Bird Sings, in the sense that they go to add to this rich theme."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Like many readers, I first encountered \\"The Great Gatsby\\" in honors American Lit in high school. Unlike many readers, I enjoyed most of the literature assigned in high school and college, but \\"Gatsby\\" has always stood out in my mind, even among the classics, as a stellar example of the writer's art. Fitzgerald crafts every sentence with the precision of a diamond-cutter and takes more care with his story's overall arc and balance than any other novel I know. Each character is vividly drawn and speaks in a highly distinctive voice. The symbolism is perfectly pitched, neither too heavy-handed nor too obscure. \\"Gatsby,\\" like the United States, is about money, and as such is perhaps the quintessential American novel.Whenever I get tired of mediocre writing and the poor to non-existent editing one sees in today's fiction, I re-read the 160 exquisitely wrought pages of \\"Gatsby\\" to remind me of the heights to which novels can aspire."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald's novel personifies the glitter and underlying corruption of the Jazz Age (a term which Fitzgerald himself coined). Through his portrayal of the incorrigible and and somewhat naive Gatsby, the self-made man, the reader begins to understand some of the mindset of the time; the pursual of the American Dream and the corruption that was necessarily involved. A great book, with a range of characters (though some are irritating) and wonderful symbolism and meaning, especially with regard to the color.

Though the novel didn't get very popular until after Fitzgerald's death, the novel is definately a must-read. There is so much meaning within the book if you look at it. It is full of different motifes, for example, the repetition of some colors and the disappearance of others, the idea of fascades... There is even a good connection between this novel and Homer's epic Oddyssey, which I won't get into. Anyways, Fitzgerald's style is fantastic, as is the story - full of intrigue and criticism of the times."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This story is amazing and eloquently written. At a '1st glance' and a 1st read, it seems like a simple love story with a tragic ending. However, having studied the novel and explored its issues and themes, the broader and more significant issues are brought to our understanding and we realize what Fitzgerald is really trying to tell us. The way that it conveys this message very subtly and in an eloquent way, is its strongest point. It is books like this,Salinger's &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, and Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; and many others, which really give a book a real meaning for us to realize of the world we live in.

He lures us with his simple but misunderstood characters. And he finishes it off with his incredible ability to paint a picture of a decade so out of control. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; tells the story an incredibly wealthy man (Gatsby) who is somewhat of an oddball in the socially aggressive environment of New York in the twenties. Through the narrator, Fitzgerald gives us the insight into Gatsby's true character that others in the novel either don't pick up on, or ignore. The only thing I didn't like about this novel is Fitzgerald's ocasional use of the cheesy metaphor that other's find so eloquent. However, I'd have to say that this was one of the more enjoyable books I read this past year."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby has become, deservedly so, one od the most widely read, widely taught novels ever.

IMHO it is one of the great American novels, and one of the best American novels to tell the story of a particular class of people in any era out there. In this case, the era is The Roaring Twenties and the class of people that the novel deals with is the extremely wealthy. It was definitely an interesting era and \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is the novel that stands tall above all the other novels to deal with this subject matter.Jay Gatsby is a man of mystery and intrigue. Women fall at his feet. He supposedly went to Oxford. He hangs out with the man who fixed the 1919 Chicago White Sox World Series. Nobody really knows how he makes his money or how he made his fortune, but he apparently started from scratch. He throws outlandish parties that all sorts of rich and famous people who do not know him come to. People clamor to be on the list to his parties but do not know him.These people are portrayed as shallow, brittle, vain. They have come by their money, but they care not whom the victims are along the road or in the path ahead. Just so they can hold on to their claim to fame. Anything, so that they can maintain their lifestyle. Society is disposable, people come and go, they live and die. It really does not have anything to do with them, does it darling?What happens in the novel is really of no concern, also. This is profound, but it makes \\"Gatsby\\" the novel that it is. \\"Gatsby\\" is the first book in \\"The Big Read\\" for Wichita, KS. this year (2012).

I can now say I've both read this book and listened to a reading of it, and there's so much complexity in the subtext that each time the tone suggested something slightly different.Regarding the story itself, more of a short story really, it seemed to me somewhat unremarkable. My primary pleasure came from wanting to learn more about this mysterious man Gatsby, who he is and what motivates him.The Great Gatsby is such an idolized staple of American literature that I grant myself several more re-reads to fully appreciate its genius."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby was chosen by a book club I belonged to. I had originally read it in high school (over 10 years ago), but at the time I thought it was so utterly boring that I couldn't keep up so I had no idea what was happening. I didn't remember anything except for the Green Light. Reading it now was definitely a different experience.I thought many of the characters were very shallow. Tom, Daisy, Jordan, even Gatsby. They were lounging rich folk with too much time and money on their hands. Even before I found out that this was set in a hot Long Island summer, i felt like they were so lazy. During the story NOT MUCH HAPPENS. A lot is revealed about the characters, but action wise, not much.We find out that Gatsby, is NOT so great, that Gatsby and Daisy loved each other at some point, we see a lot of drunk driving, and lavish parties, and the beautiful glitzy life of Roaring Twenties young rich Americans. We see no self-control, or depth.Even Nick Carroway, the narrator, turns out to be a VOID of a character. Rather then someone who takes action, he is the one whom actions happens to. He gets invited to a party, so he goes. He walks into a room and people talk to him, and he doesn't say much in return. People ask favors of him, but he never asks anything. He seems to be dully OKAY with everything, and have no strive for anything. He is a vessel through which secrets are revealed and are passed on, but he has no secrets of his own.Skimming the book after I read it, I see a lot of foreshadowing (which of course I had no idea when reading it the first time). For example, when Nick came to Tom and Daisy's house, and Daisy was lethargic and not talking to anyone until Nick mentioned he lived next door to Gatsby, then she started speaking. Also, when he was at the party, he heard rumors of Gatsby being a bootlegger, and later this also revealed to be true. A green light, for \\"go.\\"What this book does is splendidly, in flowery descriptive language, capture a snapshot of one sector of society during the 20's. You really get a feel for the clothing, the hair, the way they behaved themselves, the interactions between people, the music, and amusements. The word choice absolutely helped when reading - I was really able to capture the scene, moment, emotion behind something. Exquisite word choice by Fitzgerald.So, did I like the book? Not very. I liked the setting, the era, the language, but the characters were vapid, lacking emotion, initiative, or drive. And the more we find out about these people, the less you like them.I definitely don't think this book should be read in High School. So much of what happened was so minute that its easily missed by teenagers. This book can really only be absorbed by adult readers. Even so, if I didn't have it on audiobook I was probably have a hard time getting through it because it can get dull at times.I should probably mention that I listened to the Great Gatsby on Audiobook. Unabridged, performed by Tim Robbins on 6 CD's. The story itself was the first 5 CD's. The 6th CD were readings of letters that Fitzgerald wrote to his publisher about this book and other projects he was working on. They were interesting little insights into the author. Tim Robbins was a very good reader. They even threw in snippets of Jazz in the beginning and end of every disk, which was a nice touch. Of course, I also took out the hard copy from the library, which I skimmed for comparison.At the book discussion we all agreed that we would have liked to see two things: 1. A follow up to this story, after the great depression, to see what become of them and their money, and 2. an alternate ending - one in which Gatsby is ok. What then?

I love the contrast between the morality of all the characters where Nick is moral almost to a fault while Gatsby and Daisy are both almost too immoral to function. This timely story contains action, scandal, love, and betrayal and it captures the escence of great American literature."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The first time I read Gatsby was in high school, too young and coerced to come away with much but an urge to slap Daisy. The second read, in my early twenties, was magic -- I drank it in a night, awed by the grace of the language, and particularly swept up in the sad romance of it: gauche, hopeful Jay Gatsby, arms and dreams wide as he stared across the Sound at the green light at the end of Daisy's dock.This third time was the best, the purest, and if you haven't read it for a while, I urge you to pick it up again. It's truly a masterpiece, painting the whole American mess in vivid colors and flawless perspective without wasting a stroke. The best part, the deftest, is that Fitzgerald makes everyone culpable, from philandering elitist Tom Buchanan to passive narrator Nick Carraway. Even the reader can't help but feel involved: In the thousand wrongs and slights of everyday, in our selfish wants and our crueler rationalizations, we create and prolong the world Fitzgerald painted for us.And yes, I still want to slap Daisy."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is a marvelous look into the green-eyed monster of sexual jealousy. It's ripe with symbolic imagery from Fitzgerald's personal agony over his wife adulterous affair.Everyone knows the superficial lit class interpretation of the novel; idealistic Gatsby pursues fortune in vain attempt to dazzle and win golden girl, only to have her reject him. Conclusion: classic condemnation of the hollowness of upper class materialism. Rubbish!The story is not political. It is personal pure and simple! It would have taken place anytime, any place those two particular personalities came together. In real life Fitzgerald won his Zelda. But he then promptly and insouciantly cheated on her. She got him back by cheating on him. In his journals Fitzgerald wrote that something died at this time. Shortly afterward the couple moved to Paris.Does this not parallel George Wilson's reaction to his wife's affair in The Great Gatsby? Yes, Wilson is also Fitzgerald, the tortured, jealous part of Fitzgerald who mourns the loss of his wife even as he realizes her for what she is. Myrtle is the low class floozy that Zelda has become in Fitzgerald's eyes by cuckolding him.Wilson tries to hold on to his wife by locking her up until he can transact a business deal (buying the coupe) and thereby have the money to take her \\"west\\", something they had long talked about but which he is now going to make her do.Analogously, Fitzgerald sold short stories (seeing himself as stooping to low class laborer by writing for commerce instead of art's sake?)to pay his and Zelda's way to Paris, removing her from her paramour's proximity.Who actually kills Gatsby? The symbol of idealism and optimism (Gatsby)is killed by the symbol of grief and jealousy (Wilson). Fitzgerald was disillusioned by Zelda's adultery not class materialism.Who does that leave Daisy/Zelda with in the end? Tom, the lout, the woman beater, the snob. Realizing, to his relief, that Daisy will never actually leave him, Tom becomes smug. Go ahead, he tells Gatsby (or any man who now idolizes Zelda), flirt with her all you want. She'll always come crawling back to me! If Gatsby is how Fitzgerald wants to be, Tom is the husband Fitzgerald actually is.Daisy, Myrtle and Jordan are all Zelda; Daisy the debutante on a pedestal, Myrtle the common floozy, Jordan the sophisticate pursuing her own identity and career. But Jordan has no address of her own. She lives off other people and cheats on her golf game, just as Fitzgerald claimed that Zelda stole from him material for her own writing career.This is the world as seen through the eyes of a self-centered, tyrannical egoist, but with one saving grace, Nick the observer, the recorder. Nick is the writer in Fitzgerald, and for all his faults as a man, Fitzgerald was one heck-of-a- writer."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The wonder of F. Scott FitzGerald's magnum opus is that he has created a great mirror for any individual looking into it. Therefore, a god can see a god and a fool can see a fool. Reading the various reviews from a wide variety of supposed learned individuals, I must say that this masterpiece is not just a well written story or even art, but a great mirror that can reflect whatever an individual may have to offer to oneself. Within each of us, live all the characters that appear in this novel (if we're lucky) from Jay Gatsby to George Wilson. Obviously, some readers (amazon reviewers included) have lost key characters far too early in their life. The style and language of the story is both engaging and active. It stimulates the mind of the reader to create and not just follow, as most common writers will have us do. In a world of sheep that think themselves as wolves, this work may seem less than satisfying. Being given the opportunity to look into a mirror and truly look at ourselves verses shown an idealistic picture and told that that image is we, many will chose the latter. History has shown that most people prefer the illusions of life. As J.D Salinger simply put it &quot;They're all a bunch of phonies...&quot;"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I haven't read Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby' in almost two years. I picked it up again, to-day, though, and realized the truth of the notion that one learns something new each time one returns to a book. 'The Great Gatsby' just is a novel that must be returned to periodically to appreciate it properly.While the characters in the novel remain ultimately unknowable at their indefinite cores, Fitzgerald does a great job tying his characters to their historical setting. The protagonist of the novel, to my mind, is Nick Carraway, the narrator. The hero of his story, which frames the novel, is the legendary Jay Gatsby - a legend in his own mind. Although Carraway's narration is often heavily biased and unreliable, what emerges are the stories of a set of aimless individuals, thrown together in the summer of 1922. Daisy Buchanan is the pin that holds the novel together - by various means, she ties Nick to Jordan Baker, Tom Buchanan to Jay Gatsby, and Gatsby to the Wilsons.The novel itself deals with the shallow hypocrisies of fashionable New York society life in the early 1920's. It is almost as though Fitzgerald took the plot of Edith Wharton's 'The Age of Innocence' and updated it - in the process making the characters infinitely more detestable and depriving it of all hope. Extramarital affairs rage on with only the thinnest of veils to disguise them, the nouveau-riche rise on the back of scandal and corruption, and interpersonal relationships rarely signify anything permanent that doesn't reek of conspiracy. The novel's casual allusions to beginnings and histories often cause us to reflect on the novel's historical moment - when the American Dream and Benjamin Franklin's vision of the self-made man seem to coalesce in Jay Gatsby, a Franklinian who read too much Nietzsche.No matter how you read it, 'The Great Gatsby' is worth re-reading. M.J. Bruccoli's short, but informative preface, and C. Scribner III's afterword are included in this edition, and both set excellent contexts, literary, personal, and historical, for this classic of American literature."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This eloquently written novel, full of symbolism and wonderful imagery is set among a millionaire community on Long Island.

Carraway's intervention triggers revelations about Gatsby's criminal past, and a love afair between Gatsby and the wife of the wealthy Tom Buchanan; these in turn leads to further tragedy. At the end of the book Carraway sits alone outside Gatsby's mansion, reflecting on the emptiness of the lives he has just described. Certainly this novel stands alone in range and depth.

Between the solid story, symbolism and pleasant prose, the Great Gatsby touches on something everyone experiences in one degree or another: that of unrealized dreams. There are many Gatsbys in the world - each scheming some last-ditch effort to snatch victory from a certain defeat. He is a timeless character.Now, this is Fitzgerald, and that means he can lapse into sentimentality. I think what makes this book his best work technically is that he keeps tight rein over the sap. It is far more mature than This Side of Paradise and less amorphous than Tender is the Night. Saul Bellow considered Fitzgerald's writing 'weak', but at its best it strikes a young, idealistic chord that makes all the sap worthwhile. I've always felt that comes from Fitzgerald's successful courtship of Zelda.I recommend this book, but it is one of those stories you know whether you read it or not - like Romeo and Juliet or King Author. If you like Fitzgerald, there are several newer writers that he has influenced. Hunter S. Thompson comes to mind, and I once heard Thomas Wolfe mentioned as a 'devotee'. John Keats was a big inspiration in Fitzgerald's writing, and that old humbug Bernard Shaw as well. Ultimately, I think the Great Gatsby is the best American novel to date, which bridges admirably the old English poets and the modern workaday world."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Ernest Hemingway, who had a lifelong love-hate relationship with F. Scott Fitzgerald once described Scott's talent as &quot;perfect and delicate as the wings of a butterfly.&quot; Yes, and that is what the lucky readers get in The Great Gatsby:that wonderful, exhilerating, lyrical delicacy shadowed by tragedy. I keep re-reading this book. It contains four or five of my favorite scenes in all literature: the scene of Daisy on the couch in the cottage with the breeze billowing her dress; the car accident at the party when we glimpse this dancing shoe emerging from the car; the great passage about &quot;those thrilling, returning trains of my youth&quot; and the scene where they're getting drunk in the hotel. There has never been a better, more subtly written drunk scene. Many have called Gatsby the best American novel of the century. It's not hard to see why. It's got everything in it. And it still stands, fresher than ever, as the great sad story of the American Dream gone sour."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"To me this is literary perfection. It is the only book I know of that is complete: not a word should be cut, or added. It has a palpable mood in which the reader in engulfed: decadence, melancholy, longing, hope, failures, dreams, and an unflinching striving for something purer in a world that wants to drag us into its arrogant and indifferent corruption. Gatsby is THE romantic hero, and Nick the sensitive observer on whom the moral foundation of the book rests. The symbolism is simple and works unobtrusively. I love this book and have read it several times now. It is like a great painting or scene that holds in its smallest details the universal design or chaos if that be the paradox.Reading some of the reviews I find people's opinions varying greatly. Some very intelligent people dislike it, even hate it while others love it, or think it good. The same can be said of not so intelligent people. As Nick puts it: &quot;I was within and witout, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexaustible variety of life.&quot;Do not be too greatly influenced by reviews or the book's reputation, simply read it and decide for yourself. In the end considering how short the novel is, how accessible, and if nothing else(I personally think it is much more) a literary phenomenom, it is worth reading for anyone interested in novels and literature"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It's what's not written and the hidden, subtle meanings between the lines and the potent reaction of the reader that makes this book one of the classics of American Literature, that and Fitzgerald's elegant, almost dance-like, symbolic and deep prose; yes, many might react surprisingly at the word \\"deep\\" to describe The Great Gatsby, but many simply did not see that- in portraying the shallowness of the characters, the fast-paced 1920's eastern life of the rich and notorious, and the struggles of one man-Gatsby-to rise above his past and ancestry and misplacing his meaning in life to one, undeserved woman-a well-hidden depth of meaning and understanding of what mankind should strive for and unfortunately what most miss was clearly pointed out in the novel.As I read other reviews, I concluded that many misunderstood this novel and it took a Kid Review to understand the main theme of the book: as we try to look into the future-be it for our ambitions, fulfillment, happiness, or love- and turn our dreams into realities-as Gatsby so desperately strived for-you are forever thrown back into your past that has been forgotten by many, for your past shapes the paths you take, your past and past decisions leave their marks and has often dire consequences on your present and future life. It is a message to be cautious and savor yesterday so that you do not fall and regret tomorrow. It is in this essence that Gatsby stood out from the others in the story and met a tragic fate at the hands of the careless, shallow, rich and the confused. Who Gatsby was, his flaws, and misplaced love fore Daisy was of no consequence, that was not Fitzgerald's point and many missed it by looking solely at the plot and shallow characterizations and dialogue.While Fitzgerald pointed out many obvious human traits-snobbery, excessive romanticism, carelessness of others' feelings, betrayal, and the shallow curiosity of other people's dramas, as well as the social discrepancies between the rich and the poor scornfully and with distaste, he was barely skimming through the true meaning of his novel.It was not a coincidence that the first 3 settings of the novel mirrored the last 3 settings of the story, in which the past meets the present and affects the future of every main character. The mirror image of the beginning and end of the novel closes the dramas that had unfolded so successfully and so unexpectedly you have to give pause, and with awe come to appreciate the genius of the writingAnd if that still leaves you confounded of what had just happened, it is in the first 2 pages and in the last 2 pages that Fitzgerald bluntly voices what he truly desires for the reader to understand.Anyone giving this novel a bad review simply did not understand it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Written by F. Scott Fitgerald in the 1920's, The Great Gatsby never ceases to depict the fallibility of the typical wealthy American. It is also a fine representation of the American dream and the price that comes along with it. The theme that I was imbued most by was the inability to grasp time: past and present. Gatsby is the typical wealthy American in the 1920's who lives the life wanted by all Americans. His involvement in bootleg alcohol tends to make him a shady character; however, he is in a way the fallible hero. His undying love for Daisy was what brought him to the life of organized crime and illegal activities. Along with the theme are symbols used to further substantiate the theme of wealth and time. For example, the clock that Gatsby tips over and catches shows how he is desperate to take control of time and bring what he wants: a chance with Daisy. His courage and motivation to win the woman of his dreams nevertheless proves that wealth cannot bring back what was past and over. Fitzgerald's use of symbols is what represents most the books' themes. It also serves as a lesson that what is past is past and that there is only a chance at moving on, not staying in the past."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a fantastic love story told in such a manner that can be enjoyed by men and women alike. Gatsby is every woman's dream man. He's loyal to his love, honest, intelligent, gallant, handsome, and has money. The only draw back is that his money is dirty. Truly a fiction character that women can only dream about, never the less a very entertaining piece of literature."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I admit, I was surprised. I went into reading this book as a big task, something to be avoided at all costs. But when I really got down to reading it, I realized how interesting the book actually was. The first chapter or so was a bit slow, but after that the storyline just kept gaining momentum. I strongly believe that F. Scott Fitzgerald was the premier writer of the &quot;Jazz Age.&quot; &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is often referred to as the quintessential novel of the &quot;Jazz Age&quot; and I believe that this is very true! Some of Fitzgerald's characters seem as real as the characters in &quot;Ordinary People.&quot; Realism is especially clear in the main character, Nick Cathaway. He is a hard working man from the Midwest who was in the &quot;Great War.&quot; Some people say that he lives a rather boring life, but honestly, if your life were so much more exciting would you be sitting at home reading this book? I didn't think so! Although Fitzgerald was a great writer, I think he was a little politically incorrect. He also used a lot of plays on words, which made reading the novel a little more confusing. The notes in the back of the book did help a little but it was more confusing then it needed to be. I did like how Fitzgerald used the first person. It lets us get really close inside the narrator's head and that's nice to be able to do. Overall I really enjoyed reading this book and I can't wait to read other books by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Thank you for listening and V.A. rules."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I was forced to read this book in my high school English class. I ended up actually enjoying this book. I thought it was a good story, engaging and a wonderful depiction of the 1920s. I found myself not so into the plot but into the style of writing, and the wonderful backdrop of the roaring 20s, a time of partying and prosperous times for the upper class. I found this book to be very dark, touching on the pain that money can bring."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald is told from Nick Carraways point of view. Nick lived on Long Island Sound, but he lived in West Egg on the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound. Nick knew only what he would see or was told about Gatsby. The book is about the changing of hearts for people that have so much money all they need is someone to love. Money isn't everything because love can over take money. Gatsby would give up everything for a true love such as Daisy. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a good novel full of surprises that will make you think twice about money and love.F. Scott Fitzgerald writes from Nick Carraway's point of view. Nick is the narrator and through Nick we find out about all the other characters and how they become the way they were. Nick would figure out the other characters and learn about them when spending the day with them. That way you were able to find out where each character came from. All the other characters had different views than Nick which made him nice to have around for a day because he would look at issues from a different viewpoint helping them out."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"while reading the great gatsby over this past summer i did not realize the signifigance of the underlying meaning. after i read it a second time i began to understand the actual beauty of fitzgerald's masterpiece. if you ever want a book to sit and contemplate for a while then i suggest this one."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby crosses time as it depicts the careless indulgence that is embedded in our culture. There is a Tom, Daisy and a Gatsby in all our lives. Fitzgerald immortalizes America through his novel. We feel the struggle for independence, love, respect and acceptance that people of all cultures come to achieve in this country. We learn that we, those born and raised in this country must aslo struggle for these. Most importantly, though Fitzgerald brings us Gatsby. Through Nick's eyes our own soul begins to search, and we find that within each and every one of us there is a little of the vulnerable, mythical Gatsby."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a wonderfully written book that keeps the reader attentive at all times.

The context was hard to understand at first, but we grew accustomed to it as we progressed. The beginning was slow but it soon picked up pace and was exciting. The story is almost like a soap opera.

Overall great book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I think this is a good book but yet, a little confusing and hard to understand.

But as I got further along I got more interested and was soon caught up in this great story. Gatsby resembles a typical American in search of fame and wealth. His love for Daisy motivates him to go in search of these two things. But once he achieves them it is too late, for Daisy is already married. He died a tragic death betrayed by all those whom he considered to be his friends."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is truely a well planned novel which has a slow beginning into conflict and reaches it's climax only towards the end. It has a very negative/cynical perspective when thoroughly studied which is not presented directly to us as readers. The 4 star rating is a biast view on my behalf because I am a plot driven reader, howevr even though I found the Great Gatsby hard to read at the beginning, it captured my attention later on .

THIS is how you write books kiddies."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Initially the book seems to drone on about nothing much, but stick to it. The message of the book and the intricatly woven, all-pervasive symbolism eventually becomes apparent. I would haved awarded five stars if soap opera plots held any interest for me.

I FELT REALLY BAD FOR GATSBY BECAUSE HE WAS ALL ALONE. THE BOOK MADE FEEL LIKE I KNEW GATSBY. I COULD NOT STOP READING BECAUSE I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT.

Nick, the main character and narrator, felt a little detached from the rest of the plot and, while now that it's over I appreciate the story being told from an outside perspective, didn't make much sense with the role he played in the story.

I first read this book as a teenager for fun and remember disliking it immensely but later not remembering why. Now that I ave reread it I realize what that is. The type of people described and the way they act irk me. They are well off family surrounded by people that dothings to each other with no feelings. They just keep hurting each other without caring about the consequences.In the beginning of the book it is very boring and does not become interesting until Gatsby becomes involved in the story but the way people act towards one another.I do not really see the beauty in this story but I do see commentary on society I just do not agree with it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"That's my fatal opinion of the book.

The characters of Jay Gatsby, Daisy Buchanan and Tom Buchanan are bold, rich and well created. Jay and Daisy fall in love, but while Jay is serving his country overseas, Daily marries wealthy, egotistical, arrogant Tom Buchanan. Far be it from this minor setback to deter Jay from pursuing his lady love after he returns home. The book has a well-developed plot which holds the reader's attention from start to finish. What particularly interested me about the book (which was also made into a movie,) was the eloquent, magnetic era in which the setting took place. One could not help but be captivated my this extraordinary period which laid many of the stepping stones to our future. You could almost picture yourself sipping tea in a stately mansion or playing polo with the greatest of men. &quot;Great Gatsby&quot; - great book!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I enjoyed this book, but I did find it mildly confusing in the beginning. The first few chapters were rather descriptive and this was more of a hindrance to me than a help. The story contains a lot of symbolism also. Everything really has some deeper meaning. But you can read it on a more &quot;surface&quot; level too, and just enjoy it as a tragic love story. If you do decide to read it in a more in-depth manner, you will see Fitzgerald's story as one of the &quot;American Dream.&quot; The characters are striving for money, love, success and guarantees. They often try to be something on the outside that they really aren't on the inside. The story is told from a rather minor character's point of view and this enables the reader to come to many of his or her own conclusions. The narrator is also easily relatable. The Great Gatsby is a well-written book that gives a strong sense of the author's values and beliefs, which are typical of his time. But the book is very meaningful and entertaining in our time as well."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It is interesting that Fitzgerald's choice title for &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was actually &quot;Under the Red, White, and Blue&quot; (after he rejected the much-publicized &quot;Trimalchio&quot;). However, the book had already gone to press and it was too late to change the title at that point. The reason I mention this is that I believe Nick Carraway is actually the most interesting and compelling character in the novel, contrary to popular belief. Fitzgerald set a standard for narration with this novel - a larger-than-life character seen from the less-biased view of a narrator who is eventually drawn into the novel's plot (as seen in &quot;All the King's Men&quot; and &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot;,and even the film &quot;Wall Street&quot; among others). By the end of the novel, the reader comes away with a compelling and solid portrait of the Midwesterner, Nick Carraway (note, carraway seeds are in rye bread, a Midwestern association), who goes East, finds it &quot;morally bankrupt&quot;, and eventually returns to his roots. The novel is about the American Dream in general, and it is incredibly ironic to call Gatsby &quot;great&quot;, as he is shown to be a slave to love and ambition, whereas Nick is a much stronger man in the end. Nick is the only one who changes throughout the course of the novel, and therefore while he is not as outwardly flashy as Gatsby, he is the one who keeps the reader's interest in the end, as he comes to the same conclusions that we hope we would come to in a similar situation."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is a story of a man who is very rich and could buy anything he wants. But the only thing that he wants is his past love Daisy. Daisy is now unhappily married to Tom Buchanan, who is also very wealthy. Daisy is caught between her true love Gatsby and her husband Tom. Gatsby's quest to capture the love of his one and only Daisy leads to heartbreak and conception.Fitzgerald does an excellent job in portraying the mood of the roaring twenties. Gatsby's parties are described very well and all the events show this time period. Fitzgerald also shows the lifestyles and the characteristics of the time period of all three classes of society. The three classes shown where Gatsby and the Buchanans as the upper class, Nick Carraway as the middle class, and The Wilson's of Asheville as the lower class. The second thing that Fitzgerald does well is capturing the reader's attention. The character Jay Gatsby is a very handsome and rich and is left very mysterious by Fitzgerald. This mystery of such a character draws the reader into the book. Later in the novel the reader attention is obtained by tragic and unpredictable events. One part where the author may not have succeeded in his purpose was showing how Gatsby obtained the &quot;American Dream&quot;. The novel talks about how Gatsby is so successful, yet Fitzgerald never even mentions directly what he does for a living. Overall Fitzgerald is successful in portraying not only the characteristics and lifestyles of the time but also turning it into a popular novel that is very interesting."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"After several years of hesitation, I finally read Fitzgerald's classic at the end of which I couldn't help but wonder what the fuss is all about. Suffice to say that the book is probably more famous for what it represents than the literary value of its contents. The plot is trivially simple and at times over-dramatised. The saving grace comes in the form of the spare and lucid writing, and the Roaring 20s' atmosphere that is essentially the central theme of the book."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a wonder of modern literature. Fitzgerald skillfully exhibits his disgust with the patrons of the roaring twenties and their disgust for the up and coming &quot;bourgeoise.&quot; Not only that, The Great Gatsby is interesting! The shattered dream of Jay Gatsby is one of utter horror. It really makes you wonder what kind of society we live in!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Alright, as you can probably figure out, I wasn't so fond of Gatsby. I went in, as most high-schoolers do, forced to read and understand yet another \\"great\\" novel, one of the other classics, and steeled myself for the worst. 'This book can't be that bad', I thought. 'I mean, it's a classic. People the world over rave about it, it's been a top seller for the last couple decades. That has to mean something.'Now that I've read it through I find myself disappointed. Yeah, I understand that Gatsby is about the rise and fall of the American Dream and not getting caught up in the past and even how much our past affects our future. But other than that, to me it reads like a biography of Fitzgerald's life, with himself in the starring role. I mean, really: the young man who started life poor, who worked his way to the top and falls in love with a beautiful, rich, and not-all-there socialite who turns down his love in favor of a life of luxury. It doesn't seem surprising that this was written only a few years after his marriage to Zelda - who nearly did not marry him because he couldn't offer her the security and luxury of wealth! It disappointed me very much to think that this classic of literature is a loose story of FItzgerald's life. I understand writing what you know, and I've written enough to see the power of writing the stuff you understand, but that's just ridiculous.The language of this book doesn't really read like a true view of Nick Carroway, the supposed narrator - instead, to me it felt more like I was watching a home video shot over Nick's shoulder with Nick providing occasional narration. Fitzgerald over-characterizes certain characters, giving them true form and personality, almost to the point of nausea - in the first chapter alone he has dedicated an entire paragraph and a half to a description of how wonderful Daisy was and how men all over fell in love at the sight of her - and this is supposedly from the mouth of her cousin! I didn't get much of an inage of Tom either, but Gatsby you knew to the point of wanting to slap him every single time he said \\"old chap\\" because it just gets annoying. As for Wilson and his wife, the catalysts and the reason for the book's ending? Didn't get much of a description of them either.Fitzgerald's skill with emotion is supposed to be one of the reasons that this book is so well-known and loved. But the ending is the only bit that got a good reaction. I was disgusted by the rest of the story, and I hated it. He did have skill with emotion, he did make you connect with the story, but it is good to have such pure and total disgust of something?That's pretty much the sum total. If you want to really, really feel with a story, Gatsby can do it. Love it or hate it, you'll be at the extreme, I'm finding. If you want a story chronicling what is typically considered to be the American Dream and it's ups and downs, this book also is probably a good choice as well. But I would definetely not recommend it for reading outside of those two reasons, whether those be for school or work or just curiousity. If you want a good classic, read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer or Gone With The Wind or even The Odyssey or Iliad, but not this book.I hope this review helps somebody."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I bought this book because it was on the reading list for my book club.

A tale like TGG could be the right answer. Even if I have found the track a bit boring, it is the most representative subject that can be defined American epics. But what I really appreciate about Fitzgerald is his style of writing, the best I have ever met in American and English literature, which also retains its meaningful form (but in that case I have to pay much credit to the translator) in the Italian version. The final short digression about the green light is one of the most often seen quotations."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"There is something about Jay Gatsby that is quintessentially American. When I was a younger reader, I simply put the character down as shallow. He's a phony, sure, but it comes from the idea that he can remake himself in his own image, godlike, into something better than he really is... and even reshape his own past. What is the American Dream, but the idea that you can transcend your background and origins to become whatever you want? To transcend barriers of class, wealth and breeding? Of course, the cost of such a dream sometimes ends up as more than most of us would be willing to pay, and the dream often crashes upon the rocks of reality. F. Scott Fitzgerald does not shy away from that."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"In this book a certain Jay Gatsby has accumlated a vast wealth from nothing, having any material possession he might ever need. Yet, he lacks love. This is about his attempt at capturing his love, and all the strange things that a man might do to get it. The flashiness and greatness of the 20's are represented well in this book, with lavish parties and care free guests. It shows that the rich have problems as well, and many times their lives are more empty than the lives of those that are poor. Fitzgerald's writing style kept me very entertained, being very calm and relaxed throughout the whole book. The oddity in Gatsby's &quot;style&quot; kept me interested and thoughtful, such as the constant use of the phrase &quot;old sport.&quot; I think this book deserves to be considered the classic that it is, and has earned its place among other greats."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby has many twists and turns, chock full of phrases and situations that make sense as the story unfolds that beckons you to go back and reread this story. The story meshes the characters and their setting very well. However, as good as the story was, it was difficult to feel anything but disappointment with any of the characters.The narrator, Nick, is never fully fleshed out. He seems to be a prop brought in from the Midwest only to be used as an observer of the strange goings on of the rest of the characters. Even his relationship with Jordan is blandly glossed over. With so many different characters to juggle, one wonders if the narrator character could have been dropped completely.Jordan is ... a golfer, was it? She appears to be another peripheral prop in a mad dash to bring the only three characters who have any flesh together.Which brings us to Daisy. A girl who one begins to feel a warmth towards but who destroys any goodwill as events reach their climax. She is childish and numb to all but her own feelings. She is beautiful and fascinating, but wholly boring and empty.Her husband Tom, on the other hand, was a powerhouse of a character. Full of energy and passion and endowed with the wealth of his forebearers, this man has the ability and nature to lead corporations or governments. He squanders it all buying into pop psychology and wrestling with the 'ash' of society. What is most disappointing in Tom is that one can see this gargantuan man slowly turning himself into a stupid ape. How many times did I feel like wrapping my fingers around his thick neck and telling him to shut up?Finally there's Gatsby. A boy in a man's body. Building himself into the man that he is by careful planning and determination, he finds himself at the crest of adulthood used as a doormat for those who he might consider his friends. He confuses serfdom for gentlemanliness. He throws off the shackles of his past but builds for himself a house of cards. One almost feels happy for him when Wilson makes his housecall to Gatsby's mansion.All in all, this is a great book. Even without sympathetic characters, the story flows along quite well with little eddys of brilliant storytelling that come together at the end and urge the reader to go back and reread what may have been missed on the first outing."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I love this book. On one level, it is a burning love story about obsession, yearning, and unrequited love, but on another level, this book is an interesting look at life in the Roaring Twenties.

Doctor JT Eckelberg's eyes looking down about man... supercilious and vaccuous... ha... it's a classic. Love it and reread it every few years.

There was certainly more to get out of this book than I did, but it left a strong, satisfying feeling with me when I finished. When I awoke I was face-down in the sand."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Like most high school students I read this in English class. Like most students I dreaded it (Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Steinbeck, what's the difference?) This was one of the first books to open my eyes to use of almost perfect prose while telling a story of less than perfect people. It helped that I had an instructor who led us on a hunt for the symbols within the story. She expalined the use of the symbols whether they were conciously put there by the author or whether they are a manifestation of societal mores and structure.The basic story line is that a poor boy falls in love with a rich girl. The poor boy goes off to make his fortune, the rich girl marries someone else. The poor boy comes back rich and finds the unhappily married girl. Chaos ensues. At first he is one of the &quot;in&quot; crowd. But Jay Gatsby still seems like the man trying to buy his way into high society. His attempt to woo Daisy from her philandering husband ends in tragedy for one of the &quot;little people&quot; in the story. As usual the old monied beautiful people are untouched by the petty problems of the rest of world, even if they are the cause. The entire story wrapped in beautiful prose as if to emphasize that with the proper wrapping even the ugliest present can look beautiful. The light of hope only blinks off once the contents are fully revealed."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is my all-time FAVORITE book. I was required to read it for my English class in high school. I had seen the movie with Robert Redford, and I thought it was okay. But after finding the way Fitzgerald portrays symbolism and foreshadowing, is just amazing. Also, he spends time on the little things about each character, making his writing exquisite. I read the Fitzgerald was a drunk while he was writing this, but he sure was smart! My English teacher pointed out some amazing things that I would never be able to think of in my whole life! This book is truely amazing, I highly reccomend it for anyone. It isn't a long book, and it is for anyone interested. You will be very happy after you read, and you'll know why people consider it to be the Great American Novel of the century."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This novel is more than just a novel--it is the English language used in the greatest essence of perfection. Fitzgerald has written out prose that intertwine so many elements, the heirarchy of American society, love, aspiration to the American Dream, the sign of the times in the Roaring Twenties, friendship, paradise, and paradise lost, yet it is all woven together so clearly, so vividly, so beautifully...Fitzgerald's prose is lyrical, sharp and intense. It is the height of the use of the English language. The devices used to keep the reader interested are borrowed, yet brought to a level of perfection, a level that the originators of these devices could never fathom.Comparing Fitzgerald's work to the work of more modern novelists, I see what the latter aspire to. I was supposed to read this in high school but neglected to. I wish this was the novel to have sparked my interest in the art of prose.In the Esquire article &quot;Monologue to the Maestro: A High Seas Letter&quot; by Ernest Hemingway, Hemingway talks about what makes a great writer. He says that reading the classics is something a writer should do &quot;...so he knows what he has to beat.&quot; He goes on to list classics that he feels are essential for a writer to read. In a modern times, &quot;Gatsby&quot; is a novel a writer should read &quot;so he knows what he has to beat.&quot;The Great Gatsby is not only a benchmark for writers, but a novel for anyone to read for its beautiful use of the English language, gripping story, and story structure. As I wish I could read Russian to fully understand the essence of classics like &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, I can imagine serious readers who cannot read English feeling the same way about a book like &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot;I recommend this book to anyone who is into fine art, for this is fine art of storytelling and the English language of the twentieth century. Furthermore, I suggest,in order for this novel to be fully enjoyed, that it be read in one sitting."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a book about the upper class in New York. It shows you how luxurious life can be but also how money doesn't bring total happiness. In this book the main character Nick Carraway is trying to break away from his country background and finds himself living in New York. What this book shows and what Nick finds out and doesn't like are the selfishness of the rich community, the backstabbing, and the shallowness in everybody. These are the reasons that Nick movies back to the country and marries his hometown sweetheart.In my opinion I didn't like this book for the same reason that Nick left to go back to the country. I thought it was a very difficult book to read because there was never any positive happening to these people and it moved at a slow pace. All the ladies in this book were selfish, shallow sluts who didn't care about anyone but themselves. This is shown when Daisy Buchanan has an affair with Gatsby. At the end of the book, when it comes down to choosing who she wanted to be with, she pick her husband just because Tom could offer her security and the life style she is accustomed to, not for true love. The men are not any better. They are also shallow, careless, and like to take risks. For example, Tom Buchanan is having an affair with Myrtle Wilson. Myrtle is the wife of George Wilson who owns a garage in the Valley of Ashes. Tom keeps an apartment for her in the city during this book which is the scene of a rather wild party.Even though I didn't like this book there were still a few parts that I liked. I thought it was sort of sweet how Gatsby had a never-ending love for Daisy. Even though she didn't deserve the kind of love Gatsby gave her, the relationship was kind of a fairytale without a happy ending. I also thought the way Gatsby died was interesting. It was perfect timing for a death because he never had to go through life suffering, knowing that Daisy his obsession, would never be with him. It was ironic that George Wilson was the one who shot Gatsby because Wilson thought Gatsby was the one who had an affair with and murdered his wife. In fact Gatsby did neither and the only one who came on top was Tom Buchanan, who was responsible for causing pain in both of the men's lives.All in all I didn't like this book. It was slow moving, boring, and depressing. If I had to recommend this book to a group of people, it would be to adults/teenagers with a lot of time on there hands or if you just like gossip."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This is the most overrated book of all time. It's all about ritzy partying, about the things that happen to people who party a lot. That's the great American dream -- sappy unrequited love before and after partying. I can't understand why it's revered in American literature. It doesn't have anything to offer but a melodramatic peek at the lives of very shallow characters. The characters sounded as if they were culled straight out of Beverly Hills 90210: The Jazz Age Version. The prose is masterfully done, but the story is just pathetic."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I have to say, this is one of those books where you feel like there is something important that you are missing when you read it. It seems to be about nothing on the surface, but for some reason, it feels like there is an undercurrent of meaning that just didn't come through for me.The book is narrated by a man named Nick, who moves out to West Egg on Long Island to learn about bonds in the 1920s. His cousin Daisy lives on East Egg with her husband Tom, though they don't have a good relationship.Next door to Nick lives a self-made millionare named Gatsby, who throws weekly wild parties at his house, but seems to have a sad secretive side. Gradually, Nick gets to know these people, but not a whole lot else seems to happen for quite a while. Tom has a mistress named Myrtle, who is married to a car mechanic.Eventually, Gatsby begins to confide in Nick, and tells him that he once knew Daisy and wanted to marry her, but left to fight in the war. By the time he came back she was already married. His wild parties were designed to attract her attention so he could see her again. Nick eventually gets them back together, and finally one hot day, Gatsby confronts Tom.They had gone into NYC for the day, and argue hotly over who Daisy really loves and who she's going to live with, but eventually, Tom pretty much wins. He sends Gatsby back to East Egg with Daisy while he stays with Nick and another girl, Jordan.Meanwhile, the car mechanic has finally discovered that his wife is cheating on him. He tries to lock her up, but she runs out the door and is hit by Gatsby's car. Driving by a little later, Nick and Tom see this and are convinced that Gatsby was driving, though it was really Daisy. Gatsby decides not to tell anyone the truth to protect her.By the next day, Tom and Daisy have left the state and Gatsby seems tranquil, but there is a sense of foreboding. Nick has to leave for work and when he returns, Gatsby is dead in his pool, killed by the mechanic because he thought Gatsby had killed his wife. This part was a little confusing.In the end, Daisy doesn't seem to really care about Gatsby, and no one comes to his funeral except for his father and Nick.By the end of the book, I definitely felt that it meant something, but it seemed very hazy and I couldn't figure out exactly what. I think it has something to do with caring more about appearances and money, than anything else. I would recommend reading this book as it was fairly enjoyable after the first chapter, but if you're a teenager you probably won't understand it completely. I'm going to do a re-read when I'm older and hopefully it will become clearer."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It's one of the worst book I ever had to read.

I think, due to my procrastination, I had to do so just a few days before a paper on some aspect of it was due. Can't remember what the topic was, but I know I turned it in late and Dr. Johnson was not pleased. I got a \\"C,\\" I think. Now, 25 years later, I read it again at the suggestion of Robert Girardi, author of several books and a collection of short stories (\\"A Vaudeville of Devils,\\" which I liked very much - a shameless plug).Wow. Did I even read this book then? I must have done so quickly and without much attention because it was a very good novel. A bit slow at the beginning, but as I learned about the characters and their connections to one another, I had to keep reading to see how it would all end. Tragically, by the way. And you see it coming, though I wasn't expecting to end as tragically as it did. Don't read further if you don't want to know what happens...So many people lying, living in a dream world: Gatsby, holding on to a past love/infatuation, believing he can re-create it years later, with a new name, a false front and all the trappings of a cultured, wealthy young man (actually gained through criminal activity); Daisy, aware of her husband's affair with someone, yet not confronting him, and engaging in an affair of her own with Gatsby that is really doomed from the start; Myrtle, who thinks Tom loves her more than his wife, but that illusion is \\"crushed\\" along with her nose; the guests of Gatsby, attending his parties only to get drunk and have some fun, most not knowing their host and not caring if they don't, parties only held so Gatsby can see Daisy again. And then there's Nick Carraway, the narrator, a self-described \\"honest man\\" who fails to confront these illusions with the truth. He doesn't tell his cousin Daisy about the details of her husband Tom's affair. Shouldn't he have, out of love for her? And he never really confronts Gatsby about his fantasy about re-connecting with Daisy, the long-lost love of his youth. Couldn't he have \\"talked some sense into him,\\" again, if he really cared about Gatsby? And when they all have it out at the hotel in NYC, why doesn't Nick call Tom on the carpet about his second life with Myrtle, as Tom is attacking Gatsby for his affair with Daisy? Finally, Nick could have told Wilson the truth about Myrtle and Tom after the accident, so Wilson's rage and desire for revenge would have not been misplaced. He could also have told the police that it was Daisy, not Gatsby, who was driving the car, and that it was Tom that was having an affair with Wilson's wife. Tom and Daisy make off like bandits, though not without scars, the illusion of their marriage apparently safe and sound; Myrtle and Wilson and Gatsby all experience the ultimate fantasy killer, death. Even Gatsby's dad is allowed to believe that he had a good boy, a smart boy, a successful boy. And Nick doesn't shatter his illusion. Out of compassion? Fear? Indifference? Speak up Nick; have some courage. You're \\"one of the most honest people you know.\\" So tell the truth to the people around you and maybe you can help them face reality and have better, honest lives, even if the price is the death of their fantasies and pretense.

The premise is decent enough and may have even been more original when he wrote it. But the fact is he wrote it quickly, across the ocean from his editor (no e-mail or faxes in those days), and the book apparently didn't even get edited appropriately before publication (Fitzgerald was already a success by the time he wrote this).The result is something barely fleshed out beyond your basic plot outline. This is just the bare bones, no character development, no real insight into what is happening, just a string of events that come to what Fitzgerald must have thought was a shocking conclusion (although you aren't entirely sure how you got there - we don't really know how Daisy made her decision). The ride is great though. Page after page of poorly edited text that reads like stream of consciousness, first draft writing as opposed to a finished work. I swear at least once he used a word that isn't even a word. It was so unintelligable that in certain editions (before they went back to previous Fitzgerald drafts and corrected the mistake) a simple grammatical error meant that you could think Daisy was pregnant before marrying Tom. Such a small error actually dramatically changes how you interpret the key plotline of the book.This book actually was not a smashing success upon publication, nor immediately after Fitzgerald's death. No, it became popular in the 1950s as America became obsessed with class differences and simultaneously fascinated and envious of the wealthy. This was the first novel in that space by pure happenstance because there wasn't much interest in the subject when Fitzgerald wrote it. So being first to market in public schools eager to stoke class differences, it was widely used in schools and took off from there.Utterly skippable. The best thing you can say about it is that for only 150 pages of your time, you too can claim to have read a classic novel."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"From reading reviews, it looks like I'm in the minority in being unimpressed with this book. Maybe I just didn't get it, but I found this modern classic to be just plain boring. The lives of upperclass Long Islanders in the 1920's was not interesting to me. I'm not sure how people consider this to be one of the best books written--what about Tolstoy, Dickens, Dostoevsky, etc.?"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I walked away very disapointed with 'the Great Gatsby'. Its said to be one of the best American novels of all time, yet I found it lacked maturity as well as development. The novel is about Nick Carraway's friendship with Jay Gatsby, a mysterious wealthy 30 year-old who throws lavish parties where most of the guests are not even invited and don't know the host at all. Gatsby reveals to Nick through a mutual friend named Jordan that the reason he has been throwing parties for years is because he hopes that the love of his life will somehow walk into one...Gatsby is a generous but painfully removed man who cannot forget Daisy,the love of his life who he hasn't seen in years, since before her marraige to another man named Tom. I thought that the plot was good, but it need more development and the characters needed more depth. 'The Great Gatsby' is a short read, I read it in a day, and found that Fitzgerald's style is continuous from that of his first novel, 'this Side of Paradise'. The only credit I do have to give to Fitzgerald is that his word flow is very readable and his revised sentences are nearly perfect. I wouldn't recommend reading it unless you are an absolute fan of Fitzgerald, you want to learn about the Roaring Twenties, or want a short and hardly romantic and at times boring read."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This can hardly be called a novel. It is, at best, a novella at roughly 150 pages. The craftsmanship that went into choosing words is obvious, but it is equally obvious that Fitzgerald didn't have much of an ability to create and tell stories. The novel moves ahead predictably, with nary a twist. Similarly, the characters are flat, each painted with an overly broad brush. None of the characters is multifaceted enough to maintain reader interest beyond the bounds of this tiny book.Clearly, this novel deserves the lack of attention it received when first released. It's too bad the 1950's gave rise to a class of pretentious persons who lifted this book up from the slime into which it had deservedly descended. It is thanks to them that school children across America are subjected to this tripe in the name of education.How many more children will have their budding love of reading destroyed by being forced to read such purile and juvenile garbage as this?Fortunately, I had been reading much longer, more complicated novels for many years by the time I was required to read this one in my Sophomore year of High School. I hated it then, but I thought at the time that it was I who was at fault. Now, some 15 years later, I've re-read the novel, and I find it to be almost completely without merit.It's a good thing I was already a reader by the time this garbage was inflicted upon me, or I might never have acquired a taste for books, thinking this was representative of the works available. Not many children have been so inoculated against poisonous works such as this one.Is it any wonder why American kids don't like to read?"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"THIS PARTICULAR EDITION OF THE FITZGERALD CLASSIC IS SUBLIME.

It seemed to lack depth. No real conflict. Fabulous people living fabulous, rich lives in the Hamptons. A nice escapist novel but not quite enough substance for me."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"There is this handful of books where empathy is actually possible with the first person narrator: Catcher in the Rye, The Bell Jar, Invisible Man, All the King's Men, god forbid - Lolita, throw in Bukowski for good measure, but also The Great Gatsby. These books throw us into their subject by allowing us to understand what it would be like to be in the same scenario, and we can better understand that type of life. I am uncertain what it is that links these, but perhaps the narrators' fear, uncertainty, and continuing effort to figure life out in spite of the knowledge that the effort will inevitably end in failure make them human and part of us. The Great Gatsby lets us live for a moment in the twenties without engaging in any truly great events, despite the title. If only there were one of these for every decade."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a novel centered around obsession, extravagance, and the perils associated with these things. The narrator is Nick Carraway, whose seemingly dull life is meant as a contrast with the lives of the other characters. Jay Gatsby is the title character, whose true identity remains hidden for most of the novel. He has created a life for himself: a new identity, a disreputable job, and elaborate parties, all a front to impress the woman of his dreams. Daisy Buchanan lives in fashionable East Egg, with her husband Tom. Their life is consumed by maintaining an outward faade of wealth and perfection. The truth, like Gatsby's life, is much less glamorous. Daisy is bored and restless, and Tom keeps a mistress in the City.Nick, at the beginning of the plot has rented a house on Gatsby's property, and conveniently is also Daisy's cousin. Gatsby comes up with the brilliant idea of recruiting Nick to help him seduce Daisy. Daisy is immediately attracted to the excitement that seems to surround Gatsby. The dangers of his business dealings, and the constant flow of strangers that attend his parties seem so different from her calm life with her husband. Both of them are desperate for some change, and believe that all their dreams will be realized when they are together.Fitzgerald in this novel has created an American classic. His tale of decadence and destruction is an essential work of fiction. He has taken the \\"roaring 20's\\", and shown the negative side of luxury and wealth. Although at times he seems to be advocating lewd parties, or adultery, he is merely trying to show what ends come to people who partake in these activities. One cannot help but sympathize with Gatsby. He is a man who is convinced that he must be something other than himself in order to impress the woman he loves. Yet all his efforts prove in vain when he realizes that Daisy would never make him happy, and still his pursuit of her still leads to his death.In reading this I felt that one could not help but enjoy it. The plot lacks dramatic action scenes, but this is made up for with the complex social situations that Fitzgerald showcases. Its appeal also lies in the readers' strange attraction to a character who is less than perfect (Gatsby), and distaste for a character who seems to have the least flaws (Nick)."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It tops more than one list of the greatest novels of all time. Sure, it's subjective, but everyone should read this book. I somehow didn't read it in high school, so I picked it up recently. It's great. And the movie with Robert Redford did a nice job of adapting it too."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is one of America's greatest literary achievements. This ranks on any short list of the greatest novels of the century. The tragic tale of Jay Gatsby is a character study, with every chapter a different facet of a manufactured persona. Gatsby never comes into complete focus, but that, oddly, is one of the strengths of the book. And Gatsby's love for his prewar flame Daisy rings true (a love she doesn't deserve). The other characters also are striking and brilliant. The plot too is poignant and tragic. And Fitzgerald's style and voice fit the story perfectly. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"This book is written in beautiful language, perfectly describing the events it depicts. When I read a book I get very frustrated with superfluous words and unnecessary narrative. Fitzgerald somehow describes a situation, and does so in a way that leaves you with no doubt as to what he is descrbing, without any excess. The levels of thought this book touches upon are amazing. To me its theme is simply that of disillusionment. Fitzgerald shows both a world we see and assume to exist and the things that lay beneath it. This is a book that by the closing pages you can easily feel it is a masterpiece even if you can't put your finger on why. Subsequent readings show the depth it reaches. It is truly a work of art."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The book The Great Gatsby was a wonderful book which told the story about one mans desire to win back the heart of his one true love.

One night Tom and Gatsby got into a fight leaving Daisy scared because she loved them both, she ended up doing something that Gatsby had to take the blame for. This book tells the story of tragic love and loss. I gave this book a 4 stars because I thought that it was a great book and it shows that people will do anything for true love.

Scott Fitzgerald is a great novel! I would first like to tell you that upon my first reading of the novel I was not impressed. My first reading of the novel was when I was a freshman in high school. I didn't enjoy reading nor did I appreciate writing at that time. My disliking of reading contributed and affected my views on the book drastically. I decided to give the book another try again seven years later and I love it! I think if the book is read by an experienced reader at any age, then one could appreciate the book for the many great aspects and details provided for the readers.This novel brings to us many feelings. It demonstrates to us how greed, wealth, love, ambition, success, lover's triangles, and one's desire can change life. Once all those things are linked together the plot becomes very intense. I enjoyed that the novel included all of those life's happenings.The plot to the novel is very exciting. It portrays the early 1900's and the Jazz Age beautifully. I enjoyed that the plot was directed towards what daily life could bring to one's self. The characters, plot, daily occurrences, opportunities, employment, and the struggles in the book were all a very good representation of early American life. I feel the book portrayed real life, real problems, and real people. While reading the book I never thought or found what I was reading to be far fetched.I enjoyed that the book was told by a character that wasn't the main character. I enjoyed the perspective that it gave by looking into Gatsby's life and not Gatsby simply being informative about his life story. I also enjoyed that the main characters were not the only focus in the book! There were additional characters that were linked in many different ways to the main ones and were introduced and then continuously followed upon. The book became to be a story about many people and how life\`s obstacles affected their decisions, choices, and life in general.I think anyone who enjoys reading should read this novel at least once. The novel has a very nice story line that I think most everyone should enjoy it! I give this book 4 stars!!!!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby written by F. Scott Fitzgerald takes place during the hot New York summer of 1922. On the surface the book is a romance between two estranged lovers, Gatsby and Daisy, but the heart of the book is a metaphor of the time. The symbolism is directly parallel to the disintegration of the American dream.The book is a wonderful read if you like the spider webs Fitzgerald weaves. The Great Gatsby is full of symbolism related to the time period, and a love story that is nothing short of ridiculous. I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spend reading The Great Gatsby. The book allowed my imagination to play out wonderful scenes with every page. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about undying love, and the lengths some people will go to obtain their dreams."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"&quot;Isn't it pretty to think so?&quot; Somehow that sentence captured my attention, and I began to picture young rich Americans from the jazz age.Reading this book at an age,beyond high school, made me re-think American literture and its contribution to intellectualism."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I reread this recently and loved it so much more than when I had to read it in high school. Fitzgerald's humor is so much more subtle than most humor writer's today and the funny lines are tucked between such beautifully crafted prose. The story is so simple - basically just describes a few parties at a mysterious Gatsby's mansion - but the humor and just enough foreshadowing keep you wanting to move forward. His observations of the young rich would fit in almost perfectly today. Inspired me to get back to writing my own book!By Jaimal Yogis, author ofSaltwater Buddha"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I suppose it's arguable that this is a great novel but it's certainly one of the best written in English in the first half of the twentieth century. It's the story of a man who fell in love with a flighty young girl five years earlier, lost track of her while trying to become worthy, then tried to \\"recapture the past\\" although she had reverted to flirtatious and materialistic form and married an enormously wealthy buffoon.Fitzgerald really hit it out of the park with this one. Nothing of his that I've read elsewhere -- excepting a few short stories and essays -- approaches the quality of \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" It's an immense literary achievement, though it's short and sweet.It's not a wildly experimental exercise in style -- not Joycean or Faulknerian. Fitzgerald's prose flows along in its own simple, comprehensible, ironic way, with occasional decorative adornments -- fractured sets of impressions here and there, but nothing to impede our interest in the plot.What I mean is that stuff HAPPENS in \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" Let me think. Adultery, illegal drinking, a horrible automobile accident, a smashed nose, impolite snubs, unabashed greed, suicide and murder.It's not a simple love story. Gatsby's love for the shallow Daisy is one of the few things that propel him. It's as fundamental to his character as the air he breathes. He's harnessed to it.Then there is the covert theme -- not very covert -- of social distinctions, the gap between the awesomely rich and the rest of us. Gatsby is marked as nouveau because \\"he wears a pink suit\\", drives a gaudy car, and hangs with the wrong people. \\"Rich girls don't marry poor boys,\\" is the way Daisy puts it, but she's wrong about that. She might better have said \\"old money doesn't marry new money.\\" It would still have been off the mark, but less so. And I'm compelled to mention the quietly comic observations that the narrator, Nick Carraway, makes from time to time.All this, and more, is given to us in some exquisitely genteel prose. Is it okay if I quote some examples? Fitzgerald is describing the desolate neighborhood near the gas station where his mistress lives. \\"This is a valley of ashes -- a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendant effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-gray men spring up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.\\"What he's done in this paragraph (I could have chosen a dozen others) is move subtly from the metaphorical to the real with our hardly being sensible of it. Of course, piles of ashes aren't really houses and chimneys, but the men with the spades are material enough. Yet the whole thing fits together like a painting, the laborers barely discernible among the clouds of ash.Fitzgerald can give us a flash shot of character. The narrator, Nick Carraway, visits Tom, an arrogant, cruel, self-indulgent ex-football player he met at Yale but hasn't seen for years. Tom waits for him, legs apart, at the stop of the stairs. Then he puts his arm over Nick's shoulders, turns him around, and sweeps his hand across the vista presented by the estate he lives in. Tom's first sentence: \\"I've got a nice place here.\\"Fitzgerald can write \\"pretty\\" too. Daisy and Tom live in an atmosphere that's constantly compared to champagne, wedding cakes, icing, filigree, and white toilet powder. Gatsby's night-time social brawls: \\"In his blue gardens, the girls and men came and went like moths among the champagne and the whispering and the stars.\\" One sentence gives us everything we need to know. \\"Blue gardens.\\" \\"Moths.\\"It's not just the style that makes this an outstanding novel. It's the structure too. In Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Psycho,\\" the major star, Janet Leigh, is murdered half-way through the film. One gasps, killing off the star with a brutal murderer who comes out of nowhere. Fitzgerald does pretty much the same thing with the mystery that constantly simmers behind Gatsby's real identity. Who is Gatsby? Where does he come from? How did he make his fortune? Did he kill a man? The answers are traditionally saved for the climactic ending but Fitzgerald throws them at us half-way through the story, as the maniac sweeps aside the shower curtain and puts an end to the heroine in the bath tub. A daring and risky step.When Gatsby finally begins to grasp Daisy's true nature, \\"he must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is....\\" And, of course, the book's last sentence is one of the best remembered in American literature, drawing our attention in the direction of dead visions, and not just Gatsby's."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I absolutely love this book. It's one of my all time favorites, the paradigmatic story of romantic obsession (which, like all true romances, ends in betrayal or death--in this case, both). What raises this romance far above the genre is its profound insights into both human nature and America as an ideal and a culture, and the quality of Fitzgerald's writing: from his masterly employment of literary tropes and his gorgeous prose to his unforgettable characters and evocative descriptions of places and events, Fitgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby\\" sets unsurpassed standards for great fiction. It has a permanent place on my bookshelves and in my heart.The San Val hardback edition is a step up if you want this for a home library. But if I were going to buy a hardback and also wanted a great scholarly introduction to the text, I'd invest in the Harold Bloom critical edition."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I read Great Gatsby back in Junior High and my only real memories were that it was boring and the characters were unloveable/unredeemable.Finally getting around to re-reading it with more literature behind me, I have a much different take. While still not a favorite read of mine, I found it more entertaining than I remember and I actually came away engaged in the story and the characters.Reading it this time, I was more distinctly aware of the prohibition era in which these characters were revolving and the extent to which that directed some of their actions. The drinking/partying took on a new aspect. It also gave me a greater perception into Gatsby's character and his relation to society as a whole and the society he was trying to 'break into' (Daisy's).There was still plenty of superficiality to the characters...but that doesn't mean these characters are flat. On the contrary, I saw a lot more depth this time around than in my early teens. I was very impressed by the way Fitzgerald added so much depth to these characters while at the same time providing them with so little substance.I enjoyed looking more closely at the interactions between Gatsby and Daisy and the way the various relationships worked. Now that I've actually dated and married, I viewed the relationships in a different light and could better understand the tension, jealousy and hypocritical behavior going on.I would like to have seen more development of the pseudo-relationship between Nick and Jordan, but I think leaving it vague throughout and then ending it abruptly allows for more in-depth thinking than if Nick and Jordan had happily escaped the tragedy surrounding them.I seem to remember there being significant discussion about the East/West geography in my Junior High English class...but reading it this time, I just didn't see that as a main motif. Sure, we had \\"West Egg\\" and \\"East Egg\\" and various New York parties and excursions. But when you get down to it, the East/West thing didn't work...partly because all of the main characters are just transplanted anyway (they all came from the west/midwest) and partly because the culture around them felt contrived anyway rather than some high culture that would be representative of the \\"true culture\\" of established Eastern money or whatever.I had forgotten some of the details of the climax and the ending and so was a little taken off guard when everything unraveled. Parts of the climax scenes felt a little rushed or underdeveloped, but still provided a satisfying turn of events to the story arc, even if the end of the book left me a little unsettled (which is part of the intent, I believe).My initial rating from my Junior High memories was 2 out of 5 stars. With a more mature perspective on reading and having read a whole lot more and learned a whole lot more, I can give a better rating and say that I can see now why this book is held up as a classic. It's not the action packed thriller or adventure novel that I may have wanted as a young teenager, but it is a thought provoking and engaging narrative exploring class and relationships in a turbulent world.****4 stars"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"My daughter's AP English teacher assigned Gatsby to her as a summer reading project.

I strongly believe that everyone who rated this classic novel below a 3 stars didn't fully grasp the symbolism in the characters, the location (East/West Egg, Dr. T's Eyes), the green light or the meaning of any of the relationships. It's a really quick read, 180 pages, you can do it in one day...but read with much concentration! Go back to your college days and remember that legendary authors, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, crafts his work so that NOTHING is written by mistake. The setting, the colors, the dialogue, they all have an underlying meaning.I would also recommend reading a little biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald before reading \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" because then you'll know that it's somewhat autobiographical, being that he is from the Midwest and he was a solider.Overall, reading The Great Gatsby requires immense concentration and an understanding of literature/symbolism. If you do some prior research, then you'll realize WHY it is a classic.And don't just skip the book and watch the movie (with Robert Redford), because the book is MUCH MUCH better."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I found a copy of this book in a very small, very messy book store in my area and decided to give it read. Fitzgerald from the start is extremely descriptive yet brief and poetic. What I find so very impressive about this book is it's ability to make you understand the depths of both the 1920's and the place this story has in it; yet the story and themes are not just easy to relate to, they are fresh even after 90 years. I am an actor and while reading the last 4-5 pages I found myself reading aloud from the book because the conclusion and final thoughts of the character telling the story are written in a profound way; one that makes me feel they should be spoken so that the meaning won't be lost."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Aside from the narrator, Mr. Carroway, who chances to be Gatsby's perceptive neighbor, we are the only ones who ever come to know the man. Everyone else sees only a fragment of him... if that. And he is far from what he appears to be. We ultimately know him as delusional, obsessive, pitiable, and needy. The fact is he's quite a bit like many of us; the difference is in the contrast between his external persona and his internal one. Fitzgerald's remarkable achievement in this book is in portraying Gatsby's dimensionality so completely in 180 pages. From shadowy playboy to abandoned corpse in 180 pages. And in the process Fitzgerald treats us to his remarkable craft:\\"Instead of rambling, this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside - East Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.\\"\\"...there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.\\"\\"Everyone suspects himself of at least one cardinal virtue...\\"\\"He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths - so that he could \`come over' some afternoon to a stranger's garden.\\"\\"...I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes.\\"\\"There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind...\\"\\"At the gray tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the room.\\""},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"My personal choice for The Great American Novel - with an emphasis on the American. This is, as narrator Nick Carraway notes, a story of the West after all.Fitzgerald's masterpiece captures the American dream at a point in time, and yet in a way that resonates down to us today. It remains the most accessible of the classics. I can't recall enjoying re reading a book more. Just a delight. Every chapter, every page, is luminous and heart breaking.I returned to the book, haunted in many ways, not so much by Gatsby as by Carraway, the narrator, who happens to be in the perfect position to observe the Gatsby/Daisy Buchanan love story, as a relative of Daisy and a neighbor of Gatsby's.It was his sense of being an outsider looking in, or being more observer than participant in events, with which I most cloely identified. In many ways I still think of it as Nick's book, and this re reading confirmed the notion."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I do not understand why this is a classic, for the following reasons:1.

I'm inclined to reserve all judgments. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope\\" (5-6). F. Scott Fitzgerald opens The Great Gatsby with Nick's commentary to define his purpose for The Great Gatsby: no one can't judge others; he can only allow the different arguments of a situation to lead to a point of cognitive dissonance, define his hopes, and strengthen him as a person. Some view The Great Gatsby as a love story about Fitzgerald and Zelda, his wife, through Gatsby and Daisy's relationship, while others dig deeper to find underlying controversial issues of bisexuality through Gatsby and Dan Cody's relationship. These were just tactics Fitzgerald uses to bring the reader to a point of cognitive dissonance so he will discover his deepest hopes and unshakable beliefs. Great pieces of literature use such tactics.Set in the suburbs of New York City, The Great Gatsby tells Nick Carraway's story of the quirky character Jay Gatsby. It focuses upon Gatsby's love and pursuit of Daisy Buchanan, while reflecting upon his detour relationship with Dan Cody. From beginning to end balanced evidence for each relationship allows presents the reader to ponder Gatsby's personal life and intentions, with a choice of focusing on the obvious and judging what is right or wrong or weighing the different arguments to determine personal hopes.One reviewer claims that The Great Gatsby is a love story modeled after Fitzgerald and Zelda's marriage, especially through Daisy and Gatsby's relationship. Gatsby and Daisy's past was electric. When young, they were so engrossed in each other that Daisy didn't notice Jordan Baker five feet away! Ms. Baker describes it as romantic how Gatsby looked at Daisy. This reviewer's argument that the novel was a pure love story is logical but too obvious to be Fitzgerald's purpose for writing the novel. Another reviewer questions the intentions of Gatsby's \\"youthful relationship\\" with Dan Cody and suggests that Gatsby may be bisexual. Gatsby and Dan Cody's first meeting was electric, also. Gatsby smiled and Cody found him \\"quick and extravagantly ambitious\\" (106). Cody bought him expensive clothes and even included him in his will. This \\"arrangement,\\" as he called it, might have lasted indefinitely; that is, until Cody's wife stepped in. This is a more sophisticated, intuitive suggestion but still not Fitzgerald's purpose for writing the novel. Fitzgerald provides supporting evidence for both relationships to prevent the reader from knowing exactly how Gatsby feels; to prevent the reader from making a judgment. Every great writer uses similar tactics of weighing arguments with limited information to push the reader to a greater level of understanding. For example, George Orwell's 1984 weighs unattached versus emotional sex; Nathaniel Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter weighs parental obligations versus social status; Shakespeare's Othello weighs fate versus decisions; John Cheever's \\"Enormous Radio\\" weighs privacy versus safety. Each presents arguments concerning judgment and hope to lead the reader to a point of cognitive dissonance and relate it to his personal life, learning that he is unable to make a polar judgement about another person's life. Fitzgerald is exemplifying that the reader can't make forthright judgements about Gatsby's personal relationships, especially his sexual preference; the reader can only weigh each argument with his personal hopes and determine what is best for himself.Sure, Fitzgerald could have used his marriage as a model for the novel, and clear evidence supports that Gatsby has bisexual tendencies. Neither of these was Fitzgerald's purpose for writing the novel. Every great writer uses these tactics in for a greater purpose. Any writer could attack social issues or write a love story, but it takes a great author to change a reader's life."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"In F. Scott Fitzgeralds's novel The Great Gatsby, he manages to completely bore his reading audience by slowing down his depiction of the fictional story. This novel has a bittersweet storyline to it, which can keep a reader hooked at certain points, but not all throughout the novel. The love between Jay Gatbsy and the married Daisy Buchanan is just enough to keep this story going, without it, Fitzgerald has nothing to keep anyone wanting to pursue the plot. The strength of the characters in this novel is also questionable. This book is one that will not be missed for those who would like to read about little excitement once in a while. The Great Gatsby is a decent piece of fiction, but its slow formation, poor narration, and lack of enthusiasm fails to keep its audience entwined.The introduction in this novel should just be skimmed, because reading would take too much time and it is far too detailed for any intro. Much of the background that Fitzgerald puts into the story is unnecessary and for the most part, mundane. At one point, he goes into detail describing pages of guests that go to one of Jay Gatsby's numerous parties. ALthough this book does move slowly, some of the romantic moments between Jay and Daisy do cause a little bit of suspense in the storyline. The ending to this story is also another drawn out process. It is again filled with a bunch of statements that really do not pertain to the story as a whole. The end is full of sentimental thoughts that do not really mean much to the reader. Basically, Fitzgerald becomes extremely wordy when he begins and finishes the Great Gatsby.Nick Carraway, the narrator in this story is a poor character. As he tells about the individual lives of the characters, he seems to give off a sense of detachment. Being the narrator, of course, he might be somewhat not as important as the rest of the characters; however, it is almost as if he was not even a part of the story. The book would have been better without him because he did not do much to give a true insight on the feelings of each person. He is far too conservative for a person who is supposed to give the opinions about the actions of the main people in the two love triangles. Perhaps if Nick were more a direct and upfront about his take on the romantic episodes Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan along with Myrtle Wilson and Tom Buchanan, the audience might be enthusiastic about reading.Fitzgerald uses his own life experiences as a guide in this story, which in a way helps readers understand some parts of the chemistry between Jay and Daisy during the roaring twenties. The poor guy that Fitzgerald used to be was Jay and the beautiful rich girl that he was in love with, but could not have, was the married Daisy Buchanan. Although the plot might be fascination enough to keep some readers going others may find the general story far too detailed and at some parts boring. Sure, the ending might serve as the spontaneity that readers were waiting for; however, they should not have to wait until the end to be surprised. Most authors may throw the readers many times during a story in order to provoke those people into guessing what might happen. Fitzgerald does that less than a few times making the novel less enthralling.The Great Gatsby is a great story if one can truly appreciate its many details along with its wordy introductions and closings. A reader needs more than patience alone to read this book all at once. Now wonder this book did not receive the acclaim that it has now, when it was first published."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I don't understand. This book is called the Great Gatsby, but everyone in the book treats Gatsby like he's regular size. What's so great about that? I mean, if he were a giant or something, that would be totally sweet, but if he's just a normal size guy, then why does he get a whole book about his greatness?All I really remember about this book is there are some strange things about lights on the shore, and a chick named Daisy, which made me think about the Dukes of Hazard a little bit, but that's it. I sorta vaguely remember Gatsby fighting a jive talking robot, but it was in one of the later chapters, so I won't ruin it for you.You can read this book if you want, but I'd recommend you try and figure out who is better: Kitt from Knight Rider, or the Orange car from Dukes of Hazard."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It truly is.

He can't stand the thought of mixed relationships, \\"next thing they'll have intermarriage between blacks and whites\\" (p.137). Oddly enough Fitzgerald gives Tom that line to describe the significance of the suspected extra marital affair between his wife Daisy and Gatsby. Was he inferring that becuz Gatsby was not a European white (Tom refers to himself and his crowd as Nordics) he was doomed to fall?Tom's a avid reader of white power literature alluding to the authors as \\"scientists\\". He warns everyone that 'coloured' races will take over if left unchecked. Airheaded Daisy (the rich and of course white object of Gatsby's affection) agrees, remarking admiringly, \\"Tom's..very profound\\".Tom also chooses the underdog to conduct an illicit affair--his mechanic's wife, Myrtle. Of course Tom goes unpunished for his adulterous behaviour while Myrtle is killed in a hit and run, courtesy of Daisy, who also gets off unscathed. Gatsby takes the fall for her.James Gatz is of course a Jewish name, which Gatsby changed in his late teens showing his own shame for his ethnicity. Of course the shifty Jewish criminal, Mr. Wolfsheim has a poor command of the English language. Nick, the narrator mocks his versions of \\"Oggsford\\" for Oxford and \\"goneggtion\\" for connection.At the end the poorest people are wiped out, the mechanic and his cheating wife (for whom Tom sheds a hypocritical crocodile tear). Narrator Nick refers to the mechanic's death as \\"the holocaust\\".Can't say I enjoyed this novel, Gatsby fell in foolish love with a high-maintenance, forbidden woman because she was white, full of money and the fineries that went with it. It wasn't a pure love story. In the end Gatsby paid with his life while Tom and Daisy (who I'll call a spineless murderess for not admitting to anyone her responsibility in the manslaughter of Myrtle) continue their high lifestyle scot-free.Was Fitzgerald trying to say the underclass doesn't have or deserve a chance in hell?"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"it has no purpose.....its a hard to readboring book!?!?!? i dont find it that interesting...but i have to read it for school so what can you do?"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Deceptively simple...beautiful language, memorable story and characters, many layers...i've read this three times. very quick, enjoyable read. learn something new every time."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Surely everything has been said before.

Frank is easily one of my favorite performers and was a truly great loss in the field."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a small, quick read classic novel. While many consider it to be the finest of American novels, I personally didn't find it to rank quite that high. It is however a very good book, and although I somehow did not read the book until my 30's, I can understand why it is so widely required in many high school and college courses.Mr. Fitzgerald paints a vivid picture of the \\"Jazz Age\\" of the 1920's and most of the book is centered on New York City and Long Island's North Shore. I found a lot of parallels to today throughout the book. The Great Gatsby gives a detailed development of how the never ending quest for material objects and riches can corrupt someone to their soul if a proper grounding in what is truly is important isn't present.Mr. Fitzgerald also provides excellent character development; creating characters that can be rooted for and loathed at the same time. In the end it is shown how shallow pursuits can lead to a road of destruction and dismay."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I just finished reading this book for honors english class and i actually enjoyed it. I didn't know what to expect so i was really surpised at how good the writing is. I agree with the reviewer who said the genius of this book is not just the story but the meanings hidden within the text. It really is extraordinary writing. You could analyze almost every sentence in this book and find a hidden or alternate meaning. The story wasn't edge of your seat action but it was still very interesting. The book really makes you think Fitzgerald was far ahead of his time. It's a book that deserves its place as one of the greatest American fiction books of all time. I would definitely recommend it to any one interested in reading a book that makes you think a little."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"It's difficult to give any even-handed critique F. Scott Fitzgerald's standard-setting Jazz Age novel since it was required reading for most of us in high school. However, if you come back to it as a full-fledged adult, you'll find that the story still resonates but more like a just-polished cameo piece from a forgotten time. At the core of the book is the elaborate infatuation Jay Gatsby has for Daisy Fay Buchanan, a love story portrayed with both a languid pall and a fatalistic urgency. But the broader context of the setting and the irreconcilable nature of the American dream in the 1920's is what give the novel its true gravitas.Much of this is eloquently articulated by Nick Carraway, Gatsby's modest Long Island neighbor who becomes his most trusted confidante. Nick is responsible for reuniting the lovers who both have come to different points in their lives five years after their aborted romance. Now a solitary figure in his luxurious mansion, Gatsby is a newly wealthy man who accumulated his fortunes through dubious means. Daisy, on the other hand, has always led a life of privilege and could not let love stand in the way of her comfortable existence. She married Tom Buchanan for that sole purpose. With Gatsby's ambition spurred by his love for Daisy, he rekindles his romance with Daisy, as Tom carries on carelessly with an auto mechanic's grasping wife. Nick himself gets caught up in the jet set trappings and has a relationship with Jordan Baker, a young golf pro.These characters are inevitably led on a collision course that exposes the hypocrisy of the rich, the falsity of a love undeserving and the transience of individuals on this earth. The strength of Fitzgerald's treatment comes from the lyrical prose he provides to illuminate these themes. Not a word is wasted, and the author's economical handling of such a potentially complex plot is a technique I wish were more frequently replicated today. Most of all, I simply enjoy the book because it does not portend a greater significance eighty years later. It is a classic tale that provides vibrancy and texture to a bygone era. It is well worth re-reading."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby along with The Sun Also Rises is one of the most alluring and fantastic portrayals of a certain time-period of thought and decadence in American history. The roaring 20s, the Jazz Age, is captured in all of it's wanton desires, greed, and debaucherous elegance. Throwing lavish parties and stopping at nothing to make his idealized relationship come true, Jay Gatsby chases his dream girl with reckless abandon. Despite the lavishness of his monetary wealth and possessions, the end produces tragic consequences, broken relationships, and broken dreams that leave the protagonists mending their emotional and physical wounds.The use of symbolism and double-meanings is truly profound as Fitzgerald creates a canopy of subtle messages of the dangers present in the pursuit of illogical desires. Much of this novel parallels Fitzerald's own tumultuous relationship with his wife Zelda and the fragments left behind from the real-life counterpart year's later are stunningly analogous to the results explored in this novel. A masterpiece of literature that continues to stimulate the mind and interest of the reader in its exploration of deep seated human foils."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I'm somewhat taken aback by the number of negative reviews of a work that has a quite well-deserved reputation as a classic of American literature. Its prose may seem dated to the MTV generation, but it was certainly \\"modern\\" for its time. Treating \\"Gatsby\\" as a curious historical or sociological artifact misses all but the bare surface of the work. I recommend a careful re-reading to those who found it difficult to digest - perhaps paying more attention to how Gatsby's dream shaped what he did throughout his life, and what the final result might tell us about human nature in the context of the American ethos."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Very easy read; a book that I've always thought of reading, but just recently did.How interesting that Gatsby accumulated a fortune and styled his entire life in the hopes of regaining Daisy.I liked the symbolism of the eyes on the billboard. They seemed to be the conscience of all the characters, though could it have symbolized God? Interesting."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"In 1922 during the jazz age, F. Scott Fitzgerald brings forth an extra ordinary tale of love. Fitzgerald was made to write a smooth and entertaining novel such as, The Great Gatsby, which became a classic of the twentieth century literature. F. Scott Fitzgerald carefully selects his characters' words as he describes the astounding and fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his strong, innocent intentions as he strives to exalt his love to the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. The Great Gatsby is a tragedy amongst the wealthy and the poor. It is irresistibly melancholy but funny, while light but sensible from beginning to the end.The story depicts Gatsby's obsession with his one true love, Daisy, whether he was right or wrong to love her, his love for her robs life of all its meaning and purpose. Fitzgerald writes a phenomenal novel, that without a doubt, can be called a masterpiece. His choice of words is very articulate and the description he embodies in every sentence is pleasurable for all readers. Fitzgerald helps the reader to become a part of the novel and connect with the characters. He writes to make his readers be aware of their imaginations, while making them picture the narration perfectly down to the very last detail. Fitzgerald creates fictional characters, such as Gatsby that one can fascinate to and enjoy reading about. This novel is hard to put down, its very easy flowing once you start you just have to finish it!. The book is so dramatic and entertaining that it's easy to miss the fact that it's beautifully written.A work to remember, for I usually have trouble connecting with other books I read for Literature class. The Great Gatsby was such a breakthrough, and a good attempt to get my fascination of dramatic, and suspenseful novels into place. I highly suggest for anyone who would like to read a dreamy, classy, and an outstanding story to pick up The Great Gatsby. The story gives a new thrill of a Shakespearean story \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" with a sensational twist at the end. It proves that not every love story ends beautifully, or the way the main character would like it to, which makes Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby an even more sophisticated and like no other.This story is not like your average \\"love story\\", it gives away more than you expect. And that clearly shows how an author develops his master piece as he progresses with his writing. I am sure that many young adult readers that come across The Great Gatsby will surely enjoy reading it. It is surely a dramatic novel at it's best!"},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Here's one of the most read American novels. Sure, it's been heaped with praise since the critics of the mid-1920s were thinking about worshipping a new messiah. But let's face it: their enthusiasm was on the right mark.The Great Gatsby is a swift, gorgeously written story about people we don't seem to have anything in common with. These are confused, wandering, sub-stratispheric members of an even more deeply ingrained sub-culture that, for the modern reader, also has no bearing on anyone they will ever encounter. And yet the prose and the narrative force of this novel imbues these alien characitures with the sweet and stunning glow of life. They transform into very human beings caught up in much of the youthful pain and torment of anyone who ever dreamed of success. It is a tragic, heart-rending story of broken-hearts and insincere love as well as an epic portrait of nearly an entire generation of people embodied in the character of their greatest ambitions. This book soars higher and higher with the passage of time and continues to force students, sometimes, to realize that they can enjoy reading a novel.A wonderful, extraordinary book that tends to stay with you for a long time."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Roaring Twenties, also known as the Jazz Age, was a very American response to World War I. Until 1917, America had kept her distance from the commotion on the European continent, and it was indeed the Great War that pushed America out of her hesitant isolation and onto the world scene. The tremendous moral confusion and psychological disillusionment thus unleashed by America's involvement in the gruesome war of attrition hailed a new generation of artists. F. Scott Fitzgerald, one of the most prominent writers to have emerged from this generation of artists, framed his generation's struggle in The Great Gatsby. By placing his protagonist in the midst of Long Island, NY's dazzling elite and glamorous parties, Fitzgerald presents to us a son of the Jazz Age whose post-WWI pursuit of the \\"short-winded elations of men\\" is so characteristic of that era. But Gatsby, a decorated hero from the indecisive battlefields of WWI and also a fabulously rich man, is not a character whom Fitzgerald intends for the readers to admire. Instead, Fitzgerald hints that there is a considerable distance between the man that Gatsby is and the man he is capable of being. Thus it appears only ironic that Fitzgerald should choose to title his novel The GREAT Gatsby. But in the wake of America's political readjustment on the world scene and internal social shift, Gatsby comes to symbolize an age of great aspirations that ended in hollow grandeur. And as a protagonist who successfully embodies \\"an unbroken series of successful gestures\\", Gatsby captures Fitzgerald's own great vision of a complacent American society, numbed by shallow pleasures, and ultimately betrayed by the very dream of greatness his generation hoped to achieve.Intrigued yet? Read the novel and find that green light beyond the foul dust of all that's tangible. Welcome to the world of Jay Gatsby."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I just finished listening to the unabridged audio version of The Great Gatsby.

The commute was the best part of the day and strangely I was actually glad when I got caught in traffic.F. Scott Fitzgerald's writting style and use of words was beautiful and the story was very interesting as well.

It was close to five, but just did not make it, and I can't quite put my finger on it."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Nick Carraway is an unsuspecting Long Island-dweller living in a small house that is sandwiched between mansions. Through two old acquaintances, Tom Buchanan and his wife, Daisy, he learns that one of his neighbors is the rich, extravagant Jay Gatsby, who soon invites him to one of the periodic late night parties on his property. At this party, he befriends Gatsby and soon becomes intertwined in his story. He finds that Gatsby's money was earned through illicit methods, and sees his friend's incongruously idealistic character. Finally, he watches as Gatsby is confronted by his past in the form of Daisy Buchanan.During WWI, five years before the events recounted in The Great Gatsby took place, Jay Gatsby was a soldier stationed in Louisville. There, he met Daisy, and in his romanticism, he believed that it was everlasting, mutual love at first sight. Four years later, when Gatsby discovered Daisy's marriage, he moved to Long Island, where his past lover and her husband were now residing.We see Jay Gatsby's incredible idealism, inharmonious with the rest of his character, which is, to me, the most significant characterization in the entire novel. It is the one aspect of the story that allows the reader to keep reading, feeling that everything might be eventually work out. How Gatsby hopes against hope, believes against belief, that Daisy, after five years, still loves him, is a tribute to the human spirit. His complete confidence during his confrontation with Tom Buchanan shows the incredible ability within us all to trust in a reflection of the past. It makes us all Gatsby's friends, makes us hope with him, wish with him, have faith in him. Gatsby's romanticism makes readers aspire to or even believe that they have this incredible love of \\"a green light at the end of the dock\\", a symbol of the hope that has been lost and yet is still there.I would recommend this book to everyone, although some slight racism and sexism common at the time the novel was written may discourage sensitive readers. The literary style and word usage is, for lack of a better description, incredible, and the book's plotting is superb. The Great Gatsby realistically portrays both the best and the worst of human attributes and allows any reader to identify with the characters, no matter how far-fetched this might seem. F. Scott Fitzgerald's book is the epitome of American literary accomplishment and a must read for any serious booklover."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"I gave Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby a shot recently outside of school. There are both things I love about the book and things that I found a little tedious. On the positive side, I enjoyed the social insight, the lyricism, the story in general. Fitzgerald was truly blessed with the gift of words, and the use of imagery gives this classic much staying value. It is just so real it comes alive in your head. The story of Jay Gatsby, who has grown wealthy (on the shady side of the law as it turns out) and his love for Daisy Buchanan is still affecting today. I disliked how it took a while for the story to get really moving, it was a little tedious sometimes. But don't let that spoil it for you.

Upon finishing &quot;Gatsby&quot; this semester, he said it was the first book by an American author he found to be unequivocally beautiful. Fitzgerald, in his classic novel about Nick Carraway, Jay Gatsby, and the American Dream, not only delivers a message with which every American can identify, but writes with such an amazing lyricallity that at times I simply had to stop reading to visualize the beautiful descriptions he gives in the novel. This book is a classic; a must have for anyone who was not fortunate enough to read it while still in school, but even those who did should own a copy."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"Gatsby is one of those novels that I love to come back to and reread. It's really a writers' textbook that teaches by example how to extend, invent, and use language in new and effective ways. For it's a rare book that gets this amount of meaning into a sentence and it's a rare book that has the dimensions and extraordinary intensity of impression that its paragraphs carry. Scenes blaze with life and it all goes by so fast I always end up with the feeling that I have finished a short story not a book. In Gatsby Fitzgerald is more in command and control than he is in all his other novels put together including The Last Tycoon, Tender is the Night, The Beautiful and the Damned, and This Side of Paradise. Gatsby is a novel with few false moves, a simple story and a simple plot. One might say almost perfect in structural simplicity, but the meanings are complex creating the suggestion that there is more, much more, under the surface, which incidentally there is. Part of the subtext is brought out by rich symbolism. Who will ever forget the weird eyes of T.J. Eckleburg looking over the wasteland of ash and what that means? Who will ever forget the green light at the end of Daisy's dock and what that means? If you haven't read this classic of twentieth-century literature, please read it. If you have read it, you might profit by going back after you have matured some more and rereading."},{"Title":"Great Gatsby (Everyman)","review":"The Great Gatsby is a novel that breeds contrasting opinions from readers throughout. That is definitely a sign of a great, classic piece ofliterature. If a novel was written and full of adulation and honour, it would not be a good book, because human thinking seeks entertainment and the literal sense of words, therefore a book that is both loved and hated at the same time proves to be one which offends and intrigues audineces in such a vast, drastic way, that its ablty to do this makes itself a masterpiece. The myriad themes in this novel are what sets it apart from all others. The rise and fall of the American Dream is portrayed in which we can all see the rise and fall of success in our lives and forces us to think whether we should proceed with our lives, living in superficiality and materialism as Daisy and Tom did. The passion and obsessive love that Gatsby hold for Daisy is unrecognizable today, and it brings a sort of mystery and wonderment of what it could be should it be refelcted at present. The Great Gatsby is based upon equality, socail discrimination and our human ideals. It revolves around what we perceive is important, happiness or materialism and while we go about careless of others and absorbed by ourselves, what are we trying to prove? God is in fact watching us and as we try to achieve success and beconme happy using guidelines other than those of reaching the genuine American Dream, we are doomed to failure.

It is important to know what the book is about in order to know why everyone admires its beauty. Fitzgerald wrote this novel as an example of the famous \\"American Dream\\". The story is based on a man who has devoted his life to the fulfillment of his platonic conception of himself. Jay Gatsby had chosen Daisy to incarnate this dream, but nothing would be easy for him.

Even more broadly it is novel about how we as humans live in a more or less permanent denial of our death, our ageing and despite the fact that that is the only physical fact about our journey through life that we can count on.The novel doesn't assert one path as better than another in terms of dealing with \\"remember you must die.\\" We might appreciate those who honor the statement over those that don't but death or God or life doesn't give anyone brownie points for any of it."},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"It's a rare novel that mostly peoples its world with the elderly and explores the recognition of the unavoidability of death. Muriel Spark takes a gander via a social comedy that cuts through a few layers of London society circa 1957 (this was published in 1959). Throughout the story, a variety of characters who were born Victorians, were young and full of intrigue as Edwardians, and achieved middle age between the wars, experience various degrees of physical and mental decline. Beginning with the large and bossy Dame Lettie Colston, one by one, they get anonymous calls with a speaker who says the same thing each time: \\"Remember you must die.\\" Depending on who is receiving the call, the reaction ranges from horror to dismissal, but all stir to life in ways they have not been stirred for some time. Fifty-year-old secrets rise up and cause trouble. One of the characters is a blackmailer. There are wills and fortunes to be made and contested. Meanwhile, an elderly poet is trying to get the experience artistically while a doctor measures their lives scientifically to get at the mystery of age and death. It's hard to keep a lid on.It is a mare's nest and this review could roll on for paragraphs trying to sort out the carefully woven characters and plotlines, not to mention spoiling them. The irony and wit are rich, and so is the vision of the spiritual realities of death as part of life. Those wanting a traditional mystery plot may be confounded by the outcome to the question of who is molesting everyone with the calls, but then it was not meant to be a straightforward mystery. It can be gritty in places. The image of the working class women for whom retirement means a large, privacy-free ward in a hospital is devastating. When I was visualizing the action, it came through in black and white imagery--this was London recovering from the war, with glimpses of bomb shelters and ruins here and there. Spark uses very little color in her descriptions, if at all.This is an artistic success and a pleasure to read. I've nicked it one star only because I liked some of the author's other books better, like A Far Cry From Kensington and The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie."},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"What a wicked sense of humor, loved the geriatric cast of characters. The older generation has never been more fascinating. It's dark, twisted, and infused with the inevitability of degeneration and demise. There's also an intriguing cameo by the Almighty, which just took the whole thing to an unexpected level. Loved it."},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"The central subject of this book is old age and the creepy perception of death approaching. All characters are old, and the story reflects their individual attitudes and response to death's proximity. The main character is Dame Lettie Colston, a rich spinster who begins to receive enigmatic phone calls by a stranger who, calling her by name, reminds her that she will die soon. Dame Colston then pesters the police, who reluctantly open an investigation and even recruit a retired detective. Then some of Lettie's acquaintances start experiencing the same phenomenon, and the detective sustains interviews with each one. Some of them get terrorized, some others joke with the caller, some others call the police, and some simply hang up and forget about it. It becomes the detective's nightmare that every one gives a different description of the voice: some say it's a young man (kind, agressive, sad, or creepy), some say he's an older man, the point is no one gives the same account.In the course of the narration, two subplots appear, perfectly intertwined with the main thread: on the one hand, the diverse errands of the characters, which show the very different ways in which people face old age and death (these characters include Lettie's sister in law, who suffers from senile dementia); on the other hand, the story of Lettie's ex-nurse, interned in a residence for the terminally-ill, and its microcosmos.Funny, sharp, necessarily possessed by a black sense of humor, this novel is a great dissection of the final phase of life. One surprising thing is that the author was then still far from it."},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"Muriel Spark has been called \\"witty,\\" or \\"clever,\\" and while that is quite an accomplishment, I would prefer if a novel was deep. The only other Spark work I've read is _The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie_, a masterpiece of irony. Perhaps after World War II, the arc of characters with interior consciousness like those of V. Woolf, had ended, and Spark and others were what readers wanted. Something about this novel reminded me of the BBC TV series imported to the USA, _Waiting for God_. However, in _Memento Mori_, there is a sinister element which is really dark, the crank phone calls to Dame Lettie, \\"Remember you must die.\\"Part of the sadness or pain of the novel is that people don't become wiser as they grow older--and they often, still, don't have the power or will to reflect on their lives. There is no question that all of the characters are well-drawn: Alec Warner is sinister and disturbing, Mrs. Pettigrew, a housekeeper seems the most sympathetic, the most genuinely troubled. And then there are Dame Lettie's ludicrous accusations that Inspector Mortimer is the crank caller. Mortimer has the only wise line: the police won't find the caller because, \\"considering the evidence,\\" he said, \\"in my opinion the offender is Death himself.\\"This is a relatively \\"easy read,\\" and Spark shows how dialogue can move a plot along. There is a painful, gruesome scene to do with Lettie towards the end which brings the novel to a high point."},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"I highly recommend Memento Mori. First of all, the elderly -- and we are talking about the advanced in age, sixty-eight year olds are consider the \\"young\\" -- rarely receive fictional treatment. As a thirtysomething reader, I found Spark's take on the topic interesting and the ending (as well as the mystery of the phone calls) oh so effective.Spark takes pains to show how the wisdom that is supposed to accrete over the years has not worked and her characters display the same vices and virtues that they have their whole lives. The ending is sudden and heartbreaking because the absence of direction the characters show never abates.Another strong effort by one of Britain's literary doyennes."},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"A bit dated, but still a fun read. I was disappointed that the mysterious caller was never explained, but if the arrival was a bit disappointing, it was a pleasant voyage. No question that people \\"of a certain age\\" will get more from Memento Mori that the younger generation. I advise parents and grandparents to read it and pass it on to the children to enjoy when they reach \\"that certain age.\\""},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"I found it quite slow in the beginning, but once it began to move, I enjoyed it - but, I have to admit, in small doses. It isn't a book -- at least for me --- that I get lost in and read for three hours without noticing the time. I could forgive that if the writing were gorgeous. But it's okay."},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"The Scottish born writer, Muriel Spark, who was born in 1918, wrote the novel Memento Mori in 1959. It is a really satirical commentary on life, coloured by her Roman Catholic faith.The content of the book tells us the story of some rather old British upper class people who get anonymous telephone calls, in which they are reminded of their soon death. The message is, \\"Remember, you must die\\". The novel takes place in the early fifties or so. It begins with the first anonymous call, which seventy-nine year old Dame Lettie Colston gets and ends about one and a half year later, when most of the described characters have died. Within that period we discover a complex net of relations between those old people, ranging from love affairs in their youth time to blackmailing and blaming each other.The book is indeed a very fascinating and readable story. At the beginning you get to know each character separately, but deeper in it, the whole matrix of their relations is drawn up. Mrs. Spark describes perfectly the way how the very aged people live in their past. They keep on thinking of events that had happened in their youth and for that reason the reader gets the impression that they have an enormous fear of things which will come. These are things like becoming insane and mad. Nevertheless, death is the topic, from which they are most threatened of. In my opinion you can see this behaviour in the way how they react concerning their anonymous calls. They are very upset about those happenings and it is their main goal to catch the culprit. This gives the novel a distinct tough of mystery. However, they have never found out who the caller was. The main statement of the story for the characters as well as for the reader is: \\"if you do not remember death, death reminds you to do so\\". What Mrs. Spark means is that anybody should be aware of the topic death, because it comes anyway and you can't do anything against it.Another very important thing, ironically described in the book is the religious and conservative way of living of many Brits. The characters in the story describe themselves as very religious, but when they begin thinking of their adolescent behaviour, contrary secrets are lifted. As an example, we could use the characters of Lisa Broke, Guy Leet, Charmian and Godfrey. The last two people had been married for years, but within them she had an affair with Guy Leet. He had, by himself additionally an affair with Lisa Broke. When Lisa comes behind that secret, she wants to tell everything to Godfrey. The only way for Guy Leet to prevent a disaster was a marriage with her to calm her down.All in all, the book is very engaging, though I think that the ending of the book is rather confusing. In my opinion Mrs. Spark could have replaced the appearance of Godfrey's son Eric and Matt O'Brien with a more detailed finish, because if you read through the last pages, you keep on waiting for a suitable showdown, which does not appear. The view informations you get deal with the character's death dates and the diseases from which they were suffering of."},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"And the message is that they must remember that each of them is going to die. Their responses to this are interesting. Fear. Denial. Acceptance. Strange, and yet moving. And what would our response be if someone called and told us, &quot;Remember you must die&quot;?"},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"Muriel Spark is, as always, deliciously sharp, witty, entertaining, and terrifying. Here a mysterious voice (God? Death? the author?) admonishes a set of alternately charming and despicable souls: &quot;Remember, you must die.&quot; Spark is a better novelist than Evelyn Waugh because, while Waugh is often more riotously funny than the ever-subtle Spark, Waugh focuses more on the foibles of the moment--some of his characters will be (though still entertaining) &quot;dated&quot; by the middle of the next century, one suspects. Spark, however, through her tiny intrustions into fictional reality (the voices here, the typewriter in THE COMFORTERS, etc.) enlarges her scope--so long as people die and don't want to think about that fact, MOMENTO MORI will be on target. It is curious that it is the women--Flannery O'Connor and Muriel Spark--who are strong enough to emphasize in the theology of their fiction the &quot;terrible swiftness of mercy,&quot; the sheer audacity of the Holy Spirit, as it were. Spark is not only one of the best novelists of our century--she is very likely the most economical. MOMENTO MORI is one of her best. Spark says more in a little over 200 pages than many novelists manage to say in a lifetime of long novels."},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"Memento Mori--&quot;Remember you must die&quot;--is the persistent message that intrudes itself into the characters here, a collection of very elderly Englishmen and women of the mid-1950's. Don't be put off by the message, although most of the characters are. This is not a gruesome book. It is a humane, gently hilarious and deadly accurate depiction of what happens to people as they reach and live in old age. The message is a foil for the author's revelation of the individual natures of her characters.I was amazed that I laughed out loud at several points, so acute are Ms. Spark's observations. If you have known very old people or are one yourself, at least one who has a sense of humor and irony, you can appreciate the universality of these people and their attitudes. The individual characters are bound to their own times and situations, youth in the high Victorian Empire and the years thereafter into the twilight of the post war traumas of diminished England. But I am certain that wherever you are, if you have known old people, and observed them interacting with each other, you will recognize Spark's cast of characters and their adventures. The loves and hates, successes and failures that marked their youth are all carried forward and nursed. People bide their time to avenge, in mundane and petty ways, the petty slights and bullying of their spouses and friends accumulated over a lifetime.It all comes together memorably in a very readable way."},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"Muriel Spark is a prolific writer. Her most famous and widely read book is probably &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot;. But I wanted to savour something different of Spark's and decided on the highly recommmended &quot;Momemto Mori&quot;, which is about a bunch of octegenarians being tormented by an anonymous caller. What reads like a typical detective story (Agatha Christie style) turns out to be a psycho thriller with a twist. A dead body does turn up eventually but not before we are nearly three-quarter way through and even then, the murderer's motive and identity are both inconsequential and summarily dismissed. By then, you get the distinct feeling that you have been led up the garden path and that the threatening anonymous caller is a mere (though brilliant) technical devise used by the author to draw to the open the secrets of past indiscretions committed by the book's senior citizen cast. The thought of these oldies fornicating like minxes in their youth is simply hilarious. As it turns out, the caller assumes a different voice for each victim of the hoax. It is this &quot;voice of Death&quot; that triggers off memories of past sins and indeed action on the part of the characters which moves this psycho thriller briskly along. Spark, writing with her usual charm and wit, deftly avoids the danger of the book becoming a &quot;talkie&quot; and for that, we are grateful. I finished the book in two days. It was a delight !"},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"The late Muriel Spark's crisply-written third novel and first genuine masterpiece, 'Memento Mori' (1959), would be followed by nineteen more, including additional bona fide classics 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' (1961), 'The Girls of Slender Means' (1963), 'The Driver's Seat' (1970), and 'Loitering With Intent' (1981) before her death in April of 2006.Compared to these and other Spark fictions, however, 'Memento Mori' is remarkable for its essentially straightforward plot (a number of elderly lifelong friends and enemies are harassed by a mysterious telephone caller who states \\"remember you must die\\"), its relatively stable mid-Fifties London setting, and the depiction of its cast.Unlike both earlier and later Spark novels, the characters presented are fairly unambiguous in terms of their natures: they're either essentially humane, decent, and humble, ethically and morally confused, or patently amoral. Thus, in terms of both characterization and the behavior that arises from it, 'Memento Mori' can be interpreted as a highly polished but basic blueprint for all of Spark's future fiction, in which cultured blackmailers, undetected maniacs, manipulative appropriators, and aggressive human parasites abound. In fact, the endlessly conniving, money-obsessed Mabel Pettigrew remains the quintessential Spark villain.Like the best Spark's novels, 'Memento Mori' also seamlessly knits pronounced metaphysical questions into its text, and addresses the question of human perception and objective control: who or what ultimately manipulates and guides human existence?As a meditation on human decency, morality, ethics, aging, and mortality, 'Memento Mori' doesn't overtly concern itself with the literal mystery presented by its plot. Like the question of which student betrayed the Scottish school teacher in 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,' the mystery of the phantom caller is disarmed fairly early in the text, and thus subtly revealed as a mere plot device upon which the author effortlessly hangs her weightier themes.Sophisticated, sharply insightful (\\"If I had my life over again I should form the habit of nightly composing myself to thoughts of death. I would practise, as it were, the remembrance of death. There is no other practise which so intensifies life. Death, when it approaches, ought not to take one by surprise. It should be part of the full expectancy of life. Without an ever-present sense of death life is insipid. You might as well live on the whites of eggs,\\" retired Police Chief Inspector Henry Mortimer advises the assembled cast), and hilariously comic whenever it chooses to be, 'Memento Mori' remains essential Western reading in the new millennium."},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"Loved this book. It was witty, insightful, and very well-crafted. The subject of old age is treated not only without the usual sappiness and maudlin sentimentality, but with irreverence. Though the book is entertaining, it touches upon a number of important ideas- the meaning (or lack thereof) of life, how modern society regards death, and the treatment of the elderly in today's society. Though the book was written in the mid to late 1950's, it is just as relevant today as it was when originally published."},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"A wonderful novel about a subject taboo in the 1950's in London... growing old. One of the very few books of its time to talk about those in their 70's and 80's without being patronizing or treating them as stereotypes. BBC Television produced a wonderful version filled with stars who had not held starring roles in decades (except Maggie Smith). Wonderful character studies and a clever premise. Vintage Muriel Spark, for me her finest novel."},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"This mystery novel is one of the most important works of Muriel Spark, a leading Scottish novelist as well as Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, who received many prestigious awards such as the US Ingersoll Foundation TS Eliot Award in 1922 and the British Literature Prize in 1997.The title, Memento Mori, is a Latin phrase that is commonly translated as \\"Remember you must die,\\" and this has been widely used as a motif for artistic creations to remind people of their own mortality since classical antiquity. The original thrust of Memento Mori was \\"Carpe Diem\\", \\"seize the day\\" in Latin, which entails the advice to \\"Eat, drink, for tomorrow we die!\\" quoting from Isaiah 22:13. Spark's message, however, seems to differ from the idea of carpe diem in this novel, although the meaning is not literary mentioned anywhere in this book by the author. That means how Memento Mori should be interpreted is all up to the readers, and that is the key to solve the mystery in this novel.The eccentric yet very interesting idea of this book is the most of the main characters are the elderly people who are septuagenarians and over. They are total of 22 men and women in a variety of living environment---some people are rich and famous, some are ill and dying. In spite of their differences in age, sex, place to live, health and living conditions, they had only one thing in common; all of them received anonymous phone calls in different voice tones whispering a single baffling message, \\"Memento Mori.\\" Spark depicts tactfully how each character tries to ferret out the culprit.The beauty of this novel is the fine way Spark describes the lives of the elderly victims. Although she delineates the scene from mental agony of dying woman to excretion in the hospital bed, there is no sadness or melancholy in her description. In Spark's world, everything seems to be able to be subjects of funny story. Mercy may exist somewhere much deeper from the point of view of a Catholic writer.Another thing I like to point out about the characteristic of this book is that Spark's writings are concise and easy to read. She even reiterates the same phrases and passages several times. As for a reader whose mother tongue is Japanese, since this novel doesn't require much referring to a dictionary, I am satisfied with Spark's novels as foreign reader-friendly books. Some of you may feel that Spark uses the same descriptions too many times. Nevertheless, I'm sure her writings are so pithy and to the point that repetitions are bearable. I'm convinced that you can receive fresh different sounds and meanings of words from the context each time even reading the same passages.Memento Mori is a mystery novel which has a basic structure of the connection of very modern, ordinary, yet scientific instrument and unrealistic mystique. Spark digs up something we usually forget, or even we never want to remember because of the unpleasant truth. Namely, this is not only a mystery book but also a literature work written in a little lofty style according to the scene. Therefore, if you're just looking for a so-called ordinary, heart-beating thriller, this book is not for you. However, I would like to recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery and wants to look back over your own life seriously and sincerely a little bit for a change."},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"Ms. Spark's writing is akin to a master political cartoonist: With deceptively simple strokes, she illuminates the extraordinary, the mundane, and the absurdities of our human condition as we tussle with aging, class, greed, and our mortality."},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"This well-regarded meditation on life and death is one of those books I would have been unlikely to ever get around to had it not been selected by my book group. Our group tends to pick (and generally enjoy) classics or works by various well-regarded international writers (recent examples include Saramago, Eco, Calvino, Greene, Pamuk, etc.), so this book seemed like it would fit well within the group's standard range. So it was somewhat surprising to discover that, not only was I not the only one who showed up for our discussion with a rather tepid reaction to the book, but none of the six other well-read members found it in any way remarkable or edifying. Even the person who picked the book (a self-professed fan of Spark's other work) found it a disappointment.Set in mid-1950s London, the story revolves around an interconnected group of elderly people. In what might be considered a parody of an Agatha Christie book, one, and then another of the old folks start getting mysterious phone calls informing them that \\"Remember, you must die.\\" However, this is not a detective story or a thriller, except perhaps in the metaphysical sense. Despite recreating the classic scene of gathering all the characters in a drawing room in a debriefing conducted by a retired police detective, Spark is purely concerned with their reaction to the idea of mortality, rather than revealing the true nature of the phone calls. Indeed, two of the calmer characters reflect that the calls may be from \\"Death\\" (with a capital D), reflecting Sparks own stated belief that the line between the tangible world and the supernatural is a very thin and blurry one.However, many of the characters take the statement as a direct threat and grow increasingly agitated, while others take it as a mere statement of fact, and at least one is in total denial, and another finds it an interesting scientific problem. What may be ultimately frustrating, however, is that none of the characters change in any way as a result of the calls -- if anything, their often negative characteristics are only amplified. One pessimistic lesson may well be that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, however it seems more likely that Spark is attempting to highlight the notion that those who contemplate mortality on a daily basis lead more fulfilled lives as a result.In any event, those who like the book repeatedly cite the venal, immoral, and foolish behavior of the elderly protagonists as a major source of humor. Our group felt that while the various indiscretions, blackmail, and outbursts of jealousy and vitriol may well have been sly and subversive in the '50s, they aren't likely to strike any but the most naive of modern readers as such. Ultimately, I would be inclined to second-guess my reaction to such a critically well-regarded book, except that six other people more or less had the same experience."},{"Title":"Memento Mori","review":"All the characters in Muriel Spark's novel are old people. There is Dame Lettie Colson who is pestered - but perhaps it is an illusion - by anonymous telephone calls with a voice saying only \\"Remember you must die\\", her brother Godfrey and his wife Charmian who live in a sort of m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois. Their life doesn't get easier as they advance in age: senility and physical decrepitude are handicaps they try to live with, sometimes conscious of them but not always.Then there are the twelve female occupants of the Maud Long Medical Ward, a nursing home, who spend their time gossiping about petty scandals, mostly about wills being rewritten in the favour of another person for some trivial behavioural reason.The plot is both funny and macabre because all the characters are mean, jealous, curious, witty or confused, probably as they used to be all their life. It seems that old age does not transform our character much, for better or for worse."},{"Title":"A Folly of Princes","review":"This is the second installment of Nigel Tranter's trilogy detailing the struggles for the House of Stewart, in Scotland.

Not remembering what happened to her immediately after the crash, she awakens to the erotic \\"fever sex dreams\\", a poisonous effect from the deadly swampwater she ingested. The cure is administered by Jarod Ellis, a former sex slave who has escaped the torture he has suffered at the hands of the women of Paradise. Jarod doesn't believe this woman is a relative of the men he's protecting, and refuses to help her find them. Piper has no idea what has happened to her sisters, but she is determined to find them, as well as her brothers, with or without Jarod's help.But Piper is not accustomed to the laws in Paradise, and doesn't realize the dangers of being out on her own in Death Valley, where women are captured and turned into sex slaves. She needs Jarod's help, and can't deny the incredible attraction she feels towards him. Jarod awakens her deepest desires, and unleashes needs in her she never knew existed. But Piper must find her siblings and isn't about to let anyone or anything stand in her way. She takes off through the swamp, alone, unaware of the dangers surrounding her. A near run-in with the Death Valley boys proves to her what could happen to her if she were captured, and how women are treated as property, not as independent individuals. She's reunited with Jarod, but then later both are caught by the Death Valley Boys, and Jarod must challenge them for Piper and win, or she will be their captive, forced into sexual slavery and not free to find her family. Jarod also risks his own freedom and the possibility of being returned as a male sex slave, a life he wants no part of. Is this fiesty independent woman worth risking it all for? But how can he trust her when all he's ever known is pain and torture from women?Jan Springer writes another heart-pounding erotic story in the Hero series, and writes about some of a woman's most forbidden desires, but never makes them seem crude or shameful. It is HOT, and will leave you breathless on many occasions. Jarod is a very sexy hero with a tormented past, yet hasn't lost his gentle touch or protective instincts in his dealings with women. The idea of being with a man who has been trained in the life of a sex slave and how to make a woman's sexual fantasies come true is an intoxicating image, and will certainly fire up anyone's imagination. While some may be offended by the idea of slavery, and rightfully so, I urge readers to remember this is a work of fiction, and does not condone any forced situations on Piper or Jarod,but is rather used to create an erotic world where not all the slaves feel forced into their roles as captives. I look forward to finding out what happens to Piper's sisters, and hopefully won't have to wait too long."},{"Title":"Heroes at Heart - A Hero's Kiss","review":"Jan Springer's \\"A Hero's Kiss\\" is a super hot story full of steamy sex on a tropical planet.

Neither can deny their passion for each other. Jan Springer created an interesting world for Paradise, and also the culture of these sex slaves. I'll have to back up and read others in this series.

I can't sell mine as new because punctuation and grammar errors are marked with yellow highlighter on practically every page!Romantica (not a spelling error) scenes are unfounded. For all their emoting, the main characters barely know each other and what they find out about each other mostly comes from alternative sources and not each other.

A time when slow moving milk and strawberry trains made local stops to picked up their harvests for the city markets and a time when young boys adventured with mail order cameras and witnessed the first airplanes take flight. Teale had touched the hearts of so many American servicemen overseas because he reminded them of the homes they longed to return to when so far away at war.Teale's maternal grandparent's farm \`Lone Oak' has long disappeared off any local maps and alas many of the local sand dunes were destroyed by the coming of even more steel mills and other industrial plants which have polluted the shore ever since. However, some of the people Teale portrayed and immortalized in \`Dune Boy,' their headstones can be found in the quaint Furnessville cemetery, which is today surrounded by the surviving 1863 Lewry House; the 1880 Furness Mansion; the 1886 Schoolhouse Shop, and the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore; A bountiful national preserve, home to the modern science of ecology, and habitats to wildlife and plant species not found anywhere else in the American Midwest. A charm that inspired Teale to become the prolific author and American Naturalist of his time remains in these Indiana Dunes. Teale's \\"Dune Boy\\" is a testament, which can inspire todays and future generations to save what remains of the great sand dunes of Indiana. It is one of our family Classics and a recommended reading for anyone who has a passion to Save the Dunes or who comes to visit our Indiana home.I recommend reading \`Dune Boy' with \`Ann's Surprising Summer' by Marjorie Hill Allee, (published earlier in 1923) but concerning the Great Depression years and the portrait of a collegiate woman and that of her family camped in the dunes, and that fiction read with Thomas Rogers \\"At The Shores\\" (published in 1980) set between the World Wars, which continues the adventures of young adolescents in the Indiana Dunes. The recent publication &quot;Moonlight in Duneland&quot; an oversize tome by the historians, Ronald D. Cohen and Stephen McShane, illustrates the travel posters of the early 20th century that promoted the Indiana Dunes and can add depth to the above reads."},{"Title":"Dune boy;: The early years of a naturalist,","review":"This book was so good it inspired jealousy.

So much has changed since the book was written, but the landscape, weather, and wildlife were there before the author and will be there long after the reader. It's a sweet reminder of how beautiful the world is."},{"Title":"Dune boy;: The early years of a naturalist,","review":"Originally this review appeared in \\"The Hoosier Science Teacher\\"As I read Edwin Teale's nostalgic memoir of the dune country near Michigan City I flashed back to my own childhood. I first visited the dunes when I was nine years old on a family vacation while camping near the lakeshore. For me this was the most fascinating and beautiful place in the world. The sand dunes, jack pine forests, and roaring waves on Lake Michigan were right out of a storybook.Edwin Way Teale is considered one of the leading scientists, naturalists, and writers of the mid-twentieth century. He was born in Joliet, Illinois, but his visits to dune country to stay at his grandparent's farm, Lone Oak, make him one of our greatest Hoosier writers. Many G.I.s during World War II read Dune Boy from fox holes in Europe and Japan. This book is a joy to read and full of the wonders of nature as seen through the senses of a young boy.Dune Boy is a series of short stories telling of young Edwin growing up on a magnificent farm with his two grandparents whom he lovingly refers to as Gram and Gramps. The Ways are wonderfully eccentric characters who lovingly tell stories and share the joy of nature with their grandson. As Edwin Teale says, \\"his grandparents understood the world of dreams, fantastic plans, and the make believe of a small child\\".The book opens with young Edwin in his overalls lying on the roof of the farmhouse at Lone Oak while surveying the ninety acres of woods, wetlands, and blue hills surrounding his grandparent's property. There are chapters filled with innocent humor. My favorite is when young Edwin is challenged by Gramps to catch as many mice as he can in the granary for a nickel a dozen. Having read books about the great north and tales of trappers, Edwin begins to skin and dry the mice into \\"mouse pelts\\" that he hopes to sell. On a visit to town with Gramps he takes his pelts to various furriers where the adults are dazzled by his miniature bounty. They send him from store to store so everyone can see his amazing collection. Every chapter is a new adventure in the natural history of the dunes and lake country. Edwin studies snakes, gathers wild foods with his grandparents, and even builds a small airplane he names the Dragonette. It seems every new summer or holiday there is endless adventure for a young boy growing up by exploring the dunes and forests of northern Indiana.After finishing Dune Boy my first thought was that this is the kind of book I wish my elementary teacher would have read to me. This is the rare book that is an exciting adventure for both adults and children. Teale's prose is poetic and reminds me of the masters of non-fiction nature writing. This is a book in the tradition of Thoreau, Muir, or more recently, Edward Abbey. Dune Boy teaches us the power of nature and the importance of preserving wild places. By the end of this book Teale, now forty years removed from Lone Oak, revisits the area and observes the many changes made by human progress. Anyone could use this book in his/her classroom to teach students about the beauty and complexity of the natural world that is all around us. Teale gives us a reason to care about the Great Lakes and the fascinating ecosystems that are disappearing every year right before our eyes. Everyone who is a \\"Hoosier\\" should read this book with pride and enjoy once more the adventure of being nine years old."},{"Title":"Games You Can Play With Your Pussy Cat and Lots of Other Stuff Cat Owners Should Know","review":"This book is a strange work of graphic comic fiction.

This is a slim volume packed with the flavors, sights and sounds of the author's beloved native city. Displaced by Hurricane Katrina, Saloy, a former professor at Dillard University previously resided in the Bay Area of California and recently won the Oakland Pen Award for poetry.Written in sections with titles like Shotgun Life, Red Beans and Ricely Creole Quarters and Black Creole Love, the book yields poems that pay homage to her light, bright Creole father (My Creole Daddy) and her jet black mother (My Mother's the Daughter of a Slave), the real native foods and a way of life that are now far away memories, maybe gone forever. She humorously tells how she came by her name in Nat King Cole Babies and Black Mona Lisas and waxes philosophically about Catholic School in Parochial Product.There is a glossary of terms at the end of the book as she uses a lot of Creole/French words and phrases and Louisiana language that is foreign to the rest of the U.S. You can taste the galait (fried bread) and beignets, smell the aroma of chicory coffee and visualize the Second Line parades as you take a journey through the Seventh Ward in an hour or less.

There was also times when humans thought the earth was flat, and witches were burned at the stake.Likewise, there was a time that psychologists believed that autistic children were victims of cold, unloving mothers. And, as with Freud's theories, that belief is now known to be false.This book, as a work of behavioral science, is outdated flat-out wrong. Perhaps as a work of escapist ficiton, it is worth a read.

Virginia Axline, author of 'Play Therapy' finds out as she records the progress of Dibs in this book that has since become a child therapy classic. A review in Amazon.com held forth that Dibs is autistic, but it is clear to me that he is not. Dibs is a child who deliberately withheld speech and affection as a means of self-defense against his cold, unloving, high- achieving and demanding parents and their battery of tests to prove him gifted. He does not suffer a neurological disorder nor is he autistic.This remarkably moving and honest book gives credit not to the therapist/author for having worked a miracle, rather, it is the child and his inner strength and resolve that are given praise. The amazingly articulate child acts out his anger through his play of dolls. In a poignant part, Dibs reverses the parent-child role and 'makes' a 'mother' doll build a mountain upon the instruction of the 'boy' doll.&quot;It is too hard to do,&quot; said Dibs. &quot;Nobody can build a mountain. But I'll make her do it. She'll have to build the mountain and do it right. There is a right way and wrong way of doing things and you will do it the right way.&quot;After some thought, he decided he would help the 'mother' and not impose such an onerous task on her. He talks of love and caring for his mother and sister. This shows that Dibs, despite his frustration, fear and anger, has great capacity for compassion, empathy and forgiveness. The therapy sessions with his non-judgmental therapist helped Dibs be aware of his feelings and of matters within and without his control.Having learned it is all right to be a child and to be himself, Dibs unlocked the doors in his life and introduced himself to the world of other children. The doors of affection, acceptance and understanding that had been closed to him by his rigid, compulsive, scientist parents were opened after Dibs realized he need not fear the censure of his therapist and when his parents, after his mother's two surreptitious meetings with the therapist, decide to open up too and allow their children to grow and learn naturally without pressure and constant criticism. Dibs proved himself a real hero when he identified himself with a grownup doll and declared himself 'big, strong and not afraid any more'. He went on to be asociable, intelligent child with a keen love for nature and other people. The author recalls with pleasure how Dibs, at age 15, wrote a letter to his school newspaper to protest the dismissal of his classmate. He wrote with conviction and a strong sense of justice. The letter was signed: 'With sincerity and intent to act, I am, sincerely yours, Dibs.' Such is the integrity and leadership qualities of an admirable child who at one point was labeled mentally retarded. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the emotional development of children."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"...of an inaccurate perspective. In terms of writing quality and emotional &quot;pull,&quot; this book deserves 5 stars. And, like Freud, it is important to read -- in the correct context. Axline was a pioneer of play therapy (for individuals and groups), and I think there is no doubt that it is a fruitful method for interacting with troubled children. In my practice as a psychologist, I have certainly found play therapy to be extremely productive because a) it is the natural &quot;language&quot; of children, and b) it is also one of the most important ways children learn.So...yes, I believe Dibs (as presented by Axline -- we do have to rely on her description) closely fits the criteria for Asperger's Syndrome, a syndrome on the autistic spectrum where very bright children capable of complex thinking may be quite impaired in basic social, motor and communication skills. And I do believe her therapy with him was very helpful because she provided a model for social interaction, one-on-one (group situations were probably too overwhelming) that allowed him to increase his positive interactions with others (which, in turn, increased their positive response to him).I sympathize with reviewers who are outraged at the use of &quot;refrigerator mother&quot; theory in the book -- and with the reviewers who experienced the pain of unloving or abusive parents. No, an unloving or uninvolved parent cannot &quot;cause&quot; autism. However, it is also true that no autistic child was ever helped by a lack of love or being locked away from others. What both Axline and many reviewers have not taken into account, though, is the degree to which love between parent and child is developed interactively: Dibs mother blames herself because he was an unwanted child (and Axline agrees with this assessment), but it is clear that people unprepared and unwilling to be parents would need an outgoing, engaging child to &quot;seduce&quot; them into affiliation. Faced with a difficult and unresponsive child, with no experience of nurturing, it is not uncommon for parents to find interacting with their child so aversive that a &quot;refrigerated&quot; relationship develops. (Particularly if, as an astute earlier reviewer noted, one or both of Dibs' parents had ASperger's syndrome.) Dibs' sister, outgoing and charming, allows them to experience &quot;success&quot; as parents, so they, naturally, interact more warmly with her. It might be said not that &quot;rerigerator mothers&quot; cause autism, but that autsim in a child can sometimes lead to refrigerated parents.It is important to be fair to Axline, I think. If Dibs was at least 15 years old when the book was written, she was working with him in the late 40's or early 50's -- and for her time, she showed considerable compassion for Dibs' parents. Moreover, many reviewers are suspicious of the book, thinking that she claims to have achieved her results in 7-12 sessions. Careful reading shows that Axline worked with Dibs approximately once weekly for nine months. Even allowing for illness and vacations, 30 or so sessions with a highly skilled therapist can support massive change in a young child. I'm inclined to believe that what &quot;worked&quot; for Axline was her modeling of social interactions at a pace slow enough for Dibs to absorb skills that led to positive reinforcement when he used them at home and at school. In addition, I think play therapy would have greatly ameliorated the anguish he undoubtedly experienced at being unloved. In return, his mother was able to feel more successful and therefore more loving, which led to a slow but continual improvement in their relationship.I have always wanted to hear Dibs' point of view. He would, presumably, be in his mid to late 50's now, and I often wonder how adulthood has been for him, how he remembers Dr. Axline, and what he thinks of this book."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"As a practicing oncologist I deal with peoples struggles for their life.This is another story about an individual's struggle to take control of their life.In some other reviews of this book I think the readers missed the basic concept. This is not a book that blames parents for their childrens psychological problems, rather it points out the power of conversations and actions on another human beings emotional well being. Especially the power during early childhood when the individual is developing his or her self concept.It should remind us all that the conversations we have about people including ourselves can alter a life. The pivotal point for Dibbs was acceptance of his self expression by a talented psychologist then himself and finally his parents. In the epilogue the letter Dibbs writes points it out beautifully.I recommend it highly for all those interested in the triumph of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"When I first encountered Dibs in 7th grade I was deeply touched and changed by the reading. Dibs is a little boy caught in a family that doesn't mean to hurt him but does sheerly by continuing the dysfunctionalism that is so prevalent. I don't think Axline ever accuses or blames the parents for not knowing how to cope with Dibs' different personality. As I read I was able to see Dibs in myself. And I also was able to conquer the world I was locked into.

I read this book at age 16, while in my first year as a summer camp counselor. The empathy and emotion she shows in her writing struck a chord with me, and inspired me to take a similar look at helping children. I am now studying to become a child psychologist. I have worked with children with Autism, ADHD, anxiety, and depression, and I can attest to the reality of the thoughts, reactions, and emotions of both child and therapist. This book is a seminal work, and I recommend it to anyone who works with children."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"In the novel, Dibs: In Search of Self, I found many instances of the word &quot;lock.&quot; Through this stirring novel, Dibs is able to &quot;unlock&quot; his emotions and allow himself to be happy. He realizes that he can be angry, sad or happy and that is what makes him Dibs. This was a touching novel, I can understand how some readers may believe that it is cruel to motherhood, but from my viewpoint, Dibs mother did not smother him with love, as so many mothers do. She passed him off as a &quot;chunk of a thing&quot; and believed that with her intellect, she could not have a mentally retarded child. But as we see, Dibs has an IQ of 168. But that's not what is important in a child, or any being, it is the self-worth that Dibs found through his play therapy sessions. He &quot;unlocked&quot; the door and found himself. This was a remarkable novel, and I recommend this book to those who would like to see the strength in a child named Dibs."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"This book doesn't blame anyone's parents for mental illness. I read this book while getting a psych degree in college and it stood out for the real care and empathy the author feels for her patient. She draws no conclusions about Dibs' parenting- she is disappointed that his parents are not as involved in the care and therapy of Dibs as she might wish. Axline finds expressions of the universal struggles of growing up in Dibs and tries to be of help. She works with Dibs and doesn't just give him a label and dismiss him as unreachable. Any resemblance of Dibs' problems to the modern diagnosis of autism is missing the point of the book entirely."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"This book is about a little boy named Dibs. He is very intelligent. However, he appears to have a social disorder, is withdrawn, and afraid. His therapist helps him overcome this through psychotherapy (in the form of play therapy.) She shows him lots of love and concern, but not judgement or condemnation; her method extremely helps him.I don't think there is anything \\"wrong\\" with Dibs. God made us all different. Some people are naturally bubbly and confident; some people have difficulty interacting with other people. I think God made us all different for a reason: there are many different jobs and missions in this world that have to be done, and different jobs require people of different personalities in order to be able to get them all done. No one should tease or judge someone for being \\"withdrawn\\" or \\"introverted\\". God has great plans for that \\"withdrawn\\" person, as well as He does for the bubbly loudmouth.This book was written in 1964, but I feel it is still a wonderful book. A more recent book that might be of interest to people who loved this book is \\"The Highly Sensitive Person\\" by Elaine Aron.

The book was insightful into the process of play therapy, and it provided an excellent case example to use in parallel with our text. Virginia Axline's use of the skills in the session helped the textbook description make much more sense. I was also intrigued by the power of play in the lives of children and how much they use toys to express what is in their heart and mind when they either lack the vocabulary to express what they think and feel or when what they have experienced is too scary to them to talk about.

It is a therapy that allows children to unlock the doors of their souls to help them to heal and find an identity.

I totally agree with \\"A reader from Rhode Island\\" however.This book is so beautiful and fascinating because Dibs himself is so beautiful, inspiring and fascinating.However, the power of the therapy used is not truly convincing to anyone who has any real knowledge and understanding of mental \\"disorders.\\"What a lovely thought it is to think that if we just listened to people and let them \\"be\\" that they would be healed from mental difficulties. As a teenager I would have wholeheartedly taken on board these theories and ideas. However life has taught me that there is more involved in how the brain malfuctions and works than childhood experiences or relationships with parents.There is much that talking therapy cannot \\"cure\\"\\"A Reader from Rhode Island\\" is certainly correct in saying that Dibs showed signs consistent with the autistic spectrum disoders. I know those of you who do not know about these disorders will be appalled at the wonderful, gifted Dibs being \\"labeled\\" autistic by anyone. The term I would use for Dibs is not autistic but Aspergers' which is on the Autistic spectrum.Again you are appalled that I would use any such term to describe the wonderful gifted Dibs.Well he obviously was gifted and wonderful and a special person. I also belive he has all the symtoms of Asperger's syndrome. A syndrome very common in families of scientists interestingly enough. (Dibs parents were both scientists.)They are very good at organising and putting things in sequence and order and analysing data. One or more of Dibs parents probably had Aspergers' themselves. It is a genetic condition. Such people are often gifted but have a lot of problems expressing emotions and dealing with people socially.Certainly it is true that the way Dibs confused and distressed parents kept locking Dibs in his room would have made him worse.However although \\"Miss A\\" helped this family interact socially and deal with their emotions.She certainly did not cure Dibs with her dubious therapy (therapy most children get today at kindy, playgroup and from their parents)She congratulates herself a great deal and yet at the end of the book Dibs is still not talking to people who say hello to him or to his father.I wish the ideas that Axline puts forward were true it would be so fascinating, simple and such a fun area to work in. I have been offered the oppourtunity to study Play Therapy and it would be so interesting and fun and right up my alley and consistent with my talents. I'm no scientist I could never become a psychiatrist.But in my heart and head I know that it is really outdated [stuff]. No amount of talking or \\"letting a child be\\" is going to cure them of a neurological problem such as Aspergers syndrome."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"That is exactly what I'm saying. You are a psych student -- look at the DSM-IV criteria for autistic disorder. Autism obviously existed prior to 1943, when Leo Kanner first identified and described the condition. Prior to that date, however, autistic children were lumped in with schizophrenics and/or other seriously mentally ill children. Because autism was first recognized as a separate phenomenon in 1943, when Freudian concepts reigned, the \\"experts\\" looked to Mommy as the cause. A fellow named Bruno Bettelheim wrote a book called The Empty Fortress, which was considered the authoritative text on autism for years. It stated unequivocally that children become autistic as a result of rejection by their cold, repressed mothers. During the 50's and 60's, when Axline wrote Dibs, anguished parents of autistic kids (like Dibs's unnamed mother) were cruelly blamed by child psychologists for causing their child's impairment. Despite a multitude of controlled studies showing no correlation between maternal behavior and autism, it wasn't until modern imaging techniques revealed the actual structural differences between the brains of autistic and non-autistic children that Bettelheim's theory of the \\"refrigerator mother\\" was entirely abandoned. (Some psychologists are still influenced by it. See the review below.)Certainly parents can inflict cruel emotional abuse on their children, and certainly that abuse causes pain and dysfunction in those children. What we know today, however, is that emotional abuse does not cause autistic traits like those exhibited by Dibs! (According to the American Pediatric Association, one would look for lack of self confidence, nightmares, headaches or stomachaches with no medical cause, abnormal fears, attempts to run away.) At the outset of the book, 5 year old Dibs has no peer relations, little speech, delayed gross motor skills, and never makes eye contact. He adheres rigidly to his routines and has kicking and biting tantrums when they are disrupted. His expressive language skills are about the level of a three year old (\\"No go home!\\" \\"No lock doors!\\") Nonetheless he has islands of intellectual achievement. He recognizes numbers and has taught himself to read.You may or may not believe that Axline's book is a legitimate account of a child being cured of these symptoms in 12 play therapy sessions. Leaving that aside, however, the fact is that today a child with those traits would be diagnosed on the autistic spectrum. He would receive at minimum language therapy, social skills therapy, and occupational therapy. And his unhappy mother and father would be referred to a support group, where they would learn (among other things) that Dibs is not being intentionally \\"bad,\\" that there are better ways to cope with tantrums than locking him in his room, and that they are not to blame for his impairments.\\"Let Me Hear Your Voice\\" by Catherine Maurice includes a poignant description of the grief parents of autistic children experience; and \\"Madness on the Couch\\" includes an account of the Bettelheim years, when despite all the evidence to the contrary, parents of autistic kids were treated with contempt."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"Dibs was a five-year-old boy who, through play therapy, began to become more comfortable with himself and with others, and unlocked the countless barriers that had plagued and confined his mind. He was continually (especially by his parents) underestimated, and hurt when his father would degrade him or his mother would test him. His story is easy to relate to in many ways, for everyone at one point in time was underestimated or under-appreciated.Dibs' story is exceptional in that not only was he not mentally impaired, as some proposed, but was in fact a genius, who merely suffered from emotional damage and feelings of rejection. The authenticity and accuracy of the story is certainly up for debate, but if it can not be relied upon as an effective therapeutic example, it can certainly still serve as an inspirational tale.One question that I wish was not left unanswered in the book, however, was the origin of Dibs' aversion and loathing for the color yellow. Many clues in the book suggest that maybe the bars on his windows were painted yellow, but Virginia Axline does not give any definite answer."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It gives the reader an up-close and personal perspective of the power of play therapy for children. I had to read it for a class on play therapy I was taking, and I read it very quickly. It was hard to put down. Definitely worth reading, especially if you have an interest working with kids or in play therapy."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"Dibs in Search of Self by Virgina M. Axline is fantastic book about the therapy of a young boy named Dibs. Dibs won't talk or play with the kids in his kindergarden class. He won't talk to his teachers and cooperate at all. When his teachers put him with a group of children to play, he will either wander off, or have a temper tantrum. Once Dibs is put in child therapy with Miss Axline, he begins to act more and more like an average kindergardener. He starts talking to his teachers and parents, and very rarely has temer problems. His life is changed because of a remarkable woman, Virgina Axline. I LOVED THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"First read this book when I was perhaps 12 years old. Even now Nineteen years later I recall this book vividly.A fine work."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"This book is a classic example of the &quot;refrigerator mother&quot; school of thought. In the fifties and sixties, psychologists decided that children with autism had been emotionally abused; their parents had &quot;rejected&quot; them. Today, most informed people recognize this theory for the nonsense it was, as more and more evidence has mounted to conclusively demonstrate that autism is a disorder of genetic etiology. But Axline and her ilk never considered any objective &quot;evidence&quot; about children like Dibs or their parents. As these self-promoting, self-aggrandizing saviors heaped ridicule and condemnation on parents, they ineveitably painted themselves as loving, warm, nurturing healers. Read &quot;Dibs&quot; and note just how often, and how sickeningly, the author dwells on her own incredibly warm insights, as she is excoriating that poor mother. This book is dangerously outdated. Mothers and fathers who are already confused and suffering as they struggle to understand and cope with their child's differences do not need this kind scapegoating and demonizing. Why, as one informed reader asked below, is this book still in print?"},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"It came very quickly and I have not been able to read much of it but it looks good"},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"I received this book far ahead of the scheduled delivery time and in very good condition."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"How could I not write a great review, because the picture on the front of this book is me. Yup, I was a child model and posed for that picture when I was about 7 in Central Park NYC. It was required reading in HS went through h*ll with name calling, but then the name stuck."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"This is the allegedly true story of a five-year-old boy. His name has been changed to protect him, but in this book he is called Dibs. His parents are wealthy and very well educated. They are baffled by their son, who is in a special school for bright children even though he seems to show no signs of being bright. He almost never speaks, and when he does it is mainly during tantrums, and in short babyish sentences. Dibs' parents think he may have some sort of mental retardation, but his teachers at school don't see the symptoms for mental retardation in him. He seems to listen, although he pretends he doesn't. He studies things for long periods of time, and sits with books as though he is reading them. However, he avoids interacting with people and becomes very agitated when he has to leave school for the day and go home.Dibs' parents are at the end of their patience. They are willing to try anything to get their son's behavior under control, and to figure out if he is a normal child with behavior problems or if he does have some sort of problem. They agree to the consultation of Dr. Axline, a child therapist specializing in play therapy.This book chronicles the play therapy sessions Dr. Axline has over the course of about a year with Dibs. As Dibs becomes more and more comfortable with her and with their time together, he begins to let more and more of his feeling out, which reveal what his home life is really like and why he has withdrawn so dramatically into himself. As these sessions go on, Dibs begins to emerge as an extremely bright and articulate boy who just needs to feel safe in order to blossom.It was interesting to read the actual conversations the doctor had with Dibs. It made me think twice about how I interact with young children and how they might interpret my reactions. However, I was skeptical about the complete validity of this book. I found it astonishing that such a small child could have such a command of language and of the world around him. I found myself wondering if the things he said had been embellished or edited in such a way to make him sound brighter than he was. His intelligence in this story made me doubt the realism of the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"I think dibs is a very good book. When i first started the book I thought it would be a very boring book. Virginia M. Axline did a very good job writing something that would normally be extremely boring into something that is very interesting and fun to read. The back of the book gives a good summary. Overall this book is 4.5 stars. After the about the second chapter I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"Yet another book trying to blame autistic behaviour on cold, intellectual mothers. Axline spends an entire book telling us how nurturing and warm she herself is, but the book is narrow-minded, prejudiced and cruel. This sort of stuff should have been left behind in the 50s"},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"Sorry, but this book just doesn't ring true. A child this severely impaired (read the first two chapters) is not going to be cured in a few months of once-a-week play therapy sessions.(And contrary to what one reviewer argues, there were at most fifteen to twenty sessions. Dr. Axline evaluates Dibs, meets with his mother, and after a &quot;long and frustrating wait&quot; begins once-a-week therapy. The fourth session was on February 21 (see page 78), and sessions ended when the school year ended for summer vacation.) I can agree the sessions helped with social skills and communication, and that this was important. This in turn seemed to lead to better interactions with his parents, an improvement which was self-perpetuating, and which in turn made all three of them happier. But neurological problems don't go away through play therapy. Whatever the reason for Dibs's recovery (if it actually happened)did not come from play therapy.Remember, the book was written in 1964. Psychoanalysis was in the air, and Freud was viewed as some sort of guru. Read the popular as well as the psychiatric literature of the time. Implicit in Freudian theory is the notion that psychiatric disorders are rooted in early childhood experience. From this it was a quick (and prevalent) step to blaming one's parents for various neuroses and complexes.Dr. Axline is clearly a product of her times. A little boy is non-verbal and withdrawn -- what did his parents do to make him lock himself away like this? Read her description of Dibs's tense, defensive mother on page 34. (Note that &quot;the mother&quot; is the only major player in the story who is not even given a name.)I think of this mother and her pain. She and her husband are wealthy and have taken their son to a number of specialists. The professionals all eventually make clear in one way or another that she is the source of her child's problems. She wonders if they are right, and ponders the ways she might have damaged him (&quot;he was the product of an unwanted pregnancy! It's all my fault!&quot;) OF COURSE she is tense and defensive around Dr. Axline (who in fact concurs with the other specialists that Dib's problems stem from her lousy parenting, and probably subtley conveys that attitude).Those reviewers who read the book with warmth and delight might feel differently if they were the parent of a child like Dibs. And don't kid yourself - - it could happen to anyone. The pain of having a child with severe neuropsychiatric problems is devastating. The public stigmatization that goes along with having a child who never smiles at anyone, has explosive tantrums in public, and doesn't answer when spoken to is something you just have to get used to. Thank God for support groups.The book is an entertaining and inspiring read for the uninitated, but hurtful to those dealing with an real life mentally ill child. As to those reviewers who are in the psychological profession, don't you think that whatever faint value comes from the pleasure this book brings to the uneducated, (or its teachings on the value of non-judgmental and child directed play) is surely outweighed by all the years of useless but expensive play therapy furnished to autistic children as a result? And how about the stigmatization of the parents that results from this type of literature?I'm sure I sound like a tense, angry and defensive mother myself at this point! But that's the Catch-22 you find yourself in if you have an autistic child. If you know more about your child than the person treating him, you are seen as rigid, hypercritical and controlling. Medical research you do concerning your son's condition is seen as evidence of your tendency to coldly intellectualize his problems. And if a book like Dibs brings you to tears of frustration and empathy -- well that just shows how emotionally unstable you are. I wish this book would go out of print."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"Very impressed by the fast shipping. I will definitely order books from this seller again."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"Every now and then I read a book about some parents that goes and hires a specialist to do a parents job for them. This book is probably the best example I've ever read. Simply put, we've got a couple of inept, frustrated parents who obviously have no clue how to emotionally raise a child, hiring a specialist to do the work for them. The problem I have, is that play therapy is what the parents should have been doing. By ignoring the child, never playing with him, emotionally interacting, etc, the parents just let him deteoriate. This book is a classic example.Ok, as a child with extreme fear, unresponsiveness, especially when I was young. Yeah, I can attest to this book. But let me tell, I wish I had someone like Virginia Axline step into my life, because my parents weren't there. I fully understand this book.Simply put, look at what Axline does for the child that the parent doesn't do. This is a book reminding parents, that they just cant sit on their buts and expect their child to raise themselves, if you have an emotionally disturbed child learn how to deal with it, get close to your child emotionally, for hours everyday if you have to. Otherwise your a bad parent, period.Personally, I'm working on cleaning up the wrecking of extreme fear and a lousy mostly inept upbringing. I recommend Chi-Kung and some eastern techniques to bring the fear levels down in emotionally disturbed people. I think autism may have been present in this case, but we also have lots of fear, anxiety, etc. These emotions can be dealt with, they run in the muscle tension of the body, that's why the eastern stuff helps.In the end it's all about the fear. And Axline, with warm encouragement, leads Dibs out of his shell. Warmth can melt fear as much as the midday sun can melt ice. Emotional content is what these children need!I firmly believe autism is curable and that play therapy could very well have signifigantly helped in this case. (but that should have been the parents responcibility in the first place, to provide the emotional content necessary for a childs mental growth)No drug is going to help this condition. This condition can be healed by deep rapport and real human interaction with actual emotions. I recommend NLP based rapport, as it will allow for feelings to share between people. People learn feelings, for some it just comes more naturally, for these kinds of children, you have to break in and really work to open them up. I doubt the parents in this story did that, but Axline clearly has done it. But why weren't the parents playing with their child, where were they?Deep rapport, muscle relaxation & emotional content is what these children really need."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"&quot;Dibs in Search of Self&quot; is the story of a little boy named Dibs and his struggle to open himself up to the world. Dibs has no mental deficiencies, but hardly ever speaks. When Dibs does speak, he speaks very little and speaks of himself in the third or second person. He also doesn&#8217;t get along with the other children, biting or scratching those who go near him. He begins to go to play therapy sessions with Miss A. At first, he is afraid but she tells him not to be. During the play sessions, Miss A. sees significant changes in Dibs. He quite often plays with a doll-house family pretending it is his own. Dibs&#8217; father and mother also see changes in him. He begins talking more and more to his parents and responding when they ask him questions. At his school they notice that Dibs plays more with the other children and wants to be included in activities. I enjoyed reading this story immensely and read it every single day. It was a very well written and interesting book to read. I recommend this book to anyone interested in going into child therapy. What surprised me was that it took such little effort to bring out of his shell. He only went to therapy once a week and after three sessions there was already an improvement. This was a little hard to believe for me."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"At the age of 5, Dibs wanted to kill his father. His parents did not abuse him, and provided a stable home with pelnty of toys and educational learning and support. This book provides excellent and frightening insight into how a child, when unloved and unaccepted by his parents, can so early in life learn and understand the meaning of hate. Perhaps we Americans can learn from this example that physical comforts alone are not enough to raise well-adjusted children, and look for the source of so much childhood and teen-age violence."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"This is a fascinating book on play therapy.

There are more to children than we will ever know :o)"},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"This book is a fantastic proof, that early childhood experiences do have a strong effect on later childhood and adulthood.

Naturally, my curiosity was piqued, so I decided to read the book. The following fall, I, then 8, read the book. And read it and read and read it again! It was my first \\"adult\\" book and it touched my heart deeply. It was my very best book for the next 5 years. I loved \\"Dibs\\" so much that I was, at 8, able to quote whole passages by memory and find myself thinking about Dibs long after I reread a beloved passage yet again. I loved this book so much that I wore out my first copy and had to replace it (at 11). It has a place of honor on my bookshelf today. I truly love this wonderful book and feel it has made a postive difference in the lives of others. A little child shall lead them -- gifted Dibs has led many people into a whole new area of acceptance. It is to the author's credit she does not condemn Dibs with a psychiatric label. Dibs is allowed to move and grow and like a mighty falcon, soar! THIS IS TRULY AN OUTSTANDING BOOK!"},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"First, I must take issue with two of the other reviews: Axline makes clear that Dibs is NOT an autistic or otherwise abnormal child and thus the idea that she blames his &quot;autism&quot; on his parents is a non-starter. Rather, Axline makes clear that Dibs is, in fact, a normal child whose past experiences have crushed his ability to trust and to reach out to others. Counterintuitively, she does not cure him by providing him with the love and acceptance that his parents have clearly withheld (they make a practice of locking him in his room), but by allowing him to work through his experiences in play therapy, and she never takes his parents to task for their actions but allows the family to evolve as well. The process of play therapy is illustrated and explained through her meticulous observations and it is fascinating to see Dibs tell his autobiography to his therapist through his play and come to his own resolutions with her help and guidance. An essential work for those interested in personality development and a heroic biography."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"I read dibs when i was a freshman in highschool.

Axline is able to weave together a powerful, moving story about the pain of risk taking, and the power of growth.I feel it is likely that student-therapists learn about the potential power of child centered play therapy, which Axline helped to create. The experiential nature of this book is a nice contrast to other texts that are more cerebral and didactic."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"Great book!!

Dibs is AUTISTIC. He is not emotionally disturbed, and his condition is caused by a neurological disorder, rather than by his cruel parents. In fact, Ms. Axline actually is cruel to the parents by blaming them for a biological, neurolgical condition that today is seen as most likely due to a genetic cause.I am distressed to see the reviews of all the well intentioned readers who are unfamiliar with Autism. Studies show that nearly no autistic children who received play therapy alone as a treatment intervention emerge from their autism. Dibs is one of the few such cases ever. Every behavior Ms. Axline describes, from difficulty making transitions, poor eye contact, pronoun reversals, delayed language development, poor play skills, poor peer relatedness, precotious reading, high intelligence but uneven performance, delayed motor skills (his poor coordination, per Axline is sympotamatic of being \\"tied up in knots\\" emotionally, rather than the truthful, gross and fine motor delays), and the delayed self help skills- such as taking off his coat, are all classically sympomatic of and autistiv spectrum disorder diagnosis.The book is disengenuous to characterize this problem as emotional. Autistic children do have emotions and inner lives. Sadly, thousands have wasted years of potentially fruitful behavioral treatment based on the misleading information in this book. I suggest to any reader who is truly interested in autism to spend some time researching recent books and not one which conveys many of the erroneous fallacies of the past.Based on this erroneous assumption of the 50's and 60's, that Autism was caused by cold and rejecting parents, \\"refridgerator mothers\\", the entire medical profession failed to do ANY medical Autism research until the last ten years. Only now are scientists revealing the biological causes of Dibs atypical behavior and helping to find a cure. Thanks to Axline's false assumptions, the parents of Dibs were blamed for a medical condition, their grief or inability to relate to a son who did not respond to anyone, was blamed on them- and thousands of other autistic \\"Dibs\\" who did not repsond to Axline's magic wand were condemned to live out life untreated. As with other neurolgical disorders, such as strokes, behavior modification is the primary treatment of Autism today and has yielded very positive results for many children. Hopefully one day we will have a cure."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"\\"Dibs\\" is an awesome classic every counselor and/or play therapist will love! And even if you're not in the helping field - its a GOOD read!"},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"To me, after reading the book, Dibs seems like a bright kid with parents who had no idea how to raise a child and didn't teach him any normal social skills. He just needed someone who would listen to him, give him undemanding attention, and provide a safe environment. And he got this with the therapist who wrote the book. Then he felt safe coming out of his shell and beginning to interact normally with the rest of his world. He doesn't seem autistic to me at all; he seems frustrated and afraid of doing things wrong. I liked the book. I found that the therapist continually echoing people was a little irritating after a while, but that was her technique, and seemed to work well.Mary McCracken and Torey Hayden also write interesting books about children with emotional problems and success stories."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"I first read this book when I was about 10.

This book helped me to see that I wanted to enter into the field of chlid psychotherap"},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"Reading the jacket and &quot;about the author&quot; section prior to reading the book let me in to the fact that Dibs would be a success story. After all, one would not expect a pioneer in Play Therapy to write about a failure in that particular field (thank you for pointing that out Ms. Ban). The book is entertaining in the same way a mystery novel is entertaining--slowly, as Ms. A gains Dibs' trust, we understand the frustrations of living in a family intent on keeping up appearances. Indeed, one can assume that the more &quot;trouble&quot; Dibs is to the family, the more they try to cover their problem child up, making matters even worse...but I digress. The evolution of Dibs from a totally introverted ball of anger, confusion, and fear into an outgoing, affectionate genius makes it as gripping as a fast paced fiction novel, but it warms the heart as well. What other reviewers point out holds true as well--if people took the time to listen and extend a helping hand, especially to those who are introverted or &quot;trouble cases&quot;, this world would be much better."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"I have read this book several times because it always refreshes my enthusiam for the possiblities that psychotherapy can offer.

I don't even know this person personally, but I love him. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know how to love and how to give dignity and self-love to a person. I recommend this book to everyone who shows any kind of interest in people or who don't understand how to truly listen to another person. It is at the top of my list for my all-time favorite books. I can hardly wait to read it for the 6th time."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"A wonderful book that beautifully illustrates the power of play therapy and reveals the marvelous strength of the human spirit. This book is not about blame or autism, as suggested by one reviewer who has issues that colored their reading. It is about the potential for self-discovery and about hope. Dibs is an inspiration to all who search for personal growth, meaning in their lives, and a true self-identity. A very moving and profound story, full of wisdom, and abundant with heart. Is this book still in print? Oh, yes, and for many years to come because of its unique message of hope."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"This was a really insightful book. I agree that Dibs probably did have an autism spectrum disorder. While I don't claim to be an expert, I have two autistic cousins and have done extensive research about autism. I could be wrong but the behavior and speech patterns match with that of a mildly autistic person; this is also supported by his good command of language but poor use of words at times. Autistic people have had success with play therapy, diet therapy etc. so it is possible.At any rate, it was a good book that delved into solving a young boys' emotional and subsequently social difficulties."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"This is indeed a beautiful and fascinating read. I totally agree with the \\"A reader from Rhode Island\\" however.The book is so beautiful and fascinating because Dibs himself is so beautiful, inspiring and fascinating.However the power of the therapy used is not truly convincing to anyone who has any real knowledge and understanding of mental \\"disorders.\\"What a lovely thought it is to think that if we just listened to people and let them \\"be\\" that they would be healed from mental difficulties. As a teenager I would have wholeheartedly taken on board these theories and ideas. However life has taught me that there is more involved in how the brain malfuctions and works then childhood experiences or relationships with parents.There is much that talking therapy cannot \\"cure\\"\\"A Reader from Rhode Island\\" is certainly correct in saying that Dibs showed signs consistent with the autistic spectrum disoders. I know those of you who do not know about these disorders will be appalled at the wonderful, gifted Dibs being \\"labeled\\" austistic by anyone. The term I would use for Dibs is not autistic but Aspergers' which is on the Autistic spectrum.Again you are appalled that I would use any such term to describe the wonderful gifted Dibs.Well he obviously was gifted and wonderful and a special person. I also belive he has all the symtoms of Asperger's syndrome. A syndrome very common in families of scientists interestingly enough. (Dibs parents were both scientists.)They are very good at organising and putting things in sequence and order and analysing data. One or more of Dibs parents probably had Aspergers' themselves. It is a genetic condition. Such people are often gifted but have a lot of problems expressing emotions and dealing with people socially.Certainly it is true that the way Dibs confused and distressed parents kept locking Dibs in his room would have made him worse.\\"Miss A\\" helped this family interact socially and deal with their emotions a little bit more. She certainly did not cure Dibs with her dubious therapy (therapy most children get today at kindy, playgroup and from their parents)She congratulates herself a great deal and yet at the end of the book Dibs is still not talking to people who say hello to him or to his father.I wish the ideas that Axline puts forward were true it would be so fascinating, simple and such a fun area to work in. I have been offered the oppourtunity to study Play Therapy and it would be so interesting and fun and right up my alley and consistent with my talents. I'm no scientist I could never become a psychiatrist.But in my heart and head I know that it is really outdated rubbish. No amount of talking or \\"letting a child be\\" is going to cure them of a neurological problem such as Aspergers syndrome.What makes dealing with problems like this so complex is that one or both of Dibs parents may have been suffering from Aspergers' disorder themselves a condition which can make it very hard to express emotion. Therefor their emotionally withholding behaviour may have been part of there own conditions impacting Dibs mental health and making it worse.So there may well have been truth to the Axline's analysis that Dibs was suffering from emotional deprivation. However I don't belive it is the whole story. This is a good example of why today's psychiatrists, counsellors, psychologists and psychotherapists should LISTEN to each other and work together instead of assuming that their individual fields of knowledge has all the answers."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"The best definition I know of therapy I didn't find in any scholarlytreatise or in the works of Freud, Lacan, Buber or Carl Rogers, but inthe very simple -and very wise- words of a five-year-old child whosereal name I do not know but who was called Dibs, the subject of anunpretentious little book published in 1964 by child-therapistVirginia M. Axline, \\"Dibs: In Search of Self\\".Dibs, the unwanted son of highly intellectual parents -his father wasa renowned scientist, his mother a gifted surgeon- could onlycommunicate through rageful tantrums, bites, kicks, shouts orscratches. Most of the time he was simply a mute, withdrawn childwhose teachers had almost lost all hope of getting through to him. Hisparents, who showered on him \\"the best toys money could buy\\" variouslydescribed him as \\"defective\\", \\"mentally retarded\\" or possibly\\"autistic\\", tags that most doctors were only too eager to acceptthemselves. At home, when civilities could be easily dispensed with,Dibs' father just addressed him as \\"stupid\\".In a final, desperate attempt to help him before he was dispatched tosome \\"mental institution\\", Dibs' teachers asked the assistance of DrAxline, a play-therapist with a non-directive (Rogerian) orientation.After obtaining Dibs' parents reluctant permission to \\"study him\\" -andgranting them a strict confidentiality clause- Dr Axline startedweekly one-hour play-therapy sessions with him.Nothing was structured. From the very beginning, Dr Axline (\\"Miss A\\",as Dibs called her) made it quite clear to Dibs that the one hourallotted him every Thursday afternoon was his and only his, and thathe would use it as best he thought fit -he could play with the sandboxand toys available in the play-therapy room, talk, move around -orsimply sit and do nothing.He was under no obligation to do anything he didn't feel like. Nobodywas going to expect anything from him. He didn't have to live up toanybody's ideas of what he should or shouldn't be.After three months of those weekly one-hour play-therapy sessions,Dibs started to reveal himself to be not a \\"retarded\\" or \\"defective\\"child but a most gifted one, who had virtually taught himself how toread and write, who had a truly poetical vision of the world and whowas only too painfully aware of everything that went on around him.One Thursday afternoon, Dibs removed the \\"Play Therapy Room\\" card thathung on the doorknob and, pointing to the one word, asked \\"Miss A\\"what therapy meant.In her book, Dr Axline confesses to having been astonished by theunexpected question.After pausing for a moment, she improvised a response, telling Dibsthat therapy meant having a chance to come and play and talk justabout any way he wanted to. A time when he could be the way he wantedto be -a time when he could be Dibs.Dibs then turned the card to the other side -the one with the printedwords \\"Do not disturb\\".\\" 'I know what this means', he said. 'Do not disturb' means everybodyplease let them alone. Don't bother them. Don't go in. Don't knock onthe door, either. This side means THEY ARE BEING. And this side saysYOU LET THEM BOTH BE!' \\"What really heals man is to be welcomedby another human being in an atmosphere of total acceptance,recognition and confirmation. Welcoming the other man (or woman, orchild) as he/she really is -not as he/she might appear to be.For our disease comes from the fact that we have most often lackedthat welcoming presence, acceptance, recognition and confirmation that-apart from God- only another, caring human being can freely give us.And, lacking that, we disguise ourselves with a multiplicity of masksthat are meant to protect us from our hurting wounds."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"I believe that I found this book back in 1979 in a stack of my mother's \\"assignment\\" books when she had returned to university as an adult.

I was facsinated with every article I could find.I have vivid memories from this empathetic and inspiring read. Dibs face has been painted in my memory, and the relationship that developed with those who experienced and even nurtured him has set quite an impression on my heart.Browsing for good books to pick up again, I have stumbled onto the web display on Amazon for Dibs and am encouraged to purchase it to read it yet, again.I was 10 in 1979.Michelle"},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"Loved this book and it's main character.

I discovered myself when I read this book. Finally, after years of emotional confusion, I can express what I am going through emotionally. I now know that my exceptional intelligence has guarded and protected me from the social world around me. I now understand that I must develop my social person as well as my intellectual person. I am needing the &quot;balance&quot; you talked about in your book.I have two very dear nephews that struggle with the same issues that Dibbs does. I have strived to help my nephews develop their intellectual awareness of the world around them. Unfortunately, I have been unable to help my nephews socially integrate with their peers and teachers. My younger nephew gets kicked out of school constantly. Both of my nephews have genius I.Q.'s. They remind me so much of Dibs. I have often wondered the value of such high intelligence. You stated in your book that you had at one point wondered this as well. It seems to me that society and our schools are so unwilling to accept another's gifts...thus quelching talents that were given by God to be a blessing to all.

As a psychologist familiar with both autism and emotional impairment, my opinion is that Dibs clearly suffered from an attack on his selfhood--his spirit. I do agree that to blame parents for a neurological disorder such as autism is wrong! However, isn't it possible that the symptoms Dibs displayed were from emotional impairment, not autism? (neuroscience suggests that lack of contact/affection CAN impair the brain in areas related to emotional regulation, for example). Also, how do you explain the incredible disparity between Dibs behavior with Miss A (where he felt safe) and his father (where he didn't)? This book is a remarkable testimony to the human spirit."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"I am a Masters Degree (FSU) counselor and I cried when I read this book and knew I would never have the level of ability to help as illustrated by this book. HarOLD"},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"I am astonished that this book has fooled so many people for so long. This is not a true story. It is not based on the experience of a real person. It is an entirely fictional story designed to bolster the prestige of the therapeutic practices of the author. Every action, every response of this imaginary child accords so perfectly with her theoretical framework that it beggars belief. All her actions are so perfectly calibrated to guide this child to wholeness, to \\"self\\". There are no mis-steps on her part; she is infallible, the masterful, omniscient therapist. And \\"Dibs\\" plays his part to perfection, exemplifying the poor, abused soul whom she will lead to health and happiness. Which, lo and behold, she does! How wonderful! How moving!If you read this book with a scintilla of intelligent scepticism rather than through a miasma of mushy wish-fulfillment you cannot help but be struck by the utter phoniness of the entire thing.I'm sorry to rain on peoples parades and there are thousands of people for whom this is an inspiring story. It was for me too when I read it at 17 but re-visiting it as a much older person the alarm bells went off at full volume and I just have to cry \\"FAKE!!!\\"It goes without saying that if I could give this no stars I would have. I believe it is a propaganda tract for a particular psychological therapy about which I make no judgement. Play therapy may be a useful tool but the account of its efficacy given in this book is self evidently preposterous. It is, moreover, a fabrication which may have done tremendous harm by encouraging parents and mental health practitioners to dismiss bio-chemical or genetic factors and by pretending that such an idealised therapeutic arc was possible."},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"Dibs is an example of how parents do not take how they behave around their children into account, and instead blame their childs behaviour on some mental conditition.

Very good reading material"},{"Title":"Dibs In Search Of Self","review":"I was appalled to see Dibbs as required reading for my daughter's eleventh grade psychology unit. The book was written in 1964!!!! It's way outdated, and reflects cruel but persistent beliefs about families with autistic children. Someone commented that Dibbs couldn't be autistic, because \\"Dr. Axline makes clear that he's not.\\" Of course she did - - the whole book is a tribute (and a commercial) for its warm, loving author and her play therapy method.To anyone who knows anything about autism spectrum, the symptoms she describes are red flags for this disorder. One quick example -- Dr. A describes the child's difficulty with transitioning from one activity to another. He goes into total meltdown when he has to go home from school. She takes this as evidence of the inadequate parenting which goes on at home. But of course she never sees the scene that goes on when Dibbs has to leave home for school. She reports that when he arrives at school he \\"just stands there\\" whimpering, waiting until someone came to him and led him into the classroom. She also reports that after the battle to go home from school, Dibbs sometimes screamed all the way out to the car, and sometime became \\"silent -- limp and defeated.\\" But, she never makes the connection between the \\"limp and defeated\\" Dibbs going home, and the equally limp and defeated Dibbs arriving at school. Along those lines, she takes the mother's begging her to treat Dibbs at the family home as evidence of maternal selfishness or laziness. That's because she was never there for the biting, kicking and screaming that his bewildered mother has to endure every time she takes her son somewhere.Sure, the book is a beautiful and inspiring story, but it's probably largely fiction. A child who is as severely impaired as Dibbs is not going to recover through six or seven episodes of play therapy. Although Dr. Axline is far less cruel and judgmental than most 1960s child psychologists would be regarding the parents, this is still a harmful book.Like Freud, it's fascinating and engaging to people who never had to deal with an actual child with mental illness. Prior to Freud, serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia and autism were reseached as the brain disorders they are. Thanks to this arrogant, poetic, and imaginative man, decades of research opportunities were lost. One day, in the not too distant future, I am certain that play therapy for children like Dibbs, just like psychoanalysis for schizophrenics, will be likened to the use of leeches for curing pneumonia."},{"Title":"Revelation (Journey Through The Bible, Volume 16)","review":"Revelation was used in our Wednesday night Bible study.

The fact that Mr. Davis, also known as sir and master in this book, is a friend of Nikki's mother is not really dwelled upon buy the author except to increase the naughtiness of it all...The author certianly likes the male father type figure, in a position of authority, using his powers of reaoning to gently, slowly and inexorable breaking down the targeted females' resistance to his prurient interests and passions.

John Davis had gone to a hypnotherapist and that had been that. He had not looked backsince that day, and, he hadn't smoked, either. The simple and natural power of one human mind over another had beenamazing. Once he learned how to do it, he had amazed himself.He had also amazed her, Nicola, or Nikki, as he called her. She was his young Greek housekeeper when she had arrivedto clean his house on that Saturday morning. She was also a virgin, but he hadn't known that at the time. When he did knowthat, he decided to keep her that way for a little while longer.He wanted to enjoy her sensual virginal state and train her as his willing slave. He wanted to deflower her over time, asmuch time as he wanted to take while he figured out how to deflower her twenty-year-old twin sisters, Athena andAppolonia, as well, and who most probably were also virgins, too. Then he would train them, and in exactly the same way.But as time and exposure to them all went on he began to change.He saw his wife of many long years for exactly what she was, nothing more than a thinking woman, seemingly devoid of allthe natural feelings and inclinations a female should have, in his opinion. He began to want more out of life, and, as his timeand exposure to Nikki and her twin sisters increased, he finally took what he wanted, when and where he wanted it, andexactly how he wanted to.But what made him want to change his life completely was the fact that they wanted him to take what he wanted, in anyway he wanted to take it from them. They didn't know that at first. He didn't either, at first. But when he did know that, therewas no stopping him in his grand plans for all four of them.They also didn't know it at the beginning that they never stood a chance against a natural male with a mission.

Simply put, it's a book you don't want to miss! But okay, I'll tell you just a few reasons why we really loved it:\\"A Lova Like No Other\\" is an excellent Christian book! Author Stephanie Perry Moore did a magnificent job capturing the struggles of what it means to have faith in God. This book is so captivating that it was difficult to put down. Moore allows the reader to experience the same range of thoughts and emotions that accompany us when we attempt to compromise or rob God instead of allowing His will to be done. This book is real, it does not sugar coat, gloss over or mask the natural needs and desires we have as Christian women. This book reveals the Christian woman's most intimate prayers and longings, even those that are not always pure.Never have I read a book that has had such a strong male Christian character. It is easy to settle for the Christian man that just attends church on Sundays. But what about the Christian man who is sold out for Christ? What about the man who loves Christ so much that he will not allow anyone, or anything to come between his love for Christ? It is so awesome to read of such love and devotion, and as a result, it forces you to reconsider being complacent with a partner who has simply given their life to God, but has not dedicated his life to God.It is truly an exhilarating and secure feeling knowing that we (as women) don't have to worry about positioning ourselves or manipulating men and situations in order to find and receive love. This book confirms that putting God first in your life above all else makes Him \\"A Lova Like No Otha.\\"Reviewed by Marina Woods The GOOD GIRL Reviewers www.goodgirlbookclubonline.com The GOOD GIRL Book Club"},{"Title":"A Lova' Like No Otha","review":"Bought this book which was dispayed outside a book shop.

I was counting on good writing, a interesting storyline, and a inspiring message. I was grossly disappointed. I was also expecting a Christain Fiction. I considered this more of a Romance novel which had a theme with a &quot;religious&quot; couple in it. The technically shallow writing really shined through because of the unbelievable characters and plot. The main character went back and forth between her non-existent religious convictions and her lust and stupidty. The author confuses me several times about the main character's, Zoe's, beliefs. During the storms Stephanie Perry Moore places Zoe in the middle of, Zoe quotes all these scriptures, prays continuously but then in the next scenes says she hasn't touched a bible in years, is fighting with other women, and about to commit suicide. When her dog-of-a-fiance leaves her at the altar, his fine Christain best friend, Chase, swoops to her rescue to offer her unconditional love, a place to stay and carries her to Seattle where he starts his new job as an NFL football &quot;practice squad player.&quot; Throughout most of this time she is living rent free and without a job. She says she realizes that the Lord didn't want her with her ex-fiance since he didn't know Him. At this point the obvious question is why Chase and Zoe are supposed to be together then, since Zoe obviously doesn't have a clue and Chase is walking with Jesus. Through a series of 'miracles' Chase makes the team and becomes the star player in a couple of months. Moral of the story, she gets a fine rich football player of the year because Christ is good.Now I don't believe that Christians can't experience these events but the characters and the constant drama in the plot was written horribly and didn't ring true. This book was a bore if you are a serious reader, which I am. This book was a letdown if you are used to reading Christain Fiction books that have inspiraton, which I am. If you are too, I would suggest reading &quot;A Voice in the Wind&quot; by Francine Rivers. However, if you are in the market for light entertainment with a religious twist give this book a try."},{"Title":"A Lova' Like No Otha","review":"It was okay.

Amen!"},{"Title":"A Lova' Like No Otha","review":"This is my first Christian Fiction novel and I have to admit it was not that bad. Stephanie does have some writing skills which serve her well. The storyline was interesting and I finished the book, although admittedly, I skipped pages at a time to get to the good stuff.There were two main problems with this book. First, a romance novel is generally good if you have good sex, good drama, and/or non-romance-plot. Since this is Christian Fiction, the romance was not enough to keep the book going. Although, the few romance scenes did a great job of building you up to ultimately let you down :(My second issue with this book is the dialogue between a Chase and Zoe. I understand Chase is a very religious man but there are very few young people who will, in every day conversation, respond to a comment with, \\"That was your past, don't you know you have been washed by the blood of Jesus? He has forgiven all your sins?\\". Let's just cut-the-madness, and be real! I think the book had a little too many conversations that went this way. Yes, there are some christians who speak *Jesus-talk* any time they open there mouths. But the majority of us are regular talking joe's...we don't have to talk *holy* to be christian. I am not saying anything is wrong with this, but I think Stephanie used her book to try to teach the word through some of the dialogue. I understand this is her first such novel for adults, and thus, I am hoping she can rise above the simple *tell me* in her novels, to *show me through a story*.All-in-all this is a very nice story, and young Christians (both in their walk with Christ and 21 and under) should find this book an entertaining read. Since the sex scenes are non-existent, and there is very little else besides the question of 'will they or wont they make it work?', to entice you into finishing the book, I caution adult romance readers to steer clear, you will be dissappointed. Otherwise, you should keep a look out for Stephanie Perry Moore's next adult novel. I am sure she will improve!"},{"Title":"A Lova' Like No Otha","review":"at first the story started off slow but as i read on it (the story) picked up and i couldn't put it down i feel the story showed that with GOD anything is possible if you have strong faith and in all areas of our life HE is there for us this is my first time reading a stephanie perry moore book but i plan to read the other ones writtn by her"},{"Title":"A Lova' Like No Otha","review":"I couldn't relate to these characters.

In A Lova' Like No Otha' by Stephanie Perry Moore, storms are raging quite a bit in the life of Zoe, usually when God is trying to tell her something.After being jilted at the altar by Devyn, then crying and beseeching the Lord, Zoe ends up at Devyn's apartment, being comforted by Chase Farr, Devyn's best friend and roommate. He allows her to stay at the apartment and helps her through this trying time. From this point the story gets a little unbelievable and things happen very fast. Zoe finds herself attracted to Chase and wants a relationship with him. They move to Seattle to follow Chase's dream of being a pro football player. Both Chase and Zoe profess to be Christians, with Chase being much more committed than Zoe. Zoe does some things that are against Chase beliefs and he ends their relationship. Zoe returns home, but is called back to Seattle for a job and hopefully back into Chase life.In this Christian novel Zoe and Chase sought the Lord regularly when the storms of life became too much for them to bear alone. While they had a strong prayer life, they did not attend church, which I found a bit disturbing. They had no spiritual covering, no guidance except for friends. It seemed to me that is why Zoe was so weak. I just could not find a way to like or feel compassion for Zoe as I found her to be fickle and immature. There are good strong messages throughout the book that would be valuable to the population it was intended for, teenagers and young adults.JeanetteAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"A Lova' Like No Otha","review":"A Lova' Like No Otha' is a page turner if I've ever seen one! I was captivated from page one and couldn't put the book down until I had read every word. This book ministered to my soul. It gave me encouragement and hope that I to could be strong in the Lord even in this world that we live in. I thank God for Stepanie Perry Moore. The characters were honest and believable, and often times I thought she was writing about ME!! I cried with Zoe, the main character, through her ups an downs; in near fatal situatons I held my breath. And in breathtaking moments, I felt like I was right there with her; crying tears of hapiness. I couldn't believe the way in wich this story was woven to flow so nicely and include so much action, so much love, but most of all...so much faith. God was all up in this book!!

We think we found the right man just because he is successful, a ball player, yet he is the biggest player around. How she didn't take a closer look at Devyn's friend Chase is beyond me. But like Lil Kim said in an article in Honey a while back, she is more interested in thugs and guys like that,not real nice men who have something going for them. Once you get into this book, you will be glued to it. Gauranteed. Also, I also like the Reading Guide with the Scriptures you can refer to at the end of the book."},{"Title":"A Lova' Like No Otha","review":"This is one of the best if not the best book that I have read in ages.......I love African American centered books, I love Romance, I love Fiction, and I love Happy Endings....This book I LOVE!!!!!!!!!I read it cover to cover three times in a row over the period of an extended weekend, and learned more from it each time!!!!At first I merely suggested this book to my friends...but they were not going out to buy it quickly enought... so I took it upon myself to buy every copy I could find at the bookstores in my city and give them to all of my friends.....It also inpspired me to give this book to all young females, who I feel can truly grown and learn from this wonderful book....I cannot give it enought praises....."},{"Title":"A Lova' Like No Otha","review":"Stephanie Perry Moore is best known for her young adult Payton Skyy series. Lately, Moore has been writing novels for older readers. Her Christian ficion novel, A Lova' Like No Otha' opens rather dramatically with Zoe Clarke preparing for a day she has waited for all her life --- her wedding day. The day starts out gloomy and continues to spiral downward with Zoe being left at the altar as her fiance runs off with his pregant girlfriend. This heart-shattering experience becomes a &quot;turning point&quot; in Zoe's life as her faith must face trial after trial.In spite of the cruel manner in which her fiance leaves her, God opens the door for her ex-fiance's best friend Chase Farr. Unlike her ex, Chase is a strong God-fearing man heading for the big time in the NFL. Chase has admired Zoe from afar and is ready for this opportunity to show her real love. As Zoe and Chase grow closer together, Zoe's weaker spiritual walk begins to clash with Chase's desire to stay pure until marriage. The conflict endangers the relationship, eventually forcing them to go their separate ways. Zoe learns a valuable lesson as she draws closer to the greatest lova' of them all.This was not an easy book to put down due to the outstanding character development. Stephanie Perry Moore does a great job hooking the reader into Zoe's life from the beginning. Readers will find Zoe's shattered dreams and struggling faith very relatable. At times her turmoil leaps off the pages inducing the reader to shout &quot;Don't do that! or &quot;Girl, put God first!&quot; Another outstanding character in this book is Chase Farr. In most African American fiction, a man like Chase Farr is rarely included. The beauty of this man's faith especially as a successful African American athlete is quite refreshing!"},{"Title":"A Lova' Like No Otha","review":"Zoe Clark believes that she has a good life.

If anyone follows the trends in marriage, it's my opinion, that no one would argue that the statistics are dismal for AA women, i.e., sisters have the highest rate of singleness out of all races of women. Moreover, more AA women are raising their children alone. As a result, many women believe they have to either \\"settle\\" for a man, even if he does not treat her well, or be alone which is the theme behind the novel.The novel centers on Zoe Clark, who on the surface has it all together. She has a strong prayer life, a good job, and at the beginning of the story, we find ourselves witnessing Zoe's \\"big day\\", her wedding. After four long years, Zoe is finally marrying Devyn Jackson, the man she has loved since she first set eyes on him. Zoe would classify herself as a very religious person with a strong prayer life; yet, she tends to communicate with God only when she feels turmoil. This fact is even more obvious when tragedy strikes and Zoe begins to realize that she does not truly walk with God. In an effort to overcome this test of faith or \\"storm\\", she is forced to do a lot of self-examination and through a series of painful experiences and poor choices; Zoe comes to a realization that forever changes her life and spiritual walk for the better. Fortunately, Zoe has a companion in her journey of self-discovery: Chase Farr. Chase Farr is Zoe's fianc&eacute;'s best friend. Chase is a true man of God who refuses to allow anyone and anything to interfere or jeopardize his spiritual walk. Chase spends time in the word, he praises God, even when things are not going right, he is constantly seeking God's will in whatever he does. Unbeknownst to Zoe, Chase has loved her since they attended college together and always thought that Zoe deserved better than Devyn.I like the premise of A Lova' Like No Otha': we must first love ourselves before we can in fact love another. Ms. Moore also wants women to realize that we must first get our hearts right with God before everything else. Still, I found the book excessively \\"preachy\\" for my taste. Ms. Moore really used this novel to espouse her personal beliefs, which is fine, but she went overboard. In addition, the novel was melodramatic; can you say \\"Soap Opera\\" drama? Finally, the plot was predictable and too pact for my taste. However, if you are someone that is going through a trial and you feel that you are all alone in the world and your faith is wavering then you just might find this book an encouragement.LeannaR.E.A.L.

But this one really superceeds all of her other works. Not only is this book attention grabbing, it has a very sincere message that touches every reader. The book truly makes one yearn for an intimate relationship with God. After completing it, you are inspired to get much closer to your heavenly Father and find all that He wants for you. This book can be read more than once and also used as a devotional, or Bible Study guide. Just writing about it is a joy!!!!!!!!!!!! God bless."},{"Title":"A Lova' Like No Otha","review":"This book is AWESOME! It is definitely a page-turner. This was the first book I read by Stephanine Perry Moore, and I was totally impressed! The book has so many \\"twists and turns\\"; it's like a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat! Zoe, the main character, is left at the altar at the beginning of this novel, and she thinks her life is over. Little does she know that the best is yet to come!! As she tries to get over her ex, she falls for Chase. . .but she has a problem with Chase's pledge to remain celibate. In the end, Zoe finds that Jesus Christ is truly \\"A Love Like No Otha'\\"; that if you trust in Him, he will give you the desires of your heart! I like the way Ms. Moore shows that women can also be aggressors; that it isn't always the man who \\"can't live without sex\\". \\"God's way\\" is paramount in this book; and in the end, He reigns!!

I pray God will bless you through this book as he has blessed me."},{"Title":"A Lova' Like No Otha","review":"Reading this one was a challenge---the author's intent is well-received, but she missed it on this one. The story was missing much of what makes a novel in the Christian fiction genre--depth, reality, and inspiration. I felt like I was reading a book written for very young girls, for which Ms. Moore typically writes. Aside from that, the author's attempt to write a great love story took a sad turn toward the romance novel direction and got VERY dramatic.I wish I could say this one was good, but it didn't move my spirit at all. If you want a quick read that will have you scratching your head at the end wondering &quot;what just happened?&quot;, then this one is for you. For Christian fiction with more depth and integrity, check out &quot;JOY&quot; by Victoria Christopher Murray, &quot;A Change is Gonna Come&quot; by Jacquelin Thomas, or &quot;Forgiving Hour&quot; by Robin Lee Hatcher."},{"Title":"A Lova' Like No Otha","review":"Stephanie Perry Moore created a book that prompted you to feel every emotion under the sun.

The characters at times were too one dimensional and the author's writing style was utilitarian to say the least.

It electrified and shocked its audience, and became one of the most influential pieces of analytic philosophy in the twentieth century. And it was almost entirely mistaken.Ayer articulates an extreme empiricist theory according to which all literally meaningful statements are either analytic or empirically verifiable. The theory is supposed to resolve or dissolve various philosophical disputes by showing that they are about statements that are literally meaningless (like gibberish that is neither true nor false).Ethical statements are argued to be literally meaningless, while functioning primarily to express the subject's feelings. Statements about God and metaphysics are also rejected as literally meaningless. Other topics covered include the nature of truth, probability, personal identity, the material world and philosophical analysis.Along with logical empiricism or positivism generally, Ayer's theory is not very popular anymore, and it's hard to understand why it ever was, given the extensive (and to my mind often quite obvious) criticism it deserves and has received.Nevertheless, \\"Language, Truth and Logic\\" does a better job of articulating and explaining a version of logical empiricism than does any other work that I am aware of, and given its influence, it is of historical interest.My edition of this book is the Penguin edition (2001), though this review may be posted for other editions of \\"Language, Truth and Logic\\" as are other reviews. My edition is nicely set forth, and includes as an appendix what I think has sometimes been published as the preface to the second edition of the book. It also includes a very brief introduction to Ayer, the book and its influence."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"Language, Truth and Logic by Alfred J. Ayer was originally published in 1936. The current text published by Dover is a re-release of the 1946 edition - unchanged from the original except for an additional introduction by the author. Ayer is a well known and respected mid-twentieth century philosopher.Language, Truth and Logic is the first detailed English work articulating the logical positivist thought of the Vienna Circle. Logical positivism major focus was on the issue of what constituted a meaningful statement and subsequently what was the proper role of philosophy. In the positivist view meaningful statement were either tautologies (statements that are true by definition e.g. mathematical truths) or propositions that could be proved/disproved by empirical investigation. They argued that propositions that did not adhere to these criterion were meaningless or non-sense (questions of religion and ethics would fall into this category). As a result of this restrictive interpretation of truth/knowledge they saw philosophical discourse relegated to a largely logical-linguistic role - as opposed to any type of metaphysical speculation.The genesis of Positivist thought can be found in the early twentieth century works of Russell and Wittgenstein. Although this school of thought continues to have some advocates its popularity has declined markedly during the latter part of the twentieth century. Logical positivism demise stemmed from a range of reasons, not the least of which was its limited intuitive appeal and its apparent lack of internal consistency. With regard to the first point, to some, positivism seemed to artificially remove many of life's most important issues from discussion; e.g. ethics, God and beauty. While from a philosophical perspective positivism appeared to be self referentially inconsistent, i.e. its assertions appeared not to meet its own criterion (i.e. the assertion of what was a meaningful statement was itself not meaningful). Positivism's advocates have attempted to escape this latter charge - but these efforts have been largely unsuccessful.Despite the fact that Logical Positivism has fallen out of favor (some would say relegated to the dust bin of history), Ayer's remains a classic exposition of this important movement in twentieth century philosophy. I recommend it to all serious students of philosophy."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"I'll give 5 stars to any book that profoundly changes the way I think, and this one did.For one, I interpret the \\"meaningfulness\\" of statements differently now. I believe that a lot of what people say, myself included, is \\"literally senseless.\\"I'm just a casual philosopher, and I know Ayer's ideas were disputed and refuted, but I think they have some value. How much, I cannot say. It's a fun book to read casually and feel all philosophically cocky, because that's the way it seems to be written: arrogantly yet audaciously."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"This is a short, classic exposition of logical positivism from the young A.J Ayer, deservedly popular because of its clear writing and provocative conclusions. The book is a defense of his version of the 'verification principle', that only those statements are meaningful which are either logically tautologous or empirically verifiable.The upshot of this principle is that the entire fields of metaphysics, theology and ethics consist of nonsense or merely reflect emotional responses to meaningful statements. You have to admire Ayer's chutzpah in believing that a couple of pages of argument is sufficient to dismiss most of Western philosophy, and if you are in a charitable mood you can make yourself feel that he might have succeeded. What he does with philosophy on the basis of verifiability is essentially to dissolve it into mathematics on the one hand and the physical sciences on the other. Philosophers are only to concern themselves with the analysis of statements, either in symbolic systems or the results of empirical investigation. Any attempt to construct theories to explain the world in broader categories is metaphysics and hence meaningless.There is a good deal to be said for the clarity of thought Ayer shows here, and his commitment to keeping philosophy within a region where we can be sure that it is speaking to the real world. The history of philosophy proceeds dialectically, and analytic philosophy of this kind reacted against wild metaphysical speculations, desiring to ground philosophy in common sense and rationality. And if you scale back the grandiose claims that Ayer makes for his position, it is actually quite defensible to ask what the bases of metaphysical and theological claims are and how they relate to our experience. The principle of verifiability makes us think more clearly about the kind of things we are saying, and combats the tendency of metaphysicians and theologians to talk about concepts as though they are objects.However, this is not a convincing book in the end. The classic criticism is that it is not clear that the verification principle is either a tautology or empirically verifiable, and hence that it is meaningless by its own criteria. I think that it tends towards being a tautology, because I had the suspicion as I read through his argument that essentially we were being told that verifiable statements are meaningful because meaningful statements are verifiable. Or even just that verifiable statements are verifiable, and that Ayer has an emotion of approval towards empirical and logical verification. Once you question his definition of 'meaning' then the whole system becomes far less compelling.This is a book that any educated person should read, because the concepts in it are commonplace in philosophical discussion at many different levels."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"This book, originally written in 1935, is, as Ayer says in his introduction, 'very much a young man's book'; that's his way of saying that perhaps he was a little strident at the time. As many of us know, the young tend to believe that everything they stumble across is revealed truth, and it's only after living for many more years that one finds that what they felt they had originally discovered was already known by most other people.Ayer was one of the most famous logical positivists, had the gift of clear and concise writing and is able to maintain your interest throughout this not-too-long book, especially if you are interested in this sort of thing.His epiphany? Well, if we refer to Anthony Lewis' characterization of Wittgenstein's early work, we find that 'Language consists of propositions that picture the world; propositions are the perceptible expressions of thoughts, and thoughts are logical pictures of facts'. Therefore, if we analyze propositions, we analyze the 'truth of existence' as it seems to humans, anyway. Ayer takes propositions, determines them to be either synthetic or analytic, and judges their truth; i.e. determines reality.Looking back through the history of Philosophy, the idea of the synthetic and analytic, of the one and the many, of induction and deduction, and of subjective and objective universalism have been fully explored in ancient times, and as (I think) Plato said 'Once a young man discovers the 'One and the Many' he finds it everywhere and there's no stopping him'. It's basically what it's all about, and every 'new' idea in philosophy is some variant of it. Ayer calls it a 'little book', but I think it's a great book, and a good guide on how to look at things and think about them."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"Ayer wrote this back in 1935, but it remains a very readable book. Ayer covers a lot of familiar ground (e.g., Hume, Locke, etc), and argues for philosophers to concentrate on critical studies, rather than speculative metaphysics. He presents several simple, straightforward arguments for the rejection of metaphysics, labeling it 'nonsensical.' Ayer acknowledges the emotional content of speculative metaphysics, but argues that philosophers should not get caught up in arguing over semantically non-sensical propositions which are neither verifiable nor falsifiable. He spends a good deal of time discussing how grammar can deceive us, and deals with the usual existence-as-predicate and 'demonstrative symbols' arguments, demonstrating how easily we construct non-sensical statements without seeing that they are non-sensical. This is an extremely well-written classic. Anyone with an interest in philosophy should definitely read this at least once."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"A brief, elegant classic that shows that the major questions in philosophy need not be unintelligible to the public. I was handed a copy of this book back in grad school. I was majoring in physiological psychology, but I used to drink with philosophers, as they provided a nice counterpoint to the philisophiocal stance of my teachers. At the time I found myself entranced with positivism, something that happens to all students of the sciences sooner or later. On the surface positivism promises quite a lot, not the least of which is the idea that it provides a truely *scientific* approach to knowledge and belief. I was all set to approach the mind in a purely mechanical way when my friend Patrick gave me a copy of Ayre's little book.A little historical background: At the time \\"Language, Truth and Logic\\" was written, positivism was the hot topic in the philosophical world, and had adherents far beyond philosophy alone- for instance, in psychology, the Behaviorists, led by John Watson, were developing a positivist theory of psychology- a view that still has its strong adherents.What Ayre discovered in his meetings with Positivists was that Positivism contained the seeds of its own destruction- it could not itself pass the tests it proposed for a theory of knowledge. So I read Ayre. I thought about the argument, and the more I thought about it, the clearer it seemed. I couldn't come up with a decent counterargument. In the end, I rejected positivism, decided there was more to psychology than mere behavior, and switched my major to cognitive psychology. Quite an accomplishment for such a slim volume."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"Presents the Logical Positivist posisition that statements about experience must be translatable into terms of our experience to be meaningfull.

The book was in great shape when it got to me and it arrived very quickly! The low price will have me back looking for more."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"While I believe empiricism is a self-contradictory, hollow theory, at some point one may wish to study it for one reason or another. While not as well represented as it once was, its influence is widespread in philosophy and science (for example, most contemporary economists mistakenly believe that truths are ascertained by well-established empirical laws). Any scholar or student should start here. Ayer's classic book is a (very) lucid and concise exposition of the empiricist thesis, and it defends all its central tenets while attacking rationalist apriorism in just 150 pages or so. In this volume, Ayer's explains the systematic basis of empiricism is the assumption that all knowledge about reality must be verifiable by the five senses - nothing is known a priori about reality and so all knowledge is necessarily hypothetical in nature (as anything known by experience could have been different). All validity-claiming propositions must be empirical or analytic, never both (so a priori true statements are merely true by definition and can never be synthetic. Ethical propositions, because they are neither analytic or empirical, are merely expressions of emotions and have no factual content.I give empiricism zero stars but this book deserves four in terms of its scholarly value."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"This book has totally changed my life! The first thing to say is that it is very long and I only read the first two chapters. But I think Language Truth and Logic definitely has the potential to become a best seller. Ayer has a great talent for creating memorable charachterizations and the action is non-stop. My critisisms of this book is that there is that there is to many spelling mistakes. Also it may be worth waiting for the film version. Also Ayer critisizes other writers like Heidegger and Shakespere but maybe he is jelous of there talent! Also if Ayer wants to sell books in this country he should try to make his stories more realistic! Also the book is overated. Overall I would say that this book is very poor in places and I would not recommend it unless you are into books in which case I would rate it as excellent."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"I had higher expectations of this particular book. Somehow it feels too personal to me, and on that personal level I cannot connect with A.J. Ayer. This is supposed to be a grand account of the philosophy of logical positivism associated with some of the major figures of the Vienna Circle. Ayer is on a mission to save philosophy from the morass of metaphysics. He wants to make philosophy serve science by analyzing meaningful concepts and getting rid of the meaningless ones. But alas, he missed some scientific education. If Ayer were to be taken literally by scientists, much of science would stop dead in its tracks. He seems to think that clear definitions are key to good science. I disagree. Newton has only an operational definition of gravity (i.e., he says what it does), and even that seems to be implicit. Einstein's simultaneity, which is Ayer's own example is also not something marvelously defined, but simply the result of the core of the theory. And simultaneity is a figment of our imagination, since time is relative.Another problem is that one logically has to conclude that literature cannot teach you anything meaningful because it is peppered with the kind of metaphysical concepts that are dismissed as meaningless by logical positivists. Is literature, painting, and music nothing more than a play on human passions? A mere portal to a state of emotional excitement. Please! I will take Shakespear, Gauguin, and Motzart over this kind of philosophy any day. I would rather listen to the raspy voice of Toto Cutugno any day and hear his foreign words, some of which I do not understand, than to read again young A.J. Ayer's &quot;Critique of Ethics and Theology.&quot;"},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"I saw the reviews and I think you may be miss-lead. This book does not replaces a good introduction to history of philosophy. It is certain that this books lacks of originality, but he gives the idea that everything is well-established, and he puts everything within his range of classification, which ir really doubtful for someone trying to begin with philosophy.I don't see anything particularly new in this book. He has a scheme to classify others' philosophy. It can be dangerous appealing, in the sense that it tries to remove some of disputes of the philosophers.I would say that is a good protection from the problems of the philosophy, not a good philosophy book. He does not solve the problems, he does not say where is the origin of the problem, or the miss use of the language."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"If you are tired of reading summaries and general introductions to philosophy and would like to start reading original works, &quot;Language, Truth and Logic&quot; is a great place to start. The book is clear and concise, and is the classic presentation of logical positivism in English.The concept underlying Ayer's discussion is the &quot;principle of verifiability,&quot; which defines a statement as being &quot;literally meaningful&quot; only if it either is logically necessary (&quot;analytical&quot;) or can be empirically verified as being either true or false. Under this definition, metaphysical statements are not literally meaningful, and so are properly part of theology rather than philosophy.Ayer believes that many philosophical debates (such as those about ethics or about the nature of the soul) stem from arguing about metaphysical statements as if they were literally meaningful. He believes that once metaphysics has been eliminated from philosophy, these debates will seem silly and the questions that underlie them will be recognized as theological rather than philosophical. So once he has established the principle of verifiability and explained how he identifies statements as either verifiable or analytical, Ayer spends the rest of the book applying this principle to various &quot;philosophical&quot; questions.Of course, the place of metaphysics in philosophy is itself debatable. Ayer's conception of philosophy is relatively narrow, and many readers will prefer a wider definition of philosophy that includes some (or all) of the metaphysical statements that he banishes. Others will be thrilled to finally read a philosophical work that cuts through the mystical goo spread so liberally and destructively by other thinkers. Whether or not one agrees with Ayer's approach and conclusions, one has to appreciate his clear presentation of an important philosophical viewpoint."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"Despite its sundry philosophical flaws and its status as a work parasitic on the intellectual labor of others, this book, I think, is a philosophical masterpiece of the first rank. And by that I mean that it's a book that should be read by any serious student of philosophy and that should be interesting to anyone with some interest in the subject. If you've ever heard murmurings about the pernicious doctrine of logical positivism and wondered just what it could be, this is the book for you. But don't be misled: this book isn't of only historical interest--though it is, of course, an important historical document. While its central doctrines aren't currently in fashion and aren't in fashion for good reason, this book, like all historically important work in philosophy that's worth reading today, isn't of interest only to historians of the subject. If you want to understand the contemporary scene in English-language philosophy, you're going to need to understand the positivism Ayer and likeminded philosophers espoused since many major currents in contemporary philosophy can be fully understood only as reactions to their views.Ayer's project here is the project of all young philosophical radicals--solving all the problems of philosopher, or at least showing that there were no real problems that needed to be solved. In less than two hundred pages of lucid prose Ayer gives you a brief statement of the central assumptions of the doctrine and a demonstration of how it can be applied to problems in nearly every area of philosophy. Needless to say, in Ayer's hands it appears to work wonders wherever it's put to work.Ayer's positivism, as he himself admitted, was really an updated version of Hume's radical empiricism. But Ayer wasn't as a gifted a philosopher as Hume, and consequently, the strengths of this book aren't a matter of the truth of its conclusions (they're probably false), or the cogency of its arguments (they rarely convince), or the originality of its insights (they're really nothing new). Instead, the greatness of this work resides in its ability to inspire. This is a young man's book, and it's one written with the verve and self-assurance of a recent convert who's sure he's got all the answers and just needs to get them out there for the world to see. Ayer doesn't pause to consider objections; he doesn't draw back from his more eye-opening conclusions; and he certainly isn't worried about offending his readers' more delicate sensibilities.The central tenets of Ayer's positivism can be stated in but a few sentences. (I'll ignore the niceties here and try to get the main ideas across.) The central component of positivism is a test for meaningfulness. A sentence, Ayer claims, is meaningful if it means either of two conditions: (i) its truth (or falsity) is analytic, or (ii) it is possible to acquire some empirical evidence pertaining to its truth (or falsity). If neither of these conditions is met, the sentence is literally nonsense (i.e. it doesn't say anything capable of being true or false).The task of philosophy, then, is one of testing sentences of various types and seeing whether they're meaningful. First, the philosopher asks whether the sentence is true (or false) in virtue of the meaning of its words. If it is, it counts as meaningful and we're done. Math and logic, Ayer claims, are exhausted by sentences of this sort. If it isn't true (or false) in virtue of meaning, we proceed to the next step. In the next step the philosopher seeks to determine whether there is any empirical evidence that does or could bear provide evidence of the truth (or falsity) of the sentence. If we could imagine some method of acquiring observational evidence pertaining to the proposition, then it's meaningful and the philosopher sits back and waits for the sciences to determine whether or not it's true. If it turns out that there simply isn't any empirical evidence that could be gathered for or against the sentence, it's literally meaningless. Meaningless how? Well, sentences of this sort don't really say anything about the world; they doesn't make a claim that is true or false. People may find them important in some way, they may stimulate people's emotions and lead them to act in certain ways, but they're literally nonsensical. They say nothing about how the world is, and they have no place in a respectable philosophical or scientific view of the nature of the world. According to Ayer, this sort of nonsense is found in ethics, in religion, and in most of the weighty tomes of the great philosophers.The task of Language, Truth and Logic is to defend these conclusions and the conception of philosophy that has led Ayer to them. So it's clear that the influence of Hume on Ayer's positivism extended beyond matters of philosophical doctrine; the influence was also a methodological and attitudinal one. For Ayer, like Hume, goes where his argument takes him and is happy to demolish whatever stands in his way, including common sense, religion, and a few thousands years worth of philosophy.And, of course, this sort of willful iconoclasm also makes the book a lot of fun to read."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"\\"Language, Truth and Logic\\" burst on the philosophical world in the 1930s. A logical positivist manifesto, it rides hard a very simple thesis (inspired by Hume): that all meaningful statements are either analytic (i.e., are tautologies) or are empirical (i.e., are verifiable through sense experience) -- and that everything else is junk. This dichotomy led the author to embrace some radical positions on metaphysics, ethics, and consciousness, which, because of the book's brevity, come across as underargued and dogmatic, especially when joined to the outlandish claim that the book is the last word on questions that have perplexed philosophers for millennia. On the other hand, the writing is brisk and iconoclastic, and the reader is genuinely challenged to to figure out how exactly the arguments go wrong. Bottomline: \\"Language, Truth and Logic\\" is a fun read but readers interested in these issues would be better off going directly to Hume. He made similar arguments with more style, sensitivity, and nuance."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"This slim volume by Alfred Jules Ayer is probably the single book that did most to popularize the philosophy of &quot;logical positivism,&quot; the movement that launched the great twentieth-century assault on speculative metaphysics in general and Idealistic rationalism in particular. At any rate it is still the clearest extant exposition of the basic doctrines of that now largely defunct school (whose influence, however, lives on in analytic philosophy).It gets three stars because Ayer, unlike some of his Continental brethren, wrote clearly enough to be found out. While this book is of tremendous historical importance, its philosophical content should be evaluated only after one has read Brand Blanshard's _Reason and Analysis_, which put paid to the misbegotten &quot;verifiability theory of meaning&quot; and demonstrated once for all that logical positivism could not pass its own tests."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"A.J. Ayer's &quot;Language, Truth and Logic&quot; (1936) merits the label &quot;classic&quot; on the basis of its lucidity and unaffected directness of expression. Ayer, one of the first philosophers of mind to convey the views of the logical positivists (Wittgenstein, Neurath, etc.) into English, is nonetheless a considerable thinker on his own right, adapting the criteria of the positivists to suit his own enquiries and concerns. His work is a continuation of the thought of the critical empiricist Kant, as well as the phenomenological idealist methodology inaugurated by his own countrymen, Bacon and Hume. In clear and engaging prose, he lays down the basis of his logical empiricist method as the distinction between statements of logical necessity (i.e., &quot;analytic&quot; statements), in which the predicate is embedded in the subject &quot;a priori&quot;, and &quot;synthetic&quot; statements, whose verifiability is derived from sense-experience. Ayer adopts these principles and develops them throughout his treatise in attempt to solve the most pressing questions of philosophy. However, Ayer's method is quite stringent and reductive and leads him to repudiate an important realm of philosophical enquiry, namely, metaphysics. He dismisses all statements pertaining to metaphysics or theology as being outside his area of enquiry, since they do not correspond to verifiable sense-contents, nor to statements of logical necessity. This has led Ayer to become the object of much criticism, one critic dubbing him as &quot;the man who hated knowledge&quot;. It's a fact that philosophy consists of more than just the analysis of statements. Various Continental philosophical trends and disciplines, such as existentialism and poststructuralism, tend to be more fulfilling in their address of the personal as well as spiritual dimensions of the human being, as opposed to the &quot;traditional&quot; Anglo-American schools of positivism and pragmatism. By the same token, logical empiricists such as Ayer may have been too reckless in consigning metaphysics to the dust-heap of philosophy, as speculation on metaphysical topics remains an ongoing imperative for many thinkers. Heidegger was correct in his answer to the logical positivists who sought to banish metaphysics: rejecting metaphysics because it does not meet the criteria of logical verifiability was &quot;as absurd as rejecting a carpenter's bench for not being able to fly...&quot;"},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"I agree with much that has been said by other reviewers, but I disagree with some of the reviewers who think this is just the logical positivism written by an English person. As it is easy to see that Ayer disagrees with Carnap and others who apply rules which are too stringent to prove almost anything.Ayer's view of verifiability is not that we must 'necessarily' have first hand experience of the truth or falsity of the thing we are trying to discover, but that there must be premisses that must be 'empirically verifiable'- things that make the statement true.One area where I think Ayer is not as clear as he makes out is the difference between analytical and synthetic statements. He uses the example of 'all men are mortal' as an example of a synthetic statement, because it has only been proved by experience. But, I am inclined to think that many people would view that statement as analytic because 'mortality' is built in the very idea of man. This to me shows that perhaps our universals such as 'man', lend themselves to making synthetic statements into analytic statements linguistically. Ayer does not address this point.What most impressed me about this book were the linguistic comments. Personally, it has eradicated a lot of muddled thinking. The statement that I was especially impressed by was that thinkers, dating back from Parmenides, have thought qualities - or things that can be distinguished as part of objects - are objects themselves because they are syntactically nouns.I agree with Russell though, that the argument that all philosophy is 'syntactical' investigation is an overstatement. Philosophers like Heidegger who are the punch bags of the logical positivists still have very important things to say on the human condition, and I agree essentially with Karl Jaspers comment that we have an intuitive grasp that there is more to existence than the objects directly in front of us."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"There is no better single source of doing philosophy via the logical positivism method than by reading this book. It's really two books in one. The Introduction is a rather thorough reply to his critics of the book's original lengthier substance, and if nothing else is read, the Introduction provides an excellent example of what logical positivism is, why it is regarded highly or poorly depending on the reader, and why some people think this kind of analysis defeats the whole purpose of philosophy. The book does try to end metaphysics as we know it, but in the course of establishing new principles (i.e., verifiability), it itself becomes indefensible against the accusation of itself relying on its own premises to prove its own conclusions (a charge Ayer coyly ignores), otherwise known as circularity.The fact that many Anglo-American philosophers still do philosophy in this manner -- after Ayer's style -- is reason alone to study this book thoroughly. It is concisely written, clear and unambiguious (if not a tad bit too analytical), and exemplary of Anglo-American style of doing philosophy. I don't think too many philosophers subscribe to its own circular metaphysics, but many, if not most, current philosophers adopt its principles as a &quot;method&quot; -- something which Ayer later (in &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;) claims was his aim all along.What is disappointing to me, at least in the body of Ayer's works read thus far, is his failure to address &quot;verifiability&quot; in light of Popper's &quot;falsification&quot; doctrine. What exactly constitutes &quot;verifiability&quot; or empirical truth? And, how does the verification of empirical truth differ from the &quot;empirical falsification&quot; of Popper? Perhaps Ayer addresses this problem somewhere, but I've not found it. It would be an interesting problem to see solved."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"&quot;Language, Truth &amp; Logic&quot; is the quintessential explanation of the &quot;verifibility criterion of meaning&quot; --the cornerstone of logical positivism, which, in turn, is, arguably the foundation of Western scientific enquiry just as the Russell/Whitehead &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; sought to ground mathematics upon a foundation of pure logic. The inescapable conclusion is that ethical imperatives (sentences containing the word &quot;ought&quot; or its equivalent) are non-sensical. However logical, this position may be untenable from a practical standpoint. Jacob Bronowski's crtique of the &quot;logical positivist&quot; position in his &quot;Science and Human Values&quot; pointed out an underlying social injunction implied in the positivist and analyst methods. That implied imperative is: &quot;we OUGHT to act in such a way that what IS true can be verified to be so&quot;. Ironically, Bronowski's critique may have saved logical positivism from its own inflexible consistency, placing its edifice not upon an unassaible axiom but rather upon an &quot;ought statement&quot; which will not admit of proof by the very method which is its logical offspring. I recommend the purchase of both books as &quot;logical&quot; companions."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"Ayer is simply fed up with metaphysical and religious claims that appear to be nonsensical. So he makes us ask the following question about any claim we feel is hard to interpret:\\"Would any observations be relevant to the determination of its truth or falsehood?\\"That gets us away from having to worry about what otherwise might appear to be cognitive remarks, such as \\"god exists.\\"If it is then claimed that there is indeed evidence that would be relevant, we start to interpret claims in that light. If we are told that the existence of thunder and lightning shows that god exists, we can interpret the statement \\"god exists\\" as being equivalent to \\"sometimes, there is thunder and lightning.\\" That, and no more.The idea is to connect claims to verification, and to connect meaningfulness (or cognitivity) to verifiability.Plenty of people say that the logical positivists are Wrong, or that Ayer is Wrong. But that is silly. What they have given us is a method for arguing about potentially ambiguous statements. How we use this method is up to us. Saying that this method is Wrong is preposterous. We merely need to figure out when it is appropriate to use it and how to do so.In this book, we learn a little about logic, and we get some good training in the law of excluded middle. That law says that a proposition has to be either true or false. It is not possible that neither it nor its contradictory are true. We may not be able to tell if it is true or false. But if we see two statements which both appear to be true, they can't truly be contradictory. Ayer gives some good examples of this and of several other elements of logic.This is indeed a classic work. One can read it in a matter of hours, and it is well worth it for anyone who wants to use logic to seek answers to questions."},{"Title":"Language, truth, and logic","review":"This book is the single most valuable must-read on human knowledge you will ever find.

The truth is that we are not even close to a cure. 50% of all reported new cases are women and the statistics of minorities and inner city reported cases are staggering. As of the October 3rd, 2000...HIV is still not reported in California as a 'contagious disease' to the Public Health Department. There is currently a bill up before the Calfornia State Legislature that, if passed, would jail any physician who reports an HIV patient to the Public Health Department. How ludicrous is this. All reported cases now are a consequence of a 10 year delay that follows contracting the HIV virus. In that 10 year period of time, people of all sexual predispositions that are infected with the virus are basically walking around as 'loaded weapons'. Dr. Savitch is advocating mandatory testing for the purpose of performing counseling and doing 'contact tracing'. His call appears idealistic at first. Upon further inspection it is easy to see that if only 20% of the population is able to curtial sexual activity upon notification of carrying the virus- then we will have the time we need to continue to work and find a cure.

I found it on a dusty second hand book shop shelf and never bothered to crack the cover until a few weeks ago. I was kicking myself for not reading it sooner. Besides being completely true, this book was full of action, comedy, sacrifice and outright bravery. It follows a Czech exiled airman who flees Czechoslovakia and continues his fight in France. During his time in France he rescues a German Shepherd puppy after being shot down near enemy lines. The dog is smuggled, as a joint effort by the Czech airmen, to England, where the dog's owner joins the RAFVR and becomes a member of bomber command. The dog, Antis, is at the forefront of this book, as he becomes universally tolerated on the airfields due to his remarkable sense of hearing (detects incoming German planes when no warnings are in place) and his unwavering bravery (saving RAF personnel and rescuing civilians from bombed buildings). The dog eventually is bestowed with a Dickin Medal for bravery, a rare animal decoration likened to the Victoria Cross. I could go on and ruin the book for you, but that would be no fun at all. I will sum up this book in one statement. I recently wrote to a famous movie producer and suggested that he consider that this book be made into a movie.

People become indifferent to the hullabaloo of all verbiage.&quot;The author refers to this as a &quot;withering from within.&quot; One cannot read this book without sensing that the author is a man of great learning and passion and, most importantly, all of it geared toward bringing the reader into a better understanding of what is needed for life where the connection between faith and life is real and strong, not a nebulous wraith rooted in subjectivity. The author always seems to, at his core, be keenly aware of the relationship between words and reality, and all through the book he labors to open the eyes of the jaded modern reader to the vital nature of that relationship. Rosenstock-Hussey is one of those writers whose grasp of things goes deep yet without losing sight of how that depth is translated into every day life. One wonders if our superficial day and time can produce such men anymore."},{"Title":"The Christian Future or the Modern Mind Outrun","review":"In his review of &quot;The Christian Future&quot; for &quot;The Christian Century&quot; Martin E. Marty wrote:&quot;It has never been possible to pigeon-hole Rosenstock-Huessy... (His) juxtaposition of conventional genius and genial unconventionality, is both disconcerting and creative. In 1946 Rosenstock-Huessy was ahead of his time - and he still is today.In this book he writes about secularization, hermeneutics, the gift of language, the meaning of personhood, and Christianity without old-line appeal to transcendence. A generation that pays some attention to McLuhan, Marcuse, Altizer, Fuller (Buckminster), Brown (Norman O.) ought at last to be ready to confront Rosenstock-Huessy, whose erudition and spirit outstrip theirs. Some of the contexts of this book may sound a little archaic; many of its prophecies have begun to come true; none of its spirit is obsolete.&quot;Walter J. Ong writes that:&quot;The sweeping historical insights of Rosenstock-Huessy are some of the sharpest and freshest our age has known. His deep historical and religious penetration of the Old World past is joined to a rare understanding of the profundities of the American experience and of the human aspects of technology. Both a tirelessly critical spirit and an unquenchable hope suffuse his thought in 'The Christian Future' as elsewhere. He has had the foresight to be an ecumenicist even before the ecumenical age.&quot;&quot;The Christian Future&quot; can also be ordered from Argo Books (www.argobooks.org), as can all the rest of Rosenstock-Huessy's English language works, including many of the lectures he gave on these topics.

And for a woman who tamed lions for a living, Jovilette had a feeling that the untaming of temperate Keane Prescott would be far more dangerous...\\""},{"Title":"Untamed","review":"UNTAMED is a bit of a different story line for Nora Roberts and as an avid reader of her books, I found myself perplexed. I usually enjoy escaping the stress and deadlines in my life for a short while by becoming absorbed in the fictional book currently in my hands. With UNTAMED I just kept wondering WHY? - there was no escape for me in this one.Jo Wilder comes from a long line of lion trainers and has made it to center ring when the new owner of the circus shows up to review the business aspect of the show. Jo, along with many of the other long time performers are worried that Keane Prescott will sell the circus or even disband it. She decides to try to convince him that the circus is more a family than a business and is frustrated by Keane's entire attitude.She convinces Keane to travel with them and see first hand the excitement that can only come from being involved in a small-time circus like this one. Jo begins to think that he is softening towards her but after her performances with the big cats and her no-fear attitude, he puts the shield up once again. She can't figure it out and continues to wonder. Yep, it's the old \\"does he love me or not\\" plot. I won't give you any more details or the outcome since it doesn't have a lot going for it, you might as well be surprised with the ending! (By the way, I found the ending to be out of character for Jo, and it seemed as if Nora Roberts had to hurry and end the story so she threw it together at the last minute with little forethought).Even though the story is mundane, there are a few touching scenes in this book. One of the best passages is when Jo is comforting her oldest lion. She's known for some time that he's ill and not going to live much longer. She makes the decision one night to end his suffering and euthanizes him. The warmth and compassion shown for this animal can be a prime example to many humans on how to care and open their hearts to other living things (human and animal alike). This is a great glimpse at what a human can accomplish if they open their heart and care.Other than that, UNTAMED is weak on plot and subplots. Nora Roberts misses the boat with the opportunities to create unforgettable characters and has mediocre ones for the most part. Can you image the subplots when you could choose from the trapeze family, the circus clowns, roadies, etc.? My mind was in overdrive trying to fathom the possibilities. Unfortunately, Ms. Roberts's didn't come through on this aspect.I'm not really sure if I recommend it or not - I guess I do, after all there is a lot of garbage on the market nowadays. It's a thin book and will only take a couple of hours to get through so you wouldn't be spending tons of time with it. If it consisted of several hundred pages, I have to advise against it. How's that for waffling?"},{"Title":"Untamed","review":"The thing I liked most about this story was the setting - a travelling circus! It is very different, although the rest of the story is trademark Roberts - the characters start off on the wrong foot and spend much of the story fighting the inevitable.

Shipping was fine i keep it on the toliet to read as i am sitting going to the bathroom."},{"Title":"The Holy Qur'an","review":"I read this book cover to cover; ok, I speeded up in places when the text became overly repetitive and tedious. My review is not based on whether this is a good or bad translation - I don't know Arabic and can make no comment on the fidelity of the translation to the original. I remain puzzled why it is claimed that the Koran is not really translatable. This is in itself curious as it is odd that God would chose to communicate Himself through a people whose language was incapable of proper translation. Is the literary form of the text more important than the content of the text? It should be noted that the translation is old fashioned.There is a mixture of styles - the shorter verses are cryptic and soothsayerish/prophetic (and more satisfying poetically) whilst the largest (older?) verses tend to be more labored and repetitive. The book is highly referential and does not really stand on its own. The numerous repeats of the Moses and Noah stories, Abraham and Isaac, Sodom and Gomorrah are in my view frustratingly incomplete unless one knows the comparator texts in the Bible. Thus, as narratives, the Koranic texts can be unsatisfactory and are often baffling. In fact, because there is no real sequential narrative, one often ends a sura thinking what was the point of that. Typically, the story will begin: \\"has this story come to you\\" and the the tale will be narrated. It does not really matter what order you read the suras.Hell and its accompanying graphic punishments appear in practically every sura and are told with a kind of relish. The text is replete with violence and aggression and goes so far as to prescribe violence against the unbelievers. I know this is controversial as there is another sura which prescribes no compulsion in religion. As with all religions, the text needs to be interpreted. But, it seems to me that, to say that that Islam is a religion of peace requires considerable nuancing and explaining and disregarding of key texts and perhaps even the tone/gist of the text as a whole. The text also engages in considerable anti-Jewish/Christian polemics - God has no son, there is no Trinity, Jesus was not crucified, the Jews broke their covenant etc etc etc.There is a curious text in Surat, 33:6, as follows: \\"The prophet is closer to believers than they are to themselves\\". Perhaps its the translation but this sounds very much like what Augustine says of God, namely that God is closer to ourselves than we are to ourselves. I wonder what was meant. Does he mean that the messenger is closer to each person than each beleiving personis to the other believing person (a fairly major claim to make nonetheless) or that the messenger is closer to the believing person than that believing person is to himself (echoing Augustine)? This latter interpretation would not be acceptable to anyone (as that would be a Divine prerorgative)and thus I cannot imagine that is what he meant.Textually, there are contradictions for which Muslim scholars prescribe the rule of abrogation. Because, for muslims, the text came direct from God through Gabriel and through the messenger, such rules are needed to explain the inconsistencies. The apparent tendency of God to contradict himself (i.e. abrogating earlier verses), manifesting His absolute transcendence, means that rational discourse with followers of Islam may be difficult. For muslims, God is not Logos - the Word did not become flesh. God can do as He pleases. Nevertheless, respectful dialogue must be actively pursued in the interests of peace.The impression one gets from reading the book is: well there are some good bits (the names of God for one, encouraging people to be virtuous etc, poetic bits about God's transcendence) and there are some bad bits: prescribing the slaying of people. The granting of privileges (not accorded to other believers) to the messenger is puzzling and is in contrast to other religions where the religious founders/prophets, far from giving themselves special privileges, set themselves up as paragons of virtue by denying themselves. The latter makes one inclined to consider that some verses have been specifically designed to satisfy the messenger's needs at a particular point in his career. Western readers will have difficulty with such things as prescribing violence, laxity in marriage laws, polygamy, and permitting sexual relations with one's female slaves (never mind having slaves in the first place!) Aside from the fact that the messenger is granted privileges, it is disturbing that in one sura it is said that those who annoy God and his messenger will be cursed and punished!One comes away baffled by the lack of clarity as to how Islam stands on the Old and New Testaments - the messenger borrows heavily from the Torah and seems to respect it - likewise he respects Jesus, Mary etc but their function in the Koranic text is simply not explained. Thus, one is left with the question: why are they in the text? The references waft in and out without any explanation - the story of Zachariah is a case in point. He just appears and disappears without any meaning to his appearance in the text. Jesus is born of a virgin and he will come at the end of time. But, what was Jesus' message and why is it not the messenger who was born of a virgin and who comes at the end of the time? Leaving aside, of course, that the tone and content of the Koran contradicts the tone and content of the gospels, what is the purpose of these other religious figures in the Koran? They appear like stage props.The overall impression that this is a derivative text (reference to the Torah, echoes of the gospels/Gnostic writings etc)) for the Arabic peoples to give them a religious foundation in believing that God is One, to get them away from polytheism and to give them a sense of unity. They are thus given a foundational story, heavily leaning on the stories of the Jews but at the same time distancing themselves from Jews and Christians with much polemic. The question is why do Arabs need a new text at all - what is wrong with the Torah? (their leaning towards a rules based approach makes them, at first sight, more inclined to follow the Law than the gospel?) The answer given in the text is: schism of the Jews and Christians (and misinterpretation by the Jews) but given that Islam immediately enters into schism itself following the death of the messenger, this is hardly credible.A key problem with the text is that it is the work of one man with his limitations and frailties (note, this is not what the muslims believe) and with his own style of communicating. Whilst there is a big difference between the earlier and later suras, that difference is not so sufficient as to remove the monochrome nature of the work. There is a metaphor, the Oneness of God is so absolute in Islam that He gives his message through One man in One historical context. In the Bible, God is One but he is also constituted in relationships of community, thus He gives his message through many persons in a multiplicity of literal forms (history/facts/mythic stories/love poetry/prayers/gospels/letters/apocalyptic literature/wisdom literature) in different historical conditions and finally reveals Himself in his Son. In other words, the Bible is a work immersed in relationships.I write this review, as a believing Christian, conscious that in my own scriptures (the Old Testament), violence abounds. But, as a Christian, I profess that the Bible is inspired, not that every single word is the exact word of God. I am also conscious that in the Bible there is a process of God revealing Himself over time - this means what we get in our religious texts is God being mediated through man complete with real historical warts and all. This inevitably leads (as in the Torah where violence is plentiful) to man spinning sacred myths (God's wrath) to justify man's propensity towards evil and sacred violence. But, the truth is gradually revealed in the prophets and finally in Christ: God is love and he calls us to love Him and our neighbor.However, Muslims believe that the Koran is God's word. This is highly problematic and perhaps they will find a way, going forward, to nuance this belief and move towards allegorical interpretation. Would I recommend this book to anyone? Yes, I would recommend it to anyone of good will who wishes to know what muslims believe. I would specially recommend it to Christians, so that any tendency to relativise religious beliefs is dispelled. The Christian scriptures are indeed unique in depicting God as intervening decisively in human history and showing Himself on the Cross, as a God who loves us until the end."},{"Title":"The Holy Qur'an","review":"The seller was kind enough to notify me that this older translation was out-of-stock and no more were expected.Apparently every translation from Arabic to English is at the mercy of the translater so each version is different.Owing to the current political situation, I had been looking for an older translation in an attempt to learn more about the beliefs of Islam.

Other versions of this translation also contains historical commentary to make it easier to understand the history and context of much of what is written, and helps to eliminate many common misunderstandings and misconceptions. A common misconception of Islam in the west is that it teaches hatred and religious intolerance. In truth this is not the case in real Islam. The portions that would seem at first glance to deliver such a message are shown clearly through the commentary not to be doing so, but rather is more of a historical commentary in much the same way as the wars in the Old Testament of the Bible are described. All in all an excellent translation for a native English speaker wishing to understand the core concepts of true Islam, and to also eliminate the common misconceptions surrounding it. Beyond this excellent commentary, the translation itself is very good, if perhaps using a vocabulary a bit more in line with more educated readers. All in all an excellent translation, and a must read for anyone interested in Islam. If you are only going to buy one translation of the Quran - make it this one - but consider one that includes the commentary also."},{"Title":"The Holy Qur'an","review":"I would like to say that this book is certainly worth one's while to have on your shelf. I find that I tend to prefer Shakir's translation (or if you prefer, interpretation), but both do an excellent job of applying the Early Modern English of the King James Bible to the Qur'an. I mention this because Yusuf Ali made a conscious decision to be not arcane, but archaic; the King James Bible has remained as popular as it has because of its elevated style, and attempts by Qur'an translators to use the same kind of language, then as now, were attempts to pay the Qur'an the highest compliment by using the highest language available in English. In fact, I would argue that both Yusuf Ali and Shakir's translations (I've not read others in their entirety) use archaism often to greater effect than in some parts of the Bible. I mention this because the \\"revised\\" edition of Yusuf Ali's interpretation distributed by Tahrike Tarsile Qur'an, Inc. completely removes the translator's original archaisms (i.e., the use of \\"thee\\" and \\"thou,\\" etc.) in an effort to make it more accessible to modern readers (I can't stand this choice for my own reading, although I now use that edition to lend to friends who are interested in an introduction).In terms of parenthetical additions to the text (I don't know if there is a more technical term for these kinds of glosses), I could frankly do without them in either translation--although I understand this is often standard practice--I feel that both tend to make up for what at least beginners might consider the other's shortcomings. It is certainly worth buying in conjunction with Shakir's for the latter's topical index in its Tahrike Tarsile edition. One thing that beginners might also wish to consider is that to my understanding, Yusuf Ali's translation is more respected among Sunnis whereas Shakir's, among Shi'ites. (Does anyone know if there is an English translation particularly respected among Sufis?)One might wish to consider if interested in Yusuf Ali's translation is that for the most part, he does not use the Arabic, but rather the Western (Biblical) names for most of the Prophets. For instant, Isa bin Maryum becomes \\"Jesus, Son of Mary.\\" I do not know whether this is a desire to simply use English names for the sake of translation, or to make his interpretation more accessible to the West or to the Western-educated, but people should keep in mind that Yusuf Ali himself was a Western-educated man in what was at the time of his interpretation's publication British India. Those who come from Western backgrounds like myself will probably find this a useful convention if seeking an introduction; I am a firm believer in cross-cultural understanding, and to that end I would ask those who would prefer the Arabic names of the Qur'an to have patience with this choice of the translator. And frankly, any little thing that could help give Westerners an easier time understanding of Islam is especially crucial in this day and age, what with the \\"burqa\\" laws of France, the Low Countries, and even (sadly) Qu&eacute;bec; Little Mosque On The Prairie is a valuable cultural touchstone, but it can only do so much.Finally, although I am myself an atheist, I would like to mention one thing about this particular edition for the benefit of observant Muslims. Namely, that this is a Wordsworth Library Edition, and as such it contains a portrait of the English poet William Wordsworth on its spine. Now for reasons both annoy and mistify me, the publisher will often put Wordsworth's portrait on the front cover as well, although the Qur'an has fortunately been spared this embarassment. Not that what remains is particularly conspicuous either; the miniature portrait on the spine can't be more than one square half-inch, but it is there nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Holy Qur'an","review":"I haven't made it all the way through this book... but, as I continue to read I find new ways of thinking about what I believe and solidify what I have always thought... there is more that we have in common than not.

It covers each game of the season, in varying levels of detail, and profiles many of the teams' players and coaches.In covering the 1990 season, which had the potential to be one of the more significant events in NFL history, the author also interweaves coverage of the 49ers run of success throughout the 1980's. Overall, it presents an excellent picture of the Dynasty era Niners - which may never again be seen in the NFL, given the advent of free agency and the salary cap in the 1990's. Some of the most interesting passages, for example, are on the 49ers dealings with the notoriously demanding Bay area sportswriters throughout the 1980's.What neither the author nor his subjects realized at the time, however, was that the 1990 season would turn out to be the last campaign of the Joe Montana era team. Montana would never play another meaningful game for San Francisco, and Ronnie Lott, Roger Craig and others would soon be gone. (The 49ers went on to win another Super Bowl follwoing the 1994 season, but with a much different team that featured Steve Young and Deon Sanders). In that respect, it serves as an excellent coda on the Montana era 49ers.However, the book is not without its faults. While many players are profiled, little attention is given to Roger Craig, who would turn out to be the most significant player in 1990. His early season injury and rushed return, with little productivity, was the key to the season. While the author generally covers the team's injury problems and the gradual decline brought on by getting each opponent's best effort every week, he doesn't provide much analysis of what was really happening on the field late in the season - Namely, that the ineffectiveness of Roger Craig and the running game, whether from injury or other reason, left the team with a one dimensional attack. As opposing teams realized this, the 49ers began to struggle, culminating in the NFC Championship loss to the Giants.The author's coverage of the Championship game also seems a bit terse and abrupt, especially in contrast to coverage of an earlier Monday Night game against the Giants. Perhaps that was consciously done to show the shock of the game slipping away late, but one can't help but wish for some of the sideline details provided on earlier games. What was being said, for example, after the plays on which Montana was injured and Craig's fumble was recovered by LT ? Also, no mention is made of Montana being seriously ill in the days before the game, which was widely discussed in the press coverage of the game.Despite these shortcomings, the book remains one of the best on the Montana era team. It doesn't have the personal viewpoint and corresponding limitations that the various books by players, coaches, and journalists involved with the team all seem to contain, nor does it have the chronological tone used in most of the team history books. Given that most football books are not especially well written, it's a very good read for a 49er fan."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Wow! With a nice, down-to-earth style that most folks can follow without moving their lips too much whilst reading, Dennis Pottenger does a bang-up job of updating Charles D!ckens' classic tome of a boy's going from rags to riches! The similarities are astounding! Except for the key characters, that is. And the time setting. And the fact that the new version's subject is NFL football. Oh yes, the new rendition's ending isn't as happy as the original's was (well, for Niners fans anyway). Actually, now that I think about it, there's almost no similarities at all between D!ckens' timeless story and Pottenger's memoirs of his seven-month experience with a team that was on the cusp of destiny. Except for the title, that is. And the fact that both were written in English. Well, actually, the first \\"G.E.\\" is written in what most non-Yanks would consider proper English, whilst \\"G.E.2\\" is penned in that despised, bastardized American English. You know, words ending in -or, instead of -our, or \`program' instead of \`programme', \`parking lot' instead of \`car park', and the like...But I digress. If you've ever wanted to take a behind-the-scenes look at the Niner's 1990 season of hard-fought triumphs and ultimate tragedy, this tome is the best way to go about it. Their quest for the three-peat- a still-unprecedented three consecutive Super Bowl victories- is shown from the author &amp; players' view of the game-day field, the locker room, and the training field. From their victory at Super Bowl XXIV that sparked the quest to the aftermath of their dream-ending conference-championship loss the following season, the author takes the reader on a week-by-week tour of every hard-fought victory and horrific loss.Although he does go into the lives of the team's marquee players like Joe Montana &amp; Ronnie Lott, Pottenger focuses mainly on a handful of lesser-known red-and-gold-clad warriors. There's tight end Jamie Williams, considered the best-blocking TE in the league at the time. Leg break-prone WR Mike Sherrard once again facees the ordeal of yet another leg fracture that further stymies his playing ability. There's center Jesse Sapolu's tribulations trying to stay healthy and not let his teammates down with his absence. There's hard-hitting safety Chet Brooks' knee problem that cuts down his playing time. Rookie RB/ kick returner Dexter Carter's inconsistent effort is getting to him. And former Giants NT Jim Burt is just itchin' to get back at his old team! The week-by-week reactions &amp; insights of these players and others really gave me a small idea of what it's like to play in the big leagues, and trying your damnedest to get the job done as every weekly opponent gives their all to stop you &amp; your teammates from making history.Quite a bit of attention is paid to \`Frisco's two big games against the New York Giants. Pottenger gives the first game, a hard-hitting 7-3 Niner Monday-night victory, and almost play-by-play feel to it. He also does the same (though to a lesser extent) for their last-second heartbreak conference championship loss that saw Montana fall and not play again for nearly two years, and Roger Craig fumble the game away. Needless to say, there's few famous Niner losses that were more harrowing than this one.If you're a Niner fan (or a N.Y. Giants fan in need of a good laugh), and you feel that you can manage this little tragic tale of one of pro sports' greatest franchises and their ultimately futile shot at history, then \`Great Expectations' could very well be the thing you need!\`Late"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The 1990 Niners were a special team. The author probably set out to cover the NFL's first threepeat, only to be denied when the Giants moved on to the Super Bowl instead of San Francisco. No matter. The book tells a story of a great mix of youth and veterans, and offers a great glimpse into the worries and concerns of an NFL player. A good read. Very underrated book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations goes into the 1990 season of the 49ers and there quest for a &quot;three-peat&quot;.

After all, if you're not sure you want to adopt, buying a how-to-adopt book is like a person who's unsure about marriage buying a book on planning their wedding.Is Adoption For You is a sort of &quot;prequel,&quot; written in a friendly and helpful manner that guides you along the way, with advice on how to consider the issues involved, as well as self-tests and insightful information on adoption and adopted kids. For example, is genetics important to you? If you must have a child who looks like you, adoption won't work for you. Are you a clean freak? Children make lots of messes. It's also important to consider what your spouse or partner thinks about adoption too, one of the many key issues covered in this extremely helpful and practical book."},{"Title":"Is Adoption for You: The Information You Need to Make the Right Choice","review":"When I first read the title of this book I immediately thought: Who, other than my heart, can tell me whether adoption is for me? But the author asks enough questions and brings up enough issues that I see the importance of considering all these points before proceeding. This book pulled the mirror up to my face even about our own adoption 34 years ago! Fortunately, the answer is still yes, it was for us, only I didn't think about all the things the author brings up, such as ten adoption myths which are important to clear up before considering adoption. (I thought about none of them 34 years ago and dove right into adoption!) I'm glad the author mentioned the myth that adopted kids don't attach to adoptive parents. I can assure you that our daughter, adopted at age 4 days in 1969, is deeply attached to us. She has met her birthmother at age 28, and there is no doubt that her attachment to us, her adoptive parents, is unshakable.I especially like the author's neutrality about open or confidential adoptions. She cautions the prospective adoptive parents to become as informed about the practice of openness or confidentiality as possible and only to choose one or the other after careful consideration of what they feel is right for them, not for what is pushed by anyone.Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?"},{"Title":"Is Adoption for You: The Information You Need to Make the Right Choice","review":"This book made me think of a pocket English dictionary, with a little information about almost everything. Its target is more an American audience because it explains a lot of search, paperwork and financial issues that american residents have to go through to adopt. Canadians or Europeans may need to bypass a large part of the book, to get to the emotional, mental and physical abilities an adoptive parents may need to have. It is a good overview of what one needs to think of before adopting. I especially liked the Appendix A; Bad and Good Reasons to adopt. I would have liked to read more about ADHD which is one of the most common issues coming with adopted children, and it is not necessarily visible or mentioned to adoptive parents. I would also have liked to read a lot more in Chapter 17 from people who considered adoption. I would have liked to see comments and conclusions from people who adopted for all the wrong reasons mentioned but ended up molding themselves in the good reasons.

Finally, a book that closes the gap between these two mediums beautifully. Collage can be pretty intimidating to some people, which is why I love Kelly Angard's approach to the medium. She describes it as \\"a type of art as well as a way of creating art\\", and further explains that \\"every layout you do is a collage. It is a collage of your thoughts, memories and feelings as much as it is a collage of color, texture and image\\".This book is based on four distinct categories that the author feels is essential to scrapbooking: Colorant (techniques for adding color), Texture, Image and Collage. Each chapter contains layouts which illustrate a technique from each category. For example, under the colorant category she illustrates how to alter patterned paper, how to use a brayer to create mask effects, working with glazes, transfers, brush techniques, and so on. There are at least a dozen techniques for each category, and over 50 presented in the entire book. This is literally a gold mine for the technique enthusiast!

Stephen Knapp has given us a book to give to people about to make the transition. In this reviewer's opinion though, FACING DEATH is a must-read for us, now...to prepare for the ultimate adventure. Without a doubt, one of the most misunderstood and feared aspects of life is death. In our Western culture, we generally do not think of death (we're afraid to?) until the time comes for someone close...or our time is near. Author and seer Stephen Knapp points out that if we allow ourselves to recognize that death is a part of life...life becomes different...more valuable and more meaningful. For instance, we'd have fewer quarrels, we'd be more giving and understanding, and we'd appreciate many things that we now take for granted. FACING DEATH, therefore, is a must-read to diminish our fears of death while expanding the pleasures of life. Stephen Knapp offers both sage advice as well as spiritual insight. &quot;Each life is meant for us to learn more about ourselves, and about who we are.&quot; Nearing death, &quot;...let go and let God put you where you will make the most progress.&quot; FACING DEATH teaches that, &quot;...death is essentially the shedding of the body.&quot; What remains, forever, is the soul. Thus, &quot;...death can be looked at as a great opportunity...the ultimate healing...the start of a [life] someplace else.&quot; Stephen Knapp divines that, &quot;Preparing for death is looking into the truth of yourself. By doing this you also learn how to live.&quot; If we start preparing sooner, we learn, we have a greater opportunity to appreciate our life, and attain a high level of consciousness for the final transition."},{"Title":"The doll,: And one other","review":"This is a fairly short book, and was the first of Blackwood's works that I have read.

And that is who we really are - that peaceful awareness that is the real Self behind the small self. Further Damion and Judy Lynn are pointing out that all of us are That and that therefore we are all One. So in recognizing the peaceful awareness in ourselves and extending it to others, we are involved in a Great Conspiracy to love and allow that peace in ourselves and in our neighbors.Jesus' statement, \\"I leave you peace, my peace I give to you\\", becomes much more real.I find that the mere act of reading this book continually brings me back to the peaceful awareness - to the Here and Now. The book is a great exercise in doing the Inner Work and in assisting us to not only know about peaceful awareness but actually to experience it - Here and Now.ANOTHER WAY: ALLOWING INNER PEACE is in the great tradition of books such as \\"The Wisdom od Insecurity\\" and \\"This is It\\" by Alan Watts who tried to describe in Western terms the Peace sought by Eastern seekers such as Zen masters.The book is also in the more modern movement of great seekers and teachers such as Dr. Wayne Dyer, Dr. Deepok Chopra, and Dr. Andrew Weil who are continuously pointing out practical techniques such as meditation, nutrition, and exercise from both the Eastern and Western Traditions which will bring us closer to our Real Selves.What Damion and Judy Lynn have done, I believe, is to resist any temptation to somehow make their message seem important or correct or profound by overcomplicating it or dazzling us with verbal footwork and displays of knowledge or esoteric credentials. Instead they have stripped the message to the bare bones simplicity that it really is: there is a self that is our true Self. It is always near, never far, and it is the Awareness that you are reading this paper with right Now.Thank you Damion Kirk and Judy Lynn Griffler for reaching out your hands in love to help your brothers and sisters."},{"Title":"Another Way: Allowing Inner Peace","review":"At first glance, Another Way's simple expressionsseemed almost &quot;childlike&quot; and what I thoughtI knew already, after many years of meditationand spiritual investigation.

It is NOT a book by Kolmogorov/Fomin, but rather an edited version by Silverman. So, if you read the first lines in the Editor's Preface, it states, \\"The present course is a freely revised and restyled version of ... the Russian original\\". Further down it continues, \\"...As in the other volumes of this series, I have not hesitated to make a number of pedagogical and mathematical improvements that occurred to me...\\". Read it as a big red warning flag. Alas, I would have to agree with the reader from Rio de Janeiro. I've been working through this book to rehash my knowledge of measure theory and Lebesgue integration as a prerequisite for stochastic calculus. And I've encountered many results of \\"mathematical improvements\\" that occurred to the esteemed \\"translator\\". Things are fine when topics/theorems are not too sophisticated (I guess not much room for \\"improvements\\"). Not so when you work through some more subtle proofs. Most mistakes I discovered are relatively easy to rectify (and I'm ignoring typos). But the latest is rather egregious. The proof of theorem 1 from ch. 9 (p.344-345) (about the Hahn decomposition induced on X by a signed measure F) contains such a blatant error, I am very hard pressed to believe it comes from the original. That book survived generations of math students at Moscow State, and believe me, they would go through each letter of the proofs. Astounded by such an obvious nonsense, I grabed the only other reference book on the subject I had at hand, \\"Measure Theory\\" by Halmos. The equivalent there is theorem A, sec. 29 (p.121 of Springer-Verlag edition), which has a correct proof.For those interested in details, Silverman's proof states that positive integers are strictly ordered: k1&lt;k2&lt;...&lt;kn&lt;... which is nonsense. Consider subsets B1 and B2 such that F(B1)=3, F(B2)=2, for example. That gives you both k1=k2=1. The flaw of course is not in this slip-up per se, but rather in the logic of the proof which follows from the above ordering of k's. Compare vs Halmos text to see the difference. It may seem insignificant to certain translators, but in mathematics, out of all of sciences, subtle details change an elegant proof to a flagrant nonsense.Unfortunately, I don't have the Russian original. Instead, I'm trying to get the other, hopefully real translation, \\"Elements of the Theory of Functions and Functional Analysis\\". BTW, this is the actual title of the original, not \\"Introductory Real Analysis\\". Which apparently is causing significant confussion amoung past and present readers. To give you a background info, the Russian original is (or has been, at least) used as a textbook for a third-year subject for (hard-core) math students. Meaning, in the preceding two years they would complete a pre-requisite four-semester calculus course. For example, criteria of convergence of series and their properties is an assumed knowledge in presentation of Lebesgue integral. So, I think most of the critique from earlier reivews is a bit misdirected. The original book is a great starting book into functional analyis/Lebesgue integration and differentiation, but proofs require solid understanding of fundamentals of calculus.The best part about Kolmogorov's text is the clarity of conceptual structure of the presented subject a reader would gain, if he/she puts some effort. You would gain a thorough understanding, not just a knowledge of the subject. There is quite a difference between the two, and not that many authors succeed in delivering that.But to gain that from Kolmogorov, I would suggest the other, \\"unimproved\\" but real, translation."},{"Title":"Introductory Real Analysis (Dover Books on Mathematics)","review":"Overall, this book is a very strong &quot;introduction&quot; (I use the word grudgingly, see below) to real analysis. Topics range from the basics of set theory through metrics, operators, and Lebesgue measures and integrals. Particularly well done are the section on linear maps and operators, which include excellent generalizations as well as the usual concrete examples. The book usually includes a large number of examples and exercises on each topic which aid in the understanding of the material (though in a few instances, most notably the introduction to measure, it would have been more helpful to have examples as the theory was being developed instead of spending 20 pages getting through the theorems and only then giving a few examples).The main problem for this book, however, is that it is located at an awkward level in terms of its assumptions of what students have seen before. Most of the material covered is that of a first analysis course, and the book is probably usually used as such. The authors, however, sometimes make assumptions that students have had exposure to some of the concepts before, claiming that &quot;the reader has probably already encountered the familiar Heine-Borel theorem&quot;, for example. One particularly annoying case was when the authors gave as an example that the set of polynomials with rational coefficients is dense in the set of continuous functions, and left it at that. Are we supposed to have encountered Weierstrass's theorem before we take our first analysis course?"},{"Title":"Introductory Real Analysis (Dover Books on Mathematics)","review":"This is a most beautiful exposition of Analysis going upto graduate level!

He begins measure theory by constrution of measures on plane sets, then proceeds to generalize, one example of the conrcrete approach in the book. Kolmogorov also provided us with the axiomatics of Functional Analysis in 3 clear chapters.I heartily recommend this book as a stop-over before ,say, a study of Rudin's Real and Complex whose expostion (especially of measure theory) is as abstract as it is beautiful.And then of course, enough cannot be said about the price.....!"},{"Title":"Introductory Real Analysis (Dover Books on Mathematics)","review":"The advantages of this text have been pointed out by other readers, so I will attempt to exhibit the problems of this book.There are a lot of mistakes. And by 'a lot', I mean that the careful reader should be able to find at least 5 mathematical mistakes in each chapter. I used this text mainly as a supplement to a fairly advanced analysis course, and we'd often have problems from it used in our problem sets. At first, it appeared as if this were a very well-written text, but once we started with our problem sets, there were at least 2 e-mails sent out per week addressing a concern a student had pointed out. After a while, students stopped e-mailing the professor with their concerns, instead just assuming that they were correct whenever they spotted something weird.Let's take an example:Problem 1, pg. 137: Let M be the set of all points x = (x1, x2, ..., xn, ...) in l2 satisfying the condition \\\\sum^{\\\\infty}_{n=1} (n^2) (x_n)^2 \\\\le 1. Prove that M is a convex set, but not a convex body.The problem with this is that M IS easily a convex body, precisely because x = (0,0,...) is in M.There are many more big mistakes and little mistakes throughout the exercises, oftentimes destroying the entire POINT of the problem. Take, for example, Problem 1 of pg. 76: Let A be a mapping of a metric space R into itself. Prove that the condition p(Ax,Ay) &lt; p(x,y) (x\\\\ne y) is insufficient for the existence of a fixed point of A.Now, a counterexample here can be easily produced, even by the most elementary reader. But the exercise quickly becomes worthwhile if we make R complete. It's the little things that count in mathematics, and the small errors like these are clearly detrimental to the student.But the errors in the text aren't limited to exercises. I was reading independently at the front of the book to get some info on Zorn's Lemma and ordinal numbers, and as I read, I found the following definition:Let M1 and M2 be two ordered sets of type 01 and 02, respectively. Then we can introduce an ordering in the union M1 U M2 of the two sets by assuming that1) a and b have the same ordering as in M1 if a,b are in M12) a and b have the same ordering as in M2 if a,b are in M23) a &lt; b if a in M1, b in M2The set M1 U M2 ordered in this way is called the ordered sum of M1 and M2, denoted by M1 + M2.There is a clear problem with this definition pointed out here: http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=200985. How is the student expected to learn such important material when even the definitions have loopholes? By the end of our experience with this book, our professor was giving out exercises to correct Kolmogorov/Fomin's incorrect definitions.Note also that Silverman uses very weird words. For example, 'countably compact' is used instead of 'sequentially compact'."},{"Title":"Introductory Real Analysis (Dover Books on Mathematics)","review":"I find this a great introduction to real analysis. Contrary to what one reviewer has suggested, I think the book is fairly rigorous. It is true that some details are omitted, but they can always be filled up by the reader. In fact, this is the one of the most fun parts of reading the book!To give a concrete example: One reviewer has suggested that the theorem &quot;Every infinite set has a countable subset&quot; is proved without stating that the axiom of choice is required. This is certainly a serious lapse of rigour, BUT, in a later page, the author explains the axiom of choice (and several equivalent assertions) and also touches upon the fact that there are some very deep set theoretic questions, not yet fully resolved, concerning this axiom. He goes on to say &quot;The axiom of choice will be assumed in this book. In fact, without it, we will be severely hampered for making various set-theoretic constructions&quot;. It is evident that the above theorem is one such construction.This book emphasizes an intuitive approach to the subject, something which in my opinion is neglected by far too many books.

I did not have the mathematical maturity at the time that I do now, so accept that as a qualification to my review.

He presents several quite different examples of metric spaces near the beginning of the book, and whenever he discusses a major concept in metric spaces he shows what it means for each of his example spaces. His presentation of measure theory and Lebesgue measure is also fantastic; I always recommend that people just read this chapter rather than taking a course on measure theory.Finally, his first chapter on set theory is fabulous. As an undergrad, with having read that chapter once being my only knowledge of set theory, I was able to easily do all of the homework of my friends who were struggling in their set theory classes - I was always the person they would come to for help.I'm considering buying Kolmogorov's functional analysis book, even though it's not my area, just because he wrote it.

I appreciate that there are more scholarly, objective - and accurate - treatments of Clarence Darrow's life, but this is the one that got me interested and that still holds a special place. Although written in the 1940s, this life of Darrow was well suited to the climate of the 1960s (when I first read it), when conventional thinking was questioned and liberal ideals were gaining traction. Darrow championed not only evolution in the Scopes Trial, but also the death penalty v. mental illness (Leopold & Loeb), racial integration (the Sweet case in Detroit), and other unpopular causes long before they became the legal norm.Irving Stone's books are great entry texts to the lives of men and women of great ideals and courage - perhaps a little \\"adolescent,\\" but that's part of their particular value.

Darrow left his well-paying job as attorney for the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad to defend socialist labor leader Eugene Debs in the aftermath of Chicago's 1894 Pullman strike. As readers see, Darrow would then spend the next four decades defending other outcasts and unpopular causes. Darrow would defend labor activists and strikers, millionaire killers Leopold and Loeb, racial integration in Detroit (the Sweet Case), and the teaching of Evolution in Tennessee (Scopes Monkey trial). His opponents would include not only prosecutors, but law makers, ex-Presidential candidates like William Jennings Bryan, and very often enraged public opinion. Readers see how Darrow combined shrewd legal strategy with superb ability to question and cross-examine witnesses. Of course, he was also recognized as among the greatest courtroom orators ever - Chicagoans fought to get courtroom seats for his summation in the Leopold and Loeb case. Darrow would also twice stand trial in Los Angeles, charged with jury tampering from the McNamara case - he was acquitted but left shaken by the experience. All is here in this interesting if slightly dated book written shortly after his passing."},{"Title":"Clarence Darrow for the Defense","review":"A very comprehensive biography that describes all the various aspects of Clarence Darrow's personality, of his work and his times. Stone has great empathy and understanding so that as a reader I can feel I am being taken along to think and feel with Darrow who effectively promulgated and lived his ideals (and philosophy) of justice, equality, freedom, love, human dignity and who deeply understood their interrelations. His charity as one form of his love was so unconditional and absolute that he took so many law cases of poor people without pay. Having read Irving Stone's biographical novels of Eugene Debs (with the misleading title \`Adversary in the House') and of Michelangelo, my high expectations were not disappointed by this biography. Irving Stone did a great job because he provides a sharp insight into the socio-economic injustice in the capitalist system, the influence of the big corporations on the government, the development and the problems of the American working class movement, especially its unions. He describes the bigotry, prejudices, hatred and violence among large portions of the American society as partly supported and prompted by the media. And Irving Stone knew how to tell all this in a consistent semi-literary style and composition (the novelist shining through) keeping a delicate balance between reflective distance and narrative closeness to his subject matter. Impressive and inspiring confidence in the truth of his biography is Stone's thorough and extensive research in preparation of the book as can be seen from the references. I would recommend a new fine edition, cloth bound and illustrated - for the biography and its subject are still pertinent in the present times.Thorsten-Michael Wulff"},{"Title":"Clarence Darrow for the Defense","review":"I thought this author's interesting style was better than the other biographies on Darrow in the library.When Darrow found that the McNamaras were responsible for destroying bridges: \\"He felt like a man with a rumbling volcano in his pocket, trying to hold back the eruption with his naked hand.\\" (p. 278)Does this quote sound odd to anyone else?"},{"Title":"Clarence Darrow for the Defense","review":"A quick search shows that \\"a reader\\" appears again and again in reviews of books about Darrow, and makes repeated, unsubstantiated and biting attacks on the great trial lawyer.

'Unless a fellow moves ahead, he's left behind.'\\" (Pg. 100) Darrow once observed, \\"When I was a boy I was told that anybody could become President. I'm beginning to believe it.\\" (Pg. 196)Darrow was a firm determinist: \\"Scientists have so thoroughly established the theory of evolution, there is no longer any room for such a doctrine as freedom of the will. Nothing in the universe is outside the law, whether mineral, animal or vegetable. Free will means that man would live day by day, governed by his transient will, instead of being moved and virtually controlled by every experience of his life. The laws that control human behavior are as fixed and certain as those that control the physical world.\\" (Pg. 111) Consequently, Stone explains his motives for the defense of Loeb and Leopold, \\"All killings by the state were murder in the first degree. Since one could not reform an offender by executing him, they were acts of revenge. His half century in the courts had convinced him that... the executions did not act as a deterrent to further killings, but instead tended to cheapen human life, break down the barriers of its indestructibility at the hands of man.\\" (Pg. 432)During the \\"Monkey Trial\\" of John Thomas Scopes, he \\"now admitted Stewart's right to call him an agnostic: 'I do not consider it an insult, but rather a compliment, to be called an agnostic. I do not pretend to know where many ignorant men are sure.'\\" (Pg. 500) Of Darrow putting William Jennings Bryan on the witness stand, Stone observes, \\"It was an old Darrow strategem of putting the prosecution on the defense, which not only kept the hearing alive but turned the tide of victory. Since the court would not permit him to put scientific witnesses on the stand to build up evolution and the defense of his client, the only recourse he had left was to put the prosecution on the stand and try to break down the literal interpretation of the Bible.\\" (Pg. 515)Stone notes, \\"When asked by one of his opponents if, when he dies, he didn't want to live eternally, he replied, 'When I die all I ask is that there be some friends who will remember my weaknesses and forget my virtues.'\\" (Pg. 555) He adds, \\"His most famous quip, which has since become an American classic, was, 'I never wanted to see anybody die, but there are a few obituary notices I have read with pleasure.'\\" (Pg. 561)Stone's biographies are always engagingly-written, but this one is definitely one of his best. It benefits greatly from the private correspondence, family documents, manuscripts, legal briefs, notebooks and unpublished memoirs that Stone purchased from Mrs. Darrow."},{"Title":"Clarence Darrow for the Defense","review":"I picked up a worn copy of this book in my host's home: it looked suitably dull (I like dull books to help put me to sleep.) Boy! Was I wrong this time. Irving Stone writes well: I suspect that despite the romantic sweep of prose, the careful tilting of the light, I believe the portrait that emerges is utterly true: Clarence Darrow is an unacknowledged giant in American intellectual history.Darrow embodies just about every trait I admire in people. He was an intellectual of enormous magnitude who was ever the common man with a fierce devotion to the poor and underprivileged. He was fearless in the face of insurmountable prejudice, the threats of powerful institutions and just plain hate. The obstacles he faced in the defense of Big Bill Haywood are unbelievable, and his next Union case in California was even more challenging. Both times he plucked a modicum of success out of the jaws of incredible manipulation by the courts. I believe his notoriety and character helped shift America from the depths of ignorance, greed and bigotry that characterized the Gilded Age to the greater enightenment of his time: empowering Unions, the poor and dispossessed and setting the stage for the New Deal. Reading this book convinced me that the law and lawyers can be the most powerful tool for social transformation. The portrait painted by this book is simply awesome: it reveals how one man can move a nation over the fulcrum of his pure heart and piercing mind and steely language. It became instantly one of my favorite books: I went out and scarfed up as many copies of the early hardbound editions as I could find to share with my best friends and family.

It spans all his major cases and leaves the reader with awe for a man whose ability as an attorney in the Dr. Oscar Sweet case in Detroit, Michigan in 1925 was as if God had descended heaven from Heaven to win the freedom of a black professional who was accused of murder in an America that already had witnessed the Tulsa, Oklahoma and St. Louis race riots. His defense of the poor in the anthracite coal case of 1902 and the rioters in the Haymarket case stand as models for Americans of any age. The only weakness in the book is that his addresses to juries are not included. Clarence Darrow is as important to Americans as Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano Roosevelt were in the eras of the Civil War and the Great Depression. I recommend this book for all Americans of all ages. He was a defender of the poor and a defender of the values and ethics of American society.

He remained married to her until his death 50 years later. In marrying her, he sacrificed his natural inclinations for social convention.Mann found very young men beautiful, but his homosexuality remained hidden for 50 years after his death, when his diaries were released. These revealed that he was prone to fits of nausea, nervous, trembling and convulsive sobbing quite at odds with his public image of elegant, self-assured aloofness. He was fortunate that the Nazis never discovered his secret. -BBC Education: Biography of Thomas MannThe quote above is merely one of a number of similar sentiments that I found when I was looking for links for this review and I must admit, they completely mystify me. How could anyone read this story and not realize that Mann was an almost heroically repressed homosexual?Death in Venice tells the story of Gustav von Aschenbach, a German writer, who decides that he needs a holiday to relieve the stress of his &quot;nerve-taxing&quot; work. Eventually he arrives in Venice and conceives a passionate crush on a a fourteen year old boy named Tadzio. As he grows ever more obsessed with the boy, Aschenbach's mind becomes increasingly unbalanced. He takes to following the lad around and refuses to leave Venice despite an outbreak of cholera, virtually courting death in order to indulge his desires. Finally, as Tadzio frolics in the waves at the beach, Aschenbach dies quietly in a beach chair.Just in case the reader hasn't gotten the hint, Mann helpfully provides Aschenbach one extended soliloquy:For mark you, Phaedrus, beauty alone is both divine and visible; and so it is the sense way, the artist's way, little Phaedrus, to the spirit. But, now tell me, my dear boy, do you believe that such a man can ever attain wisdom and true manly worth, for whom the path to the spirit must lead through the senses? Or do you rather think-for I leave the point to you-that it is a path of perilous sweetness, a way of transgression, and must surely lead him who walks in it astray? For you know that we poets cannot walk the way of beauty without Eros as our companion and guide. We may be heroic after our fashion, disciplined warriors of our craft, yet are we all the women, for we exult in passion, and love is still our desire-our craving and our shame. And from this you will perceive that we poets can be neither wise nor worthy citizens. We must needs be wanton, must needs rove at large in the realm of feeling. Our magisterial style is all folly and pretence, our honourable repute a farce, the crowd's belief in us is merely laughable. And to teach youth, or the populace, by means of art is a dangerous practice and ought to be forbidden. For what good can an artist be as a teacher, when from his birth up he is headed direct for the pit? We may want to shun it and attain to honour in the world; but however we turn, it draws us still. So, then, since knowledge might destroy us, we will have none of it. For knowledge, Phaedrus, does not make him who possesses it dignified or austere. Knowledge is all-knowing, understanding, forgiving; it takes up no position, sets no store by form. It has compassion with the abyss-it is the abyss. So we reject it, firmly, and henceforward our concern shall be with beauty only. And by beauty we mean simplicity, largeness, and renewed severity of discipline; we mean a return to detachment and to form. But detachment, Phaedrus, and preoccupation with form lead to intoxication and desire, they may lead the noblest among us to frightful emotional excesses, which his own stern cult of the beautiful would make him the first to condemn. So they too, they too, lead to the bottomless pit. Yes, they lead us thither, I say, us who are poets-who by our natures are prone not to excellence but to excess.Mann, who had studied and was influenced by Nietzsche, here posits the artist as a Dionysian, drawn to the purely sensual. But at the same time he recognizes that this attraction to the non-rational realm is self destructive; yield to desire and you end up, like Aschenbach, first insane and then dead. The artist is counterpoised against the wise and rational citizenery, whom Nietzsche termed Apollonians (see Orrin's review of The Birth of Tragedy (1872)(Friedrich Nietzsche 1844-1900) (Grade: C). I've tried several times to read Mann's novels--Buddenbrooks, The Magic Mountain, Doctor Faustus--and I have to admit I find them unreadable, but supposedly this struggle between reason and passion is a consistent theme.Yet when Mann's diaries were published in the 1980's--revealing a man who, despite a successful marriage lasting half a century and producing six children, was continually smitten with young men, typically the waiters in his favorite restaurants--the critics claim to have been shocked by the revelation of his homoerotic yearnings. Significantly, there is no evidence that he acted on these impulses. He appears to have submerged his carnal appetite for boys in favor of a conventional family life. I simply do not understand why this should have surprised anyone; it seems perfectly consistent with the vision of this story that he would have chosen not to end up like Aschenbach himself.This is not a terribly enjoyable story to read and there aren't really any sympathetic characters. Nor do I find Mann's prose particularly compelling; as I mentioned, I've found his other works to be pretty tough sledding. But taken purely as a cautionary tale, it's at least mildly worthwhile reading.GRADE: C"},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"If you like short stories about grown men who are sexually attracted to boys, suicide, incest, and self-absorbed German narcissism, you'll love Death in Venice. Me, I don't much cotton to such themes in what I read, so I had trouble wading through this morass of early 20th century European bourgeoisie decadence. But as this book was the choice of our book club, I had to persevere.Of the eight short stories contained in this book, I found only the three middle ones, Mario and the Magician (1929), Disorder and Early Sorrow (1925), and A Man and His Dog (1918) to be of any worth. The others--Death in Venice (1911), Tonio Kr&ouml;ger (1903), The Blood of the Walsungs (1905), Tristan (1902), and Felix Krull (1911)--range from simply tedious and uninsightful to gross and perverse. Interestingly, it is Mann's earlier stories that fall into that category. I suppose these stories were meant to have shock value in their day. But in an era when the most disgusting material imaginable is only a mouse-click away, they seem painfully trite and pedestrian today.Mann's later stories are better, possibly because as he matured, Mann became a more skillful observer of the beauty and joy of everyday life. But if tinged with sentimentality, these stories don't really inspire. Of all the stories, Mario and the Magician is the only standout. It was the singular tale which kept me riveted with larger than life characters and underlying themes which got beyond the mundane or the merely sexual.As a whole, this is exactly the type of work that made me dislike studying modern literature as a student. The prose is dense and despite Mann's impressive descriptive ability, the stories do little to uplift the human spirit. Instead, the reader is left encumbered with a myriad of very negative ideas and dreary observations about life. In short, this book was a depressing, annoying, and occasionally disgusting read.If you want to read something interesting and uplifting, tryAngels in Iron."},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"When I think of Mann, and of this book in particular, I am caught up in epithets and contradictions: insightful, artistic, polished, brooding, ponderous, pretentious, time-bound, and slow. I cannot think of this book without thinking that it is an expression of a past era, yet an expression with some universal themes about human psyche and behavior. Mann is the highest literary embodiment of Nietzschean depth psychology and his philosophy of the Appollonian-Dionysian duality. He puts this Nietzsche-ism in the dialogues and monologues of his characters. I dare say that all of his *main* characters have been infected by something irrational and Dionysian, which they cannot shake off. Their souls have been skewed. They need to play out their drama, but not before a dose of philosophizing seeps into the story through conversations and reflections. Consequently, in this collection of short stories, the stories are not short at all, and some of them go for over 40 pages.What Mann portrays are characters affected by Nietzschean philosophy and Freudian psychology but in a subdued and cultured way. They are usually not frenzied or overtly irrational. Their layer of normality is rather thick, but beneath that layer, deterioration of the human soul continues. Whether it is an aged artist who is a repressed homosexual pedophile, a brooding young man of mixed ethnic heritage in the nationalist Germany, or the incestuous twins--all of them are living expressions of the breakdown of orthodoxy and dysfunctional life in the labyrinth of human history."},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"The reviews here are all right on. This collection may be the best intro to the GREATEST 20th Century Author..(OK, you may not agree.) Much of Mann is difficult and dense,even for me, a longtime devotee. In this collection, start off with MARIO, a superior look at the sacred and profane. We find a German tourist and his young family in Italy going into a seemingly harmless carnival-type show. The author's portrait of the innocent young is itself worth the entire book,their enchantment at the acts,until an ugly mesmorist makes his appearance performing seemingly impossible tricks on members of the crowd. Slowly, the innocent crowd has been hooked, the children awed by the whole thing, until the final,inevitable end. Reading this,I thought,&quot;Are there really people out there who can perform such acts?&quot; Who knows, but this story is surely a classic,along with the six others, mainly described in other reviews."},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"The most common translations, and for decades the only ones, are by H.T. Lowe-Porter. Her Wikipedia entry is fascinating. For better modern translations, try either the new Heim translation (the one with the introduction by author Michael Cunningham) or the new Joachim Neugroschel translation (the one used by Recorded Books and Audible, with an excellent translator's introduction that talks of the construction of Mann's writing)."},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"This is the kindle edition I like best. Aside from Mann's well known work, \\"Death in Venice\\", the book includes \\"Mario and the Magician\\", \\"A Man and His Dog,\\" and \\"Tonio Kroger\\". These stories are meant to be read with deliberation and sensibility as Mann wants us to feel the drama and tragedy unfold. In \\"A Man and His Dog\\", there is little drama and even less tragedy because the journey is mostly internal. It is a journey anyway, with the subtlety and pathos that make me say, Mann's creation of the aesthetic is deeply personal and universal at the same time. Power and powerlessness is one of his themes. Read about \\"Mario and the Magician\\" and you'll feel the existential pull of sadism and masochism evolve on so many levels, that the subtlety will seem sublime. Then the story of a man, who left alone on vacation, discovers a need so primal that it eludes his very rational powers to defy. \\"A Death in Venice\\", is about this accomplished intellectual who reverts to an early stage of development whereby he becomes enraptured by a young boy's beauty. This superficial knowing of the boy is in steep contrast to the depth of his well acclaimed written biographies. Living in his head for so long, left Aschenbach deeply out of balance. In a sense, Mann's stories are warnings to us to stay connected, generous, and humble. The characters in this volume of short stories, is about lonely people who feel small, moral nihilists who need to create drama to experience a sense of themselves, and about the formation of a union based on affection that is between a man and his dog. Who wouldn't want to enrich their literary tastes with tidbits like these!"},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"I've used this book in a couple classes now, and I love it. The stories are so screwed up, and have wonderful twists. The digital version just made it that much easier to read!"},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"This book contains several Thomas Mann short stories, but undoubtedly the best of them is Death in Venice, an absolute classic. It evokes love, youth, death, fatal attraction and of course Venice itself. Not be missed!"},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"Each of these \\"stories\\" (several are in fact novellas) are absolutely captivating. Mann had the extraordinary gift of understanding the silent drama in an individual's mind and of articulating it in a way that is at once fascinatingly distant and eerily familiar. His characters experience all sorts of love: the heated conflict of incestuous or pedophiliac desires, the tacit compassion between man and dog, the distanced empathy of familial bonds, and even the maddening attraction to love itself. In many ways the stories are thematically parallel to those of W. Somerset Maugham, though darker and perhaps even more intimate. I can only assume that Lowe-Porter's translation is true to form because the choice of diction is always spot-on and the syntax is consistently eloquent. I cannot imagine that the original could surpass the florid yet forceful style of this translation. To crown it all, the book even looks and feels beautiful with thick, sturdy pages and a heavy matte cover.In sum, this book is a masterpiece in all aspects. It deserves a place on every bookshelf."},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"Although his very name is synonymous with notoriously long novels such as \\"Buddenbrooks\\" and \\"Magic Mountain\\", Thomas Mann was prorific short story writer,too. he worked diligently and very punctually in quite disciplinary manner. Of course, above mentioned two book are true essense of his long literary life.However \\"Death in venice\\" and other short story that included in this book can be extremely helpful jumping point to explore this great but complext human being. There have been many authors whose works are basically nothing other than narration of their lives. But , in my humble opinion , no one could possibly surpass Thomas Mann. All his works are closely related to his reflections, experiences and his miseries( many might know what I mean),perhaps that's way he so merticulously kept his diary and put all his minute thought without self censoring .Among his numerous works, none are so confessional than \\"Tonio Kroger\\" and \\"Death in Venice\\". It is well known fact that \\"Tonio Kroger\\" was Thomas Mann's favorite work , despite there have been many severe critics , including his own son Golo Mann. Golo Mann, who was a prominent historian wrote unforgettable book on \\"Wallenstein\\", remarked on this work \\" the most terrible work among my father's works and also the worst short story in the 20th centry German literature\\". In addition to Golo Mann's invective to his own father, there have been numerous critics who , in my opinion, severely disparage \\"Tonio Kroger\\". There are not many works that bring almost bi-polarized reaction from readers. Please judge yourself. It's worth it.In addition to \\"Tonio Kroger\\", perhaps most famous Mann's short story \\" Death in Venice\\" is also highly recommened to read. the works will cause some outrage, disgust or utter boredom. But, it is unequivocally supreme work of art that should be free from scathing attack from both dilettanttes and philistines. other short stories are also fairly interesting works . \\"Mario and the Magician\\" , that show Mann's penetrating insight of the nature of Fascism, \\"Tristan\\", the work of cruel irony and grotesque humor,and \\"Felix Krull\\" , story that represent how Mann irony targetting himself.Overall, the book delivers memorable experience."},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"A breathtaking masterpiece of description. You will find yourself wanting to read this one very slowly, in order to savor the magnificent prose and not miss anything. As in all collections, some entries are more interesting than others. My favorites were &quot;Tonio Kroger&quot; for its look inside the soul of artistic people, and &quot;The Blood of the Walsungs&quot; for its bold look at incest, a story in which the protagonists, a sister and brother--twins to boot--find each other irresistible, and spend a good deal of the time caressing and kissing each other; the subject matter of this tale will make many readers uneasy, but it is told beautifully, and Mann captures, in mere words, all the physical charms of the ardent brother and sister. The other stories were secondary in merit, including &quot;Death in Venice,&quot; which was largely uninteresting, covering an authour who, approaching death, gets smitten by a Polish boy in that canal city. Still, for anyone interested in the craft of writing, this book is a must. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"&quot;A Death In Venice&quot; is much more then just the story of a aging author's lust for a young man - it is also the representation of Europe before and after the war. It is a beautifully written novella, that smacks of Joyce. Written from the perspective of the protagonist, it offers an indepth look into the mind of a brilliant man who finally disrobes himself of his rationality and dignity, and succumbs to passion and lust. It is a tale of morality, and leaves many questions unanswered. Does Tadzio exist? Was it all real? Who knows?"},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"The long novels of Thomas Mann can prove challenging, not unlike those of Henry James. Fortunately, this varied collection - Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories - offers an easier way to become acquainted with Mann's intellectual, psychologically complex literature.Thomas Mann's lengthy sentences and complex grammatical structures markedly complicate the task of translation. H. T. Lowe-Porter's translation is considered the most accessible version, although at the expense of subdividing many of Mann's sentences. (For comparison with an excellent literal version, look at Stanley Appelbaum's translation of Death in Venice, Dover Publications, 1995).Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories was first published by Vintage Books in 1954. My edition was printed by Vintage International in 1989; it has neither an introduction nor explanatory notes.Death in Venice (1911): While vacationing in Venice, the aging, highly respected author Gustave Ashenbach becomes mesmerized by a young boy staying at the seashore with his Polish aristocratic family. Although intellectually aware of his growing obsession, Ashenbach is unable to break away. This somber portrayal of a troubled man is a masterpiece of subtle nuances that illustrates Thomas Mann's ability to create layers of meaning.Tonio Kroger (1903) is perhaps more biographical as it explores a writer's internal conflict between his desire to be accepted, that is to fit in to a bourgeois life, and his contradictory need to follow his artistic temperament wherever it might lead him.Mario and the Magician (1929) is more explicitly political, depicting in the guise of an unscrupulous hypnotist a Mussolini-like character. The ending of this intriguing account is a surprise.The setting in Disorder and Early Sorrow (1925) is Munich, less than a decade after World War I, amid rampant inflation and social upheaval. The narrator, Professor Cornelius, is saddened by the loss of tradition, exemplified by modern art, music, and dance forms so popular with his older children, now young adults. He finds refuge in his study of history. Early sorrow refers to an incident involving his five year-old daughter, Ellie.A Man and His Dog (1918) is personal, humorous, and almost idyllic, quite different from the more serious topics addressed in the other stories in this collection.The Blood of the Walsungs (1905) is the most disturbing story in this collection. The two key characters exhibit an aristocratic arrogance and elitism that culminates in incest. In an opera scene Mann draws a close parallel between his two protagonists and Siegmund and Sieglinde in Wagner's Die Walkure.Tristan (1902) has been described as a retelling of the legend of Tristan and Isolde set in a sanatorium. Detlev Spinell, a tuberculosis patient staying in the Dr. Leander's medical facility, becomes infatuated with another patient, Herr Kloterjahn's wife. Spinell is a largely unsuccessful writer, one that has difficulty relating to others.In Felix Krull (1911) the narrator is a self-serving, unscrupulous, amoral, confidence man that is somehow likeable. The story ends abruptly, leaving the reader wondering what happens next. Forty years later Thomas Mann resumed work on this story and in 1954 he published the novel The Confessions of Felix Krull, a light, often hilarious account of a man who wins the favor and love of others by enacting the roles that they desire of him.Thomas Mann was born in Germany in 1875. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1929. He left Germany in 1933, living primarily in Switzerland and the United States until his death in 1955."},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"Thomas Mann may be an acquired taste in literature; he himself admitted that he had great difficulty knowing when to stop. Buddenbrooks, his autobiographically-based novel of a Northern German merchant family before WWI was supposed to be a short book of about 250 pages, like a Scandinavian novel. Well, it is far longer, and if you like Mann, you are glad of it.However, tackling The Magic Mountain, with its long philosophical discourses, or other Mann novels is a lot easier if you begin with these short works. (Short is relative; Death in Venice was supposed to be a short story and ended up, predictably, a novella.) The themes in these works show up again in Mann's other writings; Tristan in particular, is a sketch for The Magic Mountain (thumbnail sketch, to be sure.) Tonio Kroger resembles Buddenbrooks in the autobiographical details and setting. The theme of sexual perversion and decadence heading to destruction (supposedly a metaphor for the society of pre-war Germany) appear in both Death in Venice and Blood of the Walsungs.If you are new to Thomas Mann, these works are a wonderful place to start. If you grow to love his writing, re-reading these is always a pleasure."},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"I was given &quot;Death in Venice&quot; by a close friend. Scary how well she knows me. It was the perfect gift.&quot;Death in Venice&quot; is a collection of eight of Thomas Mann's best short stories. Usually, I'm not really one for short stories, as most times I find myself hanging at the end and disappointed in the development of the plots and characters. I was not disappointed with this book.Through his eight stories, Mann explores many aspects of human nature...most notably love. Each story has a different theme, but there is an underlying passion for life and meaningful relationships that fills each tale with beauty and a bittersweet longing. Topics in this collection range from a look at the world from the view of a young artist, a man's respect for the family pet that worships him, a stark look at an incestuous relationship between twins, a family trip to Venice gone awry, and many others.My only difficulty is that the language used is a bit more obscure than most of us are used to. I hadn't realized how important commas were, and there usefulness was proven by the lack of them in Mann's work. Usage and structure was different at the time of these writings, however, and not much time is needed to adjust.I would recommend &quot;Death in Venice&quot; to anyone who enjoys classic literature, or who enjoys reading the work of someone who is passionate about what they do and how they live. It is definitely worth the time invested."},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"Aschenbach, an ageing, ascetic author makes up his mind to visit Venice in the hope of encountering &quot;distant scenes&quot;. There he becomes wildly infatuated with a fourteen-year-old Polish boy, the Hyacinth of myth, named Tazio. The narrative centres around the fumbling and pathetic attempts made by the protagonist to address the object of his love, eventually resulting in the death of the aged Aschenbach. Mann seems interested in establishing parallels between Aschenbach's condition and the ideals of classical antiquity, as the substantial [mis]-quotations from Plato's &quot;Phaedrus&quot; make clear. However, the story lends itself to other interpretations, such as the asethetics of Nietzsche, with its duality of &quot;Apollinism&quot; and &quot;Dionysism&quot;, of which Mann was a fervent disciple. Aschenbach's dignified, ordered, rational, harmonious, Apolline existence can be read as being ruptured by the irrational force of the Dionysian, the instinct of intoxication and self-destructive excess. Similarly, Mann's portrayal of Aschenbach's infatuation with Tazio can be interpreted along Freudian lines. What of the scene in which Aschenbach is set to leave Venice but loses his bags, then returns and it is only *after* the fact that he discovers the real reason for his return? This is clearly a dramatisation of what Freud terms neurosis, the conflict between an unconscious desire and a prohibitive command of the conscious. The elevated, detached, &quot;objective&quot; style shows Mann to have been committed to the classical paradigms of narrative and composition and, in this respect, he invites comparison with Flaubert."},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"Thomas Mann wrote \\"Death in Venice\\" in 1911. The protagonist, formerly a self-controlled and respectable public figure, gives himself over to obsessively stalking a 14-year-old boy for whom he has erotic feelings. While these feelings would be unacceptable to most people in our era, it is still difficult for us to appreciate the degree of condemnation they would have attracted when this story was written. Yet, Sigmund Freud had published The Interpretation of Dreams a decade earlier, and German intellectuals like Thomas Mann were aware that censurable urges lurk beneath conscious notice within all of us. Through this story, the author was surely struggling to come to terms with his own homoerotic urges. Judging from what he wrote, these were deeply troubling to him: corruption, decay, and condemnation are the themes he presents to us. While the images conveyed through this story are repugnant and shocking, the writing is beautiful and affecting.Several of the other stories in this volume are of similar quality, and similarly deal with troubling themes (\\"Mario and the Magician,\\" \\"The Blood of the Walsungs\\"). Yet, Mann was also capable of an extended and sincerely felt appreciation of the more benign and wholesome aspects of our world (\\"A Man and His Dog\\").These stories are worth reading and re-reading. Thomas Mann won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1929, and these stories, if not Nobel prize quality, at the very least show Mann to be an engaging and entertaining writer."},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"Mann is to be struggled with; his work to be attacked and repulsed - it is the embodiment of engaging, challenging fiction. It may be advisable to start out with Mario and the Magician, a splendid and accessible story of a hypnotist performing amazing acts on an incredulous audience that is itself hypnotic in alluring its character audience and the reader into a seeminly pedestrian story that turns out to have a whimsical, fantastic denouement. M&M; also doubles as a grand metaphor for the fascism that was beginning to grip Germany - the awesome power of a tyrant and the dangerous nakedness of a raptured audience.Mann passes the test of great writing, in that even in translation, one can appreciate the literary dexterity of a master at work - a writer carried away, inhabiting each sentence of his story. Some of his lesser stories, towards the end of the anthology, are sprawling introspectives and thoroughgoing accounts of places and things.Death in Venice is a seminal work and sets the tone for Mann's subtle revelations of repressed passions and the tabboo. Mann elegantly lays bare human souls, yet keeping the lid safely fastened to the pressured jar. One of my favorites was Toni Kroger - a touching story of an artist's life, from young man to mature adult. Mann renders beautifully unrequited love and homosocial admiration by the introverted for the extroverts. In reading his stories, we may find that he expresses memories and feelings that were always there, but could not find the words for before. That, perhaps, is the highest achievement of a writer."},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"This is my first time reading Thomas Mann, save for the few excerpts that appear in college literature studies. Thomas Mann is notorious for his lengthy sentences and his never-ending novels, so I picked this as a gentle introduction to his works.Even just flipping through the short stories will give an impression of how versatile and varied Mann's writing styles could be. Death in Venice, while being his most famous work in this book, is also one of the more difficult ones to read. This was Thomas Mann at his best - his sentences, long and tortuous, rolls through the imagination paragraphs at a time. Felix Krull, on the other hand, is short and succinct, with almost a feel of modern satire permeating through it.The translation reads pretty clean and straightforward. While this probably probably loses a bit of feel in terms of grammar and structure of the sentences, Mann's styles and the suitability of the German language to this task means that a direct translation would have less flow and may seem cumbersome.Overall I would say this is a nice illustration of Mann's literary prodigy, without overwhelming those who are not yet initiated into reading his full-sized novels."},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"Death in Venice is a novella published in 1911, The work has inspired an opera by Benjamin Britten and has been filmed. In it Mann tells the story of famous author Gustav Von Aschenbach. He is jaded, disillusioned with fame finding that writing has become difficult. He decides to visit Venice. In that decaying city he goes to the beach each morning. While there he discovers a young Polish lad who is named Tadzio., The two make eye contact and there is a homoerotic element in the relationship though they do not converse. The novella ends as Aschenback dies of the cholera epidemic sweeping the Italian city of canals.Underneath this taut and beautifully written story there are many themes which resonate. We see how Venice is a symbol of death and decadence. All of the city is filled with disease, death and foul odors permeate the tale and town. The novella was published in 1911 as the old Europe of peace, relative prosperity and staid middle class morality was about to explode with the roaring of the guns of August igniting the Great War and the end of nineteenth century civilization. Mann often links love and death as he also does in his short story \\"Tristan.\\" As in\\"Tonio Kroger\\" we see in this tale the way an artist/intellectual is asked to relate to a society hellbent on business success and the accumulation of wealth. Aschenbach is a surrogate for Mann who was cold and reserved as a man but was a cauldron of seething Freudian emotions underneath the surface of his frigid persona.This collection of short stories is a good introduction to the sober art of Mann whose long sentences and literary references will keep an alert reader's attention. Mann is not everyone's cup of tea but he is an important writer whose works should be wider read in America."},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"In &quot;Death in Venice,&quot; Mann crafts an exquisite portrait of &quot;man as artist.&quot; Through the character of Aschenbach, Mann explores the artist's role in the public realm as well as his need for fulfillment in his private life. Using the character of Tadzio as a symbol of true artistic beauty, Mann weaves a love story that is at once both destructive and redemptive. This novella is painfully beautiful and hauntingly memorable -- a staggering accomplishment."},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories","review":"The incestuous love between Siegmund and Sieglinde in Thomas Mann's &quot;The Blood of the Walsungs&quot; is based on a self-centered narcissism. The twins love each other because each reminds the other of themselves: &quot;They were very like each other, with the same slightly drooping nose, the same full lips lying softly together, the same prominent check-bones and black, bright eyes. Likest of all were their long slim hands, his no more masculine than hers . . .&quot; Yet, their physical resemblance is just one aspect of their similarity.Perhaps more important is the ennui they both share, made worse by the luxury that surrounds them ('Dinner clothes in the afternoon!' Sieglinde said, making a face. It isn't even human!'). Siegmund and Sieglinde suffer the woes of wealthy children: they have everything, yet that having everything become hated because it reminds them of their own emptiness -- that they have yet to achieve on their own. Trying something, like Siegmund's painting, can even be worse than doing nothing. Because trying and failing only confirms the dread that one doesn't deserve what one has.It's no wonder the twins' inner fear and insecurity manifests as resentment, the desire for revenge, and attraction to one's mirror image. Resentment and revenge are projections of inner hatred, and attraction to one's double perhaps provides a desperate hope that each is not so bad since another is similar. And who best to understand one's inner turmoil but another who is virtually the same?It is also not surprising the twins consummate their attraction after the opera. After all, what's more dramatic, heroic, and conducive to the surrendering of one's passion than Wagnarian opera? In thunder and storm anything goes, and perhaps all is forgiven. I'm surprised they didn't go at it right there in the opera box. But, such an atmosphere surely gave artistic backdrop to each's depressive self-loathing. In that arena, each could cease being themself and become heroic. How easy it must have been to ride that feeling all the way to the bedroom. And, illicit passion now gives each meaning. An affair is so much more than an affair; it's drama in which one is the central figure, just like the opera. Because of the resentment each had for Beckerath, they now too have a perfect foil, a villain in whom they can portray to each other all the vile characteristics Hunding possesses. In it's own sick way it all makes sense.I wonder then, does each of us carry a little of that in the person we carry the torch for? Are we attracted to certain persons because they remind us of ourselves? Or who we wish to be? Or who we hope they will help us become? Or who we hope they see us as? Is love really that narcissistic or self-aggrandizing? Anybody else tempted to sleep with their brother or sister after a good opera?"},{"Title":"Novell's Guide to BorderManger","review":"This is a great introduction to Novell's Border Manager.

He does just that -- observantly, unobtrusively -- and in Astronauts &amp; Other Stories, winds up sending back to earth some radiant, revealing photographs. I'll dispense with the synopses, and say only that the characters are human, the stories inventive, and the tone clear, lyrical, and almost Zen-like throughout. Don't be misled by the author's tenderness. It's genuine, but not without its acknowledgement of sorrow, despair and hurtful behavior.

I found Dan Brown's well-crafted pageturners, for example, entertaining but loaded with very obvious, albeit effective, tricks and teasers on the order \\"he would never see her alive again...\\" kind of stuff. After a time being wrested away from the world around me by Iribarne's stories I wonder how he did it. Then there all of those character issues and aspects that are both commonly found in modern life, perhaps mundane and overlooked from day to day, that are exposed by Iribarne as the worthy, complex and truly interesting things about people that really matter. I have to say that the experience of reading Iribarne reminds me a little of reading of Proust. The experience is meditative, but Iribarne is a more efficient Proust where one need not take a weeklong holiday to have a similar experience of a really good read."},{"Title":"Astronauts: and Other Stories","review":"Terrific stories.

Matthew Iribarne knows about the quirky sacramentals that are always revealing us to ourselves. I hope that he keeps writing and helping us cope with the ephemeral relationships of everyday life."},{"Title":"Astronauts: and Other Stories","review":"Take a look around the new fiction section at any bookstore these days and you'll see there's a welcome boon in short story collections. And this wonderful book by Matt Iribarne is sure proof that this trend consists of fine, exquisitely written material. I dare you to pick up this collection, read &quot;Make Me Laugh&quot;-a funny, sad and wise tale about a disgraced priest-and not wish you had a couple of hours to wade through all of this smart and witty new writer's stories. This is the kind of book that reminds you of all the greats-Tobias Wolff, Ron Carlsen, Charles Baxter-and offers fantastic nuggets of originality that suggests the beginning of a long and fruitful career for Mr. Iribarne. Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"Astronauts: and Other Stories","review":"Thanks to Amazon, I only paid a penny for this book plus shipping. I'm less insulted by any monetary cost than the timethat I spent reading almost a third of the 300 pages presented here, thinking that the reviews couldn't have been that\\"off\\". Antecedents are crossed, mixed up, or nonexistent. There is no poetic merit in the awkward sentence constructions.The story lines lose impact when the language of each story is so disorganized. I can not recommend this book and wonder atthe other favorable reviews. I do not agree, and would never recommend this book to a friend.Note that: this book was originally published in French, so I can not see whether (a) the backwards constructions existed in French,or (b) the translation into English lost original meaning and morphed the book into something awkward and uncomfortable to read.Perhaps the original French doesn't have all the problems. Obviously, this review is about the English version."},{"Title":"The Superman Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Saving the Day","review":"Being Superman isn't just wearing your underwear on the outside, putting on a cape and attaching a giant S to your chest. You've got to know how to knock out a villain, break down a door, tackle a runaway goon, tie up henchmen, dodge and block bullets, leap in a single bound, perform various rescues such as runaway cars, cars teetering over an edge, quicksand, wild animals, someone drowning or caught in a rip, trapped under heavy objects and many other things. This manual also teaches the reader CPR, treat cuts, bites, burns, broken bones and other first aid although you really should do a first aid course to get the latest (how to save a chocking victim Heimlich Maneuver is not what you do these days). The manual also has instructions on how to change a tyre, put out a fire, stop a leak, fix an electrical outage, save a kitten from a tree and other handy skills to have.As long as the reader can differentiate between when the novel is speaking specifically about superman and when it is the real world, then this actually is quite a useful and helpful book if ever faced with these problems. It isn't as good as competitors such as The Action Hero's Handbook by David Borgenicht and Joe Borgenicht if learning these skills is the sole purpose of buying the book, so if you are not much of a fan of Superman then get that instead. However there is not much difference and the background info on Superman and comics will sway the decision to The Superman Handbook for fans. There is is also a Batman Handbook if you prefer the caped crusader."},{"Title":"The Superman Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Saving the Day","review":"The introduction dutifully notes that The Superman Handbook is a work of fiction. That it is, but still with honest to goodness, real, and accurate advice for aspiring heroes everywhere. Yes, you will learn how to block and dodge bullets, break down doors, rundown a bad guy, and rescue those in dire need from floods, fires, avalanches, and more...all without the aid of real super powers.The book is cleverly written by Scott Beatty with art by John Delany, Dave Cooper and Terry Beatty. The book combines a look at Superman lore with real life advice on survival and life-saving techniques and proves that you don't need to be faster than a speeding bullet and more powerful than a locomotive to be a superhero...you just need to know what to do in a given situation. For example, do you need to break down a door? The handbook tells you how. Don't waste time banging your shoulder into it...as the book explains a well placed kick exerts far greater force than your shoulder. You're also advised to find the door's \\"sweet spot\\" where the latch meets the door frame...all the better to bust it down don't you know.How about blocking bullets? Yes, you too can block bullets provided you have the proper equipment such as a riot shield made of unbreakable Lexan polycarbonate (bullet proof glass) or a Kevlar vest, or ceramic body armor. The book explains each of these items in laymen's terms.The section on Super Rescues tells how to save people from such predicaments as rip tides, quicksand, floods, and burning buildings. It even includes more exotic rescues like saving someone from a teetering car or hanging from a building. The Next section on Saving the Day includes practical first aid advice on how to perform CPR, treat cuts, animal bites, burns, broken limbs, help a victim who is choking, having a seizure, or been poisoned.Throughout the book bits of Superman lore are introduced on his various powers, greatest villains, most super saves, and more, just to keep things light. Whether you're a Superman fan or not, you'll find solid advice in the handbook, related in an informal style. Great job.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"The Superman Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Saving the Day","review":"While Superman may be the greatest superhero ever, this book shows how you can emulate his heroics. The intro states that while Supes has many superpowers, his greatest power is his ability and desire to help mankind. This isn't a book on the lines of others that are humorous in assuming the world of superpowers are real. This book is more of a good samaritan's survival guide on how you can help out yourself and others in certain types of emergencies such as saving a drowning victim, stopping a runaway car, and help someone choking to mundane events like jumpstarting a car, changing a tire, fixing a leaky pipe, and rescuing a kitten from a tree. While using pretty simplistic scenarios, this book tries to help instill in mankind how to emulate the kindness and heroism of the likes of Superman. Thrown in for the Superman fans are little comic facts about our last son of Krypton. It's a great how to help people guide but extra training is obviously needed for some of the situations presented."},{"Title":"The Superman Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Saving the Day","review":"I like Superman but have never been a great fan of this super hero. It has always been difficult to relate to anyone who has super powers that one could never duplicate. Nevertheless, I found this book entertaining and amusing. It also has many tips that anyone can use in various situations.The book is organized into four chapters. Chapter one covers super-skills and explains how the average person can knock out a villain, how to break through a door, how to tackle a runaway goon and numerous other feats. The second chapter deals with super-rescues such as how to stop a runaway car, how to fend off wild animals, how to rescue a drowning victim and other types of rescues. Saving the day is taught in chapter three. Some of the topics include how to perform CPR, how to treat a cut, how to treat a burn, and other similar issues. The final chapter deals with saves at home. Some of the topics include how to fix a flat tire, how to put out a fire, how to deal with a gas leak and numerous other problems.In conclusion, this is a book for anyone interested in comic book heros like Superman but please take the advice with a grain of salt. It is fully illustrated and was an enjoyable read.Rating: 3 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Predator Hunter: A Warrior's memoir)"},{"Title":"The Superman Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Saving the Day","review":"If you know nothing about Superman except that he wears red and blue tights and fights for truth, justice and the American way, you'll still enjoy this book. Like Beatty's equally brilliant Batman Handbook, the Superman Handbook explains all the techniques regular people can do to save lives. At the same time, it also gives you a primer on Superman's abilities, allies, villains and more, and it even teaches you how to speak Bizarro. So on that note, me hate this book and me not recommend it to no one. (If you don't get it, you will once you read the book!)"},{"Title":"The Superman Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Saving the Day","review":"I dunno who Scott Beatty is, but it's certain he has never tried anything in his book.

The book opens when he is a slave on a Turkish pirate galley. His fellow slaves know him as El Hakim, the knowledgeable one. As he is on the pirate galley, his thoughts frequently turn to his love, Angelita. One day he is left unchained from the galley and a Portuguese galleon approaches. Andrea makes a break for it and warns the galleon as the galley is preparing to ram the galleon. He is fished out of the water and retained as Leonor di Peristrello's slave. He is taken back to Portugal, pleading and bargaining his way out of slavery by promises of the navigational device the El Kemal, that lets him mark latitude with precision. In time, he becomes attracted to Leonor. He also puts together that his brother Mattei, took the family business and married his sweetheart, Angelita. He makes some voyages. The most notable voyage is his one to Antillia. Upon his return he goes to meet his Angelita. He is given drugged wine, discovering that Mattei wants him dead and that Angelita is a greedy, no-good girl. Mattei wants the secret of the El Kemal device. Andrea manages to fight out of the situation. In the ensuing fight, Matei kills Angelita is and is captured. Matei is taken and sent back to Venice to the authorities. He realizes that he loves Leonor and decides to marry her. He also decides to open the secret of the El Kemal and give it to all sailors."},{"Title":"Jagdgeschwader 54 : 'Grunherz' (Osprey Aviation Elite 6)","review":"This is a book typical of this series: a survey of the unit's operational life, interesting, but a quite dry reading. A good starting point, don't expect nothing like Don Caldwell's JG26 books. For modelers: as usual the color plates are superb."},{"Title":"Jagdgeschwader 54 : 'Grunherz' (Osprey Aviation Elite 6)","review":"The book manages to cover the whole journey of JG54 throughout World War II. And because it does it in less than 130 pages, it can't be detailed. And it isn't.The pace of the book is fairly fast. Certain campaigns are given only couple of pages (for example, III/JG54 in the West in 1943-45 is covered in 14 pages despite the important events like D Day, introduction of Fw 190D-9 and Bodenplatte). However, everything is here, from Poland to defense of the Reich.Pilot accounts are scarce, and these are fairly short and dry read. Instead, the author proceeds relentlessly to yet another front, yet another battle.This book is not about planes. You won't find any technical data, cutaway drawings or development history.Despite lacking in detail, the book is accurate, to my knowledge. I didn't find any errors. Photographs are, of course, black and white. Color plates are great and are drawn by the author himself. Only extremely minor errors exist, but they are invisible to the untrained eye. Because of aircraft color profiles the book is generally useful to modelers. But again - these are only profiles: no wing paint schemes, not even color charts.Overall, it is a good entry level book for anyone interested in JG54 history. For more detailed view, there is Urbanke's \\"Greenhearts - first in combat with Dora-9\\", to name just one example."},{"Title":"Jagdgeschwader 54 : 'Grunherz' (Osprey Aviation Elite 6)","review":"The author hardly gave stories of JG-54 pilots scoring victories against the RAF during the Battle of Britian. He only talk about the casualities suffered by JG-54 during that particular time period. He should also had a list of JG-54 pilots who score against the Allied Air Forces in Normandy 1944. He only gave three examples. I find this quit bias as with some of his other books about German fighter units."},{"Title":"Jagdgeschwader 54 : 'Grunherz' (Osprey Aviation Elite 6)","review":"The subject is cool, but like other books written by John Weal is very boring. I deeply regret to buy."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"I was absolutely amazed at the powerful truth offered up in this book. It has clearly changed my life and the life of my family. At a time when all eyes are on Afgahnastan and the terrorist attacks, it is very clear that we should all be also looking at Europe and the way it is uniting. The bible states it so clearly that this will take place before the end, but it truly takes a genius like Mr. Adams to put the pieces together and show us all this plain and simple truth. Well actually it doesn't take a genius to figure it out once all the pieces are put together. Europe has tried to unite continuously since the fall of the Roman Empire. Napoleon tried it. Giribaldi tried it. Mussolini tried it. And Hitler tried it. After centuries of wars that were unsuccesful, now this prophesy is happening in a presently subtle manner. This book makes everything so crystal clear, I wish I had read it years earlier. A must read for anybody interested in the future of the world."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"The author has nerve, courage, and knowledge. He takes them all on from the church to the continent of Europe. I could not do it because I would not have the nerve of this guy. The book is fascinating and it really does reveal the meaning of 666 and what the beast is really all about."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"I do not remember how I first ended up with Canyon Adams first book about President Clinton's sex addiction, but I became a C.A. fan as soon as I did. When I saw his two new releases I bought them right away and I have to say he has done it again. These new books are remarkable, to the point, direct, honest, and educational all at once. My wife is a fan too. We are behind these books all the way. C.Adams is the most powerful writing voice today. His knowledge of prophesy and scripture is breathtaking."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"This material, although controversial, is very good, to the point and articulate. I like the parts about the churches the most because it was eye opening."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"Above all things, this book is a beautiful attack on church tradition and the doctrines that govern so many millions of lives. Bravo to the author for having the nerve and intelligence to write this book. It gives every reader information on the beast, 666, the church, and the emptiness of religious doctrine. A beautiful job."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"This review below, the 2 star one that says, &quot;Badly Done&quot; is a testimony to the way in which OTHER AUTHORS in this particular genre / subject try to sabotage their competition. Case in point: note the date of the review: June 17th. The book wasn't even released from the publisher and sent to the distributor until June 18. This author in California could not have read the book...but he recognizes that it is the truth whereas his sloppy research about Mystery Babylon is a joke. Folks, book writing, especially about the truths of biblical prophesy, is cutthroat. Weed through the deceit...and some to the truth."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"This book blew my mind! Not only does the author reveal &quot;the beast&quot; and explain the number 666, but he goes beyond that to point out the crazy man-made doctrines of today's churches. I loved his expose of the Catholic church. I came away saying, &quot;WOW! The man has courage!&quot; And he has helped me to understand the Book of Revelation and the role of the churches in turning people away from the truth about God. A very very excellent book!"},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"Don't even waste your time or money on this very unscholarly piece of work. The author's lack of education in theology is very evident. If you're looking for truth don't go here."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"I have studied bible prophesy for more than 25 years and if i had this book with me when i started, i would not have taken so many wrong turns on my journey.....This simple,clear and concise little book is full of bone jarring,and eye opening information that exposes what some of us have known for years....Forget all the famous prophesy writers and the speculation that they try to substitute for fact.....Adams makes a very strange and clouded book of the bible become clear as a noonday sun....Buy this book!!!!!!!It is worth the price and more"},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"I do agree with the guy who gave this book a poor review on the following issue: the author does most certainly expose the occultic practices of the Catholic Church. And the book was well written. But by no means in this author off on the prophecy mark. I read this book too and spent several months investigating some of the points he made. I was astonished to find out that he was 100% correct on all accounts. I took the book to a well known minister in the area too, and he suggested that we buy a batch as a supplement to our bible study. The prophecy information is on track. I only wish it were a larger book filled with even more facts."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"I read this book and really enjoyed the author's slant on the catholic religion; however I was skeptical about some of the prophesies and connections between various biblical references. I then researched each and every prophesy as well as asked two local ministers to help me in my studies. The result was that this book was 100% accurate on everything it outlined. My whole church is now reading it and we have agreed that the author Mr Adams is the true authority on biblical prophesy. We highly recommend this book to all readers and all people of the earth."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"I can barely describe how powerful and life changing this book is. If your view of end times prophecy runs along the lines of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, you've got another thing coming. You will never pick up another one of the books from that series again. It is hard to describe how powerful this books is. It is not even 200 pages; yet I found myself taking longer to read it then I anticipated as I literally had to stop reading the book after every paragraph or so and just think about what I just read. IT IS THAT POWERFUL!!! This book has changed my entire outlook on the end times prophecy and believe if you really and truly want to know more about this subject, you owe it to yourself to read this book. I feel Canyon Adams is right on the money. I think that Mr. Adams knows more about this subject than anyone out there at this time. It is up to you. You can either believe what the &quot;churches&quot; and man interpret about prophecy OR you can read this book and see how the bible backs up itself and explains everything so clearly now. I feel as if a veil has been removed from my eyes and I really can see the truth now. No other book out there backs up it's claim with so much BIBLICAL evidence. The only thing we need to know to interpret end times prophesy is the Bible. Period. I am currently reading the authors other book, The Signs and will be reviewing that one very soon as well, but so far it is just as unbelievable as this one. If you are going to a &quot;christian&quot; or catholic church right now, please read this book. It is a simple choice really. Go to the church of your choice, or go to God's church. It's up to you. All the other books out there on prophesy right now are full of manmade interpretations, not biblical. Read these books and see for yourself."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"I have read this book and wanted to clarify what that one guy wrote about, how &quot;the antichrist&quot; is a man, because Canyon Adams makes very clear that the antichrist IS a man...but the BEAST 666 mentioned in Revelation is NOT a man. Canyon Adams makes clear that the BEAST mentioned in Revelation (the 666) is actually a kingdom. A country. To be specific, the Roman Empire, and even beyond that. It's the resurrected Roman Empire, brought back to life through the unification of Europe.And when Revelation says, &quot;It is the number of a man,&quot; it is referring to how the number 666, deciphered, stands for Roman Man, or even more so, for Romulus who founded Rome.This book is a work of genius. I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to know the truth about the Bible and about the approaching future of Europe and the United States."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"This is a very poorly done book from a prophecy perspective..it is fairly well written..just totally off base as far as prophecy is concerned. He does a good job exposing some of the occultic practices in the Catholic Church but you can learn about that for free at many sites on the net...the rest of it is a waste of time."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"I read this book twice. And I read Ms. Reeder's offbase review below only once...before I dropped a corny one on the ground in disgust at her narrow viewpoint.Canyon Adams does NOT offer salvation in this book. He offers insight. He points out that the beast is not a man but a country...a continent...an emerging global super power who was in power when Jesus was on Earth and was crucified. And who will be in power again just before Jesus returns. Folks, it'e Europe! It's the Roman Empire! It's Europe merged with the Middle East to form the Roman Empire of old. And 666, the mark of the beast? It isn't a mark at all. In fact, we ALL have it! We all blindly have the mark of the beast right here and now.Yes, as Ms. Reeder points out, salvation comes from grace. But what she is offbase on is her analysis of this book. This book points out the very correct details of the beast and 666. Salvation is up to you.Read this book. And remember, WE ALL HAVE THE MARK OF THE BEAST TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Mr. Adams is the only authority on this subject. He's a genius."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"People, this book is one you must read. The author points out things that are important for us all to know now. He wrote this book in 1999? and if I would have read it then I would have been skeptical, but everything he said is true and its coming true right before our very eyes and in our time. Watch Europe. Watch the decline of United States economic power and the rise of the Eurodollar. Watch Europe extend into the Middle East. Watch the Catholic Church ride the beast.For the money, this book is priceless."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"This book makes a great arguement about what the true nature of the Catholic church really is.Read the facts, the facts are quite amazing when you read about what beast really is.You hope the author is wrong but he's getting all his information straight from the Bible it self. Easy to read and easy to follow. Great book!"},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"I read the excellent reviews of this book including one disheartening one, and then I bought this book at another one by Canyon Adams called The Signs. And truthfully they both blew me completely way. I have never experienced anything so close to the core of truth before. Both of these books are guaranteed to knock any reader who is interested in the bible right on their backside. If I had twenty thumbs, I would give this book twenty thumbs up and The Signs another twenty thumbs up."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"This amazing work from Canyon Adams contains some of the most chilling and suspenseful biblical prophecies that people of today are seeking the answers to. It's hard to believe he is not a scholar, just someone who reads the bible every day with a strong conviction to understand it's contents. He has answers to the meanings of 666, the mark, the Great Whore, and who or what is the Anti-Christ? Sometimes it seems to be repetitive, which is only to add clarity to his theories. Mr. Adams has an uncanny way of being able to interpret the bible and it's prophecies."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"I have always thought my catholic church to be something sacred and spiritual and biblical, until I read this book along with the book of Revelation and Daniel. Now I realize that Revelation talks about &quot;the mother of all harlots,&quot; and I begin to see how my church is nothing more than another deceitful tool used by Satan in his own master plan. This book is priceless as is the other one written by Canyon Adams called The Signs. These books are must reads!"},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"Christmas, Easter, New Years and Halloween... I love(d) all of the holidays, until after much research i realize that they are all pagan based festivals/holidays changed a little to add a touch of Christ here and there.Do you want to know what the truth is and are you searching? Are you ready to have your life and perspective on things turned rightside up? Get this book and let others read it. I believe that only the few who truly have this knowledge and use it will be the ones who make it through.We were born in and are surrounded by deception and lies. This book breaks all of the barriers to know the truth.If you don't already know what this book contains that I can assure you that you are not ready. You are not ready for the knowledge that you will have after reading this.Sometimes the truth hurts. This is truly one of those times.For anyone who is Catholic... When you read this please do a full investigation of what this book contains. The pure of heart Catholics have much to think about after reading this."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"Ok, I bought this book based on the reviews, but man was I disappointed. First of all, the author does seem to have a great deal of insight about he Catholic church, which I tend to agree with. However, if someone really wants to get deeper into that subject I would recommend reading &quot;A Woman Rides the Beast&quot; by Dave Hunt. A much more scholarly and in depth treatment of the history of the &quot;Worlds greatest cult&quot;.Secondly, concerning the identity of &quot;666&quot;. The author is totally in error when he identifys the &quot;mark of the beast&quot; as a religious system. Scripture says that the mark of the beast is the number of a MAN, not a church. There is a book in print intitled &quot;The Antichrist and a Cup of Tea&quot; written by Tim Cohen. This book is, in my opinion is the best and most important information available on the subject of the Antichrist. I recommend it to everyone I talk to on this subject. I would call it a must read!Thirdly, the author's background. He gives us a mini-autobiography of himself, but fails to share his testimony. Just as Jesus said to Necodemus. &quot;You must be born again&quot;, no man can &quot;see&quot; the kingdom of God unless he is born again of the Spirit of God, which is the Spirit of Truth which will lead you into all truth! When a man is indeed born again, he knows it, and knows when ane where and under what circumstances it took place. Not only that, it becomes the most important aspect of who he is.I give this book 2 stars,1 for effort, and 1 for the authors stand on the Catholic church."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"I would like to first start off by stating that I was weary of getting this book. But I was in need of some literature on the current (and past) heresies of the Catholic church. Honestly, I found the facts on the Catholic church very &quot;skimmed&quot; over by the author. He does a lot of degrading, but not a lot of facts. I like to see numbers and dates and reasons for these things. He doesn't really get into the numbers speaking of the heresies aspect BUT...he does show a lot in the end times concept. He points out a lot of concrete facts (years, names, etc.) in explaining his interpretation of books Revelation and Daniel. All of the fatcs are hard to swallow at first, but the more that he throws at you, the more it glues itself together.Now here are some things that I either totally disagree with or wonder why he didn't include them in his book:1. He doesn't really express how he see's Jesus as the Lord of his life and the Savior of his soul. He talks about Him a lot, but he really never addresses Him in that way. You might think I am being petty, but in this day and age, there are a lot of false doctrines out there. Plus, the bible says to test the spirits to see if they are from God or not. He says &quot;God and Jesus&quot; a lot in his explainations. I tend to put a lot of emphasis on that Jesus is GOD. He is the LORD, the CREATOR, the SAVIOR, the MOST HIGH GOD! He is my EVERYTHING!2. He goes out there in left field talking about Christianity being an adbonidation of God. He zeros in on the different denominations of Protestants. I myself am a Southern Baptist. I know what the Holy Spirit feels like inside me, I know my relationship with my Lord Jesus is solid. I do not agree on how he condemns the various denominations though. He is correct on a lot of ritual being placed on people instead of a more faith based realtionship in the church.All in all, the figures about the &quot;beast&quot;, the Roman Empire, etc. are very interesting and I will be doing more research on that.3 stars."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"This is a great book....it's better than a cook book.

This book is a masterpiece of prophetic literature. Things that Adams wrote about in 1998 are coming true now, in 2004. What understanding of the bible!

Everybody must read this best seller."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"This book, like the other books by Canyon Adams, is a work of absolute genius. Everybody, please behold: Great Britain, The United States, and Israel will war against the beast: A United Europe and the Middle East. And 666 has been mark that we ALL have had for centuries. This book is beautiful for pointing all this out. Plus, it kicks the Catholic Church right in the purple and crimsons sacks."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"Without a doubt, Mr. Adams has produced a book of unparallelled excellence. Canyon Adams points out what the beast of the book of revelation is and tells us how to identify it. We all have the mark of the beast, and it is so clear. Read Revelation 13 and understand that it is not a future event. The mark of the beast has been upon us for the past several hundred years."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"The book has a very interesting and convincing evidence about what the bible says about what the beast really is. This book may say some shocking things about the Catholic religion. With out giving too much of the book away, lets just say it's very interesting. The book will show where the beast will come from and how the beast has been in our past.The book will show what the mark of the beast is and how it affects everyone.This book is a great read especially for people not familliar with this type of reading material. After reading this book you'll watch the news and everthing about Europe in the news very closely."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"I don't know what the one reviewer named kjreader is talking about, it sounds like he's rambling on like a schizo, but I have read this book my Canyon Adams and I say for the record that it is 100% on the money. Canyon Adams points out the fallacies and the delusions of organized religion, including and maybe even ESPECIALLY the Catholic relgion. He points out the Beast. And he points out how we all need to be looking at Europe to watch it merge with the middle east and become a super power like the world has never known. A UNITED EUROPE is the beast; it is the revived Roman Empire. Read Daniel 2 and 7. Read Revelation 13 and 17. Rome! Rome! Rome! Canyon Adams is so correct and on target it's almost frightening. I tell all readers to buy this book and learn."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"THE BOOK IS VERY INTERESTING.

It was difficult to accept the truth. Mr. Adam's attack on our man made church doctrines was too true for comfort. He is clear about the beast and 666 and the church and Europe. Now I have to rethink my own convictions. This book has had a very big impact on me."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"I read this book in one day, I just couldn't put it down! Canyon Adams, by far, has the freshest and most unique approach to the tribulation and &quot;end days&quot; events. This book was truly an eye opener, and unlike many other books on prophesy. The author was also very biblical in supporting his statements, approaches, and theories. Definitely a &quot;must read&quot; book. People of the Catholic faith may not be too pleased with it's contents, but, it sure leaves you with many things to think about."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"I bought and read 666 The Beast at the same time the Pope was visiting the holy land. Ding! Ding! The bells were going off all over in my head. Everything that Mr. Adams was saying was true. It was eerie, almost as if he predicted it, but I guess that is the point. The bible predicted it all along, and now all we have to do is read and watch. The book is amazing and I recommend it to everybody."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"My husband was raised Catholic - he even went to a Catholic school.

How can there possibly be any favorable reviews here?\\"The Beast Revealed\\" read like a poorly written nursery school primer. I can't see that any research went into it. The conclusions drawn were ludicrous and off-base. I tried to finish reading it, just because I'd spent money on it, but it was a waste of my time. Don't buy this book. That's my opinion and advice.And one other point I'd like to make is that in review number 47 the author disputes the previous review by saying that it was written a day before the book was distributed, but the review before THAT one--the very first review--was written ten days before the one Mr. Adams disputes. Huh?Whatever. These reviews are mostly silly. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"Title":"666, The Beast Revealed","review":"Had I written this review a couple years ago--when I read the book--I would have probably given it a four or five, however, times change, and truth is revealed or unrevealed depending on whether you really seek it or not.First of all, the Mark of the Beast ideas that he holds should not make you paranoid as it did me, nor if you follow him should you begin to gain a bigger ego and become prideful because you think you're following some esoteric truth out of hell. Salvation is not esoteric, but sadly, it is many times too simple for most people to understand, and by the time they're done with their lives, the truth was so far under them that they simply drop into whatever the reality of hell is.Concerning his ideas on the Catholic Church. Once again, with a gaining of intellectual knowledge and just plain understanding, we can see where he errs. The men who came directly after the apostles claimed to be &quot;catholic.&quot; The traditions of the Roman Catholic Church today can be seen in some of the beliefs of these men. Yes, it is true that the Catholic Church of today is stained by some liberalism and a few fallacies accumulated over the dark ages period, but we mustn't be so stubborn to take this information, twist it, and overlook the rest. We needn't become confusionists so that we can delusionize ourselves into believing what we want to!The only other thing that I believe he is terribly wrong about is the concept of the scriptures. We needn't even read all of the New Testament to be saved, but rather to simply have an inward inclination to Christ and his being, and to truly have faith on his being. This will destroy our ego lives if we let it, and begin to turn us all for the better. There is no need to read the bible as many times as we possibly can before we die, and no need to even really study it unless we feel compelled to for some reason or another.In the end, words only serve as a guide, and with C.S. Lewis I say, they cannot save you. Neither will nature, music, or anything that strokes your ego and puffs the emotions with satisfaction. They are merely helpers, only to be used under the guidlines of what true love is and the commandments of God.Nothing external can compromise what true love is if we are to truly find salvation. Buy the book if you must, and then please meditate or pray on what is right; however, if you have any attachments to anything philosophically, then you probably are not ready to accept whatever truth is. He's knocking, my friends, but so few of us take time to quit studying intellectualism and rhetoric and simply open the door for him. It doesn't happen by prayer or emotionalism, but merely by a conscious recognition that he died for us all. Then you may move on towards perfection, for as Jerome once said, &quot;To not seek perfection is a sin in itself.&quot;"},{"Title":"By the Grace of Guile: The Role of Deception in Natural History and Human Affairs","review":"I know there was an older review of this book stating that the book was negative on the nature of humanity without a positive outlook, but nothing could be farther from the true nature of the author and his works. (Full disclosure: I was a student of Mr. Rue's In the early 90's). His outlook on the human condition is one of hope and optimism. His exhaustive study of conscious and unconscious deception in humanity throughout history and today from a philosophical, psychological, and spiritual standpoint is an invaluable source of knowledge.While summarizing Rue is like trying to summarize Proust or Hugo, his insights on the very necessary nature of deception and how it can even have its own beauty (especially to support greater truths) is a brilliantly crafted exercise in showing the more positive sides of the human mind and soul.Rue's writing also makes this complex topic enjoyable to read, and definitely never dry or boring. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a great resource to understand more about the full nature of deception and the role it plays in the human psyche."},{"Title":"By the Grace of Guile: The Role of Deception in Natural History and Human Affairs","review":"Mr.Rue is just sophisticated enough to repackage total despair without readily appearing to do what so many like-minded apologists for his religion blatantly do. He uses the broad brush to paint existence into a gravelike void, then attempts to resurrect what he assumed was dead with mere wishful thinking.If Rue were right about his absurd portrayal of humanity and life in general, then his miracle elixir would prove to be just as meaningless. His arbitrary choice of values (which are themselves worthless) are laughable. Who should lift a finger for the environment when I'm a mere ball of animalistic appetites? Doing &quot;nice things&quot; for anyone other than myself is heresy, if Rue is right in his nihilism. In fact, Rue's plastic morality is an offense to this plundering viking, since I get my own meaning from burning forests and raping daughters.This book is a celebration of confusion, where the naked dancers should be lamenting and hiding. They cannot live with their conclusions--or at least when they pretend to live, we shouldn't want them for neighbors or professors."},{"Title":"The Master Key Workbook","review":"I have read the Master Key System and followed the exercises a few years ago. I found that the system did indeed help me better my life by changing my thought patterns.However, lately life has been very challenging as I embark on some major changes such as a new career path and moving to another state. It was perfect timing that the MKS workbook was released and I decided to give it a go.It is the perfect companion to the insightful original book. It summarizes each chapter and then provides additional exercises or written materials that allow you to really grasp the idea behind each chapter. All of the exercises are clear and allow you to follow through at your own pace. The extra materials are beautifully chosen to illustrate Haanel's concepts. The format of the workbook is easy to read and follow with plenty of room to write in the book. The book itself is a comfortable size, not so small as to be uncomfortable to read but not too large as to be cumbersome to work with. It is a perfect size for a briefcase or a tote bag and lies flat on a table.A word of caution - the exercises and extra materials really cause you to think and reflect. This can be a bit difficult if you are being honest with yourself. Trying to physically list the twenty things that you do to hold back your own success can be daunting. However, I have found it to be liberating as you then learn how to apply Haanel's concepts to these negative patterns and change them into positive steps to success.To understand the MKS is great, but to be able to master it is life changing. This workbook allows you to master the concepts by engaging you both mentally and physically. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Master Key Workbook","review":"A long time ago I made the transition from blue collar worker to independent business man.

I was a music major, not an education major. I am switching career areas after attaining a BA in music. I have taken no education classes, but am good with children and have a high interest and willingness to learn. I have already taken and passed the General Knowledge (GK) portion of the FTCE and will be taking the K-6 shortly. Now that you know my situation, here's my opinion:+1 STAR: Tons of information... from the formation of mountains to linear algebra to physical fitness, it's all here. No lack of content.-1 STAR: Quite possibly TOO much content. It's a bit intimidating and - if you're not sure what will be on the subject area exam and you didn't take teaching classes and you don't remember a lot of what you were taught in middle and high school - you'll find yourself trying to cram a ton of information in.+1 STAR: Well organized and easy to follow... for the most part.+1 STAR: Explains essential terms non-teaching majors haven't heard before. (Despite the book's warning that it assumes you've had teaching classes, you can still understand it.)+1 STAR: It's just been tough to find an FTCE K-6 study guide... it deserves a star for just being available.-1 STAR: The thing that bothered me the MOST - so much I should actually take 2 stars off - there are a lot of glaring errors any editor over the age of eight should have been able to catch. Misspellings, grammatical errors and incorrect punctuations are sprinkled throughout the entire book. The editing is, by far, the worst part of the book, in my opinion. It makes it difficult to take the book seriously.+1 STAR: Just because it's still not bad enough for 2 stars.Overall, I'm happy I found this book. But it DOES raise doubts for me - a study aid for potential teachers that contains such a careless editing job kind of bothers me. (It also doesn't help that I feel I may be trying to remember too much - some things that were already covered in the General Knowledge Exam that I might not even need to know for this one. Again, I could be wrong.)In short, if you have an idea of what you need to know, or just need brushing up (and can overlook spelling/editing errors), this book is fine. If you have no idea of what to expect on the exam, I'm not suggesting you DON'T get this book - just be prepared for a lot of information being thrown at you. Make sure you reserve plenty of time to study up and don't try to cram. And have a highlighter ready - taking notes takes way too much time.

It's a text whose reading is so stimulating, exciting and encouraging that hardly will be able to be ignored for you once you have decided to undertake this task.I mean, this book is a true kaleidoscopic journey in which anthropology, social psychology, human geography, ancestral costumes, mythology and history shake hands and interweave themselves. The outcome is perhaps, one of the most solid and original essays in this discipline.Acquire it as soon as you can."},{"Title":"Marriage and morals","review":"I had an older friend who admired Bertrand Russell and felt he was the bee's knees, and I've read he's the second most quoted author on college papers, after Noam Chomsky. Sadly, I'm no expert on Bertrand Russell. I've only read a few of his quotes and some information on Google, and this book Marriage and Morals. I like to think sometimes I can do a satisfactory review but this review will suffer, too, because it's been 20 years since reading it.Marriage and Morals is. . . an incredible display of ignorance. Monumentaly so. It might fly today, in, well, the ignorant times we live but I felt it was originally meant as satire, a work attempting to embarrass the very positions it was pretending to espouse. We're under the blinders. My honest opinion was that Bertrand Russell wasn't being serious, or honest.Let me say: I have absolutely no disagreement with Bertrand Russell's philosophy. My review of Marriage and Morals is not in any way an indictment or a criticism of Russell's lifelong career as a scholar. I should probably repeat that. When Russell wrote this book, however, he did so in the service of the very conservatives and theologians most folks would say were Russell's enemy. That was my honest opinion reading this work. Just one man's opinion. I may well be wrong I felt it was better to give my one opinion rather than remain silent. Russell was banned from some speaking engagements and from some jobs because of this work, by the very folks who put him up to it, and rightfully so. If you'd like to read an objective and unbiased account of this, worthy of enlightenment, Google the episode.I would compare this work to The Satanic Bible, a work where the author took what he knew of christian philosophy, and simply reversed it. There are around 500 mostly positive Amazon reviews of that book. One reviewer wrote, \\"I'm sure if the 100s of millions of non-practising Satanists around the world were informed that their lifestyles were 'Satanic' by definition, most would be surprised, if not amused. But so long as they're living for themselves just trying to enjoy their lives, regardless of religious dogma, seldom or never have spiritual thoughts, think that if someone harms them they have a right to avenge themselves, only spend time with people who are good for their own personal growth, and feel no guilt when indulging in any of their passions, then they fit perfectly into the Satanic lifestyle\\". To add some more superfluous commentary, the Bible often concedes the Earth as Satan's domicile.My review of Marriage and Morals is definitely in the minority. Only about 1 out of 10 agree with me. . . The New York Times doesn't. It gave this work a glowing review. The New York Post wrote \\"sufficient dynamite to blow a carload of ordinary sex populizers off the face of the planet\\". Another reviewer wrote, \\"Wow, Bertrand Russel is a riot! This has a wonderful satirical bite, and works as an open inquiry. . . But really a little sad but impressive how much of his comments have either come to pass. Or we are still awaiting them to do so\\".Later in life Russell was in an open marriage, practicing what he preached. When his wife was pregnant with another man's child, it was too much even for Russell. The champion of free love petitioned for (what I assume was a very public) divorce.There's a long history of this. Camile Paglia claims the 'the divine' Marque de Sade was actually a satirist also. Or an alarmist of some kind. Providing a 'warning', a roadmark to where society was heading. The conspicuously named 'libertines' in his stories engaging in more and more sadistic behavior, until in the end he just lists the atrocities committed each day as a list and nothing more. He's not too far from a 'truth' anti-cigarette campaign. On his death bed de Sade wanted people to know he truly was a pervert. Perhaps it constitutes a syndrome. Mentally ill folks who blame, not the conservatives and the moralizers, but the very people who champion them and want to celebrate their 'perversion'.I remember as a kid, during economic tough times, reading about Jimmy Carter's 'malaise' speech. I took it seriously. I had no idea Jimmy Carter was attempting to make fun of himself. Was watching an excerpt of the speech on TV recently and it certainly appeared that was what Carter was actually doing. For all of Our lives I think it's worked the opposite way.

It remains this constant struggle between our morality and our nature that will continue to trouble all those who concern themselves to give, or have, an explicit answer.Perhaps the answer is in that immortal line of Forester (_African Queen_): \\"Nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we were put on this earth to rise above.\\"That aside, despite being written eighty years ago it's still a good book especially for readers from oriental part of this world.Read it if you have not read on this topic."},{"Title":"Marriage and morals","review":"It's hard not to cheer when you realize Russell wrote so forward-thinking a piece in the late '20s. Its ideas are still being debated today, especially in light of the recent trend toward opting out of conventional, legally bound marriages in Western countries. As a married man myself, I found Russell's condemnation of conventional sexual morality quite convincing. He doesn't advocate immature hedonism, nor does he pardon all infidelity. He actually favors marriage when children are involved. He simply rocks the foundation of marriage on Christian asceticism ('fornication is sin') and the need for certain paternity. He gives an anthropological & historical perspective on the issue that is broader than anything you're likely to hear in current debates.My only complaint with this otherwise provocative & well-reasoned work is that some of his commentary borders on anti-Catholic. I'm not Catholic myself, but I couldn't help but wonder whether some of his persistent jabs at the Church weren't motivated by a prejudice common at that time. That isn't to say he doesn't critique Protestant morality as well, but he seems to take inordinate glee in poking the Vatican."},{"Title":"Marriage and morals","review":"I found this book very well-written and full of information about the history of marriage, sexual ethics, and morals. Bertrand, in his usual style, examines the social problems of his time and why they exist. This book was written in 1929, but is still logical and modern in thinking. Bertrand wittily and cynically speaks out against the restrictive dogmas of sex and love: ?It would seem that it is only with the introduction of the patriarchal system that men came to desire virginity in their brides. Where the matrilineal system exists young women sow their wild oats as freely as young men, but this could not be tolerated when it became of great importance to persuade women that all intercourse outside of marriage is wicked.?

Moreover, as he points out, they do not take into account the practical realities of life.It is indeed tragic that Russell (who died in 1970) did not live to see the full fledged effects of the Sexual Liberation movement, which began in the 1960s.The taboo on pre-marital sex has been dispensed with in most Western countries, though extra-marital affairs are not yet fully acceptable, and are branded as acts of 'infidelity'.A superb read for anyone with more than a passing interest in matters of sexuality."},{"Title":"Marriage and morals","review":"I picked this one up in hopes that my favorite philosopher might have some good I ideas on what marriage ought to be. I'm largely unsatisfied with the institution of marriage and knew Russell was as well. The first several chapters dealing with the history of marriage and the evolution of marriage in various cultures were fascinating (though a student of anthropology will recognize some things as dated).His observations on sexual education and the general unhealthiness of Victorian stigmatizing of sex was similarly interesting and frequently scathingly sarcastic. I copied a few quotes I liked:\\"It would be wise to subject all unmarried women once a month to medical examination by police doctors, and to send to a penitentiary all such as were found to be not virgins...in order to avoid the risk of certain abuses, it would be necessary that all policemen and all medical men should be castrated.\\" --on maintaining virtue at any cost--\\"The first essential is that the education of girls should be such as to make them stupid and superstitious and ignorant; this requisite is already fulfilled in schools over which the churches have any control.\\" --on maintaining virtue through ignorance--\\"Sex outside of marriage is sin; sex within marriage is not sin... but is a disagreeable duty imposed on man as punishment for the Fall, and to be undertaken in the same spirit in which one submits to a surgical operation. Unfortunately, unless great pains are taken, the sexual act tends to be associated with pleasure, but by sufficient moral care this can be prevented, at any rate in the female.\\"However when it came to his actual views on what marriage ought to be I found him more reactionary than reasonable in several aspects. He did however explain the system of companionate marriage proposed in the 1920's and I found that suitable for my own future-hypothetical marriage.I'd recommend this book to people interested in the history of marriage, but also in the idea that the marriage institution is a human invention and one that may better serve us with a bit of reworking and personalization."},{"Title":"Marriage and morals","review":"I bought this book to hear about Russell's opinion of our commonly held morals and mores. Prior to this I had gone through Russell's books on epistemology and was curious to see how he would use his knife to dissect 'morals', 'values' and 'virtues'. Russell's focus here is to identify the elements of sexual morality that would be best suited for the well being of the society and in the process he analyze and questions every aspect of the existing norms. Note that this book was published in the 1920's and since morality is a moving target both geographically and temporally, his analysis and conclusions is perhaps a bit dated.Russell starts with an explanation of the matrilineal (pretty interesting...I myself come from a matrilineal lineage) and patriarchal systems and then moves on to look at the christian ethics. The Church, especially the Catholic church, comes under a lot of attack from Russell; the genesis of the problem, according to Russell, stems from the fact that the purpose of the marriage (as intended by St Paul) is to solely prevent the sin of fornication with no interest in the positive good of the marriage. The discussion then moves on to romantic love, women's liberation & feminism and onto a very convincing section on the effects of the taboos on the dissemination of sexual knowledge. He believes that this restriction has the effect of stunting the intellectual capacity of the children, especially girls. There is a discussion of the institution of marriage and the institution of prostitution and these leads to his next proposal - that there should be what he calls the 'Trial marriage'. A lot of ideas he puts forth may have sounded radical and heretical at the time (I read he lost a teaching offer at City College, New York due to this book), but they are very common in today's society. Actually, he does not approve hedonism in any way; In fact, he advocates a strong institution of marriage and a strong bond between the mother and father when it comes to children. There are, of course, other areas of discussion in the book that would be considered offensive in today's environment such as the discussion on Eugenics; but Russell is not dogmatically advocating any particular approach, he is exploring all avenues with the objective of maximizing human happiness and whenever he feels a route may not be advisable he retreats to make a new advance. The objective is to rationally identify what is good for the society and the individual without getting into the trappings of religions and moralists (whom Russell treats with disdain).The analysis and observations in this book are based on western societies, I'm in search of a similar book that looks at these issues from the context of the Hindu society. I would like to understand how the society ended up being so morally stuck up whereas the religious mythology indicates that the God's (on whom the moralists base their actions) were totally otherwise."},{"Title":"Marriage and morals","review":"Bertrand RussellMarriage and MoralsRoutledge Classics, Paperback, 2009.8vo. vi+195 pp.First published, 1929.Contents1.

Conclusion===========================================In my attempt for a review of What I Believe (1925), I said that the prose of Lord Russell causes addiction. I was joking - but it turned out to be true. Marriage and Morals (1929) has been my first encounter with a book by Bertrand Russell, and I was somewhat sceptical whether his admirable prose would be able to hold my attention in the course of 21 chapters as completely as it does in a separate chapter, a pamphlet or an essay. Well, as a matter of fact, it doesn't - the experience in book form is much more compelling. As can be seen from the table of contents, a book by Lord Russell is exactly as perfectly organised as his prose is. Moreover, it is very thorough; there is a lot about sex, but there also is a great deal about both the personal and the social significance of marriage and family, their historical development and the crucial role religion played in it, and even something about often evaded issues like prostitution and eugenics. It should be stressed that those who are looking for some kind of obscene gossip and dirty stories will be gravely disappointed. Bertrand Russell is as frank, provocative, opinionated, contentious and argumentative as ever, but there is not a single sentence in these almost 200 pages that is vulgar, let alone obscene; what is more, there is a huge amount of common sense, extremely perceptive observations and uncommonly sensible precepts. To be sure, certain part of the book is completely obsolete by today's moral standards, but that is not to say that it does not make a fascinating read as an important historical document. The bottom line, though, is that much of Marriage and Morals is as relevant and important today as it ever was. And there is no reason to suppose that this will not remain so - at least as long as mankind exists.Our present day morality, if any, is so extraordinarily different than the one in the 1920s, that it requires a powerful imagination to imagine what a monstrous scandal the publication of Marriage and Morals in 1929 must have been. Small wonder, indeed, that it was often quoted in the New York courts in 1940 when Bertrand Russell was officially declared morally unfit to teach (philosophy and mathematics) the bright young minds in the local City College. I am yet again flabbergasted that a man who writes with such astonishing lucidity and exquisite choice of words can be so often and so grossly misunderstood; indeed, the only fault of Lord Russell's prose is his tendency to use the adverb ''extraordinarily'' a little too often - otherwise his style is simply perfect. Yet, he was regarded by many people, supposedly intelligent enough to be socially powerful, as a noxious and obscene influence to be eschewed at all costs. The only possible explanation is that they never read Marriage and Morals carefully, or they were stupendously stupid lot, lamentably and entirely devoid even of the slightest amount of common sense - or both. Bertrand Russell was once seriously regarded as a man who disapproved of marriage and any fairly decent behaviour between the sexes, but, on the other hand, was all for adultery, prostitution and appallingly indecent education of children. This is all moonshine. The case with the marriage is extremely amusing indeed. Lord Russell could hardly have been such a fool as to disapprove of something he did exactly four times in his life. As a matter of fact, this only proves what he flatly said in Marriage and Morals, namely that marriage is of great importance both as a social institution and as a purely personal relationship, and it should be dissolved only when it is childless or one of the parents is obviously unfit for his or her duties. Though he was far from the Catholic notion of marriage as sacred, Lord Russell was dead conscious that matrimony is no easy matter; a number of conditions should be observed and many old prejudices demolished if it is to have any chance to be successful. His own triple (at least) failure in the field, just as much as his notorious extra-marital affairs, corroborates his reflections, no doubt because they were partly stimulated by each other. He finishes the eponymous chapter thus:It is therefore possible for a civilised man and woman to be happy in marriage, although if this is to be the case a number of conditions must be fulfilled. There must be a feeling of complete equality on both sides; there must be no interference with mutual freedom; there must be the most complete physical and mental intimacy; and there must be a certain similarity in regard to standards of values. [...] Given all these conditions, I believe marriage to be the best and most important relation that can exist between two human beings. If it has not often been realised hitherto, that is chiefly because husbands and wives have regarded themselves as each other's policemen. If marriage is to achieve its possibilities, husbands and wives must learn to understand that whatever the law may say, in their private lives they must be free.I do not know how often marriages turn out to be happy, but I venture to claim that the above passage will retain its importance as long as people want to marry, or to live together at all.Another important, and singularly prescient, idea of Bertrand Russell about marriage is that the two parties who are going to be married need by no means be virgins. On the contrary, they should have as much sexual experience as possible, especially with one another. This, of course, is quite common today; no one would turn a hair that the bride is no virgin at all, much less so that the bridegroom has been something of a Don Juan. But Lord Russell goes even further, claiming that a stable, lifelong marriage does not necessarily exclude extramarital sexual relationships, and I cannot but think the here he is too advanced even for our present and reportedly wiser in terms of morality times; perhaps we have gained freedom at expense of common sense. Lord Russell's notion is that the mellowing of marriage, after the sexual passion is all but dead, and its transformation into affectionate companionship should in theory be sufficient for a sensible man not to throw it away because of a new love, no matter how passionate that may be; even in 1929, when he was still only in his second marriage, Bertrand Russell must have been conscious that it does not always happen that way. But his remarks about the perils of sense of duty or obsession with work are surprisingly modern, perhaps even more relevant today, in this so much more hectic world, than they were in the 1920s. Especially perceptive, if a bit dated, are his reflections about the pre-marital sexual experience:Most men and women, given suitable conditions, will feel passionate love at some period of their lives. For the inexperienced, however, it is very difficult to distinguish a passionate love from mere attraction; especially is this the case with well-brought-up girls, who have been thought that they could not possibly like to kiss a man unless they loved him. If a girl is expected to be a virgin when she marries, it will very often happen that she is trapped by a transient and trivial sex attraction, which a woman with sexual experience could easily distinguish from love. This has undoubtedly been a frequent cause of unhappy marriages.Here is a good example about positively dated but quite charming bits of moral history mixed with perspicacious remarks which time cannot wither away. One instance of historical example quite irrelevant to our times but which I find particularly extraordinary, not to say shocking, is Lord Russell's claim that even at present time - the 1920s, if I may remind you - there were newly-wed couples who were so inexperienced sexually that needed a doctor's advice because they simply didn't know what to do with themselves. I find this totally incredible, but I'll take Russell's word on it.Bertrand Russell's views of love are something, to use his language, I cannot subscribe to, at least not completely. When he generalises about love being the greatest thing a man can experience, though by no means the only one important, it seems to me that he is unduly idealistic, or perhaps relies too much on his own experience; on the other hand, it may well be that I am unduly cynical, or lack the necessary experience for a more accurate judgment. But it seems to me that very often love - and marriage too, for that matter - includes a great deal of repugnant egotism and insufferable restraint of the personal freedom. However that may be, Lord Russell's discourse on love makes a truly compelling read, mostly because of the tremendous amount of common sense that seems almost never to desert him; nor does his marvellous prose which somehow manages to say more in few pages than others could in a whole book. I cannot but admire Lord Russell's view of love as a fine symbiosis of physical and mental elements, which may reach different degrees of intensity and is there to be enjoyed by all who are lucky enough. His claim that sexual intercourse divorced from love, though by no means wicked or something like that, cannot bring any lasting satisfaction also is more than sensible. Nor is his warning that the ''gospel of work'' is a great enemy of love any less important today that it was then. Only today, in a more virtual, digital and high-tech world than ever before, we should add the disconcerting tendency love to be digitalised and dehumanised, mercilessly transformed into chats and webcams. In the end, this is just another method for fighting the terrible loneliness that affects at one time or another, seldom or often, any of us; it remains to be seen whether this method is any better than the old-fashioned one. This certainly is the place to quote one of Lord Russell's most penetrating and strongly affecting passages:Love is something far more than desire for sexual intercourse; it is the principal means to escape from the loneliness which afflicts most men and women throughout greater the part of their lives. There is a deep-seated fear, in most people, of the cold world and the possible cruelty of the herd; there is a longing for affection which is often concealed by roughness, boorishness or a bullying manner in men, and by nagging and scolding in women. Passionate mutual love while it lasts puts an end to this feelings and breaks down the walls of the ego, producing a new being composed of two in one. [...] Those who have never known the deep intimacy and the intense companionship of happy mutual love have missed the best thing that live has to give; unconsciously, if not consciously, they feel this, and the resulting disappointment inclines them towards envy, oppression and cruelty.Beautiful, powerful and stirring writing, if going a trifle overboard as well. No matter. One is compelled to reflect on it. Lord Russell brilliantly summarises the ''three extra-rational activities in modern life'' as religion, war and love. Of these, he continues, only love is not anti-rational, that is compatible with reason. Then we, in the beginning of XXI century, have a cause to rejoice, for we have eliminated almost completely religion and war. But there are two big and rather difficult questions: 1) is it worth while what he have substituted war and religion with?, and 2) is it worth while what we have transformed love into? I do not profess to give the answers. Not yet.There are a number of other issues in Marriage and Morals which must have shocked Lord Russell's contemporaries, but wouldn't bring a blush to any cheek today - except in some cases of pathological prudishness. Many of these views were far ahead of their time. Some still are. Others have been realised, but I am immensely curious what would have been Lord Russell's opinion of them if could see the results. To take few random examples, he advocated a much greater respect for nudity both inside the family and outside the house; the former, I believe, is common today, and the latter is by no means uncommon on the beach. Bertrand Russell appears to have been an aficionado of nude beaches, but I wonder what would have been his opinion about several thousand stark naked people on the street - for a photo. Lord Russell was convinced that sexual education should not be denied to children, even at quite early stages of their development; this is the only way, he claimed, to remove any false mystery or indecency that is often associated with sex and later has most undesirable psychological effects. That sounds reasonable to me, but I am not sure it is very often applied nowadays. On the other hand, I should love to know Lord Russell's opinion about the common practice of ten years old boys having access to Internet and a huge amount porn movies, including some of its most scatological and utterly disgusting forms. As far as prostitution is concerned, Lord Russell demonstrates, yet again, a very sober judgment which is all too rare among so fickle a race as mankind. He is by no means a supporter of prostitution, but he is quite aware that, no matter how restricted or improved, it can never be eradicated. Moreover, he is convinced that even at its best prostitution is still harmful, at least for men who frequently seek its services: they are more inclined to treat their wives or girlfriends as a mere source of sexual gratification. It is worth noting that Bertrand Russell is not against an occasional visit to the brothel, if certain circumstances arise, and he does have a genuine sympathy with the prostitute as a social outcast; the former is a tribute to his understanding of human nature, the latter to his compassion. Summing up the matter, Lord Russell is positive that the best weapon against prostitution is a new, less severe morality, which is by no means the same as lack of any morality:Whenever the older morality has decayed, prostitution also has decayed. The young man who would formerly have been driven to occasional visits to prostitutes is now able to enter upon relations with girls of his own kind, relations which are on both sides free, which have a psychological element quite as important as the purely physical, and which involve often a considerable degree of passionate love on both sides. From the point of view of any genuine morality, this an immense advance upon the older system.It is fascinating to put this passage in the context of our own times. Today sex is no longer ''that thing which everybody does but nobody talks about''. We all talk about it, myself obviously included. But I am afraid the quantity is inversely proportional to the quality. The interesting thing is that, despite this outstanding sexual freedom, prostitution still flourishes. Lord Russell would have been amused by the paradox. Indeed, he sensed something of it in the American way of life of his times which he considered more dissolute than the European one. Whether he was right or wrong in that in irrelevant, he certainly was aware that the new morality must also be better than the old one, that is more reasonable and designed to increase human happiness. He rejoiced at the changes in morals that were happening at the time, for he was sure that they would lead to a happier mankind. Would he have rejoiced today?It goes without saying that Marriage and Morals is a very serious book. But if I have given the impression that it is a kind of dull stuff, I have done it a great injustice. As always, Bertrand Russell's wit is inexhaustible and makes for a really great fun, not the least of which are such dystopian visions as I have quoted in my review of Bertrand Russell's Best. The main source of amusement is the historical part of the book which is quite prominent in the first seven chapters; the last fourteen are mostly concerned with contemporary issues and hopes/fears for the future. Since Bertrand Russell does not particularly like incomplete things, he discusses briefly marriage and morals through centuries: from primitive societies, through the ancient world and the Middle Ages, until the Renaissance and more recent times. One may learn about the Melanesians among whom, incredible as it may seem, the concept of paternity does not seem to exist at all; or about the Maori for whom the father of all children was - the moon; or about the Tasmanians who are reported never to have committed an adultery - which is apparently the reason for their extinction*. The most hilarious part, however, is the one dedicated to the Middle Ages, where Lord Russell describes with his inimitable sense of humour the obsession of the age with the notion of romantic love - that is one which is impossible without inaccessibility of the princess in question.Bertrand Russell being what he is, he never misses an opportunity for some severe criticism of the Christianity. The Middle Ages provide him with an excellent opportunity; at one place he quotes at length one of his fellow writers who is very keen on exposing the virtuous nature of clergy and laity alike: Pope John XXIII was condemned for incest and adultery; one abbot in Canterbury was found to have 17 illegitimate children; another in Spain kept no fewer than 70 concubines (what a harem indeed!); not to mention the Bishop of Liege who was deposed in 1274 for having 65(!!!) illegitimate children. When he comes to the foundations of Christianity, Lord Russell makes no bones about the many terrible faults of the Christian dogma with regard to morals: the wickedness of sex, a horrible thing to be endured only for propagation of species; the whole highly irrational conception of sin; the deplorable persecution of adultery; and, perhaps above all, the disastrous view of marriage that started with St Paul himself, not as an institution designed to bring and rear children, but as a legalised form of lust. It is ironic that it was indeed the institution of marriage that led to adultery, which is otherwise hardly possible, and to a great deal of additional persecution - together with the idiotic notion about its sacred character of course.In conclusion, I dare claim that Bertrand Russell's Marriage and Morals is an indispensable book for everybody who has still remained at least a little bit human. On the one hand, it is a fascinating historical document, anticipating the sexual revolution and the hippies by well over three decades. Quite unlike many a modern discourses on sex, Lord Russell's book is entirely devoid of obscenity but full of common sense and reason. On the other hand, and more importantly, not only does it go much farther than the mere sexual aspect discussing love, marriage, children, education, society, religion and many other important unknowns in the ultimate equation, but it does contain a thorough, sensible and wise analysis of human nature. Limited, to be sure, but limited to one devilishly important aspect of life. Within its limitations it is perfect.-------------------------------------------------'* By way of a little joke, I think I have just caught Somerset Maugham plagiarising. A very similar line occurs in his play The Bread-Winner (1930), which was published, produced and almost certainly written on the next year after Marriage and Morals appeared:You know that the Tasmanians, who never committed adultery, are now extinct.PS An Open Letter to the PublisherLadies and Gentlemen in Routledge,It is high time to improve your copyright pages.

So his books were largely aimed at industrial societies and when he writes these international sympathies lie at the heart of his work. Although in the united states ceding national control to an international body,european thinkers and philosophers and the league of nations and united nations at that time was ceding control to internationalbodies,and although at one time philosophers like Russell thought of a world of large international powers,not many thinkers have much credence in this any longer. Like the european union,the large economic powers endup controlling the smaller states due to success and economic might and complexity of their own educational andeconomic diversification and prowess. However in this very old book what i find interesting is what he says of modern marriage which is still worth repeating today. The cohesiveness and well being of the community start at the community home. The first step is the well being of a marriage. Then he discusses children which change the dynamics of the household..and should focus a change from adult relationships to care of children as the primary focus of a person's life and the way that adults relate to chilren and their spouses are an important point. One point i think important to modern life is the stability of marriage...divorce splinters married life and actually leads to the disintegration of all in the original family circle and most importantly the children...and leads to children solely for the most part interacting with children. There are also discussions of how the state has taken over many of the male's control in traditional families and state control has really proved counter productive to family life. An interesting book...and in this divorce prone age of interest. One point i dont agree with is his keeping the family together after the spouses have all kind of romantic entanglements elsewhere for the children's sake,although i sympathize with his values in keeping the family together for the children's sake,how will the children deal and relate to and process this as it will certainly show up in how the parents relate to each other in the home and unfortunately with the children.....Population declines. In the u.s. the ethnic makeup of the nation is changing and also canada...in europe populations are declining as a whole..this he may see as a danger since a population must be stable but is modern culture,divorce,interpersonal relations,what is the actual reason for the decline in familyrelations,and the decline in populations...and how do we stabilize a population,have healthier relations and have people interested in families.. and what does traditional religion have to do with all this...an old book from a scientific philosopher but still worth reading for an old book.

Bush Administrations, and the first three and a half yeas of the Obama Presidency, one might imagine that Edsall would have little genuinely new to say to us, and his book might best be relegated to the status of documents that are largely of historical interest.After all, there are no references to the war in Bosnia. Neither the first nor the second Gulf War receives any coverage. There is one passing reference to a conflict in Afghanistan, but not the one involving the so-called coalition forces; instead Edsall is referring to the Soviet Union's misadventure, leading to its humiliating defeat by the U.S. backed mujahideen, many of whom later participated in the burtally repressive Islamic fundamentalist reign of the Taliban.The twin towers of the World Trade Center were still standing, and so was the Berlin Wall. Few in the western world had heard of Osama Bin Laden. Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the ostensibly soul-sapping welfare program that provided an endless supply of outrages for right-wing talk show heroes and heroines, was still supplying sustenance for many unfortunate Americans, not yer replaced by Clinton's Temporary Aid to Needy Families. No one had heard of Monica Lewinsky or the determinedly conspicuous Kenneth Starr. No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top were bad ideas whose time had not yet come. The U.S. Supreme Court had not yet given George W, Bush his first term in office, nor had it rendered its Citizens United decision, opening the electoral process to the potentially overwhelming force of corporate campaign contributions ...We could go on and on, but the central question remains the same: how could a book written before these events, some truly momentous and some simply sensational, be of value to anyone trying to understand the American political landscape in 2012?In truth, The New Politics of Inequality shows us the foundation for many of the crucial outcomes that have determined Americans' prospects and the nation's place in the world. Edsall wrote roughly two decades after the passing of the Era of the Social Contract, a time when capital and labor existed harmoniously and, broadly speaking, approximated the roles of countervailing powers joined in a common endeavor. His book, thus, is set in a period when internationalization, technnological advances, outsourcing, down-sizing, and the subsequent disastrous decline of organized labor were operating in full force. As a result, real incomes of for most people -- the working poor, the working class, the lower middle class -- had stagnated and then sharply declined. Even solidly middle class and upper middle class families were bearing, in both relative and real terms, an ever-larger share of the tax burden, and the circumstances of those below them were even worse.The wealthy, however, were in a much improved position. Their incomes had risen dramatically as labor costs were further diminished, and the nominally progressive federal income tax was no longer distributing downward in an effort toward greater equity. Instead, tax-based redistribution was occurring upward, resulting in ever greater concentration the further one moved through the top fifth of the income distribution. Furthermore, when Reagan became president, his administration slashed funding for AFDC; sharply cut appropriations for food stamps and children's nutritiion; spending on public education was dramatically diminished; public service employment was completely eliminated; and the estate tax, sometimes characterized as the nefarious \\"death tax\\" was gutted, eliminating an important policy that slowed cross-generational concentration of wealth in the hope of giving everyone a chance to participate with a modicum of effectiveness in the political and economic world.But how did all this come about? Where were the Democrats, the majority party and nominal representatives of the least fortunate and the working and middle classes. If we follow Edsall's compelling argument, the Democrats were stuck in the '60's.The Democrats and their primary allies, especially organized labor, were taken by surprise when the traditional Republican minorty coalesced with increasingly politicized and aggressive business interests and a growing and well financed conservative intellectual establishment. Almost unnoticed, the Heritage Foundation, the American Enterprise Institute, Stanford's Hoover Institution, and similarly conservative-to-reactionary think tanks began setting the intellectual terms for congressional policy making, something that, at least since 1932, had been the purview of the Democrats.In the meantime, the Democrats had been busy with squeaky-clean procedural reforms that, on their face, promised to make policy making and the electoral process more open, decentralized, and accessible, no longer dominated by a few congressional committee charimen who had gained their positions by virtue of seniority and who had long impeded passage of progressive legislation regarding civil rights and labor. In an odd turn of events, however, by decentralizing power and by increasing the number and importance of primary elections, Democrats had undercut their dominant position.The Era of the Capital-Labor Social Contract was long gone. Republicans made no secret of the fact that they represented a homogeneous group, the big-maney elites and their intellectual allies. Yes, there were differences among elements of the Republican constituency, but these were inconsequential when compared with the over-riding commonalities that gave the party cohesion.The Democrats, by contrast, were the party of a diverse, often conflicting collection of out-groups, people who wanted to change the status quo rather than reinforce it. The working class, for example, had little or nothing in common with environmentalists. In fact, the objectives of the two groups were often at odds -- jobs or the environment -- and environmentalists tended to be better educated and more affluent than members of labor unions and others who did American society's essential but devalued grunt work. As another example, blacks and gays, both groups closer to the Demcratic Party than to the Republicans, often had fundamentally different views when it came to sex, marriage, and what it means to be a moral person. In an ironic and damaging twist, the Democrat's progressive agenda, while meant to make things more equitable for everyone, had led to a split between the working class and the poor, a product of the fact that the over-taxed working class was no longer doing well. Schisms of this sort had long been intrinsic to the makeup of the Demcratic Party, but in the past the conflicting elements had been forged into working coalitions that enabled Democrats to function as a unit.However, with the well-intentioned procedural reforms, along with the proliferation of primaries, and the renaissance of an aggressively conservative Republican Party, Democrats were in decline. In spite of their diversity, they had long been the party of lower income Americans, while the Republicans were increasingly strengthened by their representation of the wealthy. When primaries were held, high-income members of both parties turned out in relatively large numbers, while members of the Democrat's low-income core constituency were much less likely to participate. In a general election this often meant that wealthy Republicans were able to vote for candidates with interests very similar to their own. Democratic voters, however, had to vote for those who won the primaries, meaning the favorites of upper-income Democrats, who often had little in common with the Democrat's lower-income majority. To make matter worse, even in general elections, lower-income people were less likely to turn out to vote. The combination of non-representative winners of primaries and lower Democratic turnout under the best of circumstances gave the resurgent Republicans an enormous advantage.The new Republican coalition, moreover, had the money and know-how to take full advantage of technological advances that made door-to-door visits by ward heelers vastly less important than computerized lists of the demographic and political make-up of electoral districts throughout the country, enabling the proliferation of political action committees to judiciously target their resources. Democrats were slow to recognize the value of technology in accurately targeting their resources, and they spent exorbitant amounts on incumbents who, in many instances, were in traditionally very safe districts.During the decade of the '80's, the temporal focus of Thomas Edsall's fine book, the Democrats were not only slow to recognize the importance of modern technology in winning elections, they were also often under-funded. As a result, technological innovations were beyond their reach.Even television presented unique problems for Democrats. Republicans, after all, when they delivered a compaign message by way of TV knew that their audience was sufficiently homogeneous that no constituency would be offended. For the Democrats, even when adequately funded, the divisions among their constituent groups worked against them, as no one message could be tailored to the interests of all.There is so much information and there are so many unexpected insights in The New Politics of Inequality that any review, even an unduly long one, is fraught with selectivity. In fact, Edsall's book is so densely packed with information that it is difficult to grasp unifying themes around which to organize an assessment.In addition, while Edsall makes exemplary use of tabular presentation of easy-to-grasp quantitative informaion, he also includes percentages, percent changes, and comparative dollar values in the body of his text. As a result, the reader is sometimes overwhelmed, and an otherwise excellent book is pock-marked with areas of tediuim. Edsall's occasional use of percentages of percentages, moreover, is misleading, something his editor should have caught.Nevertheless, Edsall makes a fine, even if complex case that the party with the big-money constituency will turn out the votes, win the elections, and reward their members. In this instance, that means that the distribution of wealth and income in the U.S. will become even more skewed toward the top, approximating a great American plutocracy. Developed Western European countries have been able to avoid this because they have strong labor unions that include large percentages of the citizenry as members. In the U.S., this is a thing of the past.If you like the current distribution of resources in the U.S. and woud like to see existing patterns intensified, this book will make you feel virtyous and powerful. Otherwise, Edsall's brilliantly informative analysis, with its unmistakable implications for the present and our future, will break your heart."},{"Title":"A fortunate man: The story of a country doctor","review":"A Fortunate Man, first published in the late1960's has remained an enduring book which not only captures a time and place - a small village in the border country between England and Wales in the 1960's, but has become a book which in many ways is an archetypal essay about the relationship of the physician to himself, to the community and to the ideals and realities of practice. I have taught this book in medical school for almost 20 years, using it as a stimulus for young physicians to think about themselves and how they view their careers, looking forward. The photographs by Jean Mohr are among the most striking and emotional depictions of medicine in the late 20th century and the book has become a widely referenced example of combining narrative and photographs in the documentary style.Anyone who wishes to understand the essence of the doctor patient relationship or the doctor community relationship should own this book and read it. It is a classic."},{"Title":"A fortunate man: The story of a country doctor","review":"This book is an extended essay on the work of Dr. John Sassall, a country General Practicioner (GP), in a poor area of Britain. Integrated into this book are a series of often striking photographs taken by Berger's collaborator Jean Mohr. The photos complement Berger's insightful comments on Sassall's work. Berger and Mohr appear to have spent a good deal of time with Sassall and his patients and must have earned the trust, not only of Sassall, but of his patients. Berger terms Sassall &quot;A Fortunate Man&quot; not because of good luck or unusual talent but because Sassall is a person whose work is directly connected with basic existential questions and meaning. The portrait of Sassall is unsentimental, clear, and admiring. Sassall is not just a highly competent and dedicated physician, he is a man who feels compelled to use his occupational life in a quest to explore basic questions about the nature of human relationships and community. This need drives him to be an exceptionally good physician and to involve himself deeply in the life of his rather insular community. While Sassall is an unusual man and physician, many aspects of his experiences in dealing with patients cast light on doctor-patient relationships in general. As a physician, I found Berger's analysis of many of these issues insightful and useful. Berger proceeds to larger issues of how society values life and work. Berger's writing is unambiguous, direct, and informed by a considerable critical intelligence. The real measure of this book is that readers will find themselves drawn back to thinking about the questions that Berger raises."},{"Title":"A fortunate man: The story of a country doctor","review":"It begins as if it were fiction, and ends as a study of one man's life, his relation to his patients, and the economic and social conditions which frame this connection. It is less biography than philosophy, and it extends beyond doctors toward all people and their actions.This is not to say that John Berger's observations of Dr. Sassall's life can be applied to all people. Much is specific to Sassall's identity as a doctor. His depression, Berger claims, is a result of \\"the suffering of his patients, and his own sense of inadequacy.\\" But there is a theme of existentialism that underlies the book, and it is ultimately about, I think, the pain of searching for purpose after one has faced and understood absurdity. Berger cannot conclude his essay because Sassall's essence cannot be truly captured, and his existence is not yet finished.Besides being a philosophical book, it is also very personal. It is difficult to categorize FORTUNATE MAN into nonfiction categories because it is very intellectually intimate. It is a unique and thoughtful book, not only to be enjoyed but appreciated with effort and time."},{"Title":"A fortunate man: The story of a country doctor","review":"Mr. John Berger calls this work an essay, a word that does not bring to my mind great literary work. It brings back memories of forced reading and documentation. \\"A Fortunate Man\\", is a literary accomplishment, it is another example of this Author's skills and to the man this book is a tribute to. Additionally the photographs of Jean Mohr bring a sense of hyperrealism to this documentary of one Doctor's practice, the world in which he lives, and the lives he cares for. Many of the black and white images brought to mind the Artist Andrew Wyeth as he too has documented the life of those traditionally not thought to be extraordinary, but who are the foundations of our society.Photographs are not generally found in most popular literature. Images are the realm of the Author and the creations he or she can conjure in the mind's eye of a reader. Some would comment pictures are inappropriate; they intrude, or at worst become a crutch for weak writing. Others would say each reader should have their own visual experience, their own reference points they create when reading another's work. But in this collaboration the images and words compliment one another, and like the words that are black and white, the photographer too makes her contribution in shades from black to white, and the result is simply extraordinary.There are moments when the Author becomes a poet adding but a few lines to an otherwise lone photograph, and the feeling evoked has more impact than chapters of lesser writers. Mr. Berger describes a landscape as perhaps being other than a stage where events unfold, and actually being a screen or curtain that hides life's events. Landscapes for him are, \\"biographical and personal\\", read that thought with the photograph it compliments and you feel as though you have experienced an entire novel.Dr. John Sassall is the man that all this excellence in words and images were gathered for and he is deserving of every bit of the talent used. He is a country Doctor, he is pure in his motivation as his patients are what he lives for, his drive is to ease suffering, cure, and be the comforting presence when death is at hand. He is the type of Doctor that any reader would consider himself or herself fortunate to have. He is the confidant of every age, every generation, he is an advisor but never one who preaches, opines or judges. He is part of the lives of his patients, he knows them, and knows that illness is not always a physical ailment. His understanding, and using his seemingly casual, spontaneous questions often cure what no medicine could ever reach. He is a friend to everyone. In him all place their trust that is absolute.This is an overwhelming book to read even though the time you may spend reading and looking through it may be brief. For Mr. Berger and Ms. Mohr raise and document the most fundamental concerns we all have, how this Doctor deals with them, and how most of the world does not.The Author says that our Society wastes by \\"enforced hypocrisy\\"; emptying lives it does not destroy. Dr. Sassall is the answer to this future containing nothing, and his story is presented in a way that will move you, as few books of any genre will do."},{"Title":"A fortunate man: The story of a country doctor","review":"John Berger is know around the world as a Renaissance Man, one who can write criticism, plays, novels, short stories, and can even paint the occasional work of art. But I humbly submit that this may be his best work, one that examines the relationship between a country doctor and his community. Sadly the time period of the piece, the 1960s, are gone and the entire institution of the general practitioner, complete with house calls and lollipops for the children. But the questions he asks are searching ones that hinge on the very fundamental human relations that modernity is radically changing.What is a human life worth? He won't give you any answers, because he trusts you to think about all this for years to come. An exceptional work."},{"Title":"A fortunate man: The story of a country doctor","review":"as a physician and surgeon, I felt deeply moved by John Berger's words and Jean Mohr's pictures... despite the awesome advancements in both medicine &amp; surgery, the essence of physician-hood lies within those finely distilled moments between physician and patient. The relationship between physician and patient has slowly eroded since Berger's extended essay. Yet as I intermittently re-read the text and stare at the all-too-familiar scenes of suffering and personal anguish, I experience a sense of hope and become acutely aware of the necessity of remaining a staunch advocate for my patients."},{"Title":"A fortunate man: The story of a country doctor","review":"As a practicing Family Physician, I can say that John Berger captures vividly that gray area of awareness in which we operate. Seldom are the efforts of a primary care provider clearly highlighted and valued beyond the moments shared between healer and patient. While understandably dated, the feelings of a doctor caring for the vulnerable are truly and respectfully reflected in the prose. The photos only add to the quietly dramatic story of one extraordinary physician carrying on the ancient practice - to heal, to relieve suffering, to walk along with our patients in their journey."},{"Title":"A fortunate man: The story of a country doctor","review":"A photo journey through the professional life of an exceptional man and a healer in the broad sense and not just a specialist; John Berger's writing is poetic, accurate, with a keen eye for social observation, and Jean Mohr's pictures are, each one, a short story or an essay without words."},{"Title":"A fortunate man: The story of a country doctor","review":"Beautiful, thoughtful, thought-provoking writing in a fascinating setting, from a sophisticated, personally philosophical point of view.

Now I would add Berger's&quot; Fortunate man &quot;.Chekhov : a predecessor, and example of personal sacrifices (he volunteered to spend years in far eastern Siberia attending to health of prisoners there- well ahead of modern era of &quot;LesMedecines sans Frontiers&quot;). His short stories with typically Russian soul searching flavor will remain classic.Axel Munthe : in &quot; The Story of San Michele &quot; enchanting narrative of outstanding physician.And now Berger's : &quot;Fortunate Man&quot;. - It is not an essay with &quot;Take home lessons&quot; but rather with &quot; Take home reflections&quot;. There is no plot. We learn little of hero's personal private life. Yet in era of two trends in attitudes of health providers -American, you get what you pay for, and , in the rest of civilized world, so called &quot;socialized Medicine&quot;, frequently impersonal and alienated from patient, account of practice in rural England by a country doctor is endearing.Just as in Chekhov and Axel Munthe writings we find in Berger's narrative example of humane interaction between doctor and his patients.As suggested in the conclusion of the book , we are left with developing our own moral and social judgments.And this is what is expected from good book."},{"Title":"A fortunate man: The story of a country doctor","review":"This is a great book describing the satisfactions of the role of a general practioner in a small village in England. The author describes the appreciation of the village inhabitants for the doctor, and in return, his satisfactions in his role. Morris A. Wessel M.D."},{"Title":"A fortunate man: The story of a country doctor","review":"A FORTUNATE MAN: THE STORY OF A COUNTRY DOCTOR, first published in the mid-1960s by John Berger, has as its subject a certain John Sassall, a rural physician in England. This small volume, 169 pages in paperback, is also nicely illustrated with many apt b/w photographs by Jean Mohr.If you've ever been enchanted by ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL by Dr. James Herriot, an English country veterinarian, then A FORTUNATE MAN starts out promising enough with a half dozen or so brief accounts of Dr. Sassall's interactions with his patients. Then, the remainder and greater portion of the text is a lengthy Berger essay based on his observations of the physician and his place in the community. Sassall himself, as might otherwise be revealed by his very real and illustrative day to day rounds, is reduced to the introductory cameos.Berger mixes philosophy and social commentary as he explores such subjects as the doctor/patient relationship, the art of diagnosis, the physician's social standing in the community, and the physician's view of suffering. The flavor of Berger's dissertation can be sampled from this snippet regarding suffering:\\"The objective co-ordinates of time and space, which are necessary to fix a presence, are relatively stable. But the subjective experience of time is liable to be so grossly distorted - above all by suffering -that it becomes, both to the sufferer and any person partially identifying himself with the sufferer, extremely difficult to correlate with time proper. Sassall not only has to make this correlation, he also has to correlate the patient's subjective experience of time with his own subjective experience.\\"The book is less about Dr. Sassall then the author's discernment of the man, and the two are not necessarily the same. This volume would be well-received as part of any medical school curriculum - Theory of Bedside Manner or Medical Ethics 1A, perhaps. For myself, as one who is grudgingly granted 10 minutes of a doctor's distracted attention during the annual physical - the HMO's time is money, after all - I wanted to be presented with first hand evidence that real doctors (like my father the GP who made house calls!) still exist somewhere in the world. Berger's lecturing, while well-meaning and perceptive, didn't do that. It just bored."},{"Title":"A fortunate man: The story of a country doctor","review":"I am required to read this book for Clinical Skills class, but I just quit reading it when I got to part in the middle when the author talks about how ignorant the villagers are: \\"There are large sections of the English working and middle class who are INARTICULATE as a result of wholesale cultural deprivation.

I am sure there are lessons to be learned from this book, but between the marginal-quality, occasionally cryptic writing and the scorn the author shows in passages like this, they're lost.

More important are the \\"missing\\" parts of the book:First, we hardly get any information about different ways foie gras is sold; whole, pieces, reconstituted. We don't get any information about conservation techniques; for instance would it have been nice with a discussion of fresh versus pasteurised, etc.Second, there are no simple foie gras recipes at all, but around 100 haute cuisine recipes. This is totally unacceptable. I don't mind the very fancy dishes at all, but the joy of eating foie gras gets totally lost in the book. Where is the section on just eating it cold with some good bread? Where is the section on simple accompanying ingredients, like figs, etc. Where is the section on quick pan-searing of the foie gras?

I've even had the opportunity to serve it to one of my animal welfare friends without their knowledge (yes, a bit on the dark side, I know), and they were absolutely thrilled with the taste.The top restaurants in the world will have foie gras as part of their menu. Perhaps some day biotechnologists will be able to grow it from liver cells so the animal welfare folks can move on to another cause... but for now, if you don't mind the controversy, get this book, learn all about Foie Gras as a gourmet ingredient, and boost your cooking expertise!Look, if the Iron Chefs use it, it's got to be good stuff! Remember, life is too short to eat low-quality food, and taste is everything!"},{"Title":"Foie Gras: A Passion","review":"The PETA ninnies should learn something about foie gras before spouting off about a subject they know bupkes about. 99% of the world's foie gras is no longer produced by the force feeding method. They have now bred ducks and geese that just like to eat. And eat. And eat. Even if the force feeding was still in use, do these hypocrites eat chicken? Eggs? Yogurt? Wear leather? I guess they think those farm animals are treated so much better than the poor widdle ducks. This is a great book about a great ingredient, and I credit Poppy Z.

Metal pipes are shoved deeply into the throats of ducks and geese, reaching their stomachs. Then a lever is squeezed to pump huge amounts of corn directly into them. This makes the animals become grossly overweight in just a few weeks and their livers will expand to up to 10-12 times their normal size.I think it's absolutely shameless to just pretend all the suffering doesn't exist and that it's irrelevant to reviewing books like this one. Yes, books like these have a right to exist (free press), but so do the opinions of people like me who oppose promoting foie gras.I'm sure the recipes are amazingly tasty to many people,.... but at what prize?We have the internet now, so please google foie gras and inform yourself before making a decision."},{"Title":"Among Warriors: A Pilgrim in Tibet","review":"Logan finds out almost immediately on her arrival in Tibet, as almost anyone could have told her, that a bicycle is not a viable means of conveyance for a trek across the Tibetan plateau. She ditches the bike early on and becomes just another foreign roadie. Not having learned Tibetan, Logan finds it unnecessary even to find a Tibetan-speaking guide, in the absence of whom she speculates on what Tibetans are saying to another by the tones of their voices and their gestures, without ever interacting with them much. Through her eyes, the tale is one of false starts, dying falls, and inexplicable actions.The habit of false starts and quick changes of direction persists throughout the book. One more example: She goes all the way to Kham for a chance to learn about the Khampa cowboys. She sees them, but she doesn't even approach one.By the end of this book, I was angry that Logan failed to deliver solid first-hand information about journeying through this magical place."},{"Title":"Among Warriors: A Pilgrim in Tibet","review":"This book seems especially written for those people that think that karate is only about fighting, punching or hurting. &quot;Among Warriors&quot; will give you the insight that karate deserves as an art of inner strenght, humbleness and above all respect.

It is a beautiful journey that reaches deep into the human condition. Pamela Logan depicts a mysterious and unknown land that most will never know. A land of spiritual struggle and mastery.

This book opened up a world that will forever exist inside of me."},{"Title":"Among Warriors: A Pilgrim in Tibet","review":"An interesting tour through the high plateaus of Tibet, on a Bicycle! The author (a martial artist) pedals her way across the pages, much as she does through that region; with agonizing slowness and pure tenacity. Her travels lead her readers the through astounding complexity and spartan beauty found few other places in the world. Yet like the author, the &quot;journey&quot; leaves the reader aching for a soft pillow. Ms. Logan warned her reader (finally...) she was NOT writing of her &quot;martial arts experiences&quot; and that truly is too bad. Yet the few which she did specifically mention, to some, would be well worth the wait. A valiant effort, captivating at points. In her next work, the author will have hopefully &quot;honed&quot; whichever &quot;experiences&quot; she profoundly wished to convey. A quality in THIS work, she has not mastered &quot;sufficently&quot; well yet !!!!! A great book this is not, but a fair start, none the less."},{"Title":"The battle-ground","review":"One of the major assets of the novel is that the author is a female writer who gives a specific view of the Southern gentleman before and during the Civil War. It relates the education of a young boy, brought up as an aristocrat in the best Virginian tradition who grows up and becomes a real man through the ordeal of the war, the friendship of a poor white and the love of a woman. It's beautifully written, especially when dealing with nature in Virginia. Of course, the point of view is sympathetic with the Southern cause but critical of slavery.Ellen Glasgow is a major Southern writer of the beginning of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The chess sacrifice;: Technique, art and risk in sacrificial chess","review":"This is a classic book on the subject of Chess Sacrifices that was first published over thirty years ago.

Ever hear of a library?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've never written a review before but i knew half way through this book, which covers about two weeks WOT time, that I was going to. I think the first 6-7 books of this series are just terrific. But the continuing addition of new characters in each of the last three books,along with Mr. Jordan's elaborate descriptions of each characters clothing, meals etc. has almost brought the turning of the Wheel of Time to a stand still. It was a bit difficult to tell how much time elapsed in this book, but it couldn't have covered more than 3-4 weeks in 680 pages. I found myself skipping entire pages with nothing more than a glance because it was all flowing descritions not germain to the plot. I realize this is a world which Mr. Jordan has created, and he can do with it what he wishes, but I sincerely hope he listens to the people who purchase his books and picks up the pace in future WOT novels. I haven't decided if I will purchase Book 11 or not. I have reread the previous 9 several times, but there isn't much need to reread book 10 as there is so little advancement to the plot, which imho is a shame."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I just finished the book and I am so annoyed. Not only did Robert Jordan not advance the story at all (in actual time only a week or so passes from the end of Book 9 to the end of Book 10) but NOTHING is resolved.There are so many subplots that the main plot has been buried and the books have started to move at a snail's pace.Additionally in this book Jordan at some times kept information from us readers, he allowed characters to share secrets that we were not privy too. Are we supposed to remember these things for 2 years while also remembering the countless names and subplots that he has invented? Please.I will not buy the next WOT book, enough is enough. If the series ever ends maybe I'll buy all the books from 11 to whatever and read them all at once, but otherwise it isn't worth my time or money to continue reading this series.It takes over 500 pages in this book for Rand to appear, and what does he do? Nothing.Faile was captured at the end of book 8, guess what? She is still captured. Guess what else? only 32 days have passed since the end of Book 8 (Perrin keeps track).Mazrim and Halima are still wonderfully able to avoid discovery, and darkfriends are popping up all over.Egwene at one point wonders where Gawain is, musing that he is either in Caemlyn or the White Tower. Hello, she talks to Elayne in the dream world frequently enough that she would have known if he was in Caemlyn.The Aes Sedai spend hours debating what happened at Shadar Logoth, yet no one brings up the Dragon Reborn once. They're real geniuses.You know what else? Jordan has the audacity to introduce even more subplots in this book. How he ever expects to finish is beyond me.The bottom line?DON'T BUY IT. Wait until he actually finishes the series, your experience will be much better reading one after the other instead of waiting 2 years inbetween. Infact you would be fine just reading a summary of this book, since nothing at all happens."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Originally this series was to be nine books. The publisher asked Jordan to extend it to 15 books so that they could get more money out of the series. The last four books of the series are the unfortunate consequence of this request. We're ten books into the series, and it's still buildup.Of these last four books, I believe this is the best written (how's that for a glowing review!) Of these four books, this one is laid out well and is very readable. For example, the various unrelated events are linked in time through the purification of Saidin. In addition, the worst and most unbelievable character of the series (Nynaeve) is ignored. Plus the relationship that is developing between Mat Cauthen and Tuon is well written and enjoyable. We finally get to like this character.The negatives of this book are numerous, and include:-- (Spoiler here) nothing happens in over 600 pages of an adventure novel!!-- Entire sections of the book drone on. For instance, Perrin spends chapter after chapter talking about rescuing the love of his life(Faile), and then (drum roll please) .... he buys some food so that he has more time to talk about it. It's a wonder that any of his troops are still following him.-- Jordan spends an enormous effort demonstrating how shrewd Egwene is at manipulating much more experienced women. (Spoiler, kind of--) Then she pulls a positively bonehead stunt at the end of the book to get into trouble. Her actions don't fit her character, at all! If Egwene were the type of character trying to prove herself to the other Aes Sedai, her carelessness would make sense -- but she has not been written with these characteristics. As a result, her actions smell of plot manipulation.-- Book 9 ended with the Dragon purifying Saidin, thus removing the taint from the male half of the source. Then why do we now read how much of a struggle for Rand to seize the source? I grew tired of reading these descriptions books ago.Ten books into the series and I'm stuck. If you haven't started -- save yourself!! At the rate he's moving it's going to be another ten years until the series is finished. Let's just hope that Jordan can figure out how to tie these together in a way that makes sense."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan's books started out good- Fun epic fantasty with an exciting sweeping scope. As the series progressed the characters became increasingly wooden and simplistic (and these were just the starting cast). With each new installment in the series, Jordan continues to slow the pacing and introduce new and trivial sidelines to no end. Crossroads of Twilight is a new nadir for the series. No advancement is made in any of the increasing number of plot lines. If the previous book and this one were combine, the juvenile character courtships were removed, and some actual events tooks place the resulting book would not have been that AS BAD. This series needs an editor that can put a stop to the increasingly pointless and meandering sidelines that Jordan indulges in with each new installment in the series. Here is a brief synopsis (don't worry about any spoilers). What happens to Rand? Nothing. What Happens to Mat? Nothing. What happens to Perrin? Nothing. I think you get the picture. This series needs to be put to rest. More than ever this book is blatant filler designed to do nothing more than part previously dedicated readers from their cash. If you must read the book check it out from your local library. Don't waste your money and don't let Tor and Jordan gain anything from this worthless book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I can't believe that even a few people would write a 4 or 5 star review for this book.If you take the time read the positive reviews carefully, they're giving this book the \\"benefit of the doubt\\" simply because the first several volumes were good. And most of the 4 or 5 star reviews acknowledge that Crossroads of Twilight is insufferably boring, repetitive, sluggish and incredibly annoying!Please, let's be HONEST here. This is hands-down the worst fantasy book you'll ever shell out [$$] for. As a reader of all the previous Wheel of Time volumes, I can say for sure that this one is pure drivel, and it is quite disgusting the way loyal Wheel of Time readers are being treated by this author. I can't imagine what Mr. Jordan (or whatever his true name is) is doing for two years to turn out this quality of product.This current state of affairs is due to the author's greediness (\\"hmmm...I have a great idea, let's lengthen this series for cash and some more New York Times # 1 rankings\\"), or ego/pride (\\"forget my critics and the petty impatience of my readers, I'm going to do this my way or no way, even if it takes another 40 years!\\").Personally, I feel like I have been conned. I would hope that the current situation will change with the next volume but I won't hold my breath. Count me among those WoT fans who will not buy the next hardcover.

True, I'm only on page 200-something right now (after weeks of painful attempts to get interested), but absolutely nothing is happening in the story.Actually, I take that back. Tons is happening. People are plotting things, but not telling anyone (including the reader) what they are plotting. People are walking around and thinking. Women think evil thoughts about men, Men think evil thoughts about women, and everyone seems to understand those darn Cairhiren's can't be trusted. What is really starting to drive me nuts, is that if anybody just spoke to anyone else and listened for five minutes, pretty much everything in this world would be solved.Oh, and don't let me forget to mention that we've now been introduced to about 500 new main characters. And I have two thirds of the book to go!I guess I wouldn't be this upset if I didn't like the books so much, but I feel like a cocaine-addict.

There is not much going on. The plot did not advance at all from the previous book and to think I waited two years for this book. The only important part is the prologue which is like the continuation of the Book 9, _Winter's Heart_. Do not buy this book. Just borrow it from a library if you really want to know what happens. At least you can return it without delay"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am and will remain a fan of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series and I recommend to anyone that they should start reading it as soon as possible. That said I feel it is the duty for all Robert Jordan fans to admit that this particular book was garbage. The first 98% of the book is filler followed by a very small amount of writing that would normally be acceptable in the Wheel of Time legacy. Let this be a wake up call to Mr. Jordan: Even your diehard fans will get upset if you string us along! Bring the quality of the rest of the series back to where it was or you will lose millions of dollars and millions of readers. I will leave it up to Jordan to decide which is more important to him.So, to recap: Read Wheel of Time, but do not purchase the 10th book. Borrow it from a library or from a friend. If you must, buy the paperback only. Robert Jordan should get the message that fans are angry. Hopefully it will make him see the light and end the series the way it began: spectacularly."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"this book like 8&9 will help make robert jordan more money but leave the reader feeling cheated. He most likely could have said in 50 pages if that what he said in 680 pages. Read it in the book story let stop giving robert jordan our money for trash."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Those who borrow or purchase this book in hopes of finding some sort of resolution are going to be sorely disappointed. The mass is devoted to twists upon twists, and while some minor points of contention are resolved here, the lack of any sort of major resolution is something of a disappointment.Now please do not mistake me for the one of the reviewers clamoring for Jordan to finish with the Last Battle and be done with this series. I am still astounded by the sheer scope of the world he has painstakingly created for us. Characters are wonderfully dynamic and marvelously complex. Within the framework he has created Robert Jordan has allowed for a myriad of possible resolutions, and in doing so has far exceeded any contemporary scope or vision.Jordan's latest book takes another huge step in that direction. More time is spent getting inside the heads of characters that were little more then side notes in earlier books. We finally begin to witness some tiny side dramas that Jordan has hinted at over several books being played out.That said, I have three major points of frustration regarding this book.1. You almost need to make your own plot diagram to keep it all straight. Especially if the last time you touched this series was 2 years ago when Winter's Heart came out, you will find yourself paging back through old books trying to recall the significance of these seemingly minor events that are ceaselessly mentioned throughout this book.2. There is no uniting factor among the story lines. At this point, each is seemingly distinct and only barely related. I have long maintained this to be the frustrating factor behind all those who insist that this series became trash after the first three books. At that point, it was no longer an adventure of a ragged crew from the Two Rivers, but now a full blown epic tale of the fate of an entire world. While I personally am fascinated by the whole set of possibilities that opened up with this world after book 4, I must agree that the sense of intimacy the reader had with those in the book is slipping away, even among the main set of characters with which we started this series.3. The great events that have always marked the ends of each book in this series are woefully absent here, leaving the reader with the sense that he/she is being manipulated. I remember being satisfied by the battle at the Eye of the World in book 1, and later by the events at Dumai's Well in 6. I was even vaguely pleased with the Asha'man attack ending in book 8. This book had no such defining feature, just a whole new set of maybes for the next installment.In my opinion however, all this does is raise the stakes for Jordan to pull up a whopper of an ending when he is through with all of this. I for one, intend to read on, if only to see if he can manage to do it justice."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book was so bad I actually emailed Amazon asking them to consider adding &quot;0&quot; stars as a rating option"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Giant clashes are on the horizon.

He's set up so many different plot lines, and hinted at such a huge climax, that if it were me...I'd be scared.So be patient, WOT fans.

Jordan has proven he is a detailed writer at the cost of having an engaging series. More word count is spent on characters that the reader will never see again, much less care about care about.This series is becoming like a siege, I have invested the time reading The Wheel of Time and know I will tough it out.

A series that started out with a bang is continuing with a huge yawn. Jordan has apparently decided that character development is more necessary than plot, and that confusing, intricate detail is more necessary than any semblance of action. One wonders if his main goal is writing the longest novel in the history of mankind, rather than bringing any kind of closure to what started as an immensely interesting series of books. His &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; needs to have the axle greased, that flat fixed, and put into motion towards a conclusion."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Like many reviewers here, I was very disappointed in this sequel, and strongly recommend skipping it in favor of (hopefully) a better next release. Having been a diehard fan of WOT since 1990, I purchased both the e-book sequel \\"Glimmers\\" and COT when they came available, however, that finally did it for me - Mr. Jordan has to prove he can recapture the magic of the first 5 books before he gets any more of my money and time. In the early books, he started so many interesting plotlines & characters, only to later desert them for thousands of pages of useless detail and characters that no one cares about. Why, Mr. Jordan, why? You started something truly extraordinary - doesn't it make sense to finish it? Or is this a case of egomaniacal self indulgence, money, or are you simply being cruel?Interestingly enough, RJ remains unrepentant - on the Dragonmount site, there is a link to a March 13 interview where the host mentioned all the negative Amazon reviews. RJ's response: hasn't read them, and as far as the criticism, he writes WOT for himself, not his fans. So, sadly enough, I guess all we can do is vote with our pocketbooks and hope that will get his (or at least TOR's) attention and resurrect this series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Nothing happens.

What action! &lt;-- sarcasm, if you haven't caught on.I hope Robert Jordan is reading these reviews, because he has a lot to make up for with this book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've been reading the &quot;Wheel of Time series&quot; for over a decade now. The first 6 books rank with some of the greatest fantasy of all time, certainly the best in the last fifteen years. Books 7 and 8 were not as good, but they still had enough action and plot twists to keep the reader interested. I began to get a feeling with books 7 and 8 that Jordan was drawing things out, giving too much detail without moving the story line along. This has only gotten worse with the last two books, &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; and &quot;Crossroads of Twilight.&quot; At least &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; had a climactic finish with Rand cleansing Saidan. &quot;Crossroads&quot; is simply 600+ pages worth of trailer material for the next book. Perrin spends the entire book chasing Faile and doesn't even rescue her. We have several pointless chapters dealing with Elayne's political maneuvering in Andor. The rebel Aes Sedai are camped outside Tar Valon doing absolutely nothing (for several chapters!). We only get one chapter with Rand dealing with the after effects of cleansing Saidan (isn't this a rather important story line to only get one chapter in the book?). There are some interesting parts in the book, dealing with Logain, Alviarin, Mesaana and Shaidar Haran. I also thought the end with Egwene being kidnapped does set up good material for the next book, as well as the story lines dealing with alliances with the Seanchan. The possible alliance with the Black Tower and the rebels is also a good story line (we might actually get to figure out what Taim is). All in all I was disappointed with the book. I think that RJ needs to be locked in a room with a computer and not allowed out until he finishes the series. That way he might get to the point a lot quicker. Hopefully with the next book we might get a lot more questions answered and might see the end to the series. I'll be somewhat sad to see the story end, but the series is now starting to get stale."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"the show's season would be 56 episodes long"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've read this series from the first book and very much anticipated each successive volume in the series. Even so, my opinion is that you could skip this book and miss it hardly at all. Matter of fact, the next time I go back to reread this series from beginning to end I probably will. No author has any right to expect that their readers will hang with them for an infinite number of books in a series before coming to an end, but Robert Jordan clearly does because this book could best be described as a segue book. There have been segue books earlier in the series, but book 10? That is criminal abuse of your readership. If you just like reading Robert's writing then this book will be fine as you will get to visit pretty much every character for a few pages without imparting anything of great importance for any of them with the possible exception of Matt and with pretty much no loose ends tied up. The cliff hanger at the end was no doubt a setup for something to happen with regards to Gawyn in the next book, but if so its a poor plot device because all it really proves is that Egwene doesn't have the maturity to understand what an Amyrlin seat (which is a position rather like a general or any other major leader) should and should not be doing."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The biggest problem with a monumental series like wheel of time is that it takes so long to get into it (although you always feel like your building up to something spectacular). By the time you realize it's mediocre, poorly and overwritten fantasy, it's too late; you are committed to finishing the series. Thus I bought volume 10 hoping that Jordan would finally get to the point, especially after the briefly exciting progress at the end of book 9. Boy was I wrong After a 2 year wait, we are rewarded with a slow moving, plotless piece of drivel that spends 600 pages boring the reader.I am sick of Jordan's obsession with gender. Every variation of plot involves women plotting ways to put men in their place, while the men cluelessly plunder on.I cannot believe any editor would accept an author' complete lack of concise, clear, writing. An entire novel which does nothing to move the plot forward is irresponsible, sloppy, and outright rude to its readers, who will no doubt be forced to buythe next book after two more years of wait before another modest plot change.If Jordan was a true fantasy writer of any substancial talent, he could control his writing and somehow reign it in after 10 800 page novels.Crossroads of Twilight was in short a dismal disappointment."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"While I am not familiar with the &quot;bridge&quot; mentioned in an earlier review, I have certainly become familiar with the concept.

If he does not get better soon, I would tell that future reader to skip them all.If Mr. Jordan reads these reviews, bear in mind that I will not buy another book of yours again, unless I read it first at a library. I hope you decide to actually do something in the next installment - it might lead to my return as a purchaser."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"More endless conversation, more nattering women.... Oh, and lots and lots of descriptions of dresses. Worst of all, no end in sight."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It is unfortunate that Robert Jordan has realized what a money making enterprise this series is. Each book is on the bestseller list as all of us rush out to purchase them.Unfortunately, I am in this until the end. Don't get me wrong... I love this series. The first three to five books were the best fantasy i've ever read. I am ten books in, and there is no turning back. Robert Jordan is counting on this. I feel that this book is a sign of his greed. He can milk the story longer while still raking in the cash.Let me explain: This book goes NOWHERE. It takes place during the few days of the last chapter of book nine. Many of the past books have been slow with an exciting climax. I don't mean to ruin anything for you, BUT THERE IS NO CLIMAX to this book. In the end Faile is still captured by the Shaido(i find myself caring less and less...), Mat is still running from the Seanchan, The White Tower is still under seige.I would continue, but there really isn't any point.....you get the picture...NOTHING HAPPENS. There are some interesting decisions made, but we don't get to see what comes of them.Oh , also, as if there weren't enough already; MORE CHARACTERS ARE INRODUCED! I've gotten to the point where i can't tell Windfinders from Aes Sedai from Kinswomen from Wise Ones. I need to keep references around just so i can remember who is who.The only upside to this book is that all three taveren are in it for a decent amount of time, but it is a pretty small positive, as they are doing nothing.My suggestion to you is to either a)wait until book 11 comes out to read this one or b) skip it all together........"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It's hard to give a 2/5 to a book in a series I'm very fond off, yet it's hard to find any redeeming points for Crossroads. The story stops. It literally grinds to an almost full stop. Devoting a part of the book to going over the effects of Rand's actions at the end of the previous books could have been agreeable. We after all all remember where we were 9/11 or whatever. Thus, a couple of hundred pages devoted to portraying how Rand's actions reflect on other characters and what they were doing at the time sounds like a good idea.It doesn't work, however, when you devote 800 pages and nothing, nothing at all, happens.Why the 2/5 then? Well, the writing style is the same as all previous books and chances are if you liked those, you'll at least find some redeeming points.Reading this book, I had the continuous feeling that had Mr Jordan not passed away, the series would never in a million years have concluded with book 14, the pacing was simply not there."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"SLOW!.... Slow!.... Slooooooow! Absolutely no action in this installment. Dialogue, Dialogue, Dialogue. A complete and total waste of time. If you are trying to get to the final battle and haven't made it to book 10, just skip it! There is nothing in this book that is at all relevent to the story line... and you will save yourself time, frustration and you will probably get to find out about the final battle (unlike myself who just decided that if the author decided to put me thru this agony, I certainly wasn't going to submit myself to any more of it). Let me know how it turns out. If you're listening Amazon, I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have nothing negative to say about a single Jordan book, expect this one.Clearly this book was only written this way in order to extend the series further and sell more filler titles. At this point only every other book seemed to advance the story line, but this edition completely dropped the ball. The first two-thirds of the book is merely commentary on how all the main characters reacted to the ending of the previous novel. Nothing happens. Seriously. Most readers could skip this book entirely and not have an impact on the enjoyment and understanding of the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Reading through these for final time in preparation for April's release of final e-book.

Probably gonna be burned again but one can hope"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book almost broke me, it was like 13 mydraal and 13 black ajah were channeling trying to break me and it took every ounce of my will power to resist.

The life has left my eyes and I am now just a shell of a man, Damn you Robert Jordan!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As good as the last couple is about all that can be said for this book.

R.J.'s style started to slide on this book but the story line held up. I started this series by buying the first at a resale shop and was addicted by page five. It was heart breaking to lose Robert Jordan before the series ended but I loved it so much I waited for the second to final book and am about to buy the last which I hope holds up to the quality of writing he did. I did notice a change in the book 11 before he passed. It was like his style was dulled but I followed through and was glad I did. Will buy from this seller again."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan's world continues to get better and better. Very widespread with an enormous amount of characters but I found it easier to follow along with who was who better than 'A Game Of Thrones', another excellent read. Well worth the time and the money."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I enjoyed the first four books of this series, which impelled me to buy the entire series. But starting with Book V, the series became tedious. For subsequent books I simply searched for a few character names (easy to do with my Kindle) to find out what happened."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I liked most of the Wheel of Time books. I thought after the events of book 9, things would start to wrap up, but my worst fears turned out to be optimistic. Absolutley nothing happens. Except in the last 3 paragraphs of the book. Go to the library or book store and read the last chapter and you will keep current with the story."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I sincerely hope Mr. Jordan reads all these reviews. He has managed to take what he learned in Vietnam and apply it to writing i.e.; How to take a great opportunity to succeed and turn it into a 10 year war with no real ending and no winners. This book drags on for hundreds of pages building characters to sickening heights then unfortunately doesn't push them over the edge to their well deserved deaths. I am sure he is building his loyal reader base up to a final battle between good and evil but he used his readership and sucked bucks without delivering the action and excitement that made this series so good. This book is a rip off of epic proportions. I don't mind paying for a quality product but this was like reading the Ishtar sequel screen play. The only way I will read the next book is if someone gives it to me because I have bought my last."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'd just like to tell Mr. Robert Jordan: You are not getting another penny from me. NOT ONE. This is must be some sort of horrible and sick joke you are playing on the people you excited with the first books of this series.I tried, I really, really tried, but I could not finish the book. It turns out, there were so many other interesting things I could do, other than read this drivel.How much more money can he honestly think we will spend on this endless dreck? I want the time I spent trying to read this book back. Find something better to do with your time and don't read it. Well even if you do, you won't be able to tolerate it long enough to finish.Keep this up, and we'll be burning you in effigy."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I guess this doesn't really count as a review since, despite repeated efforts, I haven't finished the book yet.The first attempt was abandoned after the exhaustive effort of reading the Prologue. I took a break to read Steven Erikson's &quot;Memories of Ice&quot;. Now there's a confusing series with a whole host of characters that I enjoy reading, because in almost every chapter...something happens to the characters!My second attempt (bypassing the prologue) has stalled at chapter 9. CoT will have to wait until I finish Terry Goodkind's &quot;Naked Empire.&quot;To be honest, I can't remember what has happened in CoT up to chapter 9, except that Perrin is still wandering around in the woods looking for Faile, and Mat is tagging along with a circus holding the Daughter of Nine Moons (a character I actually looked forward to with expectation, but haven't really learned anything about...except that she's yet another in a long line of prissy, stuck-up female characters).RJ needs to give his readers some credit. Anyone who has made it this far in the series already knows that the women are concerned about their clothes and the men can't figure out the women.I'll probably eventually finish this book, if only on principle. All I can say is that I read the first 4 books in about a week and a half, and now I can barely read a page without getting bored out of my mind."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I finally got around to reading this book. I've enjoyed this series of books very much since I stumbled upon them. I can honestly say that this is the first book of the series that is complete and utter garbage, filler.The story moves nowhere. I can't even say nowhere fast because Jordan's flair for detail bogs you down and makes the reading slow.Hopefully in the next book Jordan will remember that the story is about the Dragon reborn and his two friends. I hope that Jordan spares us all the agony of another 700 page book describing what color underwear all the Aes Sedai are wearing on any given day."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have read thousands of books. This is the worst. It went no where in 700 pages and I paid twenty dollars for a lesson I will not repeat.

Who are all the new characters.; My brain is too smal to keep track.. The nuthing that happens in the book would be ok if the characters were likable. But i hate quite a number of them. Faile and the useless trio of Egwyene and Nyenne. And all the other stupid Aes Sedai who dont do anything. What nneds to be done is a drastic pruning by having some big cataclasm that kills ff 3/4 of the characters. I only had fun reading about Matt cause it was funny.Uselless book,. I ll buy the next one but i m sure i ll hate that as well. TOR should add a few asprin tablets with the book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"there is the distant possibility that, maybe, just maybe, Robert Jordan is introducing all these various storylines with a clear purpose in mind. There is the possibility that he actually keeps track of all the hundreds of characters and keeps them around for a, any, reason whatsoever. MOre likely, however, Jordan lost control a few books back and is now just swept with the tide like the rest of us, not knowing where its headed or how it will resolve itself. I read somewhere that he knows how this series will end, that this is the first thing he wrote when he started WoT. Well, this is the 10th book of the series, and he needs at least a couple more before the grand finale. I just cant believe that he needed 10, plus possibly 2 more (at least), all for providing setup to this awesome conclusion. RJ has lost his touch and vision, and it pains both the author and his readers that this series is ongoing. It is not too late to save this series, but please, take some time and think it thru before publishing book 11."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I read maybe the first 100 pages and then I skipped to the last like 20 pages. And you know what? NOTHING HAPPENED in between. The plot has not moved at all since the 8th book. I really don't understand how an 800 paged book can have absolutly nothing happening. When is this series going to end? I am going to stupidly read the next book because I want to find out what happens but if the 11th book is like the 10th I can read a synoposis or a few pages and find out exactly what happened. I can not even put my frustration into words. If you take my advice don't waste your time and read the book. Just skip to the 11th book and you won't be lost at all."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If you're looking for a book with magic, action and adventure then keep looking. If you're interested in a book where women spend a lot of time either smoothing or twitching their skirts, being either red faced or stone faced then this is the book for you. Jordan peaked at book 3 and frankly anything after book 5 is not worth reading. If you're a Jordan fan then save your money and get it out of the library. If you're not a Jordan fan then don't bother reading this book because nothing happens. You can go from book 9 to book 11 without missing a thing. The only reason this book was 680 pages long instead of 60 was so Bob could bank another cheque instead of actually writing a true fantasy novel. This is not good fantasy don't let anyone convince you otherwise. Read Guy Gavriel Kay's &quot;Fionavar Tapestry&quot; trilogy instead."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I had a hard time with this book the first time through and rereading the series wasn't looking forward to it but must admit I breezed right through it for the most part the 2nd time. I really don't think it is much different than the book preceding or following it, the storylines progress slowly in all three. There are complex plots with the Aes Sedai especially and Jordan wasn't afraid to take the time to tell the story the way he wanted, kind of like Kevin Costner. You kind of have to give up keeping track of the different Aes Sedai and just try to keep the central thrust of the narrative in mind. I have many of the same gripes other reviewers have but for anyone paying attention there are so many rewarding little moments in these books that I can't hold Jordan's idiosyncrasies against him. He really cared and went to such lengths to give (nearly) all 3000 characters individuality to enrich his creation. I love the Tuon character and her backstory especially, she is a great foil for Mat who was probably Jordan's favorite character. I also enjoy Egwene trying to play politics with women 5x her age, it is somewhat believable that a young woman could pull off some of the things she does with a little help from her friends. The only character I really don't care for is Elayne and her quest to become queen, why oh why was that plotline allowed to develop and creep on for three books or whatever it is. Jordan was just fascinated with every facet of medieval times apparently. Anyway if you are into Jordan's world the way he wanted you to be this is a good book. If you are just hanging around for exciting action sequences this is a frustrating read."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This was the fastest I ever read one of the Wheel of Time books. I read one line than skipped fifty pages of useless discriptives.What was worse, I was listening to the book and kept my finger on the fast forward the entire time and never had to go back because I was afraid I had missed something important."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The other reviews have said it all, pace started to slow down 2 or 3 books ago but this 10th installment is simply empty. I have put it down 3 times now to read other books and I doubt I will ever finish it... I read the previous 9 one after the other but I won't buy the 11th until I see a lot of positive reviews."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Crossroads of Twilight is not the strongest book in the Wheel of Time series. That said, it is essential for further plot development in the series. This was the next to last volume written by Jordan alone prior to his demise. Once again we follow Rand, Matt, and Perin in their adventures away from the Two Rivers, all maturing and focusing on the needs in front of them. Three and one half stars. Recommended."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If you had more money than what you need, or less than there is enough and is contemplating buying this book ... i would strongly suggest to donate your hard earned money away.If the whole WOT series is a journey of a thousand miles, this basically puts you about 3 steps away from Book 9. I am into character building .. but really ... to this detail?The first 5 books was great, the next 4 was tolerable ... but Book 10 ..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is number ten in a long series and probably the most disappointing.

This book is almost the last straw. I'm going to wait for paperback for the next one. This book takes place practically in negative time compared to the previous installment. Jordan needs to take a page from some other authors....and finish his damn series, already!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This was not just boring, but nothing even happened.

This series started wonderfully. I was totally enthralled. Now I think the series has become as much of a chore to write as it is to read.The book was great bed time reading. It put me to sleep in 15 minutes without fail.Perhaps Robert Jordan should take a page from Michael Jordan and just retire."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"First, let me say that I love the WOT series and I think that Jordan is a very good writer. He has created an incredible universe of the mind. However, I think that he has no idea how to finish this story. The book is almost complete before Rand even makes an appearance! I have students who don't know how to finish a paragraph and just start rambling on, sharing everything they know about the topic without being able to wrap it up. This book makes me think of them. I'm getting the distinct impression that Jordan either doesn't want to leave or can't find a way to leave the WOT universe."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Very dissappointed in this book. It did not go anywere. I thought the one before this one did not go anywere but I was wrong. The first half of this book takes place before the end of the last book. Then the last few chapters just updates a few chars. I think we progressed two weeks past the cleaning of the male half of the source. Very Disappointing... :("},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am a huge WOT fan and I think Robert Jordan is an great writer. This book has long been anticipated by his fans. I was disappointed with the book. Not to give any of it away, but it did not advance the plot too much."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"while this book wasn't as good as jordan's usually are, but it was still good. one of the other reviewers said that they thought the past three books were horrible, but i have to disagree. Crossroads was slower than the previous ones, but this series takes place over a long period of time and there's always slow points in long streaches of time. i greatly look forward to the next step in the Wheel Of Time."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have defended Jordan again and again and again. Yes, the first 6 books of this series are phenomenal. There has been a much slower pace in 7, 8 and 9, but they were all worth reading, if a bit frustrating. The climax of Winters Heart was great, and seemed to indicate great things to come very quickly. Unfortunately Crossroads of Twilight, as so many others have eloquently said, is a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. The story advances only a fraction - he could have done it in 5 or 6 chapters, had he wanted. But no. We get long, drawn-out descriptions and little conversations and details that mean nothing. Especially in the Elayne segments. What happened to the forsaken? We only get a brief and ho-hum storyline involving one of them. The \\"climax\\" could have happened at the beginning of the book, and set the stage for an exciting Book 10... but no. Now we have to hope all of this \\"Setting-Up\\" results in a return to form in Book 11.... 36 months from now!!!!Sheesh.That being said: everything that happens in this book is logical, and has to happen for the story to progress. I don't even mind it being long, the longer the better I've always said - as long as SOMETHING is happening.I won't say DON'T READ IT, because some of it is very good and interesting and well-written. Just don't expect anything earthshattering, or any major developments. You could pretty much go straight from Winters Heart to Book 11 without needing more than a cursory summary of what happened in Crossroads of Twilight for it to make sense."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Once again Robert Jordan disappoints with &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot;. I have been an avid Jordan reader since the beginning and its clear that the quality of his books has gone downhill. If I hadn't read the prior nine books, I would surely not start reading Jordan now.There is very little plot advancement in the Crossroads of Twilight. Rand doesnt even appear until the very end and you only get a glance at Nynaeve. I can't believe it took him nearly three years to write this book! One bright spot is that Crossroads of Twilight is not as bad as Path of Daggers. Wait for the paperback or check it out from the library, its just not worth it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I found myself very disappointed with book 10 when I finished. Jordan's wordiness usually entices me, but left me hanging this time. Jordan put massive amounts of description into what women were wearing, or their facial expressions, etc. and came out with a very wordy book with really nothing to say. There was really no forward movement in the storylines making it seem like this book is simply a means to make money and continue to stumble this series forward to no end. His portrayal of women leaves much to be desired with a constant view of females being catty, sly and full of ulterior motives. Even the end (where all the books usually pick up) was a yawner. I feel I wasted time in this text and am not going to recommend the series to anyone else until Jordan shows as much passion for the story as in the past. I think it's gone on even too long for him."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The book was the slowest ever! The women you want to strangle; and where was Rand and Nyneave in the story. Nothing happened! We were left hanging for the last two books. RJ leave out some of the background and move the story on."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Several years ago, the publisher sent me a paperback copy of \\"The Eye of the World\\" in response to an enquiry about a series that had ended. This started an exciting journey that now threatens to become an endless trek. The first three books were outstanding, the next three very good, but with this book the series is officially a soap opera where nothing happens, despite all the words. At this rate, it will take another 14 books to tie up all the plot lines and foreshadowed events. What a shame that many authors today ruin great series by trying for the security of a lifetime job."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan continues the Wheel of Time saga, but in such a long, slow, frustrating manner. Each book that comes out is in larger type with more spaces between lines, to give the illusion that it is as long as previous editions. In this book almost nothing happens. Most of the book is spent around the time that Rand cleanses saidin from Winter's Heart, and only advances a few days of time beyond that.The book is divided into at least six sections, with only a tiny amount of time spent with any given character. Too many people doing too little. Jordan really needs to start wrapping this story up, or take a page from George R. R. Martin and start killing off main characters.Wait for the library to read this one, unless you want to complete your collection. This one's a yawner."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"While I can't claim that this volume had much less plot advancement than the last one (Winter's Heart), it had very little to speak of indeed. One wonders if Jordan, at the current rate of plodding will live to see the final volume published.Mat/Tuon and Perrin/Faile make up a great deal of the tale, but in the latter case I almost wish they hadn't. So little advancement happens in the Faile &quot;rescue&quot; that I almost kicked the book out of an open window in a Perrinesque blood rage. Mat and Tuon hardly do any better in the circus, but at least they can (occasionally) talk to each other - Perrin is largely limited to talking to himself. Egwene's portion is no better: same-old Hall politics and minor (A'Rangar) subterfuges do not an engaging read make. Even her final cliffhanger is both predictable and exasperating.Certainly, one of the aspects that originally made the series endearing (the male-female interactions) has rapidly become tiresome. It is one thing for a character to muse at length about the incorrigibility of fe/males when they are inexperienced, but it seems downright inappropriate after they've led armies and slaughtered thousands, personally. Don't get me wrong, these aspects do not need to be removed - they simply need to take up proportionally less SPACE so that the plot can be advanced.On the face of it, significant events will occur and the plot will be advanced greatly, come the next volume. Of course, this is what was said last time. After 4000+ pages, the pace of the story is decelerating. Not a good sign. Jordan does not want to give up the universe he has created, and in so doing is slowly cheapening it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Coming from Goodkind's last bad book, &quot;Naked Empire,&quot; the first three hundred pages of &quot;Twilight&quot; read fairly well, but suddenly everything slowed. Much of the novel is a reaction to the previous novel and Rand barely appears. This is a cross road indeed, with little direction or choices made by anyone. So much of the novel seems like a diversion, with new minor chracters that seem very unrelated to the saga's plots. By the end of the novel so few things happen, they could be summed up in a short pargraph, which is disappointing in a novel of this length. I may or may not continue reading this series, but this is the last book in the series I will pay for. The page turning days in this series are long gone."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I assume these books are a cry for help. Mr. Jordan is being held hostage by his sniffing, broad-bosomed, shawl-twitching harridan of a wife and is begging for rescue by sending out massive descriptions of the horror which is his life. Apparently he's hoping someone will send a metal file in a box of tea. Meanwhile his editor keeps letting him do it, as she knows that after reading this glut of wasted words nobody wants him walking around loose in any case."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Many, many reviewers have already lamented CoT's lack of plot development and bad writing, so I won't beat that horse. I started this series when I was a young teenager, and I loved the first few books. They were engaging, things happened, and it was a satisfying reading experience.I'm past thirty now. My tastes have changed, but I still hold dear the fantasy genre even though I'm now well past the target demographic of pimply, slightly overweight gamers pulling all-nighters hopped up on soda and cheap pizza. My advice to those young elven rangers and giant-killing dwarves out there is to save your money on this series. Get the Wheel of Time series at your local library and buy different books from amazon, books that are worth the money. If we stop buying Jordan's schlock, maybe he (or his editors) will grab a clue, buckle down, and end this increasingly irrelevant tale."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This has got to be the worst book yet in this series. I am sure that Mr. Jordan is just putting words on paper to sell another book. He has lost all support from his readers. Each successive book is worse than the others. They are dragging the reader along. Mr Jordan must love to make up female names and describe them in boring details. That is how he gets 800 pages of nothing. There is no action in this book. There is very little continuation of the story. Give it up Mr. Jordan and finish the story. Any future readers should skip this book entirely. Unless Mr. Jordan plans to finish the story in the next book, I would recommend skipping the next books also."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I just finished a new Spenser novel by Robert P. Jordan called \\"A Back Story\\". This book is double spaced, printed in a very large font, and has truly massive margins. Yet, Mr. Parker manages to tell a complete story including an actual ending in only 291 pages.My idea is this: let's take The Wheel of Time away from Robert J. and give it to Robert P. Rand would pick up Lan, Perrin, and a couple of Asha'men, toddle off to Shayol Ghul, kick some Forsaken butt, save the world, and be home in time for dinner. Of course Rand would have to cook because Susan, I mean Min, can't cook.Wouldn't it be grand!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I read the book when it first came out, even though I agree that the first few books were excellent and the latest have just been average.This one was terrible. The book starts developing an interesting sub-plot with Perrin chasing after an abducted Faile, and just when it gets suspensful and interesting we switch to another more confusing and less intriguing sub-plot.Never fear, right? We'll sooner or (much) later get back to the Perrin/Faile crisis, wouldn't you think? WRONG!!!! The book finishes the second and third sub-plot and forgets it even started the first one!Maybe this is no reflection on Jordan's writing abilities. Maybe the publishers insisted on deadlines or something and that this was a team effort in the making. We can only hope.I'd like to see Jordan return to form and head towards a conclusion. He could probably get it done in two books or less as long as he decides to do it.Until then, I'll stick with Terry Goodkind's novels . . ."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"if i could i would have rated this book zero (that is, 0) stars. why? well, if you read the first book of the wheel of time (the eye of the world), then read the last installment, you will see what i mean.nothing is going on.nothing happens.robert jordan has either run out of ideasor he is planning to brainwash wot readers into waiting and waitingor he is purposely trying to torment peopleor he is subconsciously trying to torment peopleor he has lost sense of his original, unique style......anyway, whatever is happening with this man, the wheel of time, like one person mentioned, turns way too slowly.i also want to add my opinion that i have lost all respect for female characters.elayne reeks. when will she die?faile is worse. no, actually, perrin is.just one question: in the jacket summary of the eighth book, the path of daggers, it says that &quot;perrin will sell his soul to save faile&quot; or something like that...WHEN HAS THAT EVER HAPPENED?anyway, things are too inconsistent and repetative.the glossary is dull, and why put one when obviously people would not (heaven forbid) read this book first.bottom line: burn this book.

But we all know the second book 11 comes out we'll pay the $25 and buy it. Well, here's a crazy idea. Don't! Sure, we want to know what happens, but that's what libraries are for. Until RJ starts to feel the burn in his wallet he's got no reason to improve the quality of the drek he's been spewing for the last 1600 pages."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is not a review of the book so much as a review of the state of fantasy &amp; sci-fi literature. We have a problem here my friends...a problem perpetuated by us, the fans. We are continually fed endless series by nearly every popular author for the sake of the allmighty dollar. The only person getting fulfilled by reading these bloated works are the author and the publisher. We, the fans, are forced to wade through up to 10,000 pages for a story that could (conceivably) be accomplished in a tight 600 page novel. Ask yourself: When was the last time you read a standalone fantasy novel?Yes I own the books, but Robert Jordan (and Tor) is one of the leading offenders in this area. Make a stand and stop buying fantasy &amp; sci-fi series that end up turning into mindless drivel after a few books. These people (and companies) are publishing books merely for the sake of publishing and making money...not to tell us a story."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Painful to read. Nothing happens. No end in sight to this series, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This could have been a five-star book. I fully understand the disappointment of many of the reviewers who felt unsatisfied after reading this book. Jordan's storytelling abilities are just as good as they have always been - you really get into what he is talking about - but then he leaves you hanging. His story has gotten so large, with so many characters, that it is almost as if each character gets only one chapter before we are moved on to the next. With so many subplots, the reader just begins to remember who Jordan is describing and then he starts in with a different character. This is a large book that needed to be twice as long, or with half as many subplots. Mr Jordan really needs to put out a new book in this series every few months (not years) in order to keep people happy with this type of sprawling epic."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"WOT started out as an exciting fantasy series with interesting concepts and characters. It has been reduced to a muddled soap opera that progresses so slowly it cannot be called WOT but should be called Week in Review. Do not bother to read any more of this series. Pick a great fantasy trilogy, of which there are now many, and leave Jordan to fleece the brainwashed WOT fans, if there are any left out there (poor creatures!)"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"OK let's just ignore 99% of the cast of thousands,resist the temptation to drag in another battalion of new characters and wind this series up. I'll bet it could be done in two more books, max. Not a whole lot happens in this installment."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was loyal even after that last piece of fluff he wrote because at least at the end something had happened. This was garbage. I read this the day it came out and will never buy another work of his again. The only excuse for this waste of paper is that he wants cash- he won't be getting mine. If he wants to be compared to Tolkien, then maybe he should have read it. Tolkien never wrote the background of most characters in the books, nor told us anything of them except was absolutely necessary for HELLO!!! the STORY TO PROGRESS. They were kept brief or stuck in the appendix at the end of the Return of the King. The last two books of the this series has had ONE relevant event to the story and that is about it.Suggestion, if you want to read a great book series with action read Martin's Song of Fire and Ice series as recemmended elsewhere. And if you want to read a series with a great background and mythology, written properly, read the Silmarilion released by Tolkien's son. That is a proper mythology."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Don't waste your time or money. The plot has yet to move significantly since book 4. The 1,000,001 character was introduced at the beginning of the book, only to have the character ignored for the rest of the book. It seems the only way to get him to finish the story is if people stop buying. So long as people keep buying, he will have no incentive to advance the plot. I wish I had my money back."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Really, how could he have possibly released this?? How can he have so little respect for his fans to sell this mess? Nothing happened to any of the characters that couldn't of been told in a page or two.

Please, everyone- Pretend it stops at book 8."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This series could have been great. It's worthless drivel at this point.

Martin's 'Song of Ice and Fire' series instead for a real fantasy saga."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is a waste of money and time. Robert Jordan spends about 700 pages telling us the status of most of our favorite characters. We spend a while with Perrin as he continues to follow his wife, Faile. We visit Mat as he continues to successfully hide Tuon from the rest of the Seanchan through two rather risky periods. We spend a while with Egwene and it is made clear that the cause of her headaches is related to Hakima (for those few who didn't catch on in book 9... or 8). We visit Elayne and Avienda very briefly. Elayne is still pregnant. A few people know. Nothing else happens. Not a single story line progresses. This is a very frustrating book if you are looking for action or resolution to at least one story line."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan started the Wheel of Time like he was Tolkien, or at least Terry Brooks. Accolades arrived, followed shortly by an epic editorial lapse (even by epic fantasy standards).With this book, the last, and the one before that, he's aspiring to become the Henry Darger who lucked into a publishing contract.Mr. Jordan's continually peculiar fixations and minor perversions do, however, give me hope that someday the uncensored (and unedited, naturally) &quot;writer's cut&quot; will emerge."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book begins to explore the complicated relationship between Mat and Tuon, which, Mat believes will inevitably lead to their marriage, Tuon begins to see Mat as more of a companion and looks for omens to tie them together. The conflict between Perrin and the Shaido for possession of Faile comes to a cunning conclusion with a couple of twists that Robert Jordan likes to give the reader to think about. This whole series is just a wonderfully written epic that will live forever, even though RJ was taken before he could finish his masterpiece. I have read and re-read these books over the years, each time a new one would come out I would start from book 1 (now I start at New Spring) and fall in love with them all over again. I am impatiently waiting for the final book to come out on Kindle so that I can once again follow Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Nynaeve, Elaine and all the others on their intricate journey through life as brought to us by a master, PEACE to you RJ."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I could have asked for a lot more.... errr... less pages, but more action. As many other reviews have said, this book is a waste. I hope Mr. Jordan does his series justice as it comes to a close. Thus far the first half of the series has been 10 times better than the second half is turning out to be."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan's WoT used to be my favrite series - until I discovered George R.R. Martin's Fire &amp; Ice series. Anyways - the WoT has dragged on for at least the last 3 books. I was expecting this to be the last book and that the conclusion and great build up was going to make this the book that brought the series back on track. I like these side plots, but I also like to spend my money wisely. If you're a die hard fantasy fan like me and enjoy Jordan's WoT, this book will be in your collection, but it wo'nt be remembered.It is enjoyable only in that we get to be with these great charectors again."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm not going to write a detailed review.

The initial promise of a series for the ages starts petering mid-season. However, hope still exists for a strong finish, only to be dashed by being humiliated loss in a must-win game. But, the shortstop still goes home well paid and the fans are left with their wallets a little lighter and their hearts a little heavier."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I borrowed this one from the library. As most of the other reviewers have said this book does nothing to advance the plot. There have now been three &quot;set-up&quot; books with no advancement (plot, character, ect). But you do get a lot of drivel about the thread count of the pillows that a weaver in a small fishing town (that a major character has never been to or heard of) makes. Ohh, tell us more you great sage. Didn't something major happen in an earlier book that was incredibly important (hint: the taint) and you hear almost nothing about it! With all the genius that the major players are supposed to have, they act like spoiled brats with a power complex. At this point I'd like to see the Dark Lord and the Foresaken take over the world and reduce the world to ash so we're not exposed chapter after chapter of who said what to whom and what clothes someone is or is not sweating in or smoothing.Skip this one or borrow it from the library."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have no idea what is going with Robert Jordan. How did such a great series nose dive so badly? I used to rush to the book store the day a new WOT book came out. This book is sooooo slow that I found myself skimming chapters until finding something even slightly interesting to read. After about half way through and *zero* happening I stopped reading, which I never do. I just couldn't take the pain any more. Reading this book is like watching grass grow - except not as exciting. I'm all for character development but he spends paragraphs and paragraphs talking about completely irrelevant details that don't contribute at all to the plot.I'm sure this book turns out just like the last book where nothing happens for the entire book until the final chapter where there's a bunch of fights and action. Maybe I'll read the final chapter when the next book comes out if the reviews indicate that something actually happens in the next book.Don't bother with this one, unless you enjoy reading mind numbing things like the dictionary."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have been reading Robert Jordan's books for years and this book was a big let down. He could have written a 50 page version and that would have been better. He would expound upon the most trivial details for pages and pages for no apparent reason. The only reason I kept on reading was that I have too much invested in this series and have grown very fond of the characters that the writer has stopped developing in any significant way. I think he has to get a better editor."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What is Jordan thinking. He is taking longer and longer to write less and less. I've been a huge fan since book one, but this book was terrible. When the series is supposedly wrapping up soon, Jordan keeps adding new characters. It's ridiculous, I feel like I need to take notes to keep track of everyone.If you like the first few books in this series, read George RR Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" insted."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"About this book:This book is mostly the same as the last seven in the series (both good and bad.) Incredibly however, the pace of the story has slowed even further down. The only real high point was the 4 sections (not necesarily chapters which Jordan makes not intelligent use of)on Mat and Perrin (2 each) but there is no action of any kind and really no other important events/characters that couldn't have been added in a later volume outside the core work.About the series:To compare this series to the Lord of the Rings is not altogether silly. However, this series is really more like the Lord of the Rings if Tolkien had spent the hundreds or thousands of pages to fully detail the story of Golem, Sauron, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, Elrond....in the middle of the books. When all is said and done I am going to rip out every page from this series that has to do with Rand, Mat, and Perrin (the original &quot;key&quot; players) and bind them into an awesome trilogy. All the other characters and events are occasionally interesting, but not all that important outside of their involvement with the three main characters."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Don't get me wrong.I have become one of the many loyal readers enthralled with the Epic Adventure that places you right in the midst of the fantasy lives & events throughout the series. I've journeyed with thousands of others through every smile, every laugh & giggle, and even sometimes through a tear or two. But I almost couldn't wait until the end of the book, and I also skipped a few pages where the text just seemed to drag-on (no pun intended).To my astonishment there was not even a single battle that I was aware of, and I am VERY sad to say that CoT could EASILY have been left out altogether and not even missed!!!R.J. I hope the next book redeems you."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book could have been knocked down to a forty pages and not lost a thing. The writing is slow and boring, the action non-existent, and the main character (the one who this WHOLE story is about) is in all of about 10 pages.Disappointed does not begin to describe my feelings. The only reason I finished this drivel was on the off chance something interesting would happen at the end. (It doesn't).Mr. Jordan &amp; TOR books owe a big apology to all their fans."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I don't know what happened to the Wheel of Time series, but the last few books have been largely a waste of time. I agree with a lot of the other viewers who state you can skip this book and just read a summary. I am terribly disappointed that Robert Jordan has managed to completely derail the excellent story he started his series telling."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series is my personal favorite series. I have read the entire series 4 times. Well it was until this book. Does he ever plan on ending it? The first 400 pages are about what was happening in the world at the end of th last book. At least he finally got back to Mat, but too little to late. To make a long story short, this book was by far the worst one in the series. Don't buy it in Hard Cover."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":":::SIGH::::What a big disappointment!

In that case the plot would be moving at a more acceptable pace.This is was good series. And still is."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have only one thing to say to Mr. Jordan, move the story along at a faster pace. It is so incredibly frustrating to wait so long for each book to come out, and to then be so disappointed by the last 4 books. Please listen to all your readers and write the story like you did up until &quot;A Crown of Swords&quot;, because I for one am fast losing my patience with the plodding pace of the last 4 books and if the next one isn't great I will no longer be reading the Wheel of Time series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book has only been out since last tuesday but yet there are already 49 reviews by customers. I must say when I finished this book I was dissappointed. One review that I read said it all &quot;Half of a book&quot;. That is exactly what it was. The book set up a whole lot things. However many of things that it set up I was for sure would resolved in this book. I throughly enjoyed the first seven books. The 8th book did not satisfy me while ending of the ninth book was in my opinion one of the best endings so far and it easily made up for the rest of the book. After rereading the 8th once the 9th came out I did however change my opinion of it. The next book could absolutely be one of the best books by Jordan if he chooses to resolve some plots and cut out so many of the details. Perhaps his publishers are pressuring him to keep writing more and more and that's why it's taking so long. I love long series, however I do not love long waiting periods. If I already had the next book to read then this book would have been just fine however since we most likely have 2 yrs to wait for the next one.....Maybe more because Robert Jordan is supposedly going to rewrite &quot;A New Srping&quot; and publish it next year. I wish he would instead just finish the 11th book. This book definately left me wanting more(but that's becasue there was little resolution). It did leave us with a lot of speculating and wondering what's going to happen next.Or maybe just maybe this is only the first half of the 10th book and because it was so large they had to put it in two separate volumes like they are doing with first book now. Yeah right I wish..................."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It was not worth the wait.The whole book happens within a very short span.A slow slow book.I think he took the extra time to write the last 3 chapters.Thats all that was upto mark"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"RJ needs to really pick things up. I have been a total WOT fan since the series began. It's realy difficult to wait 2 years to find out whats going to happen next and continually get disappointed in the results. This book is very short compared to others in the series (perhaps that is a good thing as it means less of the monontonous diatribe we have been subjected to thus far).Going back in time with the series his first 3 (maybe 4) books were great and hinted at a wonderful and rich plot made very complex by the great number of characters and increasing number of subplots. After book 4 though things slowly went down hill, there was increasingly more time spent with character introspection and unnessasarily over detailed descriptive writing, plus alot of the self reflection done by the characters was a way for Jordan to reiterate events and knowledge already learned in the previous installments. This book is no different in the trend and has actually gotten worse.Jordan could have easily condensed the extra garbage in the last book and made Winters Heart climax into a mini climax, condensed this book and added it to the last and actually would have had a decent book. His decision to cut off where he did in book nine didn't leave enough material here so there is alot of fill inbetween the really important stuff.Here is one fan hoping the wrapup to this series harkens back to the beggining style of writing us fans enjoyed. Give us alittle more action for God sakes and spare us the uneeded ...."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I do not recommend this book at all. You are better off reading chapter summaries. This book goes no where. It is one big prologue. Book 9 left off with some real good subplots that should have been drawn out in this book, but nothing happened. Nothing was answered. Only more questions came up. This is a fantasy series and this book was nothing in the realm of fantasy. Save your money. Robert Jordon has lost his tough. Im sticking to free chapter summaries for the rest of this epic. I want to find out what happens to Rand and crew but not at RJ's drawn out money hungry drab. Tor and RJ should be ashamed."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've stuck with RJ through thick and thin. Like most people, I was a little frustrated with the slow plot movement of the last few books, but I also stood up for RJ, claiming the he was simply trying to make a more realistic world. And, well, isn't real life boring sometimes? But I must say that I was quite disappointed with this title. As other reviewers have said, virtually NOTHING of importance happens in this book. Some decisions are made, but the repercussions are not seen. The major events of &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; don't even play a minor role in this novel... in fact, most of the characters don't even know what happened yet! I really had my hopes up for this book after the climax of &quot;Winter's Heart,&quot; but they weren't realized. Of course I will continue to read the series, and I look forward to the next book in the hopes that it will be more along the lines of the first 5 or 6 books. I just hope it won't be TOO long of a wait this time!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have been a fan of The Wheel of Time series for quite a while. Unfortunately, the quality of the books has declined quite a bit since Lord of Chaos. Robert Jordan's detailed descriptions, which originally were interesting and helped move the plot forward in the early books, have degenerated into long-winded and quite predictable blatherings that do little to advance the plot of the books.I would like to suggest the RJ change the title of the series from The Wheel of Time to &quot;As The Wheel Turns&quot;. Certainly Mr. Jordan has discovered the daytime soap writer's gift for dragging out the smallest event into entire chapters.-Jim"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well, I had hoped that this book would not be a continuation of the painstakingly slow pace that has been set in the last several installments, but it is. I haven't finished it yet, which is surprising in itself since I couldn't wait for this book to come out, but I am about 500 pages into it and I can concur with the other reviews that nothing has happened yet. I wish I could say differently, but there you have it. 500 pages of, in some cases, absurd detail that really doesn't have any bearing on the story. I love the detail of the world RJ has created, but there are pages describing unimportant characters and what they are wearing, and there facial expressions. . . etc. These are the skimming parts, which is something new to me. I usually read every single word ... but this is the first book, besides text books, that I have skimmed over to get to the more important parts. The first books in the series were full of action and moved along great, with a nice climax at the end that kept you fulfilled while whetting your appetite for the next book. I am now joining the ranks who wish RJ would just finish this so we won't have to continue reading these ponderous books each time a new one is released. Obviously I will continue to purchase the books as they are released since I have spent the last ten years reading and waiting for the next one, but I hope the next one, as I did with this one, moves the story along.So, in conclusion if you are looking for a new series wait till this one is finished and then start from Book 1 \\"The Eye of the World\\". The series is worth reading, but would be better if you didn't have to wait three years in between books to be disappointed by the next installment. If you are like me and have invested a lot of time reading and waiting and rereading then I'm afraid you'll just have to suffer through this one and hope the next is better. Hopefully in the next book RJ either kills off some characters or brings the ones he has together so he can talk about them all at once and move a little further done the road to the end.Sorry I couldn't put a better spin on this, but it is what it is."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If you're reading this I'll assume you've kept up with the other books in the series thus far. If not, for your own good DO NOT start from here. To be brutally honest if I had started the series with this book I would not have considered going all the way to the library to pick up another from this series, let alone purchasing them (as I have every book so far). In my opinion, Jordan can be faulted for some stagnant plot thus far in this series, but with a series this complicated and entertaining, you're willing to plod (perhaps skim) through a certain amount of truly boring development to see just where it is that Jordan is leading you to. And until this book, I've been truly impressed. Here's where I officially became disillusioned with this series however. I read through..what? 6..8..maybe 10 hours..was that all it was? and finished the book realizing that a 30 page summary would have entirely encompassed everything that was worthwhile reading in my mind, not to mention saving 2 years of wait for this book. So little happened! Other reviewers have mentioned it as a lead into the next book...of course it was to an extent, but if you completely skipped this book, would you even wonder what you had missed when you got to the next book? I dont think I'd even realize I had missed an entire (and LONG) book in between! How is this possible? Other than maybe 15 pages of strong (and I admit, enjoyable) development between Mat and Tuon, and maybe 12 pages of further development of Egwene (not enjoyable by any means)and her relations as Amyrlin &lt;sp?&gt; - other than that I felt that NOTHING happened.. (yes I know it was more like 100-150 pages of Egwene, not 12, but I think I'm probably being optimistic in saying that there was 12 pages of NECESSARY, useful or even entertaining development. Oh yes, I almost forgot ;-) Perrin chases down Faile for..100? pages or so, never actually sees her, but he does buy some grain that has weevils (parasites) in it from some hick town...which leads me to believe that perhaps the weevils are now going to become the main focal point of the next book, since there was more content on them and how to remove them from grain than there was on Rand throughout the entirety of the novel. It seemed as if one of two things happened in this novel: 1- Jordan wanted to show that he could still get millions or readers to buy and read one of his novels due copletely to his past writings, and in no part actually due to THIS novel being worth reading or.. 2-Jordan wanted to test the waters to see if he could actually make this THE neverending story, by never resolving any of the 1000's of pages of foreshadowing and plotlines that have led us this far.. Is this what we have to look forward to 2 years more waiting with the possiblity of another book like this one at the end of it? If so, I hope Mr. Jordan is in miraculous health and outlives every one of his current readers so as to have some small chance of actually finishing this series. I for one am beginning to wonder if I will ever reach the end of it, which would be fine in my books as long as it kept me entertained in between, but if not..then the series just went from something I enjoy thoroughly to something I find myself dreading..(as I did every time I picked up this novel to try to reach the end) ;-) yes- a little melodramatic certainly but I DID mention I was disillusioned..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book goes nowhere! Non of the loose-ends from book nine were tied in this book. In fact, you could skip it entirely and not miss anything. The book had no conclusion what-so-ever and feels like the first half of a much longer edition. I hope Jordan has already written the second half and will be releasing it soon!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I love the Wheel of Time series... or at least the first six books. The first six are wonders of plot advancement, detail and excitement....Crossroads of Twilight goes nowhere. It is, literally, two weeks, book time. The characters continue what they had been doing without any real conclusion, just working on their plans with nothing more than filler. In fact, the majority of the book is based on reactions of the Aes Sedai to what Rand and Nynaeve unleashed to cleanse the taint at the end of Winter's Heart. It would have made far more sense, and made far fewer people upset, to combine the two books. As it is, this book is fluff and filler, and I closed the book feeling like I wasted [money]. The only action occurs at the very end, and encompasses maybe 20 pages. The rest is generally talk, and a very few (small) accomplishments.Robert Jordan needs to go back to the first six books and remember the beautiful writing style that hooked so many people in the first place. ... Or if it actually advances the plot, MAYBE I'll buy it. If it wasn't for the fact that I love this series, I wouldn't have bought it at all."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Sadly, Robert Jordan returns to his style in Path of Daggers with his novel Crossroads of Twilight. He provides lots of detail on individuals, their problems, their reactions, the reactions of those around them, their clothing, the weather, their hair styles, as well as snorts, sniffs, and arms crossed under breasts. But there is little plot advancement. The best part of the book deals with Mat and Tuon and that plot advances--a little. The plot thread about the White Tower's search for the Black Ajah advances--a little. The plot thread on Egwene's seige of the White Tower advances--a little. The plot thread on Perrin's search for his wife advances--a little. By contrast, the plot thread on Elayne's effort to become Queen of Andor DOES NOT advance, despite over a hundred pages of description.I fault both Robert Jordan and his wife, Harriet for these problems, since she edits his books. He is creating a unique, 12 volume novel, which in its entirety is very good, but it has dry sections--entire books shorn of activity. Rather, he seems to be in mystery mode, where he drops clues about various mysteries, without advancing the plot. Similarily, he shows his characters growing and changing, but with little progress toward denoument.The book is required reading for those hooked on the series, but I doubt it will capture any new readers."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What a disappointment. After such a long wait for Book 10 of the Wheel of Time series, readers are stuck with nothing moving the story forward. If Robert Jordan has forgotten who his characters are, his readers have not. Spending over 600 pages to endlessly review the characters clothing and the societies details is tedious at best. The book places the characters laying siege or under siege without any resolution. Two sentences stating who was camped outside Tar Valon and for how long would have been enough. Lets move along!Where was Rand for 600 plus pages?Perhaps Jordon doesn't know where he wants the story to go and he needed Crossroads of Twilight to get his bearings. The next time he needs to spend numerous pages explaining in tedious detail how the Aes Sedai Hall comes to order, he should keep it in his working outline and spare his readers.I would recommend reading the book just to get a taste of the wonderful world that has been created in this series but save your money because it isn't worth buying.Perhaps Jordan will eventually remember who his main characters are and get them put in motion once again."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was (and probably still am) a big fan of this series. After Shadow Rising, I was convinced that Jordan was the greatest fantasy writer in history, and this was the greatest fantasy work. None of the reviews below attempt to defend Crossroads on its own merits -- for the simple reason that no such defense is possible. The book is aweful. The best that Jordan's apologists can say for the thing is that it is &quot;transition.&quot;That is no excuse for writing (or marketing) schlock. Most (perhaps 80%) of this 700-page exercise in tedium consists of minor (even tertiary) characters reflecting on the world Jordan has created, current events, and other characters surrounding them. The reading eye drowns in vast oceans of expository lump, devoid of character development, plot advancement, or anything that would remotely interest the reader. After nine volumes, we no longer care what _______-Sedai thinks of women from Arad Doman. We just want to see some resolution of the dozens of conflicts and mysteries that Jordan had so carefully crafted in his prior work.This book is an object lesson in how not to write. With the exception of about 50 pages, the rest reads like an unedited exercise in expository free-assocation, the sort of stuff that would flow uninhibited from mind to page through the simple act of Jordan's sitting in front of a typewriter. I'm amazed he took three years to write this. I could have done it in three months (or if motivated by a large enough advance, three weeks).Nothing important happens in this book. Tuon turns the tables on Mat; Perin adds torture to his newly-acquired leadership skills; Alviarin meets the Dark Lord. THOSE ARE THE HIGHLIGHTS. If Jordan had trimmed this book to include only what was necessary to advance the plot or develop characters any reader would care about, the thing would have been fifty pages long.I do not believe (as others) that Jordan is stretching things to feather his nest. I think the theme of Crossroads is that the Last Battle will effect many -- hence the vast number of minor characters (how does one keep up with so many names?) whose thoughts and fears are recorded in this work. While Jordan, as this world's creator, may find this material interesting, 99.99% of his readers will not.The good news is that things are shaping up for the next battle. A teaser of an epilogue will give even the most disillusioned fan hope that Book 11 will restore the luster to this faded gem."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"out of all 10 books, the last 4 in the series are markedly slower-paced than the first 6. out of the last 4 books in the series, crossroads of twilight was the most boring waste of time. i used to love this series - up until book 7, each book i considered brilliantly engaging and i devoured them many times over. books 7, 8 and 9 were, by contrast, slow and dull, and tedious to wade through. book 10 outdulled all three in its inanity - robert jordan goes on at length about trivial details (do we really need to know how elayne likes her tea 10 times?) and advances the plotline of the series by only a hair.i thought the series had hope and gamely trudged through 3 mediocre books to find it. now after the 4th, i am quitting. i am sorry, robert jordan, but i'm afraid your writing is nowhere near as enthralling as it once was.in short, i wasted my time with this book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I started reading this series when the first three volumes were already in paperback...I was but a lad ....now I wonder if this overblown incredibly sluggish \\"epic\\" will be over by the time I get social security in 12 years.

After that memory of who is who and what is what fades fast. To add insult to injury you expect us to shell out for a reference volume...just in case we want to go back and look at the characters and concepts you discarded...or maybe you have fogotten them too!Perspective readers beware!

Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth return again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, when the World and Time themselves hang in the balance, a wind rises in the mountains of mist . . .\\"A wind carrying despair, despair for the myriads of WOT fans, who since 1990 have spen hundred of hours, reading and rereading these books. 13 years and 10 books later what started out as a incredible good reading, have turned it to something more excrutiating than chinese water torture. I am at this point reading the series just because my incredible curiousity wants to know how it ends. I am now considering waiting for the final book to come out and just read that, like a soap opera i think I can miss a dozen episodes or so and still be on top of what is going on.The books is excrutiatingly slow, we spend hundreds and hundreds of pages hearing about life as an everyday rebel Aes Sedai, or in a travelling circus, or pursuing and ever increasing number of rebel Aiel. If anyone in this book moved at the pace of the book, and whit it seems they do, the final battle will come and pass them by, while they are still trying to figure out who is who, and if they can trust their childhood friends. And hearing about the many misunderstandings between the two sexes. Although this might be real, i think RJ should stop writing a convulated Men are from Mars, Women from Venus. The characters have evolved from what seemed to be complex well described characters with personalities, into confusing mixes of real world cliches. Buy George Martin, so far his three books are very promising and will hopefully not involve into a RJ money milking keyboard puncher. Did RJ die/disappear and a ghost writer write the last few books. Did he loose any inspiration he had, or did he grow senile and forgot how he was going to end the book.I would not consider myself an RJ basher, i have read the first six books half a dozen times atleast, bought two copies of each of them because the first set was lost in a move. I have read book 7-10 one time, and regretting it.

I feel lost in space... JORDAN, what has become of you? I think I know where you're going with this. Allow me to illuminate. Your trying to expand the story, get everyone in this fictitious world involved. You're trying to give it a more global sense. That is all well and good, but you haveforgotten one of the most essential traits that any good book worth its' weight in gold has \\"SUBSTANCE.\\" That's what's missing, no more, no less.AS S. King would say, (A fellow colleuge Mr. Jordan would do well to take notes from) \\"I cry your pardon Mr. Jordan, but a mans got to say what a mans got to say.\\" This last installment is, for the lack of a better phrase, worth its' weight in cow manure. There is nothing wrong with the adding of new characters (Even though, I think, it is was to late in a story to be doing such a thing.) God! Work some magic. Make me love them, enjoy them, or even hate them! Don't give me stale people and expect me to embrace them like long lost friends. There's a saying that goes, \\"The little things make up all the big things.\\" It is not \\"The little things make up the big things, so forget about the big things.\\" Mr. Jordan is apparently a believer in the former because that is what he has done. He is so wrapped up in the syntax of things, that he has forgotten the origin, the core, and \\"The Biggest thing.\\" Which are the people that we have grown to love; Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Nyaeve, Lan, Elayne, Min,Thom Merrilin, Rand Al'Thor and yes, even morraine. (I'm pretty sure she's not dead yet.) Yes, they are all in this book, but they feel dead to me. There's no more depth to them than there was four books ago.In closing, I just want to say that I am very disappointed in you, Robert Jordan. You have taken my trust and squeezed every penny out of it. I hope you burn in hell because that is what you have put me through. Rest assured that I would not be contributing to your bank account, with your next installment. I'm gonna cut my losses and move on. Perhaps Mr. Goodkind has not fallen to the wasting disease that you have so obviously embraced."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As an escapist reader, I rarely find myself frustrated with a work of fiction. I greatly enjoy reading the WoT series. This most recent book, Crossroads of Twilight managed to do so. At the end of Book 9 we are left with Rand having just finished cleansing the male half of the Source. One might think that this would mean we'd make significant chronological progress past this point, and perhaps have some meaningful or descriptive passages detailing the HUGE importance of this event. To my knowledge it is mentioned two or three times, none of which are given much import. Also, the entire book, 680 pages, in a very short amount of time. If the Last battle is a month away we still have another 3 books to look forward to at this rate. I will say that it was.. a fun read, but look only for more questions and more subplots which really don't add much and indicate that either the conclusion is FAR off, or that the conclusion is going to be fast, short and leave lots of loose ends. Unless you have already started collecting all the hardbacks, wait until this one comes out in paperback, or better yet get it from your local library."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"And very very disappointing. I don't know. In Winter's Heart, it seemed like the pace was being picked up a little bit (after two really slow books)and a couple of momentous things actually happened. Can someone tell me what actually happened in &quot;Crossroads&quot;? This whole series has turned into a soap opera, except that Jordan's production rate would disqualify him from working on any show.Seriously, how could it possibly take more than two years to produce this drivel? At least, if the quality of the writing is going to be this bad, Jordan should give us a book every six months!Finish the story already dammit!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"That's what you'll get. Well, you'll get a lot of nattering, tight-lipped, skirt-smoothing, whining Aes Seda, pages of mundane information, and even more splintered sub-plot lines and new characters. But hey, you've been getting that for the last umpteen books. Cripes, why do I keep reading this series? Because with each new book there's still a glimmer of hope that it will GO SOMEWHERE. But, as with the last few books it goes NOWHERE and it doesn't even get there fast. I *never* skip paragraphs when reading a book for the first time but I found myself skipping page after page in this snail fest. This is the worst so far.

Please end the misery for us all."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Like a gambler hoping for another jackpot, I keep coming back to this series looking for something like the earlier installments. They actually had action, interesting plot developments, and characters you could love or hate. Now we're burdened with too many characters, too many plotlines and sub-plotlines that it's almost impossible to keep characters straight without some sort of glossary/listing.

Other reviewers haven't done justice to how little happens in this book. There are 600 some pages in this book. If you have read book nine then you know it ended with a momentous event involving a lot of magic use. The first 500 pages of this book occur BEFORE that event and leading up to it. Basically it can be summed up as every character sensing the magic use and being scare of it.Rand, the main character, doesn't even show up in the first 500 pages.You could skip this book entirely and except for the last THREE pages you wouldn't even know you had missed anything."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I wanted to love this book, but ended up having to force myself to read it at times. Sometimes, I could not even finish a single chapter before drifting off. I know some of this has been said already, more than once, but there is a reason for it; it's true.I am loosing track of who is who and who is doing what. Okay, well, I guess I know who is doing what; they are all doing nothing. I would root for the bad guys, but they don't deserve to win either.The attempts at political intrigue were never the strong points of this series, and I wish Jordan would move on where they are concerned. They are becoming less interesting and less believable.The book was not all bad and boring, but a lot of it was a waste. Some of the chapters about Egwene were interesting, though it ended just as it started to go somewhere.I am very seriously thinking of waiting until I read all of the reviews before I purchase the next the book, if I purchase it at all; I will definitely not pre-purchase it this time.I think anyone that paid for this book should get the next one for free. It is bad enough that they are selling the previews as e-books, but now they appear to be selling an entire book as a preview; and not even an interesting one.Some say this is all setup for a future book. How much more setup do we need to pay for?A book, even as part of a series, should have a beginning, an end, a plot, and a point.

It is ridiculous filler to keep reminding the reader of the same cr...p. We are not stupid.This book also has a thousand useless characters, from maids, to soldiers to Aes Sedai and on and on and on. They don't do anything, everyone is afraid of everyone else then they disappear never to make any diffrence to the story other than pages and pages of useless descriptions.

(His real name is James O. Rigney Jr.) I have concluded he is a self-righteous, supercilious, prideful, condescending, self-indulgent, insufferable prig of a man. His latest book reflects these qualities. I believe he thinks he can walk on water. He is so in love with himself, it is disgusting. I believe Mr. Rigney could not care less what anyone thinks of his books, his writing, or the Wheel of Time series. His attitude seems to be that he is writing this whole thing for his own pleasure and satisfaction and that the public is lucky that he gives us the privilege of being able to purchase his increasingly plodding tomes.With Crossroads of Twilight, for the many reasons given in the hundreds of other customer reviews, Mr. Rigney has nothing to be proud of. Mr. Rigney has apparently twisted himself into a tangle of knots and lost the thread of the story he is trying to tell. In the process, he has endangered his legacy as a great writer and is on the verge of being figuratively tarred and feathered by the reading public that he so obviously disrespects. At his current glacial pace of plot development, the Wheel of Time series will require at least fifteen (15) more volumes to reach what will by then be its anti-climactic ending. The question is whether he will have a publisher or any readers left."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Thanks go to everyone for their reviews of this book. I'd give this book a zero if I could. I thought the first six were among the best books I've read, but the series has started to lag. It looked to be picking up again at the end of Winter's Heart, so I had high hopes for this book.I've spoken with many of my Jordan-reading friends and they all concur - do not buy this book. It's completely worthless. I'm currently reading a friend's copy and won't pick up a copy of my own until it's available at the bookstore discounted to paperback prices. I need it for my \\"collection\\", but am now wary of Jordan. I won't be buying another WoT book at list price until Jordan can prove himself.What absolute drivel; I think the man has lost his thread. I expect the next two books to be possibly the best in the series IF the plot commences again, but really. You could take books 7-10 and condense them into one long book. Nothing significant has happened at ALL in the past 5+ years of reading this series.I just hope in the end Jordan can win back his fans, but I simply don't bother to check when the books are coming out anymore.

Did anyone else notice the change in writing style? I've read literally thousands of books in my lifetime and other than Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (supposedly written by Clancy at least), I cannot remember such a drastic change of writing style from a mature author. Umm...Mr. Jordan...are you SURE you wrote this book? It really felt like you were getting the touch back with book 9, but this one doesn't even 'read' like your style. Without being sexist I think I can speak honestly and state that females in the Western cultures are far more interested in clothing styles and conversations than males, but even the women I've talked to who read book 10 all wonder if a man wrote this book; as they themselves can't even imagine being that caught up in clothing styles and descriptions. As a fan, I would ask that maybe you get a volunteer proof reader to just give the next book a 'litmus' test for interest."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"...because this dog of a series deserves it.

These characters do nothing and thus their longwinded addition to the story IS WASTING MY TIME. PLEASE JORDAN, GIVE US SOME ACTION. Why is Mat wandering around doing nothing? Perrin is equally doing nothing. Rand did nothing FOR ALL OF BOOK 10!!! We have countless women that I can't even tell apart anymore surrounding Nynaeve and Elaine and ALL THESE CHARACTERS DO IS TAKE AWAY FROM OUR BELOVED CENTRAL CHARACTERS!!! I wish I could sit down with Jordan and really have it out with him because I think he may have turned over control of the series to his 10 year old daughter.

The reviews made me expect the book to be terrible and I expected the drawn out story. This perception helped me to really try to get as much out of the book as possible.The book really is a &quot;Crossroad&quot; of decision making for the main characters. I was really impressed at the level of detail Jordan went into in the way that the characters took different pieces of information and made decisions based on the information.As always, much of the plot within the Jordan novels involves &quot;ignorance&quot; by the main characters in relation to what the other main characters are doing. Many of the problems within the novels can quickly be solved if the characters bothered to openly communicate with the other characters.Yet, Jordan's explanation of the thought process each character uses was very interesting.The main thing that makes me come back to the series is waiting for the time when the characters finally get together and discover that their intentions are the same and that their goals match in many ways. I am wondering how the characters will react once they discover this, which I hope will be very climatic.If you like delving into psychology and how people think, you may want to try to take this perspective when reading this installment."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was almost driven crazy waiting for this book to come out. I feel the book is as richly detailed as previous books and the author has seemed to pick up the pace a bit (he has done that for book 9 &amp; 10). Although I was as disappointed as the others that the story did not advance as far as I hoped, I do think the author seems to be slowly bringing in his multiple subplots and building up his momentum. In my estimation, I think the author should be able to bring everything to the conclusion within 2 or 3 more books, i.e. if he does hurry up a bit. If he gets sidetracked again, all bets are off. I have great hope for the 11th book. By the way, I was not as fed up in my waiting as the others possibly because I started this serie when he has written 7 books already.

Jordan started out great, one of the greatest fantasy writers I had read. But gradually, the story got drawn out. Until finally, book 10, the hardest book in this series to read. And while I feel I can finish this series in one short book, I will not hold it against Jordan. He has managed to do what most can't, he has created a whole other world, and filled it with creatures and characters we only see in our imaginations. He created a story that is the work of what I feel is a genius. But unless he's got something up his sleeve, it's time to end it. Either way, I'm in this till the end. I'm so into this story that I have to finish it. I can't just let it drop off, I have to know who wins. That is the work of a great story, even if it is drawn out."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"While I agree this is hardly Jordan's best in the series, We all have to remember he is human and prone to failure from time to time.

These books are twisted!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"RJ has written a better book in Crossroads of Twilight than the last 3 or 4 novels might have promised. The pace has increased somewhat! (... and there was much rejoicing) However, that is about the most exciting thing to happen in this novel, as Jordan (or his editor, whichever) bleeds trite plot through a segmented and unwieldy chapter format. One is left with the impression that RJ has already written seperate books on each of the subplots of Wheel, and has just picked a few chapters to jam together for COT - the effect feels jumbled and lack luster.With Jordan's initially superb plotting and tight writing style, the drop off into outrageously drawn out, even extraneous sequencing, is something fans keep hoping will not be present in the next book. Jordan's enormous cast of leading characters has run all over the place in Crossroads, and he doesn't give much sense of coherence to their development - again. There is only one chapter on Rand, the writing of which is trite and Aes Sedai intensive. For unknown reasons, Aes Sedai seem to be taking center stage in a series where they should occupy only a marginal piece of the spotlight - if you are looking for more daring escapades from Rand and the Forsaken in this volume, forget about it. As more than half the volume is dedicated to Aes Sedai, one is disappointed to find that their plot intrigues have stagnated in time with their assault on the White Tower - this is not remedied by the abrupt, and &quot;mysterious&quot; capturing of Egwene in the second to last chapter. With 4 chapters a piece thrown in for a throughly boring set of &quot;Matt&quot; and &quot;Elyane&quot; romantic escapades, and an overly drawn out, ineffectual &quot;Perrin&quot; resque sequence, fans can at least draw a sigh of relief over struggling through this book, and hope to return to the dynamic and intricate set of characters we have come to love in the next one.Overall - Jordan is a superb writer and this is an enormous series. The intensity, which has all but dried out of these books, is only a luke warm trickle on the tounge in Crossroads. I still believe Jordan is one of the best fantasy writers of the last decade and will faithfully follow the series - no Jordan fan should miss this book, just don't get too excited about a revival of earlier excellence. Where most of the early series left me reading till 5 in the morning and no more than two chapters in, this book could be finished in a day for all the depth required to absorb it's flavors. We applaud Jordan for kicking up the pace (even if he has to do it by skimming character development) and hope the intricate plot density will reappear in following volumes."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Was the book slow, sure. Were too many chapters spent on increasing plot lines by inches, sure. Was the main character of the series virtually non-existent, yes. With all that I still enjoyed the book.

I love reading the series, love the characters, love the world, love the way it engrosses you. The problem is the two years between books. To make the series truly enjoyable you have to re-read the whole thing. I don't have time for that anymore, but I was definitely annoyed by how many characters I could not remember because they had such minor roles in the past. Anyway, I know that this has been a rambley review (my first ever). In the end I want to say I will keep reading and enjoying every book written by Robert Jordan, but will hold a little bit of annoyance until the series is complete."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I don't care if this ever ends. Everyone's got their favorite characters, we get the postcard size updates on what's happening with them. Some we don't care if they live or die, boring drugery is their fate, and in this series, living to the next installment is a good thing. I've given up on Jordan ever actually wrapping things up, but it'll happen eventually. When it does, I have my bookshelf of the series waiting and I'll re-read it in sequence without having to wait years between the books, probably several times, and I'll get more pleasure each time I re-read it. How many series can you say that about?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It seems to me that, from the reviews I've read, many have completely forgotten what made this series such a hit in the first place. The side stories and goings on outside the main plot are what first intrigued me and many I know. Robert Jordan is not simply writing a story, he writes of the lives and happenings of an entire world of his own creation. Just as in real life, the books have highs and lows and not every page is filled with action and suspence, but still keeps the storyline going.CoT has done it's part in bringing all of the threads and different storylines together. I don't think of this as building up to a big finish, but tying off loose ends and bringing it all into focus so that the main plot may continue without leaving questions in it's wake. With all of the plots of the forsaken, intrigues of politics, and Rand's strggle for sanity, WoT takes everything in stride and attempts to keep everything going smoothly.I am sick of hearing all of the insulting and belittling between those who see and appreciate the big picture in Wheel of Time, and those who do not wish to patiently endure the parts they do not like. Certain people enjoy the small things that guide story on, and others like the big ones that rush forword. There is no need not to give your opinion in a dignified manner without letting your frustration with other people get the better of you. In lamans terms, People have different opinions than you, so shut up and deal with it.As for my actual review of CoT, I give it three out of five stars. It tells what happens with all of the main characters where WH ended. I do not like it as much as Jordans earlier books, but it is still good enough to buy. I eagerly await the coming of the next installment of a series I believe to be on par with 'Lord of the Rings' and 'The Wars of Light and Shadow'."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Crossroads of Twilight was another major disappointment compared to Jordan's earlier works. However, i think that it was much better than Winter's Heart, which contained no action up until the last hundred pages. Each of the subplots progresses, although still nothing gets resolved. The Forsaken and the Dark One seem all but gone in this book, and there is no major action whatsoever."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Ok if your this far in the series it doesn't matter what I say!! It's a great and epic series full of several parts that join to make a wonderfully written masterpiece. That being said; I want to shake the editor for not catching several typos/ errors! Continuation of Rands push to power, Perrins unwilling development as a leader, and Matt's luck."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"When the book first came out, I was ready to dislike it pretty much on principle...But I waited an extra year before reading it to let some of those bad feelings pass and you know what? It is pretty good, I mean maybe not the best of the series and I agree the pace has pretty much slowed to a crawl ( but what can you expect when there are atleast 7+ distinct storylines going at once ), that kind of number means only a hundred or so pages have been devoted to each one. I myself would feel ripped of if one or three of them was ignored or dropped. So all things considered, still a good read."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"i enjoyed this book as well as all the others in the series, this is just less action packed. either way, you should read all the books through to really get into them."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"most of the reviewers on this page have been at it since issue number 5. it's an entertainment, guys, not intellectual piece, nor a college text book that you absolutely must readd. if you don't like it just drop it. don't buy the book anymore and quit qhinning.as for the rest of Jordan fans, like myself, well ... READ ON !"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Having read the reviews and heard the word of mouth about this book, this was the first of the series that I've considered waiting until the paperback was released. Having succumbed (I figured with nine others in hardback, it would seem silly to wait now), I can honostly say that it is nowhere as bad as I thought it would be. True, hardly any time is covered and the plot barely plods along, but I have to admit that Jordan's writing continues to have me turning pages.If he could manage to pump books like this (in terms of no where plot movements) at least once a year, I wouldn't complain. Having waited years for this one though cost the book some stars."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I feel I could have skipped this book in the series and miss out on nothing. Most everyone stays in the same situation they began in. The Elayne story was boring at best. The others were okay. Some parts were written very well and others left much to be desired."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The book was slow from the beginning until only a fourth of the book was left. It started to pick up and things looked like they might get interesting, then it ended. Don't buy this book until it comes out in paperback. Seriously absolutely nothing was accomplished in this book, other than to set things up for book 11."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After reading some of the reviews for this book i had to write one myself to give it some justice. First I would like to point out that the publishers were pushing Jordan very hard to get this out quick, and on that note. The book itself is good. There really is not much to it, but if you have read the series then it has all the aspects that drew us in in the first place. It does a good job of showing us what is going on and some of the plot developments. On the other hand i too have been waiting for a while for it to come out and was hoping for much much more. Compared to some of his other books, this one is lacking some of the excitement, but it does do a good job of bringing us up to date and setting an exciting scene for book elevn."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Before I read this book, i was thinking about how the prologues in each of the WOT books seems longer than the book before... Then I read this one, a book where the prologue should be entirely deleted and the rest of the book would serve as one. While the story had not advanced significantly in this series in some time, that was fine with me because things were happening in the world that were interesting. Crossroads of Twilight, however, contains virtually nothing that contributes to the world, no events of note until the last page. Filler I can take. This book was sub-par filler."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I began reading this series as a 15 year old high school sophomore. I am now a college educated professional ( no spelling cracks please.) I have purchased every book in hardback. I have tread heavily with MAT, PERRIN, and RAND. I remember when THOM was a GREAT charachter.This series is no longer worth the hours. I used to deal with Aes Seadi whining (remember NYNEVE wishing che could channel,,or pining after LAN)but no longer.I AM DONE>>"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I came to love Jordan's style of writing early on in the WOT series. The first several installments were action packed with enough detail to keep things flowing smoothly. As the series crept on, I read reviews submitted saying how they didn't like where the current books were going. After reading the books, I completely disagreed with them. I thought each book added new life to the series, and continued the multitude of plot lines. My enjoyment continued right through &quot;Winter's Heart.&quot; And now it's come to a crashing halt. I read somewhere that the reason Jordan takes so long between his books is that he wants to make sure he has the best finished product he can write. After waiting for this new book, I expected something great. What he gave us, wasn't worth reading. And I mean that litterally! You could actually skip this book in the series, and pick up with the next book not missing a thing. Absolutely NOTHING happens in this book. The entire book could have been contained in one detailed Prologue. So, I'm left with either two possibilities, 1) Jordan's talent has declined to the point where he can't write a worthwhile book, or 2) he is dragging this series out to make as much money as he possibly can. I'd have to go with option #2, since I find it difficult to believe an author of Jordan's stature could fall so far in so short a period. Unfortunately, my negative recommendation won't stop you from buying this book, since you are already 9 books into the series. But, consider yourself warned, do not expect much if anything from this work."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After waiting 3 years to buy this book. I bought it the first time I spotted it in a bookstore. I took it home and read through all many hundreds of pages and when I completed the book, I knew nothing more than I knew after I read the previous book. This book was a big disappointment. Nothing was solved, no new details were revealed.Maybe if somebody gives me the next two or three books that it will take before the author finishes this story, I might read them, but not otherwise. Ten books is way too many for a series that builds book upon book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Quite frankly, I'm at the point of giving up on this series. The latest addition, which we've all waited more than a year for, does very little to move the story forward. For all those out there who &quot;love&quot; the way Jordan is building up to the conclusion, I have to disagree.It's becoming obvious to me that Mr. Jordan is milking this for every dime he can get out of it. The last page of the book says that he plans to &quot;continue until they nail shut his coffin&quot;. I believe it. The question should really be whether or not he'll finish the story before they nail shut his coffin.I've tried to be optimistic and I'll probably still buy the remainder of the books, no matter how many, because I buy them to read AND to add to my library. However, if I had known 11 years ago what I was undertaking (long waits between minimal plot advances and what is steadily becoming mediocre writing) I would have thought twice.Additionally, having recently starting reading the Ice &amp; Fire series by George R.R. Martin, I have to say that Mr. Martin is a far superior writer than Mr. Jordan. Martin's work is rich with detail without being overbearing. Minor characters are not fleshed out ad nauseam just for added length. Wish I could say the same about the WoT series.The bottom line here is that I would only recommend this book if you wanted to &quot;complete&quot; your collection. As far as a read, my enjoyment of this series is long past and I now see the book as just another task to complete."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The first 5 or 6 books of this series is great. They are fast, characters are developing and there is lots of new stuff to see and learn about.Ever since then it has been very very very slow. The characters and people haven't changed. All I read about it is what everyone is thinking all the time, I have heard it again and again. I know how everyone thinks. All the woman are the same, all Aes Sedai are the same, everyone's thoughts are the same! Nothing changes! 10 books of this, we don't need anymore character insight, we need action. Give us some good hardcore battles, more the story along, tie up loose ends. Quit writing about stuff we already know and have heard about, after 6 books you can ease back on the same old stuff, we get it! This book is filler. It's so painfully obvious this book and the few before it were just written to extend the series and make money as it offers almost nothing new.My new favorite author is George RR Martin. Read his stuff, it's excellent!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I LOVE the Wheel of Time series (especially the first 5 books). True, they have been diminishing in quality and readability over the past few years, but this one just takes the cake. Seriously, RJ must have bored himself to death writing this. You know what happens in this book? NOTHING. Seriously... NOTHING. A half page is spent describing WASHING A SHIRT. One character comes up to Perrin and says \\"walk with me [so I can speak to you privately]\\". Not another word is said because the next 4 pages are spent describing what in a movie would be \\"extras\\" making up the people in the camp, what each one was cooking for dinner, and whether each should spend time mending his socks. And the repetition! Oh GOD! Save Me! We Get It! Egwene is not respected as Amyryllin! Matt has trepidations about marriage, and he hears dice rolling in his head (OVER and OVER and OVER). And every single woman is tough and wants to be in control while every man is confused and clueless. We Freakin' Get It!On a positive note, Nynaeve did not tug her braid once. That's cuz she wasn't in this episode.Please Mr. J, continue the STORY! Don't turn into an old man who just likes to hear himself talk. Or are you just trying to cash in on dragging the story out? I think if that is true, it will backfire, because people are really starting to lose interest. How about this, FINISH this story then start on a prequel about the origin of the Forsaken.This whole book could have been condensed to Chapter 1 of a book. In all honesty, so little happens that when the next book comes out, if you haven't read this one, you won't have missed anything and you will be able to pick up without missing a beat."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"[YAWN]... You'd think in a book with 10 different story lines going on at once that at least one of them would be exciting. Or at least semi-interesting. The fact that I finished this 680 page sleep-fest is a true feat of sheer will power. If this guy doesn't pick up the pace soon he's going to drop dead before we get anywhere interesting. Unfortunately if you follow the series you're almost obligated to read it. Though you could probably just skip onto the next one without being horribly lost. I only gave this book 2 stars because this is my favorite series, but c'mon Jordan, let's get movin'."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This was a book that I just couldn't pick up. Crossroads of Twilight is just another in a string of bad sequals that don't enhance the storyline. i kept waiting for something to happen and it never did.I will probably buy the next book, because I've read to this point, but for Christ's sake, finish it up already, or at least make it interesting."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Stopped reading at Path of Daggers.

Thanks Guys!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The only highlight of this book is Mat trying to &quot;court&quot; Tuon and I got a chuckle. Perhaps because Mat is my favorite character although he is less of his sarcastic witty self than normal. Other than that nothing happens. I hate the parts dealing with Aes Sedai....incredibly boring and repetitive with no action. This makes up 500 pages of the book. I am glad I read the thing in Books-A-Million rather than pay money for it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Come on Jordan, quit using us..this book has taken somthing brillant and run it into the dirt..reading it was like being trapped by a boor at a cocktail party. Shame on you."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As someone who was dramatically encouraged by the major plot advancements Jordan made in Winter's Heart - clearly the best book since Fires of Heaven - this is as dramatically disappointing. Once again, Jordan loses the reader by attempting to build out probably 20 more characters in a series already pushing a couple hundred. While he did the same in Winter's Heart, at least that book contained a couple significant plot advances and had the offset of a beautiful new city culture advanced like only Jordan can do. Here none of that happens. The only new culture in the book is a brief visit to a city in which the dead are rising, yet Jordan lets that plot drop off almost in the chapter he writes it in. There are indeed some interesting questions to be explored - half the world seems to think the power that was used removing the taint actually was some evil from the Forsaken, a clever world building twist, but how many more books can Halima continue giving Egwene headaches and Rand ignore Mazrim Taim without doing anything? The end result is a book quite similar to CoS, in which he moves characters around to (hopefully) advance the plot next book.There are also significant problems on the editing side. The prologue runs over 100 pages - one of the main places where Jordan feels free to introduce new characters. Our main character Rand does not appear until page 576! And finally, the conclusion lacks the characteristic major battle between good and evil that conclude all but one of the other books. How Tor let this come out in this form defies belief.Still, I will say that I spent 4 full days rereading the series back in June and as an entirety even the last several books make more sense if read standalone. Perhaps in 5 or 8 years we'll look back on this book more favorably if we can reread the series as a whole. For now, however, shame on both Tor and Jordan for not having better sense than to make convolution more complex. Worth a skim for hardcore fans but probably less frustrating to wait for the next book and reading in combination with it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"When I first started the Wheel of Time series some years ago, what most attracted me was the excellent character development. It's an aspect of his writing that Jordan typically has excelled at. After a period of time, however, the overflow of cast has become tedious for me. After the last book, I was certain that Jordan had finally begun to push his plot ahead and looked for great things from this book. At the very least, I looked for some momentum...and this book has none. I can honestly say I can't remember sixty to seventy percent of the names flitting through this book, and at this point in the series I have lost the patience to go back and re-read the series to refresh my memory. The amount of time Jordan can dwell on one or another tedious issue is amazing. Few of his prior twists develop more than a half-step, and the new ones he advances are honestly not terribly intriguing. He devotes the vast majority of the book to politics...and few of this comes to anything substantial either. The sections dealing with Egwene I very nearly came to the point of flipping past, as the majority of information presented varied hardly at all from what he had already presented previously. I believe Rand Al Thor - the main focus of the stories - is spared barely three chapters of this six-hundred plus page update.I began this series excited that it might settle in next to Lord of the Rings among fantasy epics. After waiting another three or so years and sinking another thirty dollars and quite a few hours of my life into this book, I can't say I really find myself looking that forward to another. Mr. Jordan, you have my respect as a writer...however you are going to drag this story out well beyond its welcome. I still would like to know how the story ends, but I can guarantee I won't waste my money on another hard-back after this one...and with another book like this I may not waste my time with this series any longer either. You have built a vivid and exciting world up until recently. Don't let it drown in overkill."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book really does tread water. It takes about 300 pages to catch all the minor characters up to Rand. Rand himself is only actively in the book for around 5 pages. The prevoius book set up a number of cliff hangers non of which are resolved which is surprising since egwene was at the walls of tar valion at the end of WH and is still there at the end of CoT. I really enjoyed WH for the reason that now that the taint was cleansed RJ could break some new ground and the series would move quickly to the last battle. I decided to title this review &quot;half a book&quot; cause thats what CoT is its the 600 pages that builds up to a climax that occurs in the last 300 making a nice 900 page book. Unfortunately RJ has decided that these 300 pages will be book 11. Two things about this worry me (a) Are we gonna have to wait 3 yrs for the next one i wouldn't mind CoT if the 11th book came out next week but i cant wait cause its already been 3 yrs since something happened. (b) How do we know the next book wont be dribble too. RJ needs to save the series to do this he needs to stop writing conan books and put out book 11 in the next six months. The early books were within a year of each othe why cant RJ pull finger and do some work. This book should have taken 3mnths not 3 yrs to write. Recommendation is definitely library or paper back. The worst thing that can be said about this book is that if you didn't read it you would be just fine. No matter how much you liked or disliked it this is entirely true. Owning The WoT guide book is more important than this i'm afraid."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The first 3 to 4 books in this series were thoroughly enjoyable. The characters were consistent and the reader could keep track of them. The rest of the series has been nothing but an almost constant stream of new, and uninteresting characters, with no significant plot events. This book follows in the same vein. It takes over 400 pages to even reach the point where the 9th book leaves off. And absoluelty nothing happens. If the 11th book fails to further the plot, I will no longer read Robert Jordan. I'm tired of the same scene involving a bunch of petty, bitchy, women arguing...over and over..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Another 690 pages of drivel. The purpose of a book is to tell a story, but with Crossroads of Twilight all Jordan does is waste paper. This book does not develop characters, advance plot, or even inform - all it does is spout melodrama. A writer of his talent and experience should be flogged for forcing this garbage upon us. I promise, I'll get the next one from my local library before I even think of laying out money for it. Squeeze extra royalty payments out of that, you pretentious goon."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Quite literally nothing happens in this book. It is like an aside rather than a main event. This is possibly the most disappointing book I have ever read in this or any other series. There are roughly 50 pages actually worth reading, essentially what you have here is a 700 page prologue.How this book took 2 years is beyond me. After ten books I'm not going to stop now but this book makes me want to. Come on Robert - get us back on track and give us the story we all want at a pace we can all bear!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"With Eye of the World, Jordan got off to a pretty good start. The next few books in the series were pretty good as well, but after that it is a pretty linear decline into mediocrity. Crossroads of Twilight is definately the worst book in the series thus far. The entire book seems to set the stage for yet another book, which won't come for another 2 years. I had thought Winter's Heart had enough explanation of the present. I was hoping that Crossroads of Twilight would add something of substance. It's depressing that the series that really got me into fantasy in the first place has fallen so far. The only reason to read this book is the fact that it is book 10 in WOT; it would have no hope of ever standing alone."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm an avid Wheel of Time fan, and after waiting for this book for two years, I expected a real thriller. The 9th book, Winter's Heart, was pretty slow except for a few scenes throughout the book. I figured that RJ might pick up the pace in the Crossroads of Twilight, after all there were many unresolved issues at the ending of WH. You know, Faile's kidnapping, the assault of the White Tower, the army threatening Andor...... As I read the 10th book, I realized the Jordan put absolutely no effort into making this book even somewhat entertaining. ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING was reslolved in this story. Jordan uses more paper on topics like the details of Egwene's dresses and when the Aes Sedai are going to sell some cuendillar than he does about Rand or any other interesting for that matter. It seems as if things are at the exact same place as they were when the Winter's Heart ended. When the series is complete (hopefully Jordan doesnt die before them, as he will if he takes 3 years to write a book that goes nowhere) this entire book could be cut out of the series without anyone noticing, unless of course you like reading about the conversations that a few rebel Aes Sedai are having over a cup of over-honeyed tea, for 600 pages! Is the editor blind? Is Jordan going senile? We'll find out in the next episode of.......The Wheel of Time."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"My reviews of the last 3 volumes in this series have become increasingly sarcastic and acerbic, and obviously I'm not the only one who feels that the quality of not only the series, but the individual books, has plumeted. The book, however, like its predecessors, does have a lot of words in it, which brings to mind a sketch from Monty Python. You may recall that a doddering Shakespearean actor was being interviewed, and remarked on how &quot;many words&quot; there are in King Lear. He stated that the &quot;words are all there, we just have to get them in the right order.&quot; This made me think of CoT. Maybe it just has the words in the wrong order. Maybe this really was a great book and there is a dramatic conclusion to the story which would be discovered by completely reorganizing the words, and perhaps some lexicological liposuction to trim the extra fat (braid tugging, dress smoothing, etc). But then, the same could probably be said about extensive editing of the work product of the proverbial room full of monkeys with typewriters trying to reproduce Shakespeare. Good authors (certainly human ones) get the words in the right order before the book is shipped off to the publisher. Next time, Bob, either let the monkeys and the editors do it (provided you can distinguish between a Tor editor and a monkey), or try to get the words in the right order yourself. You certainly didn't do it this time."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"My only consolation after wasting my time reading this book is that I share the company of so many others who, though sorely disappointed at the downward spiral this series has taken, are spurred by either compulsion or sheer force of will to make it to the conclusion. Sad that I still cling to a flagging hope that the action will pick up and something interesting will happen. The series began so brilliantly, but now even if something does happen, you have to hunt for it in underneath all that endlessly repetitive and confusing fringe-twitching and shawl-shifting by hundreds of minor characters who really seem to have no reason to be there. I have to say I really suffered through this one. If there were a no-star category, it would be appropriate. You could probably skip this one and still know what's going on. I ordered #11 anyway. Just a glutton, I guess."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm too late as well over 2,000 folks have sent a clear message on this \\"colossal waste of time\\" (-- William Shatner, SNL).

So much promise and potential down the drain."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"... just skip ahead and start reading at page 520. The first 519 pages are totally boring. I am actually embarrassed to have this book on my shelf. The wheel of time has ground to a halt and this series has died. I should go and bury this book in my back yard. I totally agree with all the previous reviews EXCEPT the reviews that refer to Robert Jordan as a good writer. A good writer would have written a good book, this one is not. Read George R. R. Martin's &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series to see good writing."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well, I can't disagree with what anyone here has said. I've read many of the reviews, looking for someone that _really_ enjoyed this book. I didn't find many, and even those that did, had some bad things to say.I am halfway through the audiobook version. Thank the Light for libraries. Anyhow, I mentioned halfway. Let me give you an example of what is not happening. No mention of Rand, other than what everyone else \\"thinks\\" is going on. I'm on the fourth chapter in a row that reads like a soap opera with all the Aes Sedai and folks surrounding Elayne. I think this is the part everyone starts really feeling the pain.. endless pages/minutes/hours of female banter. I'm not being a male pig, there is some very boring segments here. The style is just fine; I do enjoy the way Jordan explains and describes the thoughts of the women, but my God man, we don't need to have a minute to minute rundown of every glance and movement.Nothing has occurred so far in this book. Nothing. What you learn so far, is what everyone was doing when Rand performed his massive event in book 9. So, 50% of the book (so far) is just letting you know that everyone else \\"noticed\\" what he did.I keep finding myself daydreaming while listening to it, and when I come back to reality, the same dialog is still going on. I am seriously contemplating jumping to the end of the audiobook or finding a summary online. Honestly. And I never, ever do that.The first half of this series was so excellent, I couldn't stop reading. I started some ten years ago. So many exciting events happened. There hasn't been so much as a whisper of a Forsaken (unless I forget who they are, which is entirely likely.. since I read book 9 over 2 years ago). By the time book 11 comes out, I am sure I will have forgotten book 10. There's way way way too many characters to keep straight.Well, good luck if you plan to read/listen to it. I'm sorry Mr. Jordan, this book was a bad turn in an already long series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I read the reviews for this book before I bought the paperback. I hoped against hope that this book could possibly contain some shred of what made the first ones great. Well, you know what they say about getting your hopes up. I'll not rehash what most of 2300 people have already said about this waste of space of a book. Just know it's a jumbled mess of a book where nothing happens and women pull on their hair while giving each other dirty looks. A far cry from where this formerly great series started."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I bought this book in June 2002, and have only now (June 2006) after several attempts struggled through the 94-page **introduction** (which recaps nothing, introduces nothing, and seems to have no reason for existence) into and through the body of the book.At one point I considered prefacing this review with a 'spoiler warning' and providing a 700-word summary of the 700-page opus. But it turns out to be unnecessary, as I can provide a 3-word summary that says it all while revealing nothing -- ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENS in the course of these 700 pages. The effective state of every plot element, every subplot, and every major character is EXACTLY THE SAME at the end of the opus as it was at the beginning -- save one, true, but for these purposes we can disregard events that happen in the last 5 pages...Even when Rand succeeds in finally cleansing the taint from saidin (no spoiler there; it has appeared on dust jackets), the action happens offstage, and the impact of the long-awaited event on the action and characters is -- guess what -- Rand is a bit peaked. Otherwise, NADA!I gave the book two stars rather than one solely because the narrative was not as cloyingly annoying as the last few volumes have been. Mr. Jordan seems to have serious problems with the viewpoint of his female viewpoint characters; more than somewhat of a problem because they provide the viewpoint for the bulk of his story.Because the narrative was not as painful to read as the last few volumes have been, and out of deference to the more than 16 years of my life I have spent reading this once-masterful series, I will try one more time, and buy volume 11 when it is released. But volume 11 will be the last unless Mr.Jordan has finally delivered at least some token plot or character development to his long-suffering readers."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was really looking foreward to reading the tenth book in this series. A friend of mine got me hooked on it a few months ago and i thought they were amazing books...at least the first few where. Unfortunately the last few (excluding the ninth which was pretty good)have had absolutly nothing happening, and especially the tenth. The entire tenth book was random people looking up and seeing a lot of the source being used and run away screaming &quot;Ahhhhhhh the forsaken are loose!!!!&quot; That is honestly the whole book. And may I ask what the point of Elayne's part is, I mean you could just stick in somewhere &quot;Oh ya Elayne's been going around getting everyone to vote for her&quot; THE END And really there was way to much time with the &quot;I want tea!!&quot; &quot;No you can't you're pregnant!&quot; &quot;I want it!&quot; &quot;You can't have it!!&quot; ect. I can say that all of the characters have deteriorated; Rand is a stuck up self centered idiot, Perrin going insane...I mean the future king of Saldea can't be insane!! Nynaeve's is absolutely no fun anymore, she just goes around making out with Lan and pouting that Lanfear got to Moiraine before she did (it never says that in the books, but i'm sure she is) , Mat is doing absolutely nothing worthwhile to read about, Egwene is just...she's no fun, Sheriam is Black Ajah, and Siuan just isn't Siuan anymore. Actually the same thing happened to Morgase too. She and Siuan and Nyneave had the best attitudes but they all lost them. The only character who hasn't been completely destroyed is Min, as long as she's not mooning over Rand. The Aes Sedai as well are completely destroyed. They just sit there cowering before Rand.All in all I really hope that the next book is better because I don't want to have to go through that again."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Put a gun to my head and paint the wall with my brains. Book ten is the WORST &quot;Robot&quot; Jordan book to date. I am beginning to become impatient with his lack of creativity and excessive frivilous details. And hey, seriously, nothing happens in this entire book. I can make a list of things that are more constructive and entertaining than reading this book.1. Painting a Self-Portrait2. Doing Community Service3. Calling Old Friends4. Watching Paint Dry5. Learning Yoga....The list goes on....Seriously, DO NOT BUY THIS GOD-FORSAKEN BOOK, its only another letdown, in a series of obvious dissappointment.

I loved the second book of this series.The current incarnation is insipid. I wanted this book to end so badly so that I could hurl into my fireplace and purge myself of the experience. The taint was cleansed in the prior book, and now has attached itself to the remains of this utterly tiring tome of irritation.I want the \\"Final Battle\\" to come quickly and evaporate all the annoying, trite characters that deserve to die. There are no characters with any pathos, just random text following some meandering plot and filling a minimum page limit.Mr. Jordan, please conclude the WoT with a series of Cliffs Notes, I cannot bear to read another 700 pages of train of thought garbage."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"i can not believe i paid money for this .... jordan has lost it and me as a fan. can you believe 24 chapters before the main person ( rand ) shows up? also, how did the male side of the one power get clean? i for one don't care if jordan ever finishes his too many story line epic,because i won't be buying them."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This was junk. I have been a devoted Jordan fan since 1995. I've told all my freinds how great the series is and what an exceptional writer Robert Jordan is. I never thought Robert would make me out to be a lier. I just don't get it. Did he forget what a sword and fantasy novel is? How does he publish a book that has no action in it whatsoever? My advice to Jordan is try agian. It has occured to me that he's prolonging this series to get money. And I would hope that no author would go this low to solicite money. If he need $ he could of just asked for donations. That way there wouldn't be extra space in my closet taken up with this poor excuse for a fantasy novel.Some would say that he's just trying to fulfill his vision of a fantasy novel much the same way George Lucas makes Star Wars- for himsef first and the public second. In which case I say fine. Just give us our money back robert! That way we don't feel so cheated."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Reading reviews of this book is more entertaining than the book itself. If Jordan was attempting to deliver anything other than a cash cow for his personal fortune, he failed miserably. The book delivers no plot movement, and for those of you who have defended Mr. Jordan saying he was putting the context in place for a rousing finale, how many books of context do you need?This was once one of my favorite series, but I will never again purchase one. I found myself 500 pages with less action than occurred in the first 100 of \\"Eye of the World\\". It became a labor to pick up the book to finish it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I understand the last person's thinking that this is a setup for what is to come. Unlike the last person, I do not believe that you need 3-4 books with 600+ pages to describe location and sub-characters. I can understand if Mr.Jordan decided to have the main character in his books. But one chapter for the main character(Rand)in this last installment is ridiculous. The characters that he delves more into are Perrin, Elayne, Mat and just about everyone else and their cousin. Mr.Jordan should be ashamed of himself. From the momentum of the first 4 books he was going so good. Now he is out of ideas and trying to milk his past successes for all that they are worth. Mr. Jordan, if you are listening, end the series sometime soon and move on to another profession."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've been reading this series since the first book came out over a decade ago, and I must say this one hits rock bottom. For an author to work that long and hard and come up with a book that has no recognizable pacing, beginning, middle, or end is very disturbing. There's an editor somewhere that is seriously letting down the publisher that employs them. I gave this book 2 stars, based on my loyalty to what's come before and what might come again. By itself, it barely deserves one.This book, in my mind, is a throw-away in the series. Nothing *actually* occurs in this book that is noteworthy. No plot advances, no action, and once again, no character development. The story has become so large, he can't seem to control it. Yet he continues to *add* plot nuances, while failing to resolve any previously introduced. At least previously there was a sense of accomplishment with Rand's &quot;cleansing&quot; of Saidin. This one provides absolutely nothing. Egwene Travels her army to the shores of Tar Valon, then spends 100+ pages falling off stools and getting unexplained headaches, then inexplicably throws herself into a dangerous situation at the end for our cliffhanger! Voila! I think we could've arrived there about half a pound of book earlier and still kept the pertinent info in the story. And I'm still amazed how all these &quot;ageless&quot; Aes Sedai, skilled in so many ways, continually respond like teenage girls when under any pressure. I'm tired of hearing about 90 year old women, with years of experience in negotiations and/or dealings with stressful situations, will squeek in surprise or fidget under a glare like kids in school. The women in this series are rapidly losing what little dignity they started with.Ditto for Perrin and Mat. Mat is arguably the most interesting of the three men, yet his plotline moves maybe 50 miles on the map and nowhere in value. Perrin goes the whole book searching for Faile, finds the camp, then decides to peel off to some town haunted by ghosties? Totally uneccessary.Jordan needs a taskmaster editor to keep him on target and stop including all this fluff. I don't have a problem reading a large book, provided it has some substance contained between the covers. I made it to page 500, still waiting for something to happen. If this and the previous few volumes are setup for the finale, then there's no way the finale could take place in a single volume. Look for it to take 3 or 4 books at this rate.When book 11 comes out, I will have to think long and hard before I part with my hard earned coin for a copy. I may just wait for the series to be completed and pick 'em up in a used bookstore for a fraction of the cost."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"and that he did! I really don't blame him, I blame myself more. I've been holding on to this fantasy/dream that the WOT series will return to the quality of the mid-ninties. I know, we all know, that the past few books wouldn't have even been published, nevermind bestsellers if they were books one, two, or three. What is expected? That the final few books will be amazing and worth thousands of pages of garbage we've read for the past few year...I highly doubt it! Name a series that goes from great to horrible and then back to great...maybe Friends, but that's it.My view: shed a tear and quit, never touching the WOT series again."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I want my money and time back. It's amazing that this guy can write 675 pages in which ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENS. For heaven's sake, after thousands upon thousands of pages of plot development in prior books, we do not need to hear any more about Aes Sedai's dresses or Egwene's or Elayne's musings about things they've mused about 100 times before. Enough already. We know that stuff. Now move on and tie up some of the subplots and start winding this thing to a conclusion.Instead, he introduces subplots to the subplots. Example: Perrin is supposed to be trying to rescue Faile. Do we see anything approaching a conclusion to that one? NO. We see Perrin going to a city we've never heard of to... buy grain. Ta-da! That's it? For crying out loud! Oh yeah, and the people in that city are ... dirty! They haven't bathed in who knows how long because they're scared of the ghosts that seem to be haunting their town. OOOOOOOH! How thrilling. (Not!) Gimme a break! Who needs that garbage? Get on with it.Don't get me wrong -- I'm not saying I wanted to see the Last Fricking Battle in this book, or even in book 11. But, geez, something more interesting than Aes Sedai smoothing their skirts and Accepted dropping curtsies should happen. We need some plot advancement and the conclusion of some subplots to make it worthwhile to read these books. I hoped that we would see at least one or two of the following: Faile rescued; the White Tower seige ended; the Caemlyn seige ended. Instead, we get: Mat flirting with Tuon (the most entertaining - and I use that term lightlyt - thing this book had to offer), Perrin buying grain, and Egwene and Elayne still fretting in the same way they've been fretting for the last several thousand pages.I'm fed up. I quit."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"How very, very sad. Unlike the earlier books of this series I found this one extremely easy to put down.

NOTHING HAPPENS. Not one significant story line progresses in this book. Robert Jordon is trying to get as much money as he can milk out of this series. You will get a very though discussion of weavels throughout the whole book.I wish I had read this in college because I could have benefited from absolute artistry of stretching a 200 word short story into a 600 page book.I've NEVER been so disappointed in a series as I was on book 9. Crossroads of Twilight was even WORSE.

We should all thank him for writing this book, really. Because now, creative writing teachers the world over can use it as a teaching aid, as a textbook in everything one should avoid in writing.How bad is this book? How bad has the series become? To answer that, let's ask some other questions:1. Is Rand the main character? Does the fate of the entire world rest on his shoulders? Is he the point of the books? Was the first chapter of the series written about him? The answer, of course, is yes. So, Mr. Jordan, WHY is the MOST important character in the STORY only around for ten pages?2. Were the core characters all friends in the beginning?The answer is yes. Perrin, Mat and Rand were all friends. Rand and Egwene were in love. Nynaeve, despite her attitude, loved them all. Now, in CoT:The characters have not all been together since book 4. Perrin and Mat are all terrified of Rand, and Rand uses them. Egwene and Rand are practically enemies. Do we really want to read about characters that can't even remain true to their friendships?The problem is, there are so many problems to the story now. Not since Moiraine has an important character died. And most people think she'll come back eventually. Thom was first thought to be dead. Nope. Lanfear, Ishamael, Balthamel and Aginor were all supposed to be dead at one point or another. They are all back. Jordan can't kill his characters, and so more and more and more keep coming in. There are so many now, it is impossible to keep track of them all unless you take copious notes, and as their names are all so similar anyway (I'm convinced he uses some name generator found on the internet for the Aes Sedai) the task is doubly hard. And you know things are bad when a woman named Naen (do you know who she is? Of course not) has as much screen time as the Dragon Reborn, or Nynaeve, or Min or Aviendha.Notice how everytime Rand has gone up against a Forsaken, he has won? Notice how most people fear him more than the Dark One? So why doesn't he get it over with and kill the forsaken, as we all know he can? Notice how the chief threat right now is NOT the dark one, but the seanchan? What does THAT tell you about the Wheel of Time?Throughout the story, only a few important things have happened: Rand learns that he is the Dragon. Rand gains the Aiel to his side. Moiraine dies. Perrin and Mat do a few other litle things. Egwene becomes Amyrlin. And finally, Rand cleanses Saidin. The rest is all filler.These are all huge problems to the STORY. I'm not talking about the writing now, not what Jordan writes about and what he doesn't, not how boring it is, or whatnot. This is just the STORY itself. There are too many flaws! This will NEVER work out! I'm sorry to say it, but the series is incontrovertibly doomed. It will never get better, it's dead, gone beyond repair.I have to finish with a gloomy prophesy. People have been complaining how slow the last books are. Jordan has said only 2, maybe 3 books remain. From where they are now, ask yourselves: are the characters REALLY ready to fight the last battle? What real evidence (not what Jordan says, but by the events he actually writes) that the last battle is at all closer now than it is when the series began? Can Jordan really resolve this all in 3 books? The answer is yes. But he'll do it so quickly, it'll seem so rushed and forced, that the problem in the end will be the opposite of the problem now. The end will have been a blink of an eye...and it says a lot about a series when the most important part of it, the part that REALLY matters, is the shortest, quickest, and least developed of all. It's over folks. Jordan should be sent to jail for murdering his own baby."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"680 pages later, and not one thing resolved. If anything, there are less things resolved. The tower is still divided, Faile is still captive, Mat still isnt married, who knows what is going on with the Black Tower, and Rand is barely in the book. Save yourself twenty dollars, buy it in paperback, so maybe after you read it will have less time to wait for a plot line to end. I have been waiting close to 7 years for the tower to be united, and i am 20. Thats more than a third of my life. Some of the other lines are just as old. If Robert Jordan has a heart attack before he closes some of these......"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'd just like to list the main characters, mentioning who they were, and who they now are.Rand Before: Used to be caring (remember how he made Bela run for Egwene?),yet strong willed, and an overall good-guy. Remember when most of the story was about him?Rand Now: Absolutely does not care what anyone says or thinks, and does whatever he wants to whoever he wants. Not even 3% of this book concerns him.Perrin Before: Big, strong, gentle. Took his time to think about things, never did anything rash. Didn't like to be in charge, but took control when he had to.Perrin Now: Rash, angry, pushes people around, cares about nothing else but Faile...NOTHING ELSE.Egwene Before: Smart (she could read people like nothing else), strong willed, seeking adventure - generally fun-lovingEgwene Now: So, so, so stupid. I mean, those flaming headaches come along ONLY when her Saidin infested servant girl is around, and angry at her (sometimes AT THE EXACT MOMENT OF HER DISPLEASURE), and only her Saidin infested servant girl can make them go away, AND whenever her Saidin infested servant girl is out late, someone dies FROM SAIDIN! I just can't take her stupidness.Nynaeve Before: VERY strong willed, kind of a witch, but generally good intentioned. Quite mature.Nynaeve Now: As all the characters 'matured', in a sense (they no longer think about things that are juvenile, generally), Nynaeve has actually de-matured. She runs around like a giddy school girl now, doing anything anyone tells her to, and swooning over Lan. I mean, the only time you see her in this book is watching Lan practice sword-fighting, where she is described as practically 'bouncing up and down in her seat, rooting for Lan'. And it's only practice! And Lan is whomping the other guy, no contest! ugh...Lan Before: Quiet, composed, deadly, past shrouded in mystery and greatness.Lan Now: Forsakes everything he used to be to yell at people, making sure they don't hurt Nynaeve.Tam Al'Thor Before: One of the characters in the first book who I was so looking forward to getting to know better. His past seemed so interesting! For sure, Rand would want to talk to him and figure all this stuff out...especially when he learned to travel, and it would be nothing to take a day or so out of his schedule...Tam Al'Thor Now: I am convinced that he no longer exists.The only saving grace of this book - Mat. Mat is the only character who simply hasn't changed much...he's still good-old Mat, and completely hilarious. I think the only thing different about him is that he swears A LOT now...which is funny.The moral? I don't like the characters anymore - they're stupid, mean, angry, devilish, self-centered, and all around bad people. At least Mat is SUPPOSED to be a 'bad' person...anyway, I don't even want them to win. The Forsaken now are the underdogs, and I like them better. I must say that it would be absolutely brilliant for Jordan to turn the good guys (ever so slowly, as he has been doing) into the bad guys, and the bad guys into the good, however, because I know this will not happen - this last installment is just one more step in the complete destruction of everything Jordan started."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is the kind of book that will drive people to want to write their own fantasy stories. Not out of a desire to emulate Jordan, of course, but out of the conviction that arises that good literature must be written in order to make up for Jordan's egregious failures.It is not that this book is somehow by itself a series killer; it's that the series has been in suspended animation since a few books ago and it took \\"Crossroads,\\" essentially several hundred pages of pointless filler - the stuff that editors usually delete before sending books on to the printers, to make even the die-hard fans die.Hard.And books that are comprised of nothing more than several hundred pages of pointless filler generally enjoy these two consequences of existing:[1] Nobody - even generous fans - will remember what they've read two days after reading it, which means that . . .[2] Whatever portion of the brain the reader has set aside for ruminating about the Wheel of Time will be turned towards thinking about how, you know, gosh - every single one of Jordan's characters are really, really annoying, and, gosh again - they've been doing and saying the same exact things and not getting even the tiniest bit wiser or smarter ever since the series began. Except for Rand - the supposed protagonist - but he's as crazy as an outhouse rat and pretty much all-powerful so it's kind of hard to, you know, sympathize with the guy.And it just gets worse from there as it becomes clearer that Jordan's ability to write any kind of coherent story utterly collapsed under the weight of his need to give his RPG contingent a really bitchin' and totally detailed campaign setting. I mean, good Lord - how many pages about frickin' tea and dresses does ANY high-fantasy/obliquely-sci-fi adventure need?And that d**n Nyaeve! If ever a character was created that needed to be slapped around by Captain Kirk on an off-ship bender, it's her!And furthermore . . !. . . (ahem).See what I mean?Do yourself - your blood pressure, to be specific - a favor and discontinue the reading of this series. Just grab the books and throw them - without ceremony - into the nearest trash receptacle.Then go find a used copy of Jack Vance's \\"Lyonesse\\" and read that wonderful little gem instead. Read the other two books in that series, too, if you can find them. I'll say this about Vance: wonderful writer, and the man knew how to end a story.Did you throw those Wheel of Time books away yet? I thought so - the smile on your face gives you away."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have to agree with one reviewer who said he encouraged Jordan to keep writing, as a book of this sheer ineptitude had engendered some of the finest reviews he'd ever read. I wish CoT had done half the job of keeping me up late reading that these reviews have done. When readers as erudite, thoughtful and downright funny as these say your book is bad, it just is. End of story. And my God, is this book bad.I do have a couple of comments to those few brave souls still trying to defend Jordan:1.) Transition book? What the hell is a transition book? Transition paragraph, yeah. Transition chapter, OK. But since when does anyone need to, let alone have the right to, write a transition novel? Or maybe I'm wrong. I'm sure the Lord of the Rings could have been greatly improved by wedging 400 pages of &quot;character development&quot; between Two Towers and Return of the King. This innovative literary device will no doubt be creeping its way into community college creative writing classes any day now.2.) Speaking of character development - you can't have development without action of some kind. No, it doesn't have to involve swords or battle or Forsaken, but it does have to involve something more than a character kicking back and contemplating events. Characters develop by reacting to external events and each other. Sitting in place thinking is just that - sitting in place. The only thing it develops is extreme boredom in the reader.Despite my warnings, my younger brother will no doubt launch into CoT as soon as I hand it over to him. He, like most long-time Wheel of Time readers, simply can't believe it can be as bad as those of use who've gone before say. After he's finished, and we've commiserated a bit, I'm going to ask for it back. Then I'll do something I've never done before, never considered doing before, heck, have never even heard of before. I'm going to pack the book in a box and mail it to Tor, with a nice little sticky attached that informs them that not only will I never buy another Jordan book, I'll be reluctant to buy any book Tor puts out.I still eagerly anticipate the next book, however - not so that I can read it, but so I can see where it debuts on the NY Times Bestseller list. Five? 10? Not at all? Now that will be entertaining. We Constant Readers (to borrow Stephen King's term) may be loyal, but we're not stupid. I hope."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Like many WOT fans, I have followed this series for many years. I still think that books 1-5 are as good as fantasy novels get. However, since book 5, readers have been exposed to endless dribble and nonexistent plot advancement. In this book, readers get to well over 400 pages and realize that the timeline is still at the point where Winter's Heart ended. I've endured all I can. I will not be buying book 11. It has become abundantly clear that Mr. Jordan intends to milk this series for all that it is worth. I don't believe that an end is in sight, unlike some. There are far too many unresolved issues to work through in one or two books. If anyone doubts this, tell me what was resolved in the 680 pages of book 10. What was once one of the most action packed series in the fantasy genre is now unquestionably the genre's biggest dud. The only physical conflict in the first 500 pages occurs between a very minor character (one of Elayne's soldiers) and someone readers don't know. I firmly believe that money is the only concern here. Jordan understands the following that his first 5 masterpieces created. Each book now shots immediately to number one on the bestseller list as soon as it is released. What a huge cash cow!! Jordan has no intention of giving that up by bringing this series to a decent end. Again, look at books 1-5 and tell me that Jordan can't do better than he has since The Fires of Heaven. Obviously he can. He just hasn't cared. Well his poor efforts and lack of plot advancement has caused him to lose one reader, and I think many more will soon follow. If you haven't bought this book, don't. If you are considering the WOT series, I would advise against it, and you can't imagine how it pains me to say that. Still, there are many good fantasy books and series out there, and other writers seem to have the integrity to consider more than there own financial well being."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Lets just say its very humorous that many of the five star ratings seem to feel compelled to disparage all of these one star reviews, even though the vast majority are well though out, well written and often quite entertaining.My complaints are basically the same as everyone else's, but I'd like to point out a slightly different view. Jordan can not conclude a plot (or any sub-plot). Think about it. Around when the series started to decline, Jordan announced that he was going to start taking his time or is health was at risk. At about the same time, we start seeing the re-introduction of some of the forsaken that we thought were gone for good. Lets observe how many plot items that Jordan has felt compelled to hit the reset button on instead of bringing them to an end:-Egwene and the rebel Aes Sedai (how many books does it take to finally raid(take)the white tower? Whats this lame excuse about them not using their travelling ability to just get it done and over with and minimizing loss of life? Instead we have to hear the endless drivel and quibering amongst these supposed wise women while they build up a 'cannon fodder' army of men to kill off in useless battle.)-Elayne and the Queenship of Camelyn (She could graciously have let Rand her semi-hubby declare her queen and avoid a sensless civil war, but NO lets make her into a Power witch who won't accept help from any Man and drag on the reader into endless politics and introduce all sorts of more pointless new characters into the Royal rumble for power!)-Rand and the breaking of the Aeil/Shaido (How many times does Rand et al. have to destroy/defeat the shaido? they seem to have been killed in the thousands upon thousands and deafeated time and time again, but Jordan can't let that sub-plot end, and they all seem to have spontaneously regenerated so that jordan can send us on another bore fest of waiting 'till Perrin gets off his butt and goes after his wife from this massive shaido encampment)-Rand and the Seanchan (Hasn't Rand killed countless and defeated them countless times? And that without using the Aeil. With the amount of Aeil that he commands, why doesn't he just end the seanchan threat and wrap that one up quickly? The Shaido seem to have sold their spontaneous respawn cheat technology to the Seanchan as well!)-the black tower (when is jordan going to resovle the conflict between Taim, Logain, and even RAnd for that matter? when is the black tower going to resolve its conflict with the white tower especially with the 'cleanse'? maybe that will take another 5 books or so)-Cadsuane (the epitome of Aes Sedai arrogance is going to teach those woolheaded men something they don't like someday... great WHEN?!)-Gollum/Forsaken ( Jordan doesn't seem to be able to ever REALLY kill these guys off, what the hell is going on with them? when are they going to do something that moves the main sub plot along? When are we going to learn a little more about who's left and what the plan is? or at least a hint of it?)-The northern contingent (what are all of those northerners up to and why havent we heard anything since that 200 page prologue about them?Point is, we can all ask 100s more of these when questions, but Jordan cant seem to ever truly finish off anything. He seems to instead try to recycle the sub-plots endlessly and introduce new sup-plots at the same time. Don't be surprised to see him somehow re-introduce the taint into the male side of the power (or maybe the female side???!!!) because that would be out of line for him to finally tie anything off.You are really kidding yourself if you truly think this is a great 'buildup' or 'transitional' book, HES BEEN DOING THAT FOR THE LAST 4 books!!! There is a point at which the story (or stories) need to move on and or conclude!I will not read another book of Jordans until he starts showing that he can conclude things and move the story in significant and entertaining ways (like he did in the first 4 or 5)."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I started reading this series when \\"Fires of Heaven\\" had just been released. I swallowed up those first five books and waited patiently --- and not always that --- for the next installments. I have also reread the books several times. Each time through the series, I am struck with admiration for how Jordan manages to keep so many different plotlines interesting. For the first seven books, anyway. Then Path of Daggers came out, and something happened. I lost interest. There are TOO MANY plotlines now. Reading through CoT, I am struck by how mundane and . . . well, let's admit it. . . unneccessary all the plotlines are. And the ones that DO matter (Mat and Tuon, Perrin trying to rescue Faile, Elayne ascending to the throne) are filled with so much useless description of plants and vases and trees and horses and names that no one without an encyclopedia would ever remember ----OK, deep breath. Sorry I got carried away. I'll be the first to admit that Jordan has skill as a writer. But he's trying too hard. You know how every single paperback of this series has that quote from the critic about how \\"Jordan has come to dominate the world that Tolkien began to reveal\\"? Tolkien did only begin to reveal the story he told of Middle Earth. And there's a reason why THAT story is still the most popular in the genre. He told the story he needed to tell, and left it at that. There was so much untold, so many characters that were never introduced, so much history and language, that Tolkien never published. His son published them after his father died, and again, there's a reason why those \\"History of Middle Earth\\" volumes never gained the level of popularity their predecessors enjoyed. Too much is simply too much. Jordan is attempting the impossible, or at least the foolish, in trying to include all the things into his story that he has. And now the story has gotten away from him. He's most likely releasing those prequels now because he thinks that is the only way to appease his fans. Stretch out a good short story/novella into (what is it going to be? three books?) yet another immense story. Until Book 27 (to use a fellow reviewer's expression. Thanks :-) comes out, anyway. I'll stick with this series, but only to see how he wraps it all up. Then I'll move on with my life. Happily. (I feel sort of like a parent with a child. Not angry. Just disappointed and sad. And it's sad in its own way that I have to feel that way about such a potentially extraordinary literary experience.) *sigh* Ah, well.To close . . . I've read an interview with Jordan where he said that he had originally only intended \\"The Wheel of Time\\" to be three volumes long. I can't see how that would be possible. Six, maybe. Three, no. Twelve is simply ridiculous. With each passing day, Jordan is losing fans. That is unfortunate, but it's his own fault."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I suppose this is a little redundant, as about 700 reviews have already said what I'm about to say, but still;Nothing significant happens in this book. And I'm not talking about action, battle-fury-Salvatore-style-sequences, I mean nothing. The plot is simply ignored (or more specifically, it is pondered by each minor and major character). There is absolutly no resolution. Not only does no significant event happen, but, with the exception of Matt/Tuon, there is no character development. We don't learn anything new about any of the characters, except what they wear.The first 400 pages of this book should have been the second half of book nine, as all of this takes place chronologically BEFORE book nine.Not only that, but, considering the end of book nine, you'd excpect a huge reaction from the world, or the dark one, or the black tower, or the white tower, or anybody within a million mile radius of the event. Well, there is none. That's right, the climax of book nine (trying to avoid a spoiler) has NO affect on anyone in book 10.I don't mind the sub-plots, or the countless characters. In fact, I think they could add a lot to the story. But the fact is, they have to DO something. You don't spend 20 pages of prologe (for that matter, I have issues with a book that \\"needs\\" 97 pages of prologe) introducing Tuon's deathwatch guard and then drop him from the book. This is a common theme- the problem with most of the minor characters, especially in the prologe, is they are introduced and subsequently dropped from the novel. There is no reason to introduce a new character if he's not doing anything for the next 600 pages; if that's the case, then she/he can wait till the next book.I did give this two stars instead of one, because the writing itself is still good. Jordan, to his credit, (in my opinion, at least) keeps up an entertaining and funny writing style, and even manages to change the tone of writing to suit the persective of the character from which the story is being told (which is impressive, considering). He also has some rather well done forshadowing of events to happen soon. However, no amount of quality writing can save a book that has no plot.Put simply, by the end of book 10, no event of appreciable note occurs. No character development (with the exception of Matt/Tuon) occurs. While the writing itself is enjoyable, it does nothing to further our visit in the world of the wheel of time."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Don't get me wrong I love the wheel of time series, but after waiting so long for Book 10 to come out I feel cheated by Crossroads of Twightlight. This book is ~700 pages long but I think that the main plot is farther behind now than when book 9 ended. Basically through out the whole book nothing happens, not a single thing. If Seinfeld was a show about nothing, then Crossroads of Twightlight is a book about nothing. All your favorite characters are there, but they each have ~2 chapters worth of doing nothing in the beginning and middle of the book followed by another brief chapter of doing nothing at the very end of the book.I would advise WoT fans to skip this book entirely and move straight to book 11 when it comes out in another 2-3 years *sigh*"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is a huge waste of money and time. The story is going nowhere at a snail's pace. I love this world and the characters and I realize this is Mr. Jordan's golden goose, but there is a limit to how many of these filler books people are willing to purchase or read. Rand barely figures in this volume, Nynaeve and Lan are afterthoughts. The chapters written around Elayne and Aviendha are truely teeth gratingly annoying and tedious and the chapters devoted to Egwene and the assorted, and impossible to keep straight, Aes Sedai she consorts with are not much better. Even the usually reliable Matrim is unentertaining and bogged down. Don't waste your time, save your $$$ for the next volume, maybe something will actually happen."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Note to Jordan -- YOU NEED TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN in every book. 700 pages of excruciating detail about everyone sitting around waiting has made me no longer care what happens -- this is my last Jordan book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was personally very disappointed by Crossroads of Twilight. It seems increasingly evident that Robert Jordan and his publishers only have a profit in mind when writing this series. There was absolutely nothing of interest in the latest book and I would not recommend this book to anyone. I &quot;was&quot; a diehard Wheel of Time fan, but now I am very disenchanted. For anyone who is interested, George Martin's series is a much better read and it is obvious he cares more for the quality of his work, than the expected profits from who knows how many more sequels Jordan and his money grubbing publishers wish to make."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The books in this series just keep getting worse and worse. Almost 700 pages of absolute [poop]! It was over 500 pages before the main character (Rand al Thor) was mentioned. And then only a handful of pages. I wish I could give this book a lower rating. Do NOT waste your money. NOTHING happened in this book.....just pages and pages of One Aes Sedai trying to stare down another Aes Sedai or wise one. There were no battles, no magic, nothing at all to keep my interest. You could easily skip this book and read the next one without losing out on anything. Robert Jordan started this series with a bang with Eye of the World, but has steadly gotten more and more long winded. Now he is just a [money cow] for Tor Books looking to cash in by stringing his readers along as long as possible. I truly hope the final book in this series has already been written and is just shelved somewhere, because there is very little chance of seeing an end to it until Robert Jordan dies or retires. I want my money back!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After reading this the first time I forgot if anything really happened. So I decided to read it a second time and sure enough, nothing happened. Some people say this is a set up for big things to come. If you cant remember anything that happened then whats the point of having a setup. Also, I have no idea who anybody is anymore. Beonin, Zerowin, Meaolin, Mao Tse Dung, theyre all the same. Stick to the main characters Rob and wake up, this is getting boring."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The readers of this series were introduced to an incredibly complex world; inhabited by characters of equal complexity. It seems with this book, Jordan has become enamored with complexity rather than substance. Action within each book, early in the series, was supported by ornate descriptions of a people, their land, and their culture.The last two books, and perhaps more so this one, have dealt with description only...with this book we are introduced to so many characters that it becomes difficult to remember the former ones, let alone the newly introduced! Jordan writes of their everyday woes as if we are tuning into &quot;As the World Turns,&quot; and will do so tomorrow and tomorrow, ad infinitum. Action, as we believe it to be within this series, is almost, if not completely absent. The book ends with the promise of action, a tease of what &quot;may&quot; come with the next book.There are reader's who will continue buying the series and, I'm sure, there are readers who have decided there are far better ways to entertain themselves than reading this facsimile of a Russian novel...I'm not sure where I stand."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"One star is being generous.I found the last book moderately entertaining, and looked forward to the next one. Six hundred pages, and the main character appears in approximately 12 of those. Nothing happens, nothing is resolved, nothing changes - an entire book of childish women whining about how stupid men are, and childish men whining about how controlling women are - a candid view of Mr. Jordan's obsessions I could well have done without. The author should spend some of the money he has bilked from his readers and get some therapy instead of shoving his relationship problems down those readers' throats.I don't care how good the hype gets for his next book - I am finished with this lame duck."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'll make it quick...Dont Waste Your Money!!! I'd give it less than one star if that were possible...Nothing else needs to be said..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I don't know what Robert Jordan is thinking, but in this book it becomes obvious he is trying to provide a lot of character developing detail, like say for example Dickens would. Elayne Trakand, one of Rand Al'thor's women has 95 straight pages devoted to her court life as she's vying for the throne of her supposedly dead mother. These action packed pages involve her trying to decide what dress to wear, deciding which sitting room to greet her guests in, and other such trifles. These 90 + pages cover about 6 or 8 hours of one day, by the way. It's not even very well written. Jordan excells with his strong characters who have PoV's in Crossroads of Twilight: Mat, Tuon, Rand, Cadsuene, Siuan and to a lesser extent Perrin, Faile, and Egwene.I learned more about Thom Merrilin from 3 sentences in passing than i did about Elayne. I'm really not sure if this was even intended or not, but this book really stalled from about pages 250-500. Leaving them out would have been no problem at all. The male half of the Source was cleaned by Rand at the end of book 9, and by the end of book 10 still no one has realized what has happened, just then catching a few hints, even though every channeler in the world could sense it happening.The only redeeming values this 680 page tome has is the immersive world, the Mat sections, (Mat being my favorite character since the beginning of the series), and the hints of behind the scenes plotting that you can catch at intervals.Still, if you plan on finishing the series, you might as well read this volume so you are refreshed on the terminology and names for when something worthwhile comes out."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan is starting to become the Clancy of the fantasy world. Jordan's writing would imply that he doesn't hear any of our criticisms because we make him a best-selling author with each book. Success begets arrogance, which begets this drivel. The more I read this work, the more I miss Tolkien, Martin and even, Jordan (books 1-6). Well, I appreciate the chance to read 680 pasges where each story is take forward a few weeks, with basically nothing happening during those weeks."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I like Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series very much. His ability to pull the readers into a situation with the detail of his descriptions is un-paralleled.However, when those details overwhelm the story line it can ruin the book. In Crossroads of Twilight he has produced so much detail and filler that it is extremely difficult to pick out anything story wise happening.Needless to say, I am very disappointed. There is a lot of good in this book but it is buried in what would otherwise be considered filler. Detail is good when it is used to accent the story line or when it is used to bury/or hide important &quot;clues&quot; to the series mysteries. It is not good as filler instead of story line. Please RJ, do not make us wait so long again for so little."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"after waiting so many years for this installment, i find that its not what i ,had hoped for yes mat is there and he is great, but the story goes nowhere plenty of politics, more that i could take, in fact i found myself skimming the pages, never before done with this series, i do realize that it must be hard to keep the story going after all this time, but i know that he is better than this"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If you're looking for a continuation of the action from the first nine books, don't bother reading this one.

I have been a fan of the series since the first book came out and would be the first to recommend it to a friend. But it has become clear with the last few books that Jordan is trying to drag this out as long as possible, regardless of what it does to the story or how his fans feel. I forgave the plodding story in the last book because he ended it on such a powerfull and pivital note, one that I assumed he would pick up in Crossroads. Instead we get 500 pages of useless backstory before we even reach the point where the last book ended! We dont even see Rand untill page 540 and they just gloss over his clensing of the one source. Even the interesting parts got lost in the endless drivel. It seems to me he just took material that was cut from his last book and made this on out of it. How else can you explane a book in the Wheel of Time series that has NO ACTION, I dont think anyone even draws a sword! It was 680 pages of trivial conversations. To any fans of the series I would say skip this on , you could go from book 9 to book 11 and not miss a thing."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've been a fanboy up to this point but this book was a chore to read, the chapters about Elayne and Egwene actually had me skipping pages knowing I would miss nothing and hoping for them to just end.

But I have to say that disappointed and disgusted don't even begin to describe the feelings that I felt half way through this book and the feelings only got worse. This \\"next part\\" in the series is nothing but just an extended ending to part nine in the series. If the author continues in this fashion then I am afraid the series will hopefully finish in another five to ten instalments, rather than just the final two as reported in an interview with the author. There are 700 odd pages in the book and all that takes place is:1)Mat has just escaped from Ebou Dar.2)Perrin Aybara has found the Shaido clan.3)Egwene al'Vere has reached Tar Valon.4)Rand Al'Thor wants a truce the enemy.5)Elayne Trakand is still just sitting in Caemlyn, with the supposed siege not moving one way or the other.I am quite sure that all the fans of this series share my feelings. So as a final word for the reader of this review all I will say is that if you are a casual fan then save your hard earned money and wait for the next \\"instalment\\" in this series, this is for die hard fans only."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I stopped reading Jordan two books ago because it seems he is more interested in selling as many books as he can rather than finishing the tale. When I started reading this series I would rate it as one of the best I have read, but with hashing out the same events over and over with no advancement in the story, it has bored me to tears. I believe Mr. Jordan has a brilliant talent in telling a story and getting you to care about the characters, but please end it before it becomes a big.... bigger joke!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Those who can appreciate great setup will really love this book. Personally, I thought the setup in books 8 and 9 were good ... but this was absolutely stupendous. Fans of total plot inertia will be in heaven.I've grown to hate the character of Rand because whenever he makes an appearance the plot is in danger of moving incrementally forward. Thankfully, Mr. Jordan saves us from any threatening plot developments by keeping Rand almost totally absent from this book. And when he is introduced - briefly - towards the very end, Mr. Jordan quickly whisks him off to the sidelines before anything interesting can happen. Whew! I'm wiping the sweat off my brow becasue that was a close one.Have you ever wondered how many stripes should be on the dublet of an important dignatary from Illian? How many shawl twitches are appropriate when Aes Sedai negotiate momentous agreements? What kind of stool the general of an Aes Sedai army sits on, and how stable said stool might be? Well buckle up for a wild ride, amigo, because you're going to learn all that (and more!) by the time you've tediously slogged to the conclusion of this book.Part of what really makes Mr. Jordan's worlds so unique are the wonderful characters which populate them. I like nothing more than to scratch my head in befuddlement as yet another Aes Sedai is reintroduced into the plot whom I can no longer recall. It gives me an excuse to page to the back of the book and open up the 'Robert Jordan Appendix of Useless and Irrelevent Characters' which is always such a joy. I've created my own drinking game based on this called, [...]For anyone who wants to play along the rules are simple:1.) Is the character you're looking up totally irrelevent? Take a drink.2.) Do you have reason to suspect said character will remain totally irrelevent? Take a drink.3.) Does the character twitch her shawl? Take two drinks.4.) Is she looking \\"cross-eyed\\" at someone? Take a drink.5.) Do you know the exact design of the embroidery on the fringe of her shawl? Of course you do - take a drink. For your own sanity, consider taking another.Anyhow, I don't want to pretend everything about this book is negative ... there are a few positives.First off, Nynaeve is completely ignored. I suspect Mr. Jordan will make up for this oversite by indulging in an orgy of braid-tugging, yellow-shawled action in books 11-16, but you will be blessedly free of it in this tome.Secondly, Jordan has stopped even pretending to provide \\"setup\\" for future books with CoT. Nothing Of Any Signifigance happens - at all - in this novel. Nothing. There's not so much as a cliffhanger. He's no longer bothering to maintain any facade. I appreciate that kind of bold honesty. He's just holding out his hand and saying, \\"Listen suckers ... we all know you're going to give me your money - so just hand it over. I could personally visit each of your homes and beat it out of you, but isn't this more civilized?\\". And, yes, I suppose it is more civilized. So I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Jordan for allowing me to voluntarily hand him my hard-earned money rather than forcing him to pummel it out of me in my own house. It is very much appreciated.I can't wait for Volume 11."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"A first - a major fantasy book and best-seller whose major antagonist and most menacing villian is ...

I brewed it into a gleaming silver pitcher with a matching silver ropework tray and a set of three silver cups, each with its own saucer that was engraved around the perimeter with tiny flowers. I had bought the set in Saldea. Oh, the Sea-folk porcelain is wonderful, but I'm prone to breaking it. Anyway, I poured myself a cup of tea. There were piping hot scones in a silver bowl on the tray next to the tray that held the tea. The basket was covered with a white embroidered cloth slashed with blue silk, much like my dress. Oh, the neckline is a bit too low-cut for some of my acquaintances, who prefer good stout woolens to that Arad Domai silk that clings to the body in such a way as to leave very little to the imagination. So, as I was eating a scone and drinking my cup of tea, the steam from each rising and intertwining together like dueling serpents, I noticed a peculiar taste in the tea: it was cool and refreshing, with a hint of mint. Of course, I thought nothing of it. Giving my earlobe a tug and my braid a pull, I remembered the idiocy of every one of my male friends, indeed every male I have ever come into contact with, or ever will for that matter.

Though I know I will never see him again, I felt it necessary to familiarize myself with every aspect of his appearance and personal history. He was a short, stout man with black hair that was beginning to grey at the temples, slicked back on his head in the manner of warriors, though it was obvious he was not one. He wore brown shoes of stained leather that rustled softly against the dirt of the streets, kicking up clouds of dust that lingered in the air even after he had passed. His pants were of stiff wool, dyed green and patched in many places. He wore a leather jerkin over a soiled white peasant's shirt, the cuffs of his sleeves rolled up and out of his way. Around his neck was a silver chain with a medallion attached to it that bore the image of a bear. He spoke with a gruff voice...\\"P: \\"The TEA, ma'am.\\"C: \\"Well you don't have to be rude about it.

So I accepted it and was consumed by the sweet joy. I sent a tiny thread of fire into the pitcher to warm the wine. Soon, steam rose from the pitcher of gold, sunlight rebounding on the inset gems.

How does that advance the plot?We do not need action to advance the story, we need real plot development. There is no excuse for this book to exist, other then to fatten Jordans bank account.If it were only this one book, that could be overlooked. But each book since FoH has become progressively worse, less and less happening in each one.We know Nynaeve is clueless and likes to tuh her braid when she is angry(basically 24-7), we don't need to be reminded of it every page.We know Perrin is upset about Faile( and nothing, I mean nothing is more important, really, nothing...), but yet does nothing about it.We know that Rand is tired and stretched thin, but does nothing. The one event eagerly waited for turned into nothing(Rand meeting Logain). We know that Rand does not trust Taim, yet he never checks up on him or the black tower, even after being attacked by Ashaman.We know Aes Sedai like to hold themselves out as a mysterious and powerful group of women. We know, and are reminded on nearly every page, that what they really are, are cowardly, ignorant fools.We know that Elayne is still pregnant, can't get the lion throne, even though she controls the palace and armies. She has yet to figure out, that she is not claiming the Lion throne by right, but because Rand secured it for her, and is so incompetent she still can't get it. If not for Rand, Rahvin would control Andor, so her belief that she has some right to claim it is nonsense.The only thing that was resolved in this book, was Egwene is a fool. But of course, we knew that already. The many minor storylines about people we don't really know and don't care about at all, were not resolved, they were muddied and added on to.Jordan has long forgotten how to write a good story. He let it get away from him, and only the most diehard(and blind) fan has stayed. The only way he could possibly finish this convoluted story in 2 books is by one of two things:Each book will be at least 2000 pages long, which will never happen. Books 6-10 could have easily been 2 fantastic novels, but that would impact his bank account.All the storylines will be closed off too quickly for it too really make sense. Jordan claims it will go to 12 books but look what need to be resolved:1. The seanchan must fall under Rand2. Mat needs to regain his army and marry Tuon, and possibly take over the seanchan army3. Rand needs to take over the blacktower and somewhat control his ashaman opponents4. Perrin needs to free Faile and completely take care of the Shaido5. Masema and his followers need to be taken care of.6. Elayne needs to gain the throne7. Egwene needs to escape and take control of the tower8. The borderland armies needs to find and follow rand9. The annoying Cadsuane needs to teach Rand and the Ashaman something;probably how to be annoying.10. The rest of the nations need to follow Rand.11. Elayne needs to figure out and stop her captian of the guards12. The forsaken need to be handle, for real, this time.13. Huge armies needs to be amassed and moved toward the blight14. Whether Moraine is dead or not, she needs to show up again. My money is on her being bound to the horn now, but maybe she survived the fight against Lanfear and will find her way out. Perhaps, with the aid of Egwene.15. Padan Fain needs to be destroyed.16. The Tairen and Carhienan rebels need to be pacified, and Caroline and whats his face need to be married and gain the throne of a country.17. Rand, Elayne, Min and Avendeha need to get hitched18. People, especially Aes Sedia need accept Ashaman as not tainted anymore19. The whitecloaks need to be somehow destroyed or brought in line with Rand. Maybe Galad will take over the whitecloaks.20. All the darkfriends need to be handled in some way, especially Carridin.21. Lots of other minor storylines, like the fate of Liandrin need to be resolved.22. The darkfriends, shadowspawn, dreadlords, forsaken need to be destroyed in a final battle and the dark one destroyed or locked back up.23. Rand needs to die.Phew! That is a lot of storyline to wrap up and I bet I missed a few. CoT did nothing to move any of these along. So, supposedly, the next two books needs to do it.The biggest problem with this series is the readers. How many people here admit the series is getting worse and worse, yet feel like they can't leave it because they wasted all that time getting to this point. What sense is that? At the very least, wait until the series is finished, and then read the paperback. Falling into the trap of reading it, to read it, rewards Jordan for his crappy writing and encourages more of it. STOP THE MADNESS!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"First let me say, there is no bigger Wheel of Time fan than me. Great story, great characters, great writing (for the most part). Having said that, I have to say, making it though the pages and pages of never ending descriptions of dresses, teas, hair styles, tea cups, the porcelain tray the tea cup is sitting on, where the tray is from, who crafted it, the dream the crafter had the night before, how the crafter's wife has the absolute WRONG idea about current events in the world, how the crafter thinks he's got a good grip on what's happening even though the reader knows he's completely off too, and endless experiments on how many different ways a writer can write how an Aes Sedai can communicate disapproval was beyond taxing.By the time I was done reading, I was ready to drop kick the book if I read about another twitch of a shawl, rearranging of skirts, braid tug, disapproving sniff, disapproving snort, disapproving frown (and the subsequent smoothing of one's features hoping no one noticed), or yet another Aes Sedai standing looking at someone beneath them (who is basically everyone) with hands on hips and a disapproving scowl on their face. I think I'm seeing a pattern here; I think the book would have been a lot less painful to read if an Aes Sedai actually APPROVED of something for once, but I digress . . . (those of you who have read the book should be used to digression by now)With a very minor exception, every character is in exactly the same place and predicament at the end of the book as they were at the beginning. This wouldn't be so bad if the content was interesting but it just wasn't.Aes Sedai wear a bunch of different dresses with a myriad of patterns. Don't care.Elayne is being made to drink weak tea. Don't careThe Shaido are still around. Don't care.The Seanchan are still around. Don't care.Caemlyn is still under siege. Don't care.Perrin took 5 chapters to do nothing except buy some grain. Don't care.Cadsuane is still the single most annoying character in the history of literature. We knew this coming into the book and I didn't need or care to be reminded again.Don't care enough even to write about this thing I don't care about.All of these things I just mentioned would be fine if they were just mentioned once and left alone. The sad reality is that hearing about these things takes up 95% of the book.Back when the book first came out, I read some of the reviews posted here. After going through pages and pages of comments, only two of the reviews were positive. I finally bought the book last month thinking \\"those people are just exaggerating; the book can't be that bad\\".They weren't and it is."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"For those readers anxiously waiting for the Dark One to lash out with the first fell stroke of the Last Battle, you'll find it here in the Crossroads of Twilight. No, the vast armies of Trollocs and their Eyeless taskmasters don't boil forth from the Blight to overrun the heart of Randland, leaving only carnage and destruction in their wake; instead, in a dazzling and completely unforeseen plot twist, Shai'tan unleashes his legions of weevils against our unsuspecting heroes, and no one's grain is safe. I'm getting chills now just thinking about the brilliance of the move. Just think: weevils in the grain require winnowing, and winnowing cuts down on the profit margins of merchants, and lower profit margins means bankruptcy. I absolutely cannot wait for book 11, where we will surely see the entire economy collapse, and then it's just a small matter to bring this incredible series to a close. The Dark One will be revealed as an evil loan shark, and he'll break free from the Central Bank of Shayol Ghul and repossess every palace, dress-shop, and circus on the continent. I just hope Cadsuane can teach Rand some creative re-financing options before the situation becomes hopeless.Some other notable developments:The quality of tea has really taken a nosedive since the early books in the series, and it's starting to negatively impact the morale of our heroes. After all, what's the upside of fighting off pure evil if you can't even get a decent cup of tea when you're pregnant and temperamental?The Dark One inappropriately touches one of his minions. I'm expecting a sexual harassment lawsuit in the next volume.Hundreds of dresses are described in such intricate detail that I was able to sew exact replicas. I'm wearing one right now, in fact. For hundreds of other patterns, you can shop at wheeloftimewardrobe.com.We are introduced to the riveting social intricacies of the gai'shain laundering subculture.Perrin gets bored with his own plotline and breaks out of character for a minute before returning to form.Woolheads battle ninnies and hilarity ensues. Braid tugging is on the wane. Someone sniffs."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"1) A good writer has the ability to keep the reader's interest even when he is writing setup.2) A good writer masters the ability to time the execution of story-lines with appropriate pacing and a sense of the dramatic.3) A good writer does not need to spell every little thing out for the reader.4) A good writer knows how to keep his/her story focused.5) A good writer possesses the knowledge that a book consists of a beginning, a middle, and an end.6) A good writer respects his/her characters as individuals and recognize their unique abilities to develope in different directions.Let's take a look at Jordan, shall we?1) If Jordan had managed to keep his readers interested, he wouldn't be recieving 1-star reviews. Even when you are writing setup you need to keep the reader interested. Robin Hobb, for instance, does this by simply using a language so formidable that reading her words is in itself a pleasure. Jordan's words have become very bland and tasteless over the last few books, not unlike MacDonald's food.2) As any professional writer knows, when you are dealing with two or more parallell storylines you have to maintain some sort of balance between them and time the unfolding of events so that the reader is able to follow the different threads. You can either divide the different storylines into large \\"blocks\\" like Tolkien did in The Two Towers, or you can switch back and forth between them. If you have many different storylines, you have the wonderful advantage of being able to tell only the most interesting bits from each one - kindof like GRR Martin is doing in A Song of Ice and Fire. With so many different storylines in the loop, why would we want to read about people clippnig their toenails? Honestly, one wonders if not a good writer would have been able to derive more interesting events from all these storylines than people drinking tea, going to the tailor or styling their hair?3) Why does Jordan constantly dedicate half a page of text to every little feeling? A good writer, such as Robin Hobb for instance, only needs a few words to convey the same feeling. Why? Because she uses the groundwork she laid up in the early parts of her stories. She has introduced and developed her characters so skillfully that she after a while does not need to spend many pages describing them or their emotions. The reader knows them well enough to be able to understand their feelings without lengthy explanations. Why then does Jordan need pages and pages of laborously describing every little thing? Either he does not trust his readers to know his characters well enough, or he has simply confused lengthy descriptions with emotions.4) I think we can all agree that Jordan's story has become unfocused. The main characters are lost like extras in a soap-opera, just hanging around the set drinking coffee and waiting for someone to remember them, though unfortunately the producers seem more interested in filming new, fresh actresses doing threesomes and getting amnesia. In essence, the story of Wheel of Time is simple: there is a bad-guy and there is a good-guy who is destined to fight him. Why then are we reading about the main guy's ex girlfriend's friend's aunts drinking tea and discussing the weather? I'm not saying you can't take small trips away from the main story, but you need to return to it and keep the main story always moving forward. And to all the fans who defends this style of writing with that this deepens his world and how it's essential to the story, I can simply say: you are wrong. And I can also say that a good writer could have spent these hundreds and hundreds of pages deepening the world and adding essential parts to the story in a more fulfilling manner, for instance by keeping focus on the main characters and having them interact with the world around them instead of staying inside their heads, gibbering to themselves. My theory is that all of Jordan's mains are locked as characters. They can't interact with the world in a normal way anymore, and so he has to resort to secondary characters to do it. Except that there is a flaw in this: when a secondary character does it, it becomes redundant.5) A book should have a beginning, a middle and an end. A beginning to set things up (or, in the case of a sequel, bring the reader up to date), a middle to execute the plot of the book and do build-up for the ending, and an end which should contain some sort of dramatic climax to the build-up from the middle and the beginning of the book. Jordan does not seem to realise this. A book needs a plot of its own. It needs to be about something. Crossroads isn't. It is simply filler without any build-up in the beginning or any end that delivers anything to the reader. In the early books Jordan managed to keep a distinct theme for his books, the travels in the early columes, the great hunt, the chase for the sword in Tear and so on. His last installment totally lacks this. It is not a book that can even remotely be dreamed to stand on its own - as a book should to some extent, even if it's part of a series. Saying that he's doing like Tolkien and writing one long book and not a series is not a valid argument, as Tolkien wrote his entire series before he got published and there was plenty of oppertunity for both himself and for the editors to edit the book as a whole and to conside the series as a whole. Jordan can not pull this off, as his books are written one at a time. He has not means of going back and changing things in the earlier volumes that would need changing in order to convey a sense of this series being one long book rather than a series.6) Most of Jordan's female characters seem to have developed in the exact same direction, regardless of where they started. I honestly don't think I would notice if someone switched all the \\"Elayne\\"s on a page for \\"Nynaeve\\" or whomever. They all think the exact same way, use the same words, the same rhythm of speech, and they have basically the same opinions about everything. Except that Nynaeve feels that a braid is the only acceptable hairstyle and other characters have more lofty hair-morals. In any case, this is not the mark of a good writer. A good writer is a person whom after a certain length of text can write a line of dialogue without having to specify who said it or in what tone of voice - the reader can understand anyway if the author is good enough, and given only the choice of words, the reader can feel the tone of it. Robin Hobb is a master in this regard, and she can pull it off because all her characters have distinct personalities and just like real people they have different vocabularies and different rhythms of speech.Jordan is not a good writer. His writing is well below par for writers published by serious publishing houses. If you still believe he knows what he is doing, you are either deluded, nave or simply unable to recognize talent. A good writer would never have written this book or taken this series in this direction.I recommend you stop reading Jordan until he has finished this series completely (which would be at the earliest 2008, but that is optimistic). There are so many better writers out there!Read GRR Martin, Robin Hobb and CS Friedman instead!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is perhaps the worst book in the series so far. After a wait of over two years, we're presented with a series of unconnected snippets in which absolutely nothing happens. There is no forward movement whatsoever in the overall plot, and no issues are resolved. Most of the major characters are presented for a few brief chapters in which they essentially tread water, and we leave all of them at the end of the book pretty much where we found them at the beginning.It's pretty clear now that Jordan has no intention of wrapping this up in the forseeable future and going on to another project. It's sad to see a talented writer decide to milk a single concept for the rest of his career, rather than finishing it off and seeking a new challenge, but I'm convinced that this is the case with Jordan. The only question is, how many people will still be reading this series 10 or 15 years from now when it finally ends with book 17 or 18? I know I won't be. As far as I'm concerned, this series is dead."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"PREQUEL TO MY REVIEWI shook my head incredulously. Light, of all the bloody ashes... I look over to the book. It lies there, as plain as it ever been, as plain as the horns on a trolloc. 700 pages. 700 bloody pages?! Blood and ashes. Of all the boneheaded, stubborn things... Well, there's nothing for it now, I decided, and with a sniff of my nose I looked up from the book, and with a hard sniff, a sniff that in Ebon Dar might make strong men faint and women gasp, I turned sternly towards the keyboard. A memory flashed in my head unbidden. I am not sure where it came from; it could be from any of the nine books that I read before in this series, memories that would have been long resting in the cold, return shelves of the library, or in the scandalous embrace of another. \\"Blood and ashes,\\" I muttered through my teeth, and despite the gentle weather, I shivered and drew my coat closer to me, folding it carefully.\\"I never saw run-on sentences before that extended this long,\\" I brooded darkly. That is, if a reader can brood, and I detected a twinkie in the hard, frozen reaches of my freezer. Readers are just supposed to FAWN at Robert Jordan, and this is most decidedly out of the ordinary. \\"I am going to write the review,\\" I decided, and light be blasted! But what is it that the review needed? Is it a woman? I frowned, and wringled my nose, a move that is more a force of habit than out of irritation. Women! What does Robert Jordan find so hard to understand about them? I wondered. Light! By the way he talks about them once every paragraph, this novel is more fit as the pre-puberty study of a taraboner stable boy than a fantasy novel! I shook my head, quickly banishing the thought. No, no... perhaps there is some grander conspiracy at work here... The ageless face of an Aes Sedai looked out at my memory, laughing at me, tugging suggestively on my lower intestine and her braid at the same time.That did it, I decided, I'm really going write a review this time. The memory at the edge of my consciousness tugged again at her braid, hard, and bit her lip as hard as she can. Light, would that woman ever shut up? Women. I can never understand them. I've decided to read the words more carefully, however, the names just started to give me a headache. Bevedine or Beradine? or maybe it is Bevin and Moadine and veradine and bevelleihillbillienineOtwoOneOdine. I can never remember their faces. Only the songs, like some rude limerick, ring mockingly at my ears... \\"There once was a man with a name like Jordan, sold his book and want to be like Tolkien, so he went out one day and started to write, and next thing you know he screwed the children of light... whitecloaks that is, Altarian sea... \\"I sighed, put down my keyboard, and rubbed my eyes. Light! I must be getting on with the review.CHAPTER ONE: TIME TO BE GONEThe Wheel of Time turns, and Books come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Book that gave it birth comes again. In one Book, called the Tenth Book by some, a Book yet to be written, a Book already burned, a yawn rose in the Crossroads of Twilight. The Yawn is not the beginning, there are neither beginning nor endings in the Wheel of Time (not if Jordan is still paid by the word.) But it is a beginning.BEGIN REAL REVIEWOK look here guys, I admit, the first few books had been fun. And you know why? I got one word for you. DragonBall. It is pretty cool when Goku went out and kicked some ass each episode huh? Yeah, one forsaken each book. Super Rand attack. But let's face it. There's only so much that he can DO, before we realized that the Wheel of Time is about as complicated as Pokemon when they are still out there collecting Gym Badges. \\"I defeat the Aiel Guardian! I receive power-up -- Heron Mark V. 2!\\"Yeah. The guy is running out of ideas.So what does he do? Can he save some shred of dignity and credibility by ending the series gracefully, in an ultimate episode of Wheel of Time Extreme! (tm) and a final showdown between Super Rand W and the Dark One?No.He tries to make it into a series of intrigue, of mystery, of boring dialogue.Which is pretty sad folks. I mean, that kind of depth takes PLANNING. It takes EFFORT. Also, it takes the wisdom of seeing a dead horse, and refrain from beating it.If you want an in-depth novel, I would suggest Gene Wolfe. Now that is complexity without obfusication, and true depth folks. This book is like watching the Thought of the Day from the Jerry Springer Show."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I started reading this series at the beginning of high school, now I am about to finish college, and I think I will have completed grad school, a postdoc, and gotten tenure by the time this series is finished. After finishing the first 6 books, I was mesmerized. They were outstanding; fantastic characters, cool story, etc. I started getting disappointed with book 8, and it has only gotten worse. Even after book 8, I defended the series to all of my disappointed friends who had thoughts of abandoning WOT, explaining away their criticisms saying that the recent unremarkable additions to the series were merely foreshadowing awesome events to come. But after reading book 10, I am going to have to side with them, my patience has worn thin. I don't think I will be able to abandon the series entirely, but I keep getting excited for the new releases only find myself frustrated and annoyed after finishing them.As stated by many others, the plot goes absolutely nowhere in book 10. Nowhere! I still don't know how that is possible considering the size of the book, but it's true. As I pushed on through the book, I began to get worried because it didn't seem like anything big was going to happen, and that feeling climaxed to disappointment as I reached the end. Unfortunately, you can summarize this entire book in about five lines. Also, as previously stated by other reviewers, Rand, the main character mind you, barely plays a role and the other characters progress at a turtle's pace. I am talking about the slowest turtle that has ever been or will be on the face of the earth.Robert Jordan needs to realize that he doesn't need to explain every little detail if he has already explained it before, multiple times. If you're reading book 10, chances are you have heard of Aiel, know what an Ajah is, and are familiar with the Seanchan. I like details, but I don't need them repeated to me just to fill up space. Considering that the cover price of this book was more than any of the others, I suggest the next one be free to all who purchased this one. I don't know how many more chances I can give Mr. Jordan to redeem himself."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Yep. Like they all said, it's the Bride of the Son of the Dance of Swords.If you're even reading this review, you are one of the millions like me. Jordan's first half dozen volumes came, you saw them, and you were conquered. So we *will* keep slogging through these things, because we can't help but care about how those characters we became enthralled with so long ago ultimately make out. Even though there's precious little lately to keep us caring.I'll give it two and a half stars. There are no mighty events anywhere, and (except for the mystery of the ravaged town where Perrin travels for supplies) no new plot elements. Still, several major decisions are ultimately made; and Mat's storyline, gingerly romancing the Seanchan princess he accidentally kidnapped in the last book, is quite enjoyable.But this one makes me worry deeply about the subsequent installments. Winter's Heart had me hoping for an upcoming return to form, but now I have to wonder if Jordan has completely forgotten what fascinates readers. It's not being told, for each and every one of thirty Caemlyn courtiers, which ones have embroidery that clashes with their surcoats. And it's not being told, for each and every one of fifty Aes Sedai, which one will win a who-has-the-haughtiest-stare contest with each of the others. And it's not straining to remember, from the last volume but one, which minor character was a Darkfriend, and which one with a virtually identical name was a trustworthy hero.It's not really true that *nothing* happens in this volume. If Mr. Jordan had sliced out all the page-filling tactics I just mentioned, we'd have had a talky but entirely engaging 300 page episode. My sense of wonder is not nourished by breathless observations of sartorial and pecking-order detail that could be transposed verbatim into a tale of triumph and heartbreak at an antebellum Savannah grand cotillion.When volume 11 comes out, I'll wait for the paperback. It'll be easier on my wallet - and then I can go straight on to the 12th (if I still haven't given up, and I suspect I won't have) with a bit sharper recollection of which indistinguishable windfinder is apprenticed to the Kin with which distinctive hairdo."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have to confess . . . I read this book hoping against hope that it would progress the story, tie up loose ends and begin to weave together the tapestry. It does none of those things.I thought the first few books were darn near Tolkien . . . the last three or four books really have nailed down Jordan's legacy. A man for whom no story is too long, no trite phrase can be repeated enough, and ulimately a man who cares more about selling copy that writing.I WILL NEVER READ ANOTHER JORDAN BOOK AGAIN . . . in contrast, I will read everything written by David Gemmell or George Martin."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Okay, I know everyone has complained a lot about this bookand so I want to too!No, but just one complaint that I haven't seen too much,what ever you think about the whole Rand 4some, you must be as tired as me of hearing:I love Rand!

And to be honest, I can't recall whether these characters even appeared in book 9? (8? 7?) Jordan, (or this poor clone of a once worthwhile author), is lost in a world of his own devising, filling pages with repetitive meaningless bickering between equally un-sympathetic characters, reviews of events from previous books, and tragically little plot progression. I'm a fantasy nut, a collector at heart, who usually is willing to own and re-read previous books in a series when a new one comes out. The sheer volume of this series (what is it, like 8000 pages?) makes that impossible... so I'm lost, disinterested in most of the 42 plotlines that seem to be running, and completely disillusioned with this author and series. You'll be seeing my used copies for sale... if there are any buyers out there. Parents, don't buy this for your kids; fellow fantasy nuts, don't buy this for yourselves; it's become less painful to leave the series incomplete on the shelf than to continue supporting the creation of this drivel."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I know, yet more negative feedback for CoT. But damnit, this book EARNED each and every one of these bad reviews. Skimming the vast numbers of poor reviews on the site, I'm struck that the majority of reviewer's background is similar to mine: initially we were all HUGE Jordan fans. We all counted the days till the shipping of the next book. We flocked to websites, newsgroups, message boards eager to discuss the happenings of Randland. But now anticipation and zeal has been replaced by frustration and increasingly, indifference.Lets look at CoT itself. 3 major things about it I disliked.1) Yet another tedious never-ending 100+ page prologue, consisting of irrelevant characters who matter NOT ONE BIT to either the story arc of CoT (if indeed CoT has a story arc) or the larger story arc of the series. Text that neither advances the story or developes MAIN RELEVANT characters is worthless, and represents a significant challenge to the reader to get through.2) Irrelevant characters in irrelevant plot pieces is bad, but not as bad as relevant characters in irrelevant plot pieces. Perrin's entire story line with the 'city of the dead' came out of nowhere. A previous reviewer bemoaned this ridiculous storyline and how &quot;tacked on&quot; it felt, and I totally am in agreement. What did this accomplish? How is Perrin's character further developed here? Even worse is Egwene. The previous novel (just as bad as this one) set the stage for a battle royale for control of the White Tower. And what do we have instead? Countless and pointless Aes Sedai debates. Has everyone forgotten that the apocalyptic mother of all battles is just around the corner? This fact seems to have slipped everyone's mind, including the author's.3)If you've read the litany of the previous reviewers this will be getting old by now, but in CoT NOTHING HAPPENS! After completing the novel, I knew precious little more than I did before reading it. Even the most important event in the story (which occurs in the last few pages) takes place OFF STAGE! We don't even see it!!! But we get copious information about the divided riding skirts of each and every Aes Sedai. (The complete wardrobe of EVERY inhabitant of Randland is noted in excruciating detail.) This book is a treasure trove for Renaissance Fair costume designers. Unfortunately such detail makes for bad fiction.I used to love this series. but after completing CoT, my affection for this series is all but gone. I'll read to the bitter end, as I've invested too much time and energy with these characters to let them go so easily, but as the quality of each book vastly diminishes, I'm all but certain that a bitter end is all that's awaiting."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"i think you will all agree that this book was, by far, the worst of Robert Jordan's books. i expected better of him, but i guess this is the pinnacle of his talent. (sigh)however i think that this book could do with some revising, a lot of rewriting, and much more creativity and such. for example i don't care to read about the full-of-herself Elayne sitting in a bathtub pondering her life--pages turn and nothing happens.i also think that the characters lose more and more of their appeal (at least, to me). for example Rand is completely blocked out of most of this book and when you get to a paragraph of him it is when he is either mad, insane, angry, helpless, or desperately lost. what happened to the more interesting Rand you see in the beginning books? you barely can know his thoughts anymore.all i know is that i am tired of Mat saying &quot;Bloody ashes&quot; and people saying &quot;Light help me&quot; every other page. i am tired of dull and repetitive sayings and Rand, Mat, and Perrin complaining that they don't know how the female mind thinks and feeling sorry for themselves. i am tired of Perrin searching desperately for his dearly beloved stupid girl Faile since the eighth book (tPoD). i am tired of hearing Aes Sedai fixing their shawls and trying to seem emotionless. i am tired of the characters (Lan is ok), most especially the females. most of all, i am tired of skimming through the entire book (i finished in one day) only to find that i have wasted valuable time with this...this worthless thing. (forgive me for speaking my mind) :)please someone inform RJ that long and tedious books are a hundred times more torture than short and even remotely interesting books. :) i think he is a little out of his mind right now but that's ok. one must respect others.basically this is what i am trying to say: it was boring. i do not like boring things. nor do i intend to recommend this to anyone except those who i figure could do with some amount of torture.i talked to a friend and (s)he also agreed that Jordan is losing his mind and writing ability. hopefully he will pick up in the eleventh...no, maybe a hundredth...book. (not really) actually i think that it will take 77 years for RJ to complete half of the first half of the eleventh book... (ha) maybe we will not even live long enough to see the end of this series. which is pitiful because it was such an interesting beginning.one can only sigh at the downward slope that fantasy is at these Forsaken days.oh yes, have i failed to mention that RJ is wasting a great amount of good paper (which comes from trees which are very important for survival) in publishing this thing?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I don't have to go into much detail here - I can't say much that is different from the other hundreds of negative reviews already listed on this website. What I can say is that I am not buying anymore of Mr. Jordan's books. I was 21 back when I started reading this &quot;epic&quot; series - I'm now 34 and there is no end in sight. Mr. Jordan's longwinded style of prose, nauseating attention to detail and lack of any direction have now killed any future interest in these books that I may have ever had. Please take my advice and that of all of the other readers - avoid these books! Life is too short and the fantasy world is filled with much better authors than this one."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is my first Amazon.com review, so I carefully reviewed their guidelines before putting my fingers to the keys. They informed me to \\"be sure to focus [my] comments on the book's content.\\" Well, please pardon my confusion, but what contents are there in this book to discuss?The only thing that happened while I was reading this book was that my opinion of Robert Jordan as a vivid and entertaining writer was completely obliterated. I am now irritated by characters I used to love, impatient with decriptions that used to engage my senses, and disgusted with an author who used to be inspiring.I used to have a rule that I never began a fantasy series before the author had concluded it. I broke that rule in favor of this series. (Partly because some moronic Sales Associate at Barnes & Noble told me that it was finished.) Now I remember exactly why I made that rule in the beginning.Robert Jordan's bio says that he intends to keep writing until they \\"nail his coffin shut.\\" I have the nails ... does anyone have a hammer?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As the other 1500+ reviewers have indicated, this book is only for those die-hard fans who think that anything RJ writes is fantastic. This is only for those who think that they owe some loyalty to a writer who hasn't moved his plot lines along for several YEARS, or for those who think that anyone who disagrees with them &quot;must not appreciate good fiction,&quot; &quot;must not understand Jordan,&quot; have &quot;short attention spans,&quot; or (my favorite) must not &quot;have a brain.&quot; Obviously these reviews were by children with low standards (or adults who pride themselves on their Klingon). If you look at the majority of adult reviews, they clearly indicate that this book is, in fact, awful. It's much worse than the two before it, though it's pretty close. Again, if you are the kind of die-hard fan who defends drivel just because they can't stand to see their hero criticized, then read away. If you have higher standards--plot, believable characters, characters who don't all act in the same (stupid) way, original ideas (don't get me started)--then jump ship and read something else."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"An utterly useless piece of literature. It is a shame that the series that involved me so deeply into the world of fantasy has come to this. Mr. Jordan clearly lost his talent for engaging writing. To believe that anyone would find this almost 700 pages of minutia entertaining is clearly delusional.If I haven't made my point yet allow me clarify: NOTHING happens in this book. The entire book could be summarized in a few concise paragraphs."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well. I'd say it's about time to give Jordan a round of applause. He has managed to do what few even come close to---write a full length fantasy novel and have -nothing- happen, and have -none- of the plotlines resolved, or even being -close- to being resolved!The repititions are grating on the nerves, the pages spent describing how to launder silk (among other things) are unbearable, and the lack of PLOT is appalling. Did I mention that I was falling asleep trying to push my way through the first four hundred pages, hoping against hope that something, ANYTHING would happen. Nope. And then it just ends, and it's like you're staring at the book like &quot;Oh my God this book is beyond horrible&quot;Please, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK. If you -must- read it get it from the libary. But honestly you can just skip it. I know I'm never buying a hardcover Wheel of Time book again."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is now, unfortunately, cementing Robert Jordan's legacy. After 5 volumes of the most amazing fantasy ever put to page and a sixth that, at the time, seemed to be a bridge to the end. We have now read the fourth book in a row where very little to nothing happens. In fact in this book nothing happens but talking and more talking. I think I am as fond of these characters as anyone who reads these books but it is extremely frustrating to wait for two years for a new entry and then to be treated to, yet again, nothing. The book is well written but that is not enough. The characters are talking about doing interesting things but by the end they do nothing. The saddest commentary I have on this book is that I think I can tell any future reader of this series that you can just skip this book, nothing of any importance happens. The sadness comes from watching the most promising author since Tolkein fritter away the possibility to make something great due to his total inability to keep his story moving forward. As I think on the future, and I hope Mr. Jordan will eventually decide to finish things up. My greatest fear is that despite what Mr. Jordan says he doesn't know how to end this series and is now irreversibly mired in writer's block. An aside for those who might not know, Mr. Jordan has said on a number of occasions that he knew what the last scene in the series was from the moment he started to write it and the series would be as many volumes as it took for him to get to that scene. I wish I felt we were making progress towards that final scene instead of aimlessly wandering. I realize when I recommend this series there's going to have to be one huge warning to a new reader. It will go something like this; the first six books are amazing but you're going to have to slog through the next 2500 pgs. (and counting) of repetitive conversations and plot that moves at the pace of a glacier before it picks up (I hope!) in the last 2 or 3 books. I thought it inconceivable that I would ever give a book in this series one star, but that is all this deserves. The most polite term for this book is filler. The unfortunate reality is, it is an example of a writer deteriorating before our eyes. More's the pity."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What ever happened to the rule \\"don't write anything that doesn't develop characters or plot\\"? This is the worst installment in the series to date. If you like to buy books for no reason I highly recommend Crossroads of Twilight. This book was published for an extra paycheck. Almost nothing happens. More Aes Sedai (hundreds at this point) running around whining and bellyaching. Perrin is still searching, and with the exception of about ten pages, nothing worth reading. Mat is interacting with the DotNM, and has about twenty pages worth reading. Rand has five pages. Egwene has one page worth reading, but that is no surprise because she has been boring me since Shadow Rising. Did I mention Elayne, there's no need to. There is also about fifteen pages about the inner workings in the White Tower and some Darkfriends worth reading, otherwise don't bother.This book was written to extend the series. My recommendation is save your money."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Although I have thoroughly enjoyed this series since a friend turned me on to it, I am very much disappointed with this book.The plot was not developed further in any way. The characters were not further developed. Most frustrating of all was the complete absence of any action in the book! This, of course, is excluding the predicament Egwene finds herself in in the last few pages of the book.It seems that all of the characters and Jordan are taking a vacation from resolving any of the issues from the series. If you've not already bought this book, skip it and see what is said about the next installment a couple of years from now."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I promised myself that I would get this \\"monkey\\" off my back at book 9 but here we are at book 10 and the product is so diluted that breaking the habit is easy. There will be no book 11 or 15 or 20 purchase for me thank you. This scam has run its course. The series started with such promise and built upon itself and peaked many books ago with Lord of Chaos (book 6) in my opinion. As hard as it was to put down books 1 through 6 it becomes increasingly easy to put down subsequent books until the thought of even wasting your money stops and you start to move on to other much better fantasy like the Georege RR Martin or Tad Williams. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. If I could give the book negative 5 stars I would do so."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This series has been going on since I was a teenager. This series has been going on for like, one-third of my life. (Don't caluclate that, I'm bad at math ;-) The last series that dragged me around like that was The Tales of Alvin Maker by Orson Scott Card -- more than a decade of wating (close to 15 yrs, I think!) between the third and fourth books. The thing about that, though? Is that the payoff was more or less worth it, and the things that have been promised are actually coming to pass.I stopped reading this series (WoT) at around Book five (back in late '96 or thereabouts) NOT because I disliked it, it was actually pretty good -- but because I could see where I was being led. It was beginning even then -- the characters becoming interchangeable. It wasn't enough that somebody gained a power, they had to suddenly and miraculously become the most amazing, the most awesome and powerful whatever it was since time began. And it was happening to EVERYBODY. Which begs the question -- what threat is there from the bad guys?? When absolute power becomes average and status quo, what excuse is there for more story?That and the fact that it's hellish to wait a year or more, drooling with nervous excitment and anticipation for each installment when you're a teen. (D'ya hear that, George R. R. Martin!??) And then you have to reread the whole thing anyway just to remember what happened, and so on and so forth...So I decided -- NOT to abandon the series -- but to just wait until it had been concluded, and then I would buy the whole set and read it straight through, nice and fresh. (I didn't realize I was making a commitment of decades!)And then as time went by and the reviews got more and more... eh... piqued... I decided I'd get them from the library.And then as time went on, I became an adult and was no longer able to remember what had appealed to me in the first place (I still had hope! I had plans to reread and rekindle).But then when I found out about the deal (read: $$$) to stretch a 7 book series to... what is is now, twelve? Fourteen? Sixty-three? I just got angry and felt very very used. It shows a lack of respect for an audience that loves you and is, frankly, your bread and butter, and for their powers of discernment.I'm not speaking from ignorance, by the way. I have picked up installments in the series during the interim, including this one, if only to see what number installment is out THIS year, #38 or #45? -- flipped through them in stores and libraries. It doesn't take much to see that NOTHING is being RESOLVED (none of the original plot that drew me into the books in the beginning). You can tell that from the freaking jacket copy (and I was comitting for maybe a hundred pages a pop). And after four books worth of nothing resolved -- it becomes a chore instead of a joy. It becomes... well. I'm preaching to the choir now.Hence the title of my little review -- thanks Amazon! Because of you guys, I know I'm not missing anything."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Don't buy this book. Really. Just say 'no'.

I made it to Book 5, and then for some strange reason (not enough time, found better authors to read, etc...), I just stopped. I didn't think Jordan was a terrible writer, he just seemed to be covering the same ground with his books, a la Robert Ludlum, Tom Clancey, or Anne Rice. Some authors run out of fresh ideas quicker than others and Jordan seemed faster in this regard than most. Still, I thought the series was worth what I paid for the paperbacks when I was in college.Then, a month ago, I got deployed to the Middle East to a command post job and I saw a copy of \\"Eye of the World\\" and decided to restart the series. \\"Eye of the World\\" was still entertaining enough for me to recommend it to a reader unaquainted with Jordan, but I got some bad news for you guys - some of the things that are driving people crazy about CoT are all present in Book 1. True, these flaws were hidden by the novelty of the setting and the action-packed plot, but they are still there. For instance:- Bitchy female characters who constantly slam men? Check.- Sniffing in disapproval? Tugging that !@#$^& braid? Check.- Repetitive adjectives and adverbs? Check.No weevils or tea drinking in the first book, so at least I was spared that. To be fair, I tracked down a copy of CoT, just to skim it and see if the One Star Brigade was right. Yep, they were right.So it sounds like Jordan got rid of the good things from Book One (action, suspense, character development) and went overboard with the bad (stiff dialogue, redundant redundancy, etc...) and made reading CoT an excruciating experience for the average Jordan fan.For you first-time Jordan readers, do yourselves a favor. Read Books 1 thru 4 if you absolutely feel the need. Enjoy them, then grab some George R.R. Martin, Frank Herbert, Dan Simmons or Elizabeth Moon. Read any of their series and get your money's worth.However, if you have insomnia, love bad writing and hate the male half of the species, buy Books 5 through 10-and-counting."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Goodness there's a lot of whining going on about this book. Most of it includes the claim \\"nothing happens.\\" What those who make that assertion mean is that no climactic (\\"cast of thousands\\") battle takes place nor is there a dramatic showdown between Rand and one of the never-say-die Forsaken as has been a common ending for other books in the series. However, to say nothing happens is ridiculous and simple minded. Quite a lot happens - there's more to this story than battles and showdowns. The book does NOT consist of blank pages as you might conclude from reading other reviews. It contains some of the most interesting character and relationship development of any of the WoT books. Some nasty folk get their just deserts and others turn out to be more complicated and perhaps a touch less nasty then we formerly believed. And some of our heroes turn out to be a touch MORE nasty than we formerly believed. Characters are faced with, and make, tough choices. The ending leaves you desperate for the next chapter. If you need continuous battles and to-the-death confrontations (though there certainly are some of those) then your time might be better spent on video games. If your devotion to the series includes an appreciation for a bit more subtlety and intricate plot development, you'll probably enjoy this installment. I sure did."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Perrin finally returns and plays the role he deserves. Rand has always been a lackluster character in my opinion but in the secondary characters of Mat and Perrin, Jordan seems able to draw out real insight into the way humans act and behave. This is no \\"The Idiot\\" but it is definately a character driven story if anyone would ever take the time to look at them and how they behave. The characters and the well developed world in which they live brings it all together into an impossible to put down book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Readers remind me of TV junkies. They want it all too fast. Relax and enjoy the story - when Jordan finishes the Wheel of Time, reading the entire cycle through will be a pleasure. But reading these reviews reminds me of a vapid TV audience screaming and drooling for more gratuitous sex and violence. Hey, I love gratuitous sex and violence - but I also love fully rendered stories! It's the difference between Renaissance Art and Pornography.Don't get me wrong, this was the least pleasurable installment of the WoT to read. The story development was interesting and engaging so many characters was fun, but Jordan's writing itself seemed rushed and not as polished as in his other works. Even some of the old Conan books were better stylistically. I for one could have done without the huge numbers of the word THE used in the every the description the (Kind of like Tom Clancy, ISN'T IT? WASN'T IT? DIDN'T IT?). There were some sentences that made no sense standing by themselves, and others that had typos! Typos?! Editors fall asleep?A story must have breath to fill itself in. This book was the pause between breaths in the WoT, and I hope Jordan keeps writing whatever he wants for as long as he wants - no matter how impatient and shortsighted his fans are. Some of the words used are clearly Japanese influenced, and the work of the WoT reminds me of Akira Kurosawa films - think fully developed. Nobody complains that Ran is too long and could loose 20% of the character development! Oh, excuse me - sections where nothing happens. So? So Mr. Jordan: Don't sell out; keep it real; and don't become a ... Artist (Phillip K. Dick)."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I thought the first book of the series was really stupid. Jordan can't write.

Would buy from them again"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"First I would like to say what I actually thought about this book. First off I will say that this book kept me just as - if not more - inticed as any of the other book (with the exception of maybe The Shadow Rising) and I found myself reading page after page and without realizing the sun starting to come up because I had read all night and finished a few hundred pages. I was amazed with Mat's chapters, Mat has been my favorite character since Lord of Chaos and I just think that he is very well developed along with the rest of his gang. I also enjoyed reading everyone else's chapters, but I think Elayne and Egwene should have lost a chapter or two in order to give more time to Rand (who everyone wanted to hear more about). Perrin's chapters, I must admit, were tedious if only for the fact that he needs to get Faile back already and toughen up a little! I know he has always been the cautious one, but come on! I really did enjoy this book from beginining to end and I really enjoyed the chapters which were dedicated to the secondary characters of the book.Now, what I Think that Jordan was doing was both giving us one last look at the main characters of the story in and bring us up to date on all the secondary characters. People complain that there are too many characters and they should just be taken out, but personally I would like to hear more from all the secondary characters. I don't mean give them their own chapters, but still mroe would be good. I have also been dissapointed with the more recent books because amazing characters such as Juilin and Thom (ESPECIALLY Thom!) have had nothing to do with the overall plot of the story. Jordan said in an interview that the series would be 12 books long so what he is doing now is getting the reader caught up on everything that is going to be important to the end of the series and the Final Battle. I believe that what Crossroads of Twilight was was &quot;The Calm Before the Storm&quot; so to speak. This book had little or no action in it, but the politics and mystery of the book was absolutly amazing. Unfortunatly, Fantasy writing has become the hunge industry that it is for one reason. It is the only genre in which an impatient reader can read a book because they expect only action and for that impatient reader who cannot see a great story line and plot when it is right under their nose, they will not enjoy this book as well as a real literary fan might (these are the people that I think have been writing the the reviews and saying how Jordan has ruined the series, Of course not all of these reviewers are as I have said, but I believe most are). So for the real literary fan and a fan of the best fantasy series in circulation, you will love this book hopefully as much as I did. For those of you who want action and quick pased writing without the greatest sub-plots and characters then you probably won't like this book.I do think, however, that the next book MUST have certain things for me to keep my opinions.1. Must have conclusions to everyone side plots2. End with only the Final Battle to look ahead to3. Have much action. I said that this was a good book and it did not need action, but there cannot be two books in a row like that.4. All the main characters must come together finallySo in conclusion. This book is an amazing read whatever happens, but for me to keep my faith in the series as strongly as I always have, it does have to get to the end. As I said, this book must be &quot;the Calm before the Storm&quot; otherwise I might start siding with the other half of the people who have read this book and not liked it and in turn have started to not like the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book was good because it told you about all of the things that had been in its prequil (I think the Path of Daggers) and it led up to its sequil The Knife of Dreams. Robert Jordan had to make this kind of slow to catch up with ALL the characters and show all of the politics going on at that time. If you read the series then this book is great because it leads up to everything in teh next book which I consider the best in the series The Wheel of Time."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is the first review I've ever submitted on Amazon, but I was so outraged by this book that I felt I owed it to my fellow readers to warn them. I've also got to submit my one-star rating to do my bit in keeping the overall rating of this book as low as possible, and to counter the occasional five-star reviews I've seen, all of which were undoubtedly submitted by Jordan's wife, mother, children or dog.Like the vast majority of the reviewers, I avidly devoured the first several books in this series, and have been increasingly disappointed in the rapidly declining quality of the last four or five. However, this one is beyond bad. And since I'm sure Jordan's wife or mother will submit a five star review shortly following mine saying that I'm stupid/have no appreciation for complex political plots/don't know good writing when I see it, let me say that I am NOT a fan of hack and slash fantasy, and love complicated political plots. If that's your preference, read George R.R. Martin or Guy Gavriel Kay, each of whom can pack more complex plot twists, emotional intensity and thrilling intrigue into one book than Jordan has put in ten.Enough reviewers have commented on the endless and repetitive descriptions of the complete wardrobe of the hundreds of characters and the Elayne's gut-wrenching tragic hardship of being doomed to drinking weak tea for the next nine months that I don't need to focus my review on those issues. So, a few personal pet peeves:1) The hundreds of minor characters, none of whom I recognize or care about. For the last several books, I used to wonder if these were new characters, or a reprisal of a minor character whom I didn't recognize or care about from four books ago. Not being masochistic, I never cared enough to slog my way through the previous several books of drivel to satisfy my curiousity on this point. But the quality of this book has reached such a nadir that I found myself numb to this question. I just don't care any more.2) The one-dimensionality of the characters. Several other people have commented on this, but I'd go beyond even saying all the characters are one-dimensional. Jordan changes the shallow aspect of each character's personality whenever he chooses. For instance, in the beginning of the series, Nynaeve was depicted as a confident, assured woman. Now, she's an insecure little whiner. Actually, all it takes for EVERY character in the series to revert immediately to the mentality of a sulky adolescent is for a Wise One to lift an eyebrow at them.But now on to a specific review of the plot of this book... Wait a minute. Plot? There was a plot? I didn't notice any plot...To those of you who think this book is just a set-up for future books, and the next book is sure to be wonderful, far be it from me to dispel that illusion if cherishing it brings you comfort. All I will say is that that's what I've been saying to myself ever since Book 7. After FOUR BOOKS OF FILLER, the light has finally dawned for me, though.To those of you who are determined to stick this series through to the bitter end (however many decades in the future that end may be) who think you have to read this one to keep abreast of plot developments, I have a very valuable tip for you which will save you hours of teeth-gnashing frustration - Pick the book up in the bookstore or library and read the last three pages. You will then be fully conversant with all of the so-called progress made in the plot of this 700 page waste of paper and shelf space."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am not a troglodyte of literature. I am not stupid, uneducated (degree from US Naval Academy at Annapolis), or incapable of reading densely written prose (I love Doestoyevsky and Stephen R. Donaldson). My uncle introduced me to the series in the early 90's, and I read all of them voraciously. I noticed a trend around book 5 or 6 that there was a notable lack of plot development and found myself skimming through pages to get to plot revelations. It got worse from there. By CoT, I put it down before I reached the 100th page. I never picked it back up. I couldn't take it anymore. Nothing happened. Repetitive writing. No character or plot development. No action. Nothing. There was nothing to stimulate my imagination or hold my interest. Any of the above literary devices might have done it, but it lacked all of them.I feared that I was losing my mind, and my ability to concentrate. So went back and re-read LoTR, 1st Chronicle of Thomas Covenant, and then a historical treatise on the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict written by a preofessor I'd studied under in college. Finished 'em all. I began to suspect it it wasn't me, and when I looked this book up on Amazon my suspicions were confirmed. This was a terrible book, and it further drags down a once promising series. I always thought that this whole series should only have taken at most seven books. The last three books have been atrocious. This series is at least 2400 pages too long, which is not coincidentally more than LoTR, Chronicles, or the history of the world's oldest and bloodiest conflict.

What little that happens in this book can easily be summarized in a paragraph or two and you will save yourself countless hours of boredom. On the upside, this book is a tremendous sleep aid. I've read some of the few positive reviews about this book that laud it as a necessary set up piece for Book 11. A 700 page set up piece?! Come on! We are human beings, not ents. This is an epic fantasy series - throw us a frickin' bone here. The only thing epic about this series now is Jordan's self indulgence."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Warning: Spoilers ahead.Nothing goes anywhere! Except some good stuff between Mat and Tuon. For that, I give the book two stars. Otherwise... I'm a fast reader, but the fact that I finished this book /this/ fast means that I did a lot more skimming then actual reading. The number of people who do not appear, or have only a cameo, is astounding. Include in that ALL the Forsaken except Mesaana, Nynaeve, Cadsuane, Fain, Slayer, Thom, *Rand and Min* - heck, RJ spends more time talking about what one of Graendal's stooges is doing then he focuses on Rand. Everyone seems to take the destruction of Shadar Logoth calmly enough, the rebels are still sitting outside Tar Valon, Mat's still on the run, Perrin's still hunting for Faile... *yawn* Can we get some plot advancement? Maybe?Checking it out at the library is definitely the way to go with this one. It's not worth the cover price."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Seriously, I can't take it anymore. This series started out as one of the best ones ever written, and has deteriorated into some of the most boring sop I've ever read. There is no fixing it. Jordan has ruined what could have been his legacy by giving in to his own greed and dragging the story out book after book. I will not deign to reward him by buying number 11.

For years I have marvelled over the extraordinary complexity of Mr. Jordan's world-building skills and the continued attention to detail. Like so many others, I eagerly awaited the tenth installment, Crossroads, and having now read it, can say that Mr. Jordan has lost control over the story-line as he focuses on peripheral characters or avoids advancing the plot in favor of character development.Lets face it, if the characters are not fleshed out sufficiently after 9 books and their goals and motivations revealed, its just not going to happen in book 10. Moreover, it is long past time that certain events took place. For example, two books back the &quot;rebel&quot; Aes Sedai commenced the siege of the White Tower. Except wait, by the end of book 10, it still doesn't happen (sorry to give that away).Something's been going on with Mazrim Taim and the Black Tower for over three books, but no plot advancement there in book 10 either. (While we could speculate, wouldn't it just be nice to actually know by this time).I could go on, but in short, I only have the following to say:Enough is enough."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I CANNOT believe how anyone could have appreciated this installment. The people who write good reviews MUST be lying, or voluntarily blinding themselves. I really had to force-feed my brain to keep on reading this rag.How could this be? I am flabbergasted by the downfall of the wheel of time (no caps). I still remember yelling with surprise and delight all through the first four books. Those days are long gone. The last books (generally speaking) were so loaded with ridiculous and pathetic twists and comments that reading them sometimes made me uncomfortable.Jordan MUST finish off this mortally wounded epic, it just plain ol'sucks."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If I were an eighth grade English student writing a review of this book in the three paragraph essay format assigned by my teacher, it would probably look something like this:I think that Circle of Twilight by Robert Jordan proves that the author is addicted to meth-amphetamines.First, crank fiends talk about lots of stupid stuff and never stop, just like Robert Jordan. For example, in one part Robert Jordan describes Egwene's dress for an entire page. Second, speed freaks always start talking about one thing and then forget about it and move on to another thing because they are high and can't think clearly. This reminds me a lot of Robert Jordan. For instance, in the prologue Robert Jordan talked about a bunch of characters, but later in the book he didn't talk about them at all. I think this is because he is high. Lastly, because they are addicted, drug addicts need lots of money to buy drugs and so does Robert Jordan. This is why he keeps writing these books even though they are not very good. He needs money to buy speed.For these reasons, I think Robert Jordan is a crank fiend and he should go to re-hab for some help.The End"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have stopped buying Jordan's books, refusing to feed the monster, so to speak. Instead, I get copies from my local library. What a boring book. Absolutely the worst book I have read in years. A note to some of the reviewers who posted here in support of this book: please don't get mad at my for not being able to finish this book. Its not my fault, really. Its just that its so horrible, I couldn't continue. Instead I skimmed the first sentence of nearly every paragraph. And I couldn't tell that anything happened. Is everyone in Jordan's world as fashion conscious as a writer for Vogue? I can't imagine Tolkien taking a moment from the Battle of Helm's Deep to have Aragorn have internal dialogue about how he disapproved of Gimli's hair or blushed at thinking how tight Legolas' leggings might be.I was amazed that this book was even published. Jordan violates every single rule of writing fiction, the first of which is to treat you audience with respect."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book overall was a little tedious, but as an avid WoT fan &quot;I fear no novel&quot;. I reread this series for fun, come on now. I am not &quot;counting down&quot; to the end, and if Jordan were to die before the conclusion i would still consider it a monument of fantasy ranking with JRR Tolkien (who, if he had not died, probably had a few more good books in him, i might add.). I love the characters, i love the wit, i love the physics concepts (some could be very real [Jordan- physics major @ the citadel]) and I have no doubts that when the end comes, it won't be THE ending, but AN ending. Cheer up loyal fans! Besides, all us D&amp;D nerds know, that every once in a while, you have to do some politics, because otherwise girls won't play. Read it for the experience, not the ending."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Folks expecting vivid battle scenes or significant plot advancement in the series will be disappointed. As with the past books, however, Jordan's writing remains superb and he continues to paint vivid pictures of the characters and their environments making this an enjoyable read in the story. Some might say monotonous and tedious, but I still had trouble putting it down.Much to many's chagrin, I'm sure, more time is spent on character development than advancing the story. While it is enjoyable to watch the characters continue to mature into the roles that &quot;fate&quot; has led them into, I wish Jordan had tossed in a few hundred extra pages (bringing it to the length of some of the earlier books) to advance the story and perhaps bring one of the major plot lines closer to a resolution.The series is showing no signs of drawing to a close anytime soon (which in some ways is a good thing) but those people chomping at the bit to know what goes on with the characters will want to pick this up as quickly as possible. Those who haven't bought it yet and still thinking about it may just want to wait until closer to the next book's release to read this one.Rand doesn't get much coverage in this book, but this isn't the first time for that. I only hope that book 11 doesn't skip over the plot developments Jordan pushed along this time around in favor of those not covered.Don't expect to be happy at the end. This book ends leaving the reader just as anxious to see what will happen next as the end of Winter's Heart, and a lot of anxiety over the same things."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After reading naive and misinformed review after review, I can't help but laugh. I laugh because book 10 is by far the most rewarding, intricate, gorgeous ballet of physics, fantasy, and storytelling that this genre has ever seen. The color of an Aes Sedai's clothing. . . the deliciously complicated Elayne taking stock of a life that defies description. . . the suspense of the political intrigue (one gets the impression that today's leaders use these stories as a model for their own complex webs of political doings). This book takes fantasy to a different plane of esoteric thought, and is easily misunderstood by those who are not capable of such intellectual magnitude. You want &quot;action&quot;: go rent a Vin Diesel movie. RJ has never pretended to be in the business of &quot;fast food&quot; literature. Instant gratification is for simpletons, and if you aren't capable of understanding this work of genius-don't read it! You taint the story and it's brilliance with your petty, short-sighted whining.

Now, I haven't read many of the reviews on this site, but I can already guess what they're about \\"Waaa! Waaa! Jordan didn't have enough action, enough plot advancement in this one!\\" or \\"Why does he focus on different characters or different places than _I_ want him to?\\". Come on, people!

I also felt a sense of dissapointment at the lack of conclusions, but maybe that means 11 will be ramped up, or maybe it means that the plots have reached a point where Tarmon Gaidon is the only possible conclusion.Also on the bad side, Perrin is my least favourite of the three two rivers boys and the book focuses quite heavily on him.

I suppose you guys would say the same thing about Beowulf. The conclusion has been clearly in sight since &quot;The Shadow Rising&quot;, and was heavily hinted at way back in &quot;The Eye of the World.&quot; As to the overall length, Well thats why it's called EPIC fatasy. This story is Big, REALLY BIG. So big that ending it at any time prior to book 12 or maybe 13 Would be really cheesy. There are just too many events that must take place , each of which could be it's own book, to end it any sooner.One such event is Mat's Nuptuals. He'd just met the &quot;Daughter of Nine Moons&quot; at the end of book 9, how could they have gotten married in book 10. Additionally Elayne has to gain control of Andor and possibly Cairhien, She just arrived in Andor at the end of book 9. Egwene needs to gain control of and reunite the White Tower. Perrin Needs to find Faille And I think he'll be the one to finish off the Shaido. Are we getting the picture yet?Reviewers complain that in this book nothing much happens. I say quite a lot happened. Jordan put every major character in position to assume the roles they'll play in the Last Battle.One of my favorite things about this series is that you know exactly where he's going with it. Yeah it's long, but it's naturally long not artificially stretched to sell copies. You could edit Beowulf down to a sunday cartoon but it wouldn't be nearly as good. This is an excellent series. It is not, however, for those with short attention spans"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The problem as we see in the tenth book of this series, is that it is in the 10th book. The series was only supposed to last 7 or 8, but like a literary sellout, Jordan takes a 5 million dollar advance to extend the series to 12. I don't know about you, but if I had a series outline that was 7 to 8, and I had to squeak 4 more books out, my series would have devolved into the utter meaningless, meandering drivel it has become too. The female characters have all the warmth of a snow pea, and grate like a rusty file, and the male characters wouldn't know how to handle these unrealistic women if their lives depended on it. I give up. With any luck, so will Jordan. Book 11 will be another garbage fest, with the \\"payoff\\" in book 12 bound to be a complete letdown. If you want to read a good long series, I recommend Jack Whyte's Camulod Chronicles."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Before I read this book I never realized how little a person could say in SO MANY words. Almost 700 pages of NOTHING. We waited how long for this piece of [junk]? If he wants to stop the series he should just stop it, but don't kill us with boredom. This book even surpasses the nothingness of book 5. There is more nothing in here than ever before. Do not read this book, do not buy this book. It's like War & Peace on Valium. Go see a movie or something. Or you could switch to the Terry Goodkind series which is quite similar but far more cool since stuff actually happens. I am writing this so that you don't have to suffer as I have suffered."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Two-and-a-half stars:By the tenth Wheel of Time book, Crossroads of Twilight, the entire cast is spread across Robert Jordan's incredibly-detailed world. Each one of these characters, all of whom were once supporting characters to the protagonist, Rand al'Thor, is having their own adventure, and they even have their own supporting casts. Mat is running away from the Seanchan with his destined bride-to-be, Tuon, while Perrin and his gang attempts to rescue Faile. Elayne is trying to manoveur herself onto the Lion Throne. Egwene and the rebel Aes Sedai are waging war on Elaida in an attempt to restore the White Tower to its former glory. Rand, having cleansed saidin, is lounging around and recuperating. There are numerous subplots involving the Forsaken, darkfriends, Whitecloaks and various groups of channelers, too, but let's not go there right now. For the most part, all of the major players' stories are separate and have nothing to do with one another in this novel. If you've read all of the books prior to this in the series, you should be familiar with all of the intrigue.Now, in my opinion, none of these major plots are inherently bad, but Jordan grievously falters in this novel, and he missteps in many ways. For one thing, zero clear, noticeable progress is made in any of the said subplots. Having read Knife of Dreams, the subsequent book, I realize that the characters make several important decisions that are, in fact, important, but why didn't Jordan show the results of any of these decisions in this novel? Did he seriously need to dedicate a chapter to Elayne in a bathtub? Instead, Jordan could have skipped to Elayne simply ascending to the throne and not bothered us with descriptions of dresses. How about resolving Perrin's quest to save his wife in this book? No reason not to, really; after all, she was kidnapped ages ago in Path of Daggers. After one of the most impressive conclusions in Winter's Heart, when saidin is cleansed, why couldn't Jordan have focused the book on his world reacting to this earth-shattering news? However, half of the book takes place before and during the cleansing, and so the novel feels like a giant step backwards. That's what really grates about this book -- it makes you think about what could have been, and it does not live up to its potential. The word disappointing is thrown around a lot and it's obvious why.The familiar faults plague the story, too, but by this point, readers of the Wheel of Time should be used to them. Unnecessarily long descriptions of, well, everything are present. The relationship between men and women is baffling and utterly non-realistic, with the women, in particular, nearly all being whiny, pompous, annoying and self-centered. The lack of interaction between Rand, Mat, and Perrin (these three have not been shown in the same room together since way, way back in Book Two, the Great Hunt), continues to hamper the series, as the main characters still accumulate more and more side characters to talk to, and it is impossible to keep track of everyone and their horse. Even though I recently re-read this after reading the nine previous novels, I still had trouble recalling most of the Kin, most of the Aes Sedai, and essentially all of the Sea Folk. It will be great once Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Nynaeve in the rest congregrate again and the less-interesting supporting characters are thankfully ignored.So, having noted my gripes with the book, I really need to disagree with the general opinion given to this book on Amazon. Crossroad of Twilight is not a great book. It is not a good book. But it isn't the worst book ever written. Even when Jordan is at his worst, I still appreciate his startingly complex plot and his prose. Mat's scenes, at the very least, are still fun for me to read. But with over a thousand one-star reviews, I don't expect to change any opinions. The novel is more tolerable when you don't need to wait years for the next one (which is a much better book), but yeah, it has problems. And it is true that you can skip the whole thing without missing out on a whole lot."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This series has to end!!!The only thing interesting about this series is reading the online reviews from those who hate the series because they are spot on and the reviews of the idiots who love the series because they have no clue.The characters stopped being interesting after book3. Why is every female character exactly alike? Why is every male character exactly alike? The only interesting characters are the Forsaken but we don't ever find out much about them except when they die.Why does every female character think she is superior to every man and highly critical of them(using the same thoughts words and attitudes). Can you tell the difference between Aes Sedai,Seafolk,Wise Ones or Seanchan women?Why is every male character such a wuss? The only ones that don't follow this routine are the Forsaken of course but we don't learn much about them except when they die.Why does every character who fights for good winds up doing stupid things, acts petty, doesn't share information with other characters, is extremely selfish yet still manages to win or complete their mission successfully? Evil has very bad luck because they are losing to a bunch of idiots.Why is Rand who is supposed to be a powerful being always so afraid to use his power even when his life is threatened? Why is he always being saved from death and destruction by the lesser characters? What is the use of having power if you can't save your butt with it and you always need someone to bail you out?Rand is a scared punk and lets his own hangups about hurting women and his love of 3 women get in his way,along with being stubborn. He is a pathetic hero.Perrin: is a dope who constanly whines about using his axe and making Faile happyNynave: is a stupid girl who is so stubborn she hurts more than helps,always tugging her braid and has a temper yet we have no idea why she loves Lan.Elayne: what a waste of a character always acts like a princess. . .whateverEgweyne: how she goes from silly farmgirl to knowledgeable,savvy Amyrilyn in a year I will never figure it out.Matt: the only interesting original character because of his adcventures. Actually Matt is the only LIKEABLE character. The rest suck and engender no sympathy.The book numbs you with the same repetitive and wordy descriptions and situations and plots. 10% of each book actually advances the plot somewhat.The rest is pure drivel.It used to take me 3 weeks to read a WOT book now I do it in a week because I skip over every description of a dress, meal, city, tunic, coat, characters features, or thoughts. I only read the actual dialouge between characters and their actions, out of 1000 pages that would only entail 250."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"There were two elements to the Wheel of Time that made it great (to begin with). The first was the originality of the world that Robert Jordan created. The second was the almost relentless pace at which the plot moved forward (and that doesn't mean that there has to be action taking place, although there was quite a bit of that as well, but that the story continued to unfold). One thing that has always been present, and which I always found extremely irratating, were the characters and how they behaved. They never seemed very real to me. They never curse (unless you think \\"Blood and bloody ashes\\" is a curse). You never see them have sex. You never see them defecate. Also, they don't have the emotions of real people. The genders in this series all the act same way: most of the women have massive superiority complexes and the men don't understand what is happening.As I said, this trait of the series always irratated me, but for the first half-dozen books, this flaw was more than compensated for. THAT COMPENSATION IS NOW GONE. The originality of the world that Jordan created has not been added to, and the plot has stopped moving forward. Now there's nothing left to hold my interest anymore.Moreover, I remember a while back when I found the prologue for a Crown of Swords on the net (yes, it was free). Now, Robert Jordan would have us buy the Prologue ($3-4) and then the novel after that (~$25, 75 pages of which WE'VE ALREADY PAID FOR PREVIOUSLY!) Seldom has greed been so plain to see.The the ineptitude and raw naked greed of this man have truly disgusted me. I'm glad that I stopped reading this series after Book 8. I'm actually hoping that his series will fail so that Robert Jordan will be punished for his lust for money and his insensitivity toward his readers."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Book 1 didn't interest me, but books 2 through 6 blew my socks off. This was an intense quest fantasy with a beautifully developed world, likable characters that grew and changed throughout the story, and a world shattering story that would rock the foundations of Earth (and seems to take place on Earh, be it future or past, or perhaps both). Around book 7 it began to slow down, and book 8 was missing half the book. Book 9 had one very significant event.That brings us to Crossroads: 700 pages of nothing. At least books 7 through 9 there was some character development. In Crossroads, Jordan merely asserts what has already been established. The characters still worry about the same problems they have been dealing with for the past couple of books, and oh gee what is that column of saidar doing out there? The main character, Rand Al'Thor, doesn't make an appearance until several hundred pages into the book, and it is a minor role at that. Nothing is advanced in the plot. There is one significant event at around page 675 of a 700 page book (and the last 20 pages or so is the glossary). To say we are in a lull in the series is a grave understatement. The story has come to a screeching halt that the one power might be able to start up again, something Robert Jordan can't (or won't) do.I do enjoy reading character driven stories, and the Wheel of Time is certainly that. But I'm giving this one star simply for wasting the readers time. The last three books could have been packed into one fat (phat?) book which would have been a phenomenal read. Instead, it's dragged out with meaningless minutia that doesn't advance character or plot. Guess the main characters don't have enough experience points to fight the dark one yet.As of this writing, Crossroads of Twilight has about 1270 reviews with an average of 1.5 stars out of 5. Even Path of Daggers had some 3 out of 5 stars (last I checked). Given this (and reviews in general) I think Jordan may realized he's pushed this too far and bring the series to an end. Who knows, it might only take another ten books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I really cannot decide if Jordan has let this beast grow so huge that he doesn't know what to do with it anymore, or if he is just trying to milk every dollar he can out of it. How is it possible to write a 680 page book that doesn't advance the story AT ALL? The first half of Winter's Heart was horrible because nothing happened. But at least in the end something MAJOR was resolved. So after the first 500 pages of nothing, I was hopeful that something would happen in the end. But it didn't. If you're reading this series, skip this book. Find a summary on-line and save yourself several hours. Instead of this, you really need to read George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire. Infinitely better than what this series has turned into."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Plodding, dull, and repetitive are only a few of the less than flattering adjectives that can be ascribed to Mr. Jordan's latest effort to create a fictional world that can stand up to Tolkien's Middle Earth, Howard's Hyborian Age, Lieber's Lankhmar, to name only a few. A thorough-going Wheel of Time fan for the first six books of the series, I have come to realization Mr. Jordan has lost his way - as a writer and a creator of worlds - with this latest installment of what was once a benchmark series of fantasy-fiction. Crossroads of Twilight opens with a 90+ page preface that has no bearing on the rest of the book (presumably this is a \\"sophisticated\\" attempt by Mr. Jordan to add depth, gravitas, and complexity to his epic). The main action of the book, ironically enough, is inaction. Simply put, nothing happens in this book. Without giving away too many details, Perrin's quest to recover his wife makes no significant advances, Mat manages to travel a grand total of 30 miles from where we left him at the end of Book IX, Elayne and Aviendha manage to sit on their hands and achieve nothing (all while Mr. Jordan repeatedly reminds us that Rand is \\"wooly-headed\\" and \\"infuriating\\"), Egwene's siege of Tar Valon rots on the vine until the last page of the final chapter, and the focal point of Mr. Jordan's entire fantasy world - Rand, the Dragon Reborn himself - occupies the space of three short, ineffective chapters. One suspects the Mr. Jordan hardly needed 700 pages to tell us that nothing happens.Die-hard, unthinking Jordan-ites will, of course, cry out the standard refrain that Mr. Jordan is only strengthening the plot, adding depth to his characters, and enlivening the detail of his fictional world. A thoughtful, critical reaction to the book, however, gives the lie to these defenses. Any amateur writer is aware that over-description is cardinal sin. How many times do we need to be told in minute detail what the \\"ageless features\\" of an Aes Sedai look like? Is it really necessary to state repeatedly that \\"a wise man knows not to stand in the way of an Aes Sedai, and that Aiel Wise One's can be stern and hard to please? Does Egwene's quest for a retainer to the hold the reins of her horse really need to be described in such exhausting detail? How often can we be expected to endure descriptions of - to take just one example - Perrin's love for Faile and his anger at her kidnapping before we begin to wonder when Mr. Jordan will get around to moving his plot(s) forward rather than just describing his characters' thoughts, emotions, and physical characteristics? 700 pages and not one swordfight, not a single confrontation between Aes Sedai and Seanchan, nary a word about The Dragon Reborn, and a near complete and utter absence of Trollocs and Myrdraals. Where, Mr. Jordan, are the confrontations that actually propel a plot? Needless description kills the story's flow, while Mr. Jordan's inexplicable need to introduce every last Aes Sedai and Wise One, as well as a slew of entirely new characters, weighs down the plot and drowns any attempt at a cohesive, fluid narrative. Also, at times the writing is hideous. Fragments can be used to add dramatic effect, but in order to do so they need to occur infrequently. And misspellings and other typographical errors abound.I could enumerate many other technical and stylistic flaws, but I will not do so. I will close by saying that there is still hope for what was once a beautifully written, compelling, and exciting series. Mr. Jordan needs to break out of his descriptive rut and re-introduce action and movement to his narrative. If those of us who would like to see how the story concludes - and despite my complaints I'm willing to see this tale to its end, provided it gets back to its roots - are to be subjected to repeated 700-page offerings of description without plot movement, the least Mr. Jordan could do is release the next Wheel of Time installment in a timely fashion. Two and a half years is much too long to wait for what simply amounts to nothing. Finally, it seems to me that Mr. Jordan would greatly benefit from a strapping by the Mistress of Novices. As it now stands, it seems as if nothing less than a good lashing has any hope of encouraging him to embrace the essence of good writing: storytelling rather than exhaustive, pointless description."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"For over two years the fans of Jordan have been waiting in desperate apprehension over the arrival of this book. After the dramatic conclusion of \\"Winter's Heart\\", faithful readers had hope that Jordan could restore the pace and plot of the flailing \\"Wheel of Time\\" series.With almost total agreement, the fans have sounded their disapproval of \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\".This book suffers from a few very grave flaws: there is no progression in any of the main storylines, Jordan introduces and spends a large amount of precious \\"screen time\\" on more miscellaneous, completely superfluous characters, and the leading characters behave, in concert, in a way no rational group of people ever would.The feel you get from reading through the book is that the book was rushed. Which may certainly be true, if rumor is to be believed TOR had to pressure Jordan to finish this book \\"quickly\\". Hard to believe since we have been awaiting its publication for over two years, but it's true. The book is riddled with wording and grammatical errors. Large sections of the book read as if the writer were writing in stream-of-consciousness: describing mundane details that the writer sees happening as he is writing. In doing so, there is a large amount of repetition which quickly becomes tiresome. There is no doubt in my mind he should hire a professional editor.Over the past several books, the once-loved characters have stagnated in their development and have been simplified and over-characterized by stock phrases and stereotypical behavior. Lack of simple communication on the part of the characters leads to hundreds of pages of completely aggravating irrelevance. Terrible character decisions simply reek of the desire to contrive conflict.The first four or five books were terrific. Books six through eight were bad. Book nine had some redeeming qualities, but after spending twenty dollars on and reading through book ten I have decided to take my leave of \\"The Wheel of Time\\". I will continue to recommend the first five books, but not the series and if you have not bought this particular book yet I would urge you not to. You will be severely disappointed."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Answer: Crossroads of Twilight.What happened Rob? Was it the rack? Was the wheelbarrow full of cash simply too much for you to resist? How did they make you descend to this level?I'm not one to demand constant action in a book or novel, prior to reading this I'd read 5 biographies in a row, but come on. Nothing happened. Nothing. WTF? You could very easily just read the final chapter to be prepared for the next book...or not read it at all honestly. The last 4-5 books have descended to Dickensian indirectness without the associated skills as a wordsmith. We get 700+ pages of blathering idiocy, unrealistic (God help him if they're based on someone he knows)women who are all witches with a capital B and no plot progression. Do you remember the cleansing of Saidin? Doesn't seem like any of the characters do. You'd think it would be a pivotal event or something. Egads this book is horrible!I actually wrote a review of this book that wasn't posted because, my guess, of the incessant cursing in it.The first five books are very interesting and well written. Let's go back and pretend that Mr. Jordan disappeared upon completing the Fires of Heaven and mourn that he couldn't finish this series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"You can read the rest of the reviews about how bad this book is, and they are all correct. This book is horrible, even though I am a huge supporter of Jordan and his writing, I think this book is such a poor reflection of his writing that he should be embarrassed to put his name on this cover.But enough of that. If you don't want to know what happens in the book: please don't read any further. I am going to do what everyone else who wrote a review should have done and saved me my time and money in reading this book. I am going to summarize what happens in the 700 pages of this book, so that you the reader can go directly to book 11 when it comes out (hoping that there is action in that one).Here goes:Mat doesn't do anything. The dice roll in his head a few times, he swears a few times, and he gets to know Tuon (daughter of the nine moons) a bit better.Egwene doesn't do much. She gets impatient with being called the Amyrlin, tries to unite the white tower, and gets kidnapped in the last 20 pages of the book.Rand doesn't do much. He hears lews therin talk a bunch, his side hurts still, and he the book ends with him trying to form an aliance with the seanchean.Perrin smells how people are feeling, gets pissy that he can't get to his wife, and in the end decides to strike a truce with the seanchean to defeat the shaido.Faile doesn't do anything important.Elayne doesn't do anything important.And that is all there is to that.Sorry to ruin it if you read, but I did warn you. So stay tuned, hopefully the next book will be incredible and make up for the last 2 poor excuses of books from this once incredible author."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is sooo bad that the only positive I can derive from it is sharing my misery with all the good folks on this message board.If you haven't read this yet, don't do it! It is gloriously awful! Literally nothing happens. There is nothing redeeming about it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan is a capable of writing much better work than this. No, I do not need every page to be soaked in blood dripping battle or action, but it would be nice for some action and some common sense in the plot. It makes no sense to cleanse saidin in book 9 then act like something mysterious is happening in book 10 when everybody knows what is happening. This did not need to go on for over 400 pages! Also the plotline with Alviarin--why would she be commanded to leave the Tower for months with a distinct chance of losing her reins on Elaida? What was Alviarin doing that was so important to risk that loss? And Halima, why hasn't anybody noticed that Egwene's headaches appear right after Halima has been scolded by Egwene. If Aes Sedais are supposed to suspicious of everybody why aren't they suspicious of how she, a mere person, treats Delana Sedai like she's an inferior. Aes Sedai are anal rententive about proper hierarchy and respect and would never stand for such foolishness. And the conclusion--why would anybody place themselves at such risk? Don't you think the rebel Aes Sedai would have tested the security measures taken by the Tower Aes Sedai? Don't you think the Tower Aes Sedai would have their own roaming the city just waiting for any non-authorized channeling?As far as the action goes, Jordan really blew it. We start off with not a gripping account of how mat escaped with Tuon, but instead mat complaining of his aching body and Tuon calling him Toy with a tiny flashback to their escape. Jordan could've written three exciting chapters about their escape, instead we get three dull chapters about nothing. The same goes with the rebel Aes Sedai that was murdered in the camp. Instead of a great battle with her and her Warder versus a \\"mysterious\\" male channeler we hear of her death as report. \\"I just learned so-so died.\\" How exciting! Perhaps Tarmon Gai'don will end with somebody walking into the Amyrlin's study and announcing, \\"The Dragon Reborn has won the Last Battle, mother.\\" Whoops! I just gave away the plot for the next two books!I also really missed the arguments between the Forsaken and a general lack of chapters dedicated to evil characters. What happened to Padan Fain? moridin? Suroth? The Spider?I was also disappointed nothing exciting happened in Tel'aran'rhiod. No new discoveries of its dangers, nobody skulking about in it. Just a quick conversation there because they lack telephones. Sigh.The whole book feels like Jordan wasn't paying attention to it, like this was some side project he wasn't interested in, like his poblishers are forcing him to drag it out--or perhaps he's dragging it out on purpose to line his coffers with more of our hard earned gold crowns. I think more but shorter chapters would have solved alot of these problems. Almost all the books have over 50 chapters save the most recent ones, including COT. We don't need to know redundant facts (so redundant I won't repeat the litany that starts with men/women are impossible to understand and ends with how many buttons were on Elayne's silk dress) over actual action within the plot.And while I'm at it, can somebody please give Robert Jordan a J. Crew catalog so he'll know there is more than just red, yellow, orange, blue, green, purple, black, white, and gray when it comes to describing clothes. How about using turquoise or crimson or wheat or salmon or emerald. Can't a dress be any other color besides the color of the Ajahs? And as much as he blathers on about dresses you'd think he'd have more ideas than a \\"red dress\\" or a \\"red dress slashed with yellow\\". How about \\"She wore a silk gown done in a pattern of roses\\" or \\"He wore a cobalt, gray, and white houndstooth check jacket?\\""},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I just finished reading the tenth book, and if I could just get ahold of Mr. Jordan long enough to knock that ridiculous hat off his head, I might get SOME satisfaction out of the whole expierence! I simply cannot believe so little could happen in over 600 pages! I was stunned when Rand finally appeared on page 540...my god! I read the first 8 novels in a little over a month, and loved almost all of them. Now, after having to wait so long for this meandering waste, I am so upset..I can hardly type this! I actually found myself skimming page after page searching for any scrap of actual meaningful plot. I am also convinced that R. J. himself could not keep track of all those endlessly similar Aes Sedai names without the help of of computer program. Could somebody just tell me if Moraine is actually dead..so I can skip the rest?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If anyone needed any further proof that the WoT has descended into the realms of self-parody and bottom line publishing &quot;excellence&quot;, they need look no further than &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot;. Robert Jordan has written a book so bad that it almost deserves it's own college course, to be studied and dissected as how NOT to write a novel. 672 pages in which nothing happens, it's almost an achievement in its own right.The book follows the &quot;progress&quot; of the WoT cast, including all of those loveable side characters no one could care less about. We learn how to clean silk, we get to hear what everyone is wearing in excruciating detail, and we also get a whole lot of sittin'. Nothing is accomplished. No, really, I'm not exaggerating. Nothing happens. This is the stuff of unedited freshman english classes my friends.To dispel the beliefs of what few CoT defenders are left, this is not literary, okay? I read 19th century literature for fun, and trust me it's a roller coaster of action compared to CoT. Dissappointed CoT readers are hardly the &quot;great unwashed&quot;. Everyone &quot;gets it&quot; just fine. There's just nothing to get. Jordan is in a permanent holding pattern that will last as long as these novels are bestsellers.To any WoT fans still reading, I'd stop while you're ahead. There are literally dozens of better fantasy authors writing today you can spend your free time with. To those who have yet to start the WoT, consider yourself lucky that you haven't invested the hundreds of hours into the series only to be betrayed by an author who is lost in his own mythos and minutiae."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The first half of this book could be called &quot;Meanwhile...&quot; because it describes what everyone else was doing while Rand took care of things at the end of Winter's Heart.The second half may be called &quot;To be continued...&quot; because it sets up for some interesting events in the next book. A good thing because not too much of note happens in this book.Unfortunately, there are now just too many characters and storylines for anyone to pull together into a nice tight book. So instead we get chapters and chapters of people smoothing their skirts, wondering what everyone else is up to, and getting into position for the next book.So why three stars? Because this book is the turning point. This book is the calm before the storm. This book has the opening moves of the last battle.At least I have to hope so. At 10 books in, I plan on reading the rest of them and believe this book points at an exciting conclusion. Besides, I've got to read something until the next Song of Ice and Fire book comes out."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Although I have nothing new to add to the vast majority of reviews already submitted, I just wanted to help bring the average rating down to where it belongs. The truly horrible, sad, and depressing fact about this series is that you could skip both this book and the last and not have missed a thing. A man who might have been one of the greatest fantasy writers ever is quickly being mired in mediocrity by the weight of the last 1500+ pages of garbage he has produced. I'd gladly wait 5 years between books if they could even approach the beginning books in this series. As it is, I'll wait for his next one to hit the discount table before I waste my money again."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As with many others, I was exceedingly disappointed with this book. I've been able to accept the relative lulls in the last couple of books, but this one was simply atrocious. How can ANYONE spend 680 words to say nothing? I don't understand it.Want my honest opinion? It is beginning to seem as though Mr. Jordan and company have determined that the WOT series is a goldmine, and they should play it out as long as possible. Well, guess what, folks? Keep up this sorry state of writing, and you're going to completely lose your audience.Mr. Jordan, dear sir, it is time to finally wrap up what you have begun. Or will you go down in flames, known forever as the author who couldn't end his story?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have now donated a couple a hundred dollars to the Robert Jordan retirement fund.

That is the reason why I gave it more than 1 star. However, if you do not find good grammar exciting or gratifying I do suggest you skip this book entirely. With nothing happening in this book, you won't miss a beat by reading the next book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am astonished that anyone would say this book is great. If you've read the entire series (which was really great in thebeginning) maybe you're trying to be loyal to Jordan. I wish I had read the reviews before I [spent the money] for this story. More to the point, I wish Jordan would read the reviews and put Rand out of his misery."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I can't say I was entirely disappointed with COT--Jordan's recent efforts have been almost as unimpressive. It's simple, Jordan needs an editor to provide some adult supervision, to cut his prose and to demand he pull things together. He had 600+ pages to wrap up any one of a still multiplying number of plot lines. I appreciate suspense, character development, detailed descriptions, etc., but let's move the characters forward. I loved the first six books but have been struggling with the rest. I know he has some great ideas, but this book was a miss. It does little to advance the story and left me in doubt as to whether I'll plunk down 30+ bucks for the next one."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I agree with the readers who found this book to be another filler. Jordan has now got so many plotlines going that even were he to advance them all at a reasonable pace, still the overall story gets along about as fast as my aged grandmother!I guess at least he's consistent. I see the male and female characters still \\"interact\\" at the same idiot level of full-time misunderstanding. Jordan's creator appears to have made men to be hen-pecked, and women to smooth their skirts.680 pages (in the edition that I read) and all in all Egwene gets caught. Fullstop. That's all folks..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"With another drawn out book on my list of frustrations with this series which I once adored, I feel like a cow who is simply being milked for as much money as possible. I thought one of the most important aspects of the art of novel writing was to be good at telling a story from beginning to end, assuming there is one here. I am not convinced this is occurring with this long series. And since I doubt The Wheel of Time would end with eleven books, I suspect I will have to wade through two more books to find out how it all comes to a grand finale. How disappointing. I guess I can sum up my review in just one word: MOO."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As a fan of the series, I have been eagerly awaiting this novel.

In the books 1-9 there has always been a balance, some books slightly more slow and others slightly more exciting.Book 10 however is a completely different case. I was disappointed, for majority of the first half of the book the only thing that kept me going was what had happened in book 9.All in all though, excluding a lot of the waffle, I would say that book 10 was satisfying. Not exciting, un-like books 1 to 9.Cheers,"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"...and then I bought Book Ten, \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\". Let me tell you, I don't feel simply let down - I feel absolutely [bad]. If *this* is what I have waited for since Book Nine, I surely will not languish in anticipation until Book Eleven, because I am ready to dump the rest of the series right now, sight unseen.I don't want to ruin the book for anyone who hasn't read it yet; suffice it to say that book goes nowhere - slowly. ONE CHAPTER (Chapter 24) deals directly with Rand al'Thor (approx. 17-ish pages long), which is thrown in as a conveyence to a new alliance coming into play. No resolution within the Aes Sedai; Mat is still hearing those bloody dice rattle from time to time in his head, he still feels his silver-worked wolf head medallion go cold when some woman is channeling nearby, and he still does not consider himself a military commander. *YAWN* Oh, he has a new woman in his life (as seen in 'Winter's Heart'), but very little is done with this. Perrin, who takes up a sizeable portion of 'Crossroads of Twilight' ...well, let's just say it is nothing but a continuence of the challenge he pursued from the development in Winter's Heart, with no resolution whatsoever in Book Ten.This book is stagnant, plodding - and I dare say insulting, in the sense that after multiple delays in getting it to press and into the hands of the readers who have been following the series ...It is very hard for me to convey in words my disgust over this latest novel from Robert Jordan. Up through Book Six (Lord of Chaos), the only person Mr. Jordan had to compete with was Robert Jordan. Sadly, it seems he is no longer able to answer the bell and rise to that challenge. It is sad to see a series that started so strongly fall upon such hard times, ... In my opinion, this book is easily the weakest link in the 'Eye of the World' chain."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The quality of the first five books has kept me reading, but I cannot stomach it any more.

Unfortunately each installment now takes longer and is more disappointing than the previous one. Crossroads of Twilight is thin on plot and thick on the filling. Robert Jordan appears to be stretching the story out to breaking point, probably in anticipation of the royalties from each book. Unfortunately it seems the less substance he puts into each book the more fans fall by the way side. I would borrow this book or buy it second hand because it is certainly not worth spending your hard earned money on.

The first few were good, and then it started to go downhill. Although I like some of the characters, for the most part, I simply don't care any more. The other thing that I find to be infuriating is that he spends the first section of a book reviewing the previous books. This section has been getting larger with each installment. So now my strategy is to wait for the last book (27 or something) and just read that.

The publisher, Tor, hired a double to do book tours and then put together a COMMITTEE of hacks to keep cranking out Jordan books at the previous rate. They will continue to crank out books with no real plot resolution until the public (that means you) tires of the series and stops buying them.

How foolish to think that things were going to be different just because something finally happened at the end of the last one. This is by far the worse of the series, and if for any reason some innocent soul is thinking about starting to read this series, for God's sake save that person hours of unnecessary torment. The worse is I'm committed to reading the rest of this having invested this much time, but like others I vow to give no more money to Jordan, and I shall continue to think to myself, &quot;Ah, this is how NOT to move a plot along.&quot; If you want intricate fanstasy plots that move quickly, I suggest everyone read Guy Gavriel Kay immediately."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have been an unwavering fan of the Wheel of Time series, having re-read the first nine books three times.

He's a better writer than that.

In stead, I should have skipped it and waited another year for the next one. How can someone write this many pages about 2 days? The sad thing is, there is no development in the characters, or the plot. The last 10 pages held a glimmer of the early books, but every sub-plot touched upon in this book went nowhere. I was looking forward to a stunning last hundred pages like in book 9, but as I turned the last page, I was still waiting. I sat staring at the first page of the glossary wondering if I was missing some pages. Jordan fans should skip this book and wait for 11, then read this in the couple weeks before it is released, so you can be thoroughly confused upon opening book 11. I seldom got half a page in before falling asleep, and by page 100 I was thinking about rereading books 1-9 just to figure out what was happening.

I got hooked on this series 3 years ago and was consistently amazed and delighted with the rich, detailed world he created. I can certainly understand the addiction of a lot of people to this saga. The one thing that Crossroads of Twilight has managed to do is completely kill my interest in this series (which has been waning for a while now, since his last two books). I checked the last book out from the library and did the same for this book, and was extremely glad that I did not spend any money on this poor excuse for a book.The rich detailed descriptions that some have been championing in this book, would have worked very well indeed, if not for the same lengthy descriptions in the last few books. How many times can an author recycle his words? Stick with the Wheel of Time and find out. Some of the fanboy defenses of this book had me helpless with laughter. One reviewer called people who did not like this book \\"unsophisticated\\" and offered the resolution of the Alviarin/Elaida subplot as a window into the intricate inner workings of the White Tower (and as evidence that Jordan intends to resolve most of the subplots in this series). Laughable really, when you consider the amount of detail about the White Tower given when Egwene was made Amyrlin. We should be extremely grateful that Jordan has chosen to resolve one minor subplot out of a myriad number that he incredibly, keeps adding to.I have taken the advice of a number of reviewers in here and have gotten off the Wheel of Time."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It took me almost 2 months to finally choke down this horrid book. The book sat on my shelf for two weeks while I only had 2 chapters to go. I really didn't care anymore what happened. There are so many names and trivial characters.

What about unusual creatures attacking in the night? Warders in battle, anything. please, anything!Perrin was one of my favorite characters until this book. The first quarter of the book is spent on him whining about his missing wife. I really got that he was upset the first time you wrote that. Yawn. Mr. Jordan, you could have said all that in one chapter.All you RJ fans out there...remember when Egwene and the Aes Sedai Traveled to Tar Valon and they were on the edge of the city. This was a couple of books back. The book ended with what seemed like an exciting climax that would lead to a big battle. Two books later, they are still on the edge of town living in muddy tents. Yawn. Finally in the last chapter Egwene was captured. Wheeeeewwww. How thrilling. Yawn.Elayne is dealing with the politics of being a leader. Yawn. She is only allowed weak tea and everyone wants her to eat more because she is pregnant.Matt flirts with women.Rand does nothing.

Of course, after 10 books I'll read the next when it comes out. Less enthusiastically. I'll have to boil up some weak tea to help me choke it down."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I resisted reading the Wheel of Time series for a number of years because I figured it for an over-hyped Tolkein rip-off. When I finally did read the first volumes, I was not ashamed to admit that I had been wrong. Robert Jordan writes beautifully, with great attention to detail and the world he has created, while not exactly original in many respects, is so absorbing and fully realised that it's hard to believe it doesn't exist somewhere.That being said, I have to agree with most of the other reviewers that _Crossroads of Twilight_ is the low point of this series (I actually liked book eight, which most people found pretty dull). AFter the events in _Winter's Heart_, a slow book in itself, I expected the plot to pick up a bit in volume ten and hoped that at least a few of the subplots -- like Faile's kidnapping -- might be resolved. That, sadly, was not to be. It's not that absolutely nothing happened, but what happened was so small and took so long to say that reading was almost a chore. It's as if Jordan has got bogged down in his sense of detail and used it to mask the fact that not much is going on. By this point in the series, I think we understand how Mat feels about women and how angry and frustrated Perrin is and how people feel about Asha'man and Aes Sedai; we don't need to have it pounded into out heads. Likewise, I think we understand that we're in a fantasy realm and the details of everybody's clothing and the drinking of spiced wine are not needed to reinforce the setting.The book starts with a 95 page \\"prologue\\" that I think could have been cut all together and the next 300 pages essentially say nothing but that everyone anywhere who can channel is aware of what Rand's doing at Shadar Logoth but no one knows what it is and everyone is freaking out. If that had been the prologue we could have started at page 100 and maybe gone somewhere interesting in 600 pages, but that didn't happen and it left a bad taste in my mouth.I don't mind whole books passing without dealing in detail with every major character. If Jordan had focussed on one or two and advanced their stories, I would have liked this book better. As it is, he just checks in with many of them and I wondered why he bothered.I am also beginning to be more than annoyed with the lack of communication between the characters. Rand cleanses the male half of the source and then doesn't tell anyone? Can you say, \\"Shooting yourself in the foot?\\" I think if anyone's going to survive Tarmon Gai'don, they'd better come down off their high horses, give up the idea that their own little cliques know what's best for the world and start talking.I give this book three stars because the writing is still above par and because I did enjoy each little bit, and because I can appreciate CoT as a vast chapter in a vast story. But I really think that to redeem himself RJ would be best advised to release book 11 within six months and have it be a rollicking good corker with plenty of action."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Tolkien wrote because he is passionate about his work. His books are works of art. Jordan was like that too in his first 6 Wheel Of Time books. After that I guess he started writing not out of inspiration but out of necessity. To please himself? his publishing company? his bank account? one thing I'm sure of is that he does not write anymore for his fans and followers, and his books are now written without inspiration and passion."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Do yourself a favor - search for a summary of this book somewhere and read it instead (will be less than 2 pages long, cause absolutely nothing happens).I'm sure you can skip this volume and go straight from book 9 to book 11 and miss nothing of the plot.The great setup at the end of the previous book? Totally ignored.This one is 800 pages well worth skipping.Boring. I found myself scanning through 20 - 30 pages at a time, just looking for some dialogue between all the incredibly boring descriptions.If you read this you will regret it. I ignored all the warnings from other reviewers and I hate myself for it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Worth reading, but only to appreciate these reviews, the majority of which are infinitely better written and more entertaining than the primary source."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I enjoyed parts of this book. I wanted to enjoy more of it, really I did. Instead I found myself getting impatient at Jordan's endless assault of mind-numbing details about what someone's horse looks like, the color, cut, and embroidery of every dress or robe that Elayne wore, how many weavils were in the porrige...sure a good story teller knows how to use such tactics to put a reader on the edge of their seat or build suspense. Ok. Fine. but in 800+ pages you expect SOMETHING to happen. There is something finally in the last 2 pages that will catch you by surprise. But without giving the ending away I'll say that for me it wasn't nearly worth the effort of reading the whole book to get there.Jordan has spun so many polts and sub-plots into his world that even a more concise author would have trouble moving them all along even in the 800-1000 pages that a typical WoT novel slogs through. There is no way to remember all the names of the various minor players and what small thing they did 2 or 3 novels ago that makes them important.Other than a precious few parts where the story was entertaining or suspenseful reading this book was more like work than entertainment.I hope that later novels can focus more closely on one or two storylines and move them along at a quicker pace but I'm not betting money on it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"and crossroads of twilight is still very weak. even imagining the whole series as one great big book i can see a solid improvement if winters heart and crossroads of twilight were edited together as one book.in previous books jordan would use his elaborate details to provide hints and clues that would lead to interesting discussions and often be resolved or elaborated upon in the following book. very little of this is apparent in crossroads of twilight. many of the details do not build on previous mysteries and those that do do not reveal much. if only one significant mystery had be revealed to the reader, not even to the characters but just to the reader it would have been a refreshing moment in an otherwise tedious ramblealso engaging a moving plot would have been nice. the long awaited siege on Tar Valon is discussed by the sisters camping outside of the city but by the end of the book the siege has not begun. how many \\"wait for the next book\\" delays can one plot point take? it has been three books by now. and that is just the one thread in this tangled tapestry.it was a poorly developed book. if you had to wait for two years it was very bad show to hand off this \\"subtle\\" story. people who wait for two years have expectations. expectations based on what previous books have delivered. it was not unreasonable for people to expect a bit more even a lot more than crossroads of twilight delivered. even a few solid setbacks that finish a plotline and change it to something else would have been ok.on a separate note. for those of you who defend jordan by claiming he is not trying to milk the books for all the money he can should realize that he has agreed with Tor to split the first novels (probably all of them) into two separate books to be targeted to young readers. now i do not know what planet you live on but here on earth children grow up. someday a 6 year old will be a 14 year old and then that child can read all the Wheel of time books he or she may want. the series might even have reached a conclusion by then. Splitting the books is absolutely a way of milking the series for more money.Is crossroads of twilight a way of milking money out of a fan base, probably. it certainly was not written FOR them. pretty much any book after the fourth one feels a bit like it is dragging out the series to make more money. this one just sucked at the same time."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have found that I am severely disappointed in this latest installation of The Wheel of Time. The series started out in such a magnificent fashion. The characters were likable, the plot advanced well and the story was entertaining and exciting. I couldn't put the first four books down. I read five through nine at a bit of a slower pace but they were still enjoyable although nearing book eight the characters have dissipated into whining people who could have solved some of their problems by simply talking to each other. Rand has gone from a likable youth to a whining and moaning young man. I know that his character has many pressures but he has hardly advanced as a character in the past few books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was one of those fans who called the critics &quot;unenlightened,&quot; or &quot;not mature enough&quot; for these &quot;masterpieces.&quot; What was I thinking? I should have known better than to criticize those who didn't like the book without weighing the merits of their complaints. But no, I blindly worshipped Jordan simply because it was exactly the kind of thing other Jr. High students would do. (O.K., perhaps it's really a grade-school kind of thing, and I'm just not adult enough to admit that my behavior was SO childish). I kept buying these books and defending them as clever or brilliant....and then I realized one day that I want my characters to be likeable. I don't want to have to wonder if one of the male Forsaken is truly dead at the end simply because Jordan was stupidly vague (like with Sammael). I don't want to hate characters NOT because of their actions, but because they are all poorly written. Somehow I didn't realize, until I went back and re-read them all in a row) that the characters behave the same way, over and over and over, and that there really isn't any difference between them. Plus, the plot gets sillier all the time: Why is it that these super-powerful people can't communicate? How hard is it for Egwene or Elayne to figure out what Rand is up to when they can communicate in the dream world with each other and with the Wise Ones? Why is Perrin so stupid? And to make matters worse, I really started to hate these books when I realized how much of the first 6 (which were better than 7-10) stole so many characters out of other author's books. Why isn't this guy being sued? Geez. Well, I'm truly sorry if I misled anyone into buying the other books. If you're thinking about buying this one, PLEASE don't, unless you're in the target age range: 10-12.Thank You"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I wondered if I should bother writing anything about this book since it's been out for some time and this review forum is abundant with commentary...but I will just put in my two cents...when the WOT hit it's stride, around book 4 or 5, Jordan gave a number of interviews where he insisted that the series would be 7 or maybe 8 books tops...when he was questioned if the series may go longer, he thought the idea was absurd..he insisted that he had all the books laid out and knew how the final scene would be written even before he started the series...so, what the hell happened?Greed...plan and simple greed..if you pay close attention, you see that the fast pace of the first 6 volumes comes to a grinding halt in the ensuing volumes...I can envision a power lunch between Jordan, his agent, and the Tor editor at around the time Vol 5 hit the book shelves...the topic of discussion, how to pad out WOT in order to reap in more money...hey, this is the American way and no one can fault Jordan for wanting to max out his profits, but lets not think for one moment that Jordan originally planned to keep this series going on for as long as it has...the lack of decisive action and the continuing layering of sub plots and mini quests to the point they resemble an RPG video game storyline, only illustrates how Jordan is keeping up his end of the Faustian bargain he has made with TOR...Jordan is not the first to sacrifice his art for money and he will not be the last..unfortunately, we the readers have to endure this endless epic...like a drug, they know that most of us are hooked, and want to see how this endless journey concludes...Jordan began writing a story of Mahlerian proportions, but has ended up producing a second rate symphony by Raff..but, like any hackneyed composer knows, if the final movement of your mundane symphony contains enough bombast and joyous noise, the audience will burst into applause as they respond to the final chords and not to the entire work...we can only hope that Jordan will repay all of us, who helped make WOT a success in the first place, by providing us with a fantastic conclusion.. hopefully, there is some light at the end of this tunnel...."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is a filler book of epic proportions.If you have a weak heart and like the idea of nearly 700 pages of conversation and description then this is the book for you. There is no action to speak of so you wont get too excited reading it.Like most of the other people giving this book bad reviews I have read books 1 to 9 and enjoyed them. Book 10 is just a vehicle for killing time and taking our money. Shame on you, Robert Jordan.To paraphrase a previous reviewer, anyone who gives the book more than one star either works for the publisher or is related to Robert Jordan."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"...I could very easily pick up the next book in WOT and have no trouble following what was going on -- except, of course, I'd have to break out a chart to keep up with the myriad characters Jordan has cluttering up his world. No, wait, myriad is not a strong enough word. Tolkien's Silmarillion had myriad characters; the WOT has become more overcrowded than a third-world slum.I really think that Jordan has lost sight of the essential rule of storytelling -- to entertain the audience. Every scene in a story should contribute something to the writer's overall vision and to the reader's understanding of the story, but frankly, there's not much in this book that I cared to read about. There's nothing in book 10 that couldn't have been compressed down to about 3 chapters in another book. Jordan's style is well-polished, as always, but his editor must have been on vacation.My advice to anyone who hasn't bought this book but is considering it: wait until the series is finished, then buy all of it at once. Read the books back-to-back, one after another, and the WOT reads a lot better and makes a lot more sense. Taken as individual novels, several of the books are weak (especially this one), but when read as a whole, the series has an impressive strength."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The wheel of time started as a great series but Jordan in his last few books has not progressed the story much rather he seems to have lost control of the threads and doesn't seem to know how to bring them together again. I loved the first 5 books but have struggled through the remaining. It is almost like he is milking the popularity of the series with a load of padded books- which is a shame given that the base story and concept is fantastic- hurry up and bring the plot together. I mean what did Rand do in the last book???"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Being a huge fan of this series since day one, I've always eagerly anticipated every new Wheel of Time book. I couldn't wait to get my greedy hands on Crossroads of Twilight.After the reading the book, I've lost faith in the series. Crossroads is another book in the series -- with the exception of the first four -- that just plods along. The characters that are focused on in this book eventually work up some big decisions, hence the name of the book, but it ends before we get to see what happens. Because of the sloth-like pacing of the preceding books, some of the storylines that are covered in Crossroads have moved so slowly that they've just become boring. Most of this book could, and should, be covered in just a couple of chapters. For anyone calling this a setup book, I have to ask &quot;Why does it take nine books to setup a conclusion of a story?&quot;. I think a more accurate portrayal of this book is that it's funding Robert Jordan's bank account and not my enjoyment.That said, I've put in 13 years on the Wheel of Time and I would certainly like to see the conclusion of the series. However, I will think long and hard before I buy the next book.All in all, a very disappointing installment."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Phew. I finished. After reading 9 I remember telling myself to give this series a rest. Moment of weakness I guess.Basically this has become too long. Too many subplots. There are more named characters in this series then members of the Screen Actors Guild. It's impossible to keep track of who is doing what to whom. Definitely a soap opera. Time to converge all these subplots, The Wheel needs to turn a little faster.If you really want to finish up the series wait until the final book is published."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have to agree with most of the reviews here, that this book although a good read was the most unsatisfying of Robert Jordan's books to date.Praise is limited to the fact that the book helped pass the time while I was riding the train to work.Complaints? Too numerous to write, but I'll repeat the one most often mentioned, the fact that the book just doesn't go anywhere in resolving the layers upon layers of tangled plot lines. At the ending of book 10 we're left with all the same problems of book 9, Mat is still on the run, Perrin is still hunting for Faile, Faile is still trying to escape, the Rebels are still planning to attack the White tower, and everybody is still planning to attack everyone else. There's so much left behind from the early books and so many new things being introduced that it's almost like you're reading a different series.Every book up until the 10th, even the plodding pace of books 5-9 have had some major battle or development at the end which left me with a feeling of continuity to this series, but the ending in book ten is worse than the ending of Matrix Revolutions, leaving me with the feeling of wanting my money back. As for character development, Jordan continues to introduce more and more new characters and is determined to give each one their own personal history and background. As far as it goes it's a noble effort, but it's a wonder that the man can keep track of them all, I definetely can not, and trying to is becoming a chore rather than being enjoyable. Main characters are increasingly being written more and more into the background: Rand barely has a whole chapter to himself and Nynaeve and Lan are only just briefly glimpsed from the perspective of Cadsuane. Min only has a few lines and Aviendha seems to have become just a backdrop behind Elayne. Heavy focus is given to Egwene (understandable since she was hardly seen in book 9), and Elayne, and less to Mat and Perrin, although Mat; previously one of the most interesting characters is becoming more of a fumbling buffoon now that he's saddled with the extremely annoying Tuon, and Perrin is returning to his morose and moody self that I thought we'd seen the last of in the earlier books.I'll give it to Jordan though, complain though I might, I'm determined to finish this series, let's hope the man lives long enough to complete it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"For the first time in years, I have to agree with my dad who has also reviewed this book. It's a waste of time and trees. There is no movement of the plot, no action, no worthwhile character development, and no clear purpose other than to sell another doorstop-sized book. Most people who have read it have been able come to the same conclusion. Of the 1512 reviews to date, only 66 (4%) &quot;true believers&quot; thought it was 5-star great, while 939 (62%) thought it stunk at one star or less. It is interesting to note that while most of the negative reviews focused on the author's and the book's shortcomings, a majority of the avid fans used their review to attack the other reviewers."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"No one moves. there is an amazing artform developing here, for the lovers of null, inertia, stasis, nada, zip, nothing. No one in the entire almost 1000 pages actually does anything or goes anywhere. At least in the previous book (which was pretty close to stasis) some things occured to move the story along.There is one wonder and joy in book 10 of this series. Not reading book 10 in the series will leave you in exactly the same place starting book 11 as reading book 9 in the series left you. You wont have missed a single thing, and if by chance some detail or another *was* missed, you wont know it, because it had no consequence whatsoever.So if you have read 1 through 9, just skip 10 and go right to 11 when it comes out.

After reading RJ's books over the years I have slowly started to feel a sharp bitterness with his work. Mind I will read his work until his last book is published, but not with the same passion I once did. In Crossroads of Twilight, as in Winters Heart, the story seems to fade. It just seems that RJ is writing so that he can write another book. I won't give away plot or story line, but to say all the main players appear, though Rand isn't seen until three hundred pages in. Few questions are answered, though more are asked. And the end leaves you so twisted you feel like tossing the book across the room. With the probability that the next book won't come out till late 2005 this reader feels disheartened with ever seeing an end to what once was epic series with outstanding depth.

Yes, it is very detailed, and can seem a bit long, but if you truly love the books as so many say then it should not matter! And even if you don't love them, and you say that he can't write good, or its boring then you have some serous mental problems.

Give me Goodkind and Martin, yes they are very good, but it was Jordan who started the interest in epic fantasy again. The wait is often long, getting longer each time, but learn patience, the best ending often takes a while.

There will be transitions slow to fast and then back again. The blade master will still be wielding his heron marked blade with flawless precison and experience. With enough practice and patience some if not all can beat him,in time. Do not give up on waiting nor on learning from a master at work. The best things in life take time.

The other half are just tired of waiting for the next book.I have a prediction that when this story is finished the rating will go to 4 stars. I think it deserves 5 but I know most people don't like reading for 100 pages and stop, switch to another one of the main characters. Yes, I said characters. There are several main characters in this story. Rand is only one of them.This story is one of the most in dept stories I have ever read. This is one of the few stories I have ever seen where there isn't only 4 personalities by half way thru the story. There is a huge amount of story and isn't worth reading until you have a month to do nothing else in your free time. If you read this story all at once you will have no problems understanding the plot. It will be fresh in your head. If you wait a month between one book to the next you won't be able to understand the story due to the detail.Quite simply put this is not a causual story. It is meant to be read from first to last at once. I will not fault the story for being written in this way.Book 10 backs up in time to half way thru book 9 and continues the plots for all of the other characters not having too great of say in the last part of Book 9. The first half of Book 10 is everything going on just before and while Rand is cleaning sadin. Plus you have a comical love story, a kidnapping that hasn't been resolved, etc,etc.This is a good story. Don't let the whiners talk you out of this story.Pros: Very well written. Many separate characters maintained throughout the story with very different personalities. An execelent story line with alot of detail.Cons: A big let down when you reach the end of whatever book is just finished and realize that it will be two years before the next one and four for the following. It can be hard to switch between characters every hundred pages. The story should be read all at once or not at all."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The series is AWESOME, yet this latest addition, which I got a prerelease copy was disappointing. Some of my favorite characters has very little or no lines and it gives the feel of being made for the next book that will come out. Generally it is great for people wanting a little escape from this world yet the pace is way too slow for my liking (covering 4 weeks of WoT time). Great for hardcore WoT fans yet casual readers might feel it boring.

Perrin chases the Shaido a bit, stops to replenish his food supply, and frets about Faile. Elayne meets with a couple teenagers to gain their support for her bid for the Lion Throne.

For every 5 pages of Crossroads, 4 are devoted to how the characters are dressed or the history of the tea cups being used. I'm getting the feeling that the author is hiding Rand the way Disney hides Mickey at Disneyland. And, what's with 95 pages of prologue to the TENTH book in a series? Why doesn't he just pick up the story where it left off in book 9?The many comparisons of Jordan to Tolkien are misguided. Tolkien took us on the adventure with Frodo and the Fellowship. Jordan's work, particularly in the last few books, has all the adventure of a flight delay in real time. I would like to know what happens to many of the characters, but it is simply not worth the sheer tedium of the writing."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Many years ago this series started off with great promise and excitement. Since Moiraine left the story, each sucessive book has confused the plot so that it's nothing more than a jangled, plodding mess.Little of what this current effort presents should have taken more than 4 concise chapters to tell. Instead, Jordan insists on numbing his readers with detail and minutiae that do little to progress the story line but that simply re-presents character information that was more than adequately presented in previous volumes.Two issues are at play here:Jordan's earlier gift for deft writing has been lost; it's as though his ability to tap the 'one true source' of writing has been stilled. The poor bugger can sense it, he just can't touch it any more.Second, if there *are* editors at TOR, they are not bringing discipline to this writer. Simple writing conventions of plot, character devlopment and timing are so absent from this effort that you begin to wonder of a ghost writer hasn't taken over for Jordan somewhere along the way.This book has become a symbol for a series that, for all intents and purposes, is hellbent on snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Save your money on this and future volumes. I couldn't be more disappointed."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I keep waiting for some action to happen in this book. Instead we get a broadstroke overview of all the main characters and then some with no real movement forward in the story line. I hate to dislike this book because I've spent a year waiting for it's release. Rand the main character in the story did absolutely nothing in this new book and all the other main characters took one step forward in thier saga's but no more. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. If I didn't have so much time invested in reading this series I would bouycot his next release. Come on RJ get on with the story already."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Nothing happens? Absolutely nothing! 680 pages and the characters do nothing. Oh wait...you do get a bunch of tertiary new characters who do nothing but confuse. Jordan has said on NUMEROUS occasions he knows what the last scene is in this series. I begin to believe he doesn't know how to get there."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"At least I think Jordan deserves jail time for reader abuse.I won't repeat again what a good portion of the existing reviews have already said. But I do have a suggestion for those of you who regret purchasing this book. If your book is in like-new condition and you still have your receipt, TAKE IT BACK. I did. Send a message to both Mr. Robert &quot;show me your money&quot; Jordan AND his publisher, who should be held equally culpable for publishing this piece of &lt;bleep&gt;. If Tor had shown some backbone and stopped bowing to their own version of the money-god, if the editors had put their foot down and refused to accept it, maybe this would have eventually been a real book instead of...whatever it is. I'd not call it a novel by any stretch of the imagination."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was so looking forward to this book. Waiting, and waiting. After the last 100 pages of Winter's Heart, I was expecting now, finally, after the previous four books, real movement in the story. I expected to give this at least 4 stars. But when I say that the first half of Crossroads of Twilight covers only one day, I mean actually the day that was already covered in the last 100 pages of Winter's Heart! Instead of progressing the story, Jordan wants to go over and over the most mundane and boring of details, and seems to delight in dwelling on what really is simply gossip, which in no way appears to help the story along. We don't even get to Rand at all until the last 150 pages! I could edit this for the parts that progress the actual story and make a book of less than 100 pages- 1/7th the total length. Initially we have to wade through stories of Matt and Perrin, perhaps the most boring of Jordan's characters. And as you read through the book, and realize nothing is happening, it becomes increasingly clear that Jordan is not the best of writers. Perhaps it's to his detriment that with the recent movies, we get a taste of Tolkien's skill. But I'm getting tired of clich?s. Again and again. Like worlds without end. And I'm getting tired of being told what every character thinks, rather than having it described. And I'm really getting confused on who all these characters are. I read the glossary in the back before beginning the book, to refresh my memory, but most characters are not included there, and it's difficult to search through all the varying glossaries of the previous nine books to finally find a character and realize that they really are rather peripheral to the plot.And still, the characters are mean. Unlike within Lord of the Rings or Narnia, I don't like any of these people. There are plenty of protagonists, but no real heroes. Nearly everyone acts only for his or her own concern, without true altruism. Though some act out of notions of romantic love, there is nowhere real self-sacrificing love for others. You don't see people becoming morally better, but rather everyone trying to one-up everyone else. All self-abasement is because it is forced- there is no real humility, like with the Hobbits or what Edmund learns in The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe. There are no leaders like Gandalf or Aslan, that make the reader feel that thrill that they are next to greatness, and greater for reading this novel. No growth, no models of kindness and morality, and little true hope.I really want to see what happens in this series, so I read it. But honestly, if you haven't picked up Book One, don't. I don't see Jordan being able to wrap this up in less than 13 books. And if you are hooked on the series, rather than buying this book, just ask someone who's read it to explain the relevant details that actually progress the story. That should take about 5 minutes. And then wait for the next book. That should take about another two years.January 11th, 2003"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Crossroads of Twilight is an incredibly poor installment in the Wheel of Time Series. There is no plot movement. No revelations. No action. Well, not exactly. There is the cute plot line concerning how well Birgitte fills out her pants!However, I would not want to appear negative. The book does contain hundreds of multi-page descriptions of women's dresses, skirts, cloaks, jewelry, general appearance and eye and hair color. Most of these descriptions do explain how the women need to twitch, pull, smooth out and fondle everything to keep it all in place. Sadly, none of it contributes to the plot....My recommendation is to skip Crossroads of Twilight...."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Very disapointing. The story arcs that it continues, and the new ones it sets up, are vaguely entertaining - however none of them get _anywhere_! RJ rambles on, and on, and on. What was the point of this book? Well you got me. Perrin's captured woman? Well, still captured, oh boy, I don't care about her anymore and Perrin is getting pretty old and boring as well. Matt and his daughter of the nine moons? Well we get some amazingly small amount of info about that despite a reasonable number of pages on the subject; and again nothing has changed in that story arc. Rand? We get almost nothing useful about him. So what do we get out of this story? An amazingly amount of white tower divide politics, and lots and lots of new story arcs being set up before we can possibibly come to any kind of actual conculsion. With the exception of a few small parts I actively disliked this book because you can get the sense early on that _nothing_ is going to happen in this book. No action, minimal character development, some kind of poor writing in many respects, and lots of white tower politics and other boring story arcs. Blah Blah Blah.Truthfully some of the new story arcs appear interesting, but you know what? I DON'T CARE! We already have a story for gods sake, can we possibly make some actual progress on in? Damn RJ!I can think of a few reasons this might be the case and only one of them is vaguely hopeful.1.) RJ has just lost sight of the goal of the story. And has, for whatever reason, decided he likes his little story world and wants to explore all the facets of it by setting up yet more and more interlacing story arcs.2.) RJ wants more cash, and as such needs to write more books. And hence we get a 700 page book where nothing happens, and it happens in a real boring way.3.) RJ already has the story all planned out and there is going to be some stunningly beautiful pulling together of all the story arcs in a increasinly sharp pace that will blow us all away. Which of course means he had to set up all the story arcs first, and we are stuck with a 700 page book where nothing happens.So 3 is obviously what I'm hopping for. But this book [was incredibly bad], I mean these story arcs could have been set up with some more action, something good happening to characters, something bad happening to them, anything. But that isn't the way it was written. Anyway you should check this one out of the library and read it at some point before the next one shows up, since I'm sure you want to know what happens. But I really hope RJ gets his writing together for the next and finally finishs this series up. I'm starting to feel embarassed for the guy.RJ if you are reading this you really had best finish this thing up soon man, you are starting to piss of lots of your readers. (At least all the ones I know)"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The 10th book of a series that should have found it's end 5 books ago. Again Robert Jordan releases a book that merely trudges on with the storyline, the same old characters doing the same old things, this is half a book with nothing approaching an ending in it. While it's a good chance to revisit the world of The Wheel of Time, it's not more than a fleeting glimpse at a few days of nothing special."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What was once my favorite fantasy series is now my biggest frustration. Somehow Jordan has practically made me lose interest after 9 great books. This book is nothing but filler. It looks like they increased the font size (really) and gave us half of a book where everything happens in the 2nd half. That would be a way to make a good profit. This is the big book about nothing. I was warned ahead of time by some friends that nothing really happens in this book and they were right. Read with very low expectations. The only thing good about it is it is a quick read due to fewer words per page."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Its a bit daunting to realize how long ago it was that I picked up the Eye of the World and signed myself up for this journey.While creating an epic story on a wonderfully grand style, Jordan is dragging this out for quite a bit.When my wife got this for me as a present I noticed that the book was shorter than others in the series and that was my first warning sign. Jordan seems to need 1000+ pages to get things to happen so it seemed book 10 would be &quot;treading water,&quot; which it is.I'll buy book 11 (in paperback - not hard cover) just because I like the characters &amp; story, but I'm starting to doubt this story will be done in this decade."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I just wnat everyone to know nothing worth reading happens in this book.

I do not mind the highly introspective tone of Jordan's narratives that seems to bother other readers. I held on to the belief that they were in fact &quot;set up&quot; books for something ahead.However, this book has made me decide to abandon the Wheel of Time series. It have such a passive feel that I had to look back through the book to verifiy that anything at all had taken place. Jordan is fond of hints and innuendos, but by themselves such tricks cannot sustain a book of this size. In the end, I think that Jordan's writing style has gotten so fluffy and long-winded that he can no longer fit a book's worth of activity into even a 700 page book.If you loved the last two books, then you should enjoy this one too. If you -- like me -- were hoping for Crossroads of Twilight to redeem the series, then take my advice: Now is the time to walk away."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well, it seems the wheel of time needs to wind down and end this series. Without question, it has been the one of the best ever, however, this volume is evidence that you can take a good thing only so far. Mr. Jordan, please end the series now while you still have the respect of your readers.Very respectfully,Bill P."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Although the previous three books meandered to a degree, putting off action and reasonable directions for the characters and the story line,they at least continued to flesh out the characters and subplots in a reasonably efficient manner. While I finished Crossroads of Twilight,it was difficult to do so as the first two-thirds seemed to interminably describe and redescribe the same characters. It took 500 pages to reveal that the column of fire to the west was Rand's cleansing of the taint from male wielders of the power and destruction of Shadar Logoth, that had taken place in the previous book. The end of the wait for this volume was disappointing. Mr. Jordan needs to return to the crispness and quality of the first four books of this series and to finish the story."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"WOT was/is a good series. Now, RJ is just milking his fans for money. I spend [money] for a book. I expect some entertainment. So why was I grinding teeth the whole time I read it?There was no action. The story didn't advance. This book was boring, and uninspiring. Heck, he didn't even throw us a bone at the end of the book as usual. You probably can skip number ten and go trait to number 11 and not miss a thing.The sorry part is he know we'll just keep on buying his books because we want to see the end of it. RJ need to listen to the majority of his fans here. They are the one who made him."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Like everyone else who bought this and made it a NYT bestseller I was hoping that after the momentous events at the end of Winter's Heart we were going to be heading for an even better book this time around. Unfortunately that is not the case. Much of this book is filled with the same interminable dialogue and descriptions that we have seen a thousand times in the previous books. In addition, the book has plenty of grammatical and spelling errors which only reinforce, in my opinion, how quickly this was pushed out to maximize dollar returns.Let me sum up. Nothing happens in this book. Much of it takes place at the same time as events in the previous book were taking place. We get introduced to more throwaway characters who might have some meaning within the context of events in the next book, but who will remember by the time the next one arrives in a years time? This book is filler. It is probably the worst of the books in that it has no beginning or end, just one giant middle. I enjoyed this series of books until they started going wrong after Lord Of Chaos. I can't help but think that Jordan has lost his way somewhere and is trying to figure out how to end this thing.For anyone that is thinking about reading this series, wait it out. Just wait until the last of them arrives. Don't bother buying this book. You could most likely skip it and it wouldn't make a difference at all. Jordan will more than likely sum up the important events of this book in the next book anyway. That should take all of 10 pages. I honestly have no hope left for this series at this point.If you are looking for some epic fantasy to tide you over until this series ends try reading George R.R. Martin's series A Song of Ice and Fire."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After per-ordering this book with the great ratings that were given to it I was looking forward to a pleasant experience. I found that this book took me two weeks to read because there was not anything of intrest hapening in the plot. I kept reading, knowing that Jordan sometimes packs the last one hundred pages with excitment. Nothing, the book could have passed as much information in a much more plesant read in about eight chapters. I am not an author, but I do know that this book in no way resembles the first books of the series, and seemed like a waste of time."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have read the other nine books and have enjoyed them very much. Sad to say, I did not enjoy this one. The plot moves very slowly and many of the subplots are still not resolved. People should wait for the next book before buying this one.

As it is, this is not a good read considering that we have waited two years for this."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I loved these books. 1-7, at least. Book eight was kind of a stumbling lurch, and I've no intention of reading it again. Book nine was OK, so long as you can skim read well. Book ten, though, sucked. The freaking prologue was the best chapter! Nothing at all happened, ever, in the book. If you feel the need to read it, I emplore you to speed-read up to the first chapter from a female point of view, then skip till the next male chapter. It's only about 14 chapters, each filled with descriptions of cloths. Who cares what Elyane wears? OH, what a beutiful silver net you're wearing in your hair, Elyane! I was on the verge of violently mutalating the book with a steak knife after reading that. I couldn't decide what the climax was, a chick I hated getting shot or a chick I hate getting captured. Perhaps in book eleven they'll dress her up real nice, then make her a triple amputee. My friend and I have a theory. We think that after book seven, Robert Jordan died, and ever scince then his wife has been writing the Wheel of Time. Book eight sucked because it was her first, book nine was OK because she copied his style, and book ten really sucked because she reolized she wasn't very good and decided to milk what she had and use her own style.

In volume nine, however, he did recapture some of his storytelling abilities and, with his normal style, provided a huge and exciting finish. His latest endeavor, however, fails to move the plot along to any reasonable degree. The situation with Perrin and Faile has hardly changed. Ditto for Elayne. The Mat and Tuon relationship could have been handled in a few paragraphs, Rand is almost missing from this volume, and the marvelous feat accomplished by Rand and Nynaeve in volume nine was hardly even recognized. If this work were condensed into about two to three chapters it might be a good start for a book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This series is the equivalent of watching paint dry.

Crossroads of Twilight was the same as the last four books, only worse. There was no plot movement. This series has become a real source of frustration because it has been stalled for the past five books. The author even made us doubt if the small advancement in Winter's Heart actually meant anything (referring to Rand and Nynaeve cleansing saidin). I would not advise any newcomers to start this series. Mr. Jordan does not appear to have an end in sight. He has taken all the excitement I felt in the first five books and crushed it to nothing."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is AWEFUL! This is one of the worst books I have ever read and certainly the worst that Jordan has ever produced. I have read all of the other books several times and even the worst (6 and 8) are wonderful compared to this garbage. If you were waiting for a book to skip or for a time to stop reading the series forever, this is the book! Nothing happens and just in case you are even slightly tempted to read it, here is the synopsis. Matt travels with a carnival and falls for the daughter of the nine moons, Tuon. Perrin follows his kidnapped wife, Faile, but does not even try to rescue her and he buys some grain with bugs in it. Rand makes a one chapter appearance and does nothing. Elayne works on getting the throne back and finds out she will have twins. Egwene is besieging Tar Valon by camping near it and at the end of the book, she gets kidnapped by unknown people while trying to change a chain in the harbor into Cuendillar. No one important dies and there are no big battles. That's it! This book was Jordans joke on us, don't fall for it!!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Waste of money, infinite number of monkeys will produce some kind of conclusion to this series faster, and more entertainingly. I am jumping off this train wreck.Wait a few years, if alzheimers hasn't claimed Jordan and he finishes the thing (as if) may be worth buying at a yard sale."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm probably going to get some criticsm on this review considering the fact I gave it 5 stars even though I agree with almost every other reviewer who gave it only 1 star.First off, my opinions on the series. I know that this should be the review of just the book, but seeing as you're not exactly going to buy Part 1o before reading the other 9, then you have to review the series as a whole. I will echo almost every other reviewer in saying that the first 4 books in WoT are some of the best fantasy novels ever written. For me personally, I think it's the first 6 are master class novels and it was only around Crown of Swords when I started having trouble and my interest began to die. Eye of the World drew me in like hardly any fantasy novel before it, The Great Hunt was a true adventure, the Fires of Heaven had an almost romantic quality to it. I remember rushing home from college in the winter of 2000 just to sit down with a mug of tea and read the books until the middle of the night.However, the criticisms are perfect and fair. The problem is not that the series has no end in sight. After all, if Winter's Heart and Crossroads of Twilight were of the same quality as Eye of the World, I'm sure we'd all be very happy to keep reading (For that matter, how many of us would ever want A Song of Ice and Fire to end?) The problem is that virtually nothing happens. There are seemingly endless prologues with dislikable characters and pointless descriptions (The infamous smoothing of skirts and notorious pulling of braids). You'll find yourself skim-reading through the entire chapters. My own problem is that characters that I used to really like in the start, such as Mat Cauthon, Elayne, Egwene, I've grown to really hate and I can't stand it when Rand al' Thor makes his appearance along with the usual moanings of \`I can't wait to hurry up and die.'That's another problem. The main characters are so arrogant self-centred and self-absorbed, it makes you wonder how Robert Jordan could possibly enjoy writing about them. Also, what was once fascinating has now become tedious. I was looking forward to the Seanchan coming... it came to nothing. I was intrigued by the Aiel... they came to nothing. I was fascinated when the Tower into split into two and were led by Egwene... that's also come to nothing. Whenever a \`Big Event' occurs, Robert Jordan seems to find a way to make it an anti-climax. It's the endless descriptions that have reduced the Asha'man into nothing more then bystanders. Also, it's an open secret that both Moraine and Lanfear will return... but when? They disappeared about six books go and still show no sign of returning, even though it's blindingly obvious they'll be back.Alot of reviewers have criticised the fact that, at the beginning the WoT novels came out every year, then every two years and now every three years. Again, the problem isn't the wait. After all, how many of us moan about the wait for George R R Martin's \`A Feast for Crows' (Almost five years)? The problem is that the wait for Jordan's last three books have inevitably ended in crushing disappointment, and this is turn means the fans are demanding that the series just be ended, now, quickly, in any way possible. I'm sure that if there was an unexpected Nuclear Attack at the end of Knife of Dreams, the fans would be relieved rather than shocked or annoyed. I personally think, and this is almsot sacrilege, that Robert Jordan should hand over his notes and ideas to another writer, someone with a fresh voice just so that WoT can recapture it's previous spirit. It's very clear that Robert Jordan is incapable of it. 15 years is the evidence.Now for the reason for my five stars. I knew I'd hate this book, but I bought it and read it because I think Wheel of Time is important for all the wrong reasons. I think it'll go down in Fantasy folklore as one of the biggest disappointments in living memory, but I think it's an essential read for any budding fantasy writer. I think fans and future writers will learn from Jordan's numerous mistakes and develop far superior series. Like it or not, \`Epic' fantasy is here to stay and there will be authors attempting even longer series then WoT. Fantasy Writers can learn from the strong criticisms of WoT and make something far better. Mainly... don't waffle on with pointless descriptions, don't make your beautiful characters downright ugly, keep the same pace in book 9 or 10 as you did in the first, and don't EVER have your lead character continuously think \`I wish I could die'... it's not clever, it's not smart, it doesn't bring sympathy from the reader, only anger and hatred.And because the worst thing any author can do is lose the fans and lose their respect. I still respect Robert Jordan, but I don't think most others do. You lose your fanbase, and you lose your credibility.There are people on these boards that are/were far stronger fans then I could ever hope to be, so you can only see what happens when you lose your base."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"look at it like this: if you took EVERY word ever written by BOTH Tolkien and Eddings and combined them, they would be fewer than this Jordanesque nightmare of tedium.

His editors at TOR should be fired, fired for not having the moxy to stand up to Jordan and say &quot;This book is nothing but a crappy re-write of book 9.&quot; At one point I started counting how many pages of paper were wasted to write a simple sentence. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING new happens until the second to last page (hard cover edition). I heard an interview recently where Jordan said he didn't care about the criticism this book has recieved because he is writing the books for himself, well Mr. Jordan, do yourself a favor and hire a new editor because this was horrible!

I've been reading this series since I was fourteen, lo these many years, and this book is OBVIOUSLY sub-par even compared to the other big stinkers, e.g. 8 &amp; 9. Go to the bookstore and read it but don't waste any money on it. My only hope is that George R.R. Martin will somehow hear my keening wail and finish his book soon!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"To rehash about 2,000 other reviews: this book is tripe. Worthless. Offensive to anyone who felt any connection to this series' world and characters.I think I may have a pretty good idea of what happened, though, and I hope it gives some hope for the future. It's the Michael Crichton syndrome.Remember long ago, when Michael Crichton wrote extremely entertaining novels based wholly on his strengths? He is obviously very bright, and has a real talent for turning ideas about hard-science into fun dramas, like The Andromeda Strain. Then he became so popular, and so lauded, that he started to believe his own hype. He read so many reviews of his own books citing him as the greatest writer ever, and as the man whose every word was golden, that he started to believe it. And so he started to write books filled with what he thought was subtle intrigue, pithy character interaction, and literary depth. Unfortunately, he wasn't that kind of writer. He wasn't Delillo, or Dickens, or Wolfe, and he shouldn't have tried to be. So those books ended up being further towards the 'crappy' end of the spectrum.Then something happened - I don't know if his editors pulled in the reigns, or if his family sat him down to have a talk, or maybe he started to pay attention to the fans that he was disappointing (I hope). Whatever it was, it got him to accept a bit of humility, and to go back to his strengths. The results being Timeline, and then Prey - fun books about hard-science extrapolated into entertaining dramas.So therein lies my hope for Robert Jordan. His strengths are in describing an interesting world, in creating things that are mysterious and engaging, and in writing very cool action sequences. Recently he seems to think he's the next F. Scott Fitzgerald; and failing spectacularly. He obviously, for example, thinks that he has something deeply important to say about the sexes and about the clash of cultures, and maybe he does, but he sucks at saying it. More importantly, IT'S NOT WHY WE READ THE WHEEL OF TIME. If we want to read about the subtleties of culture and its affect on the interactions we have, there's plenty of Dostoevsky available.Mr. Jordan obviously possesses a stubbornness akin to that he ascribed to the people of the home village of his protagonists (whoever they are anymore). I just hope that eventually someone will smack him hard enough to wake him up, and we'll find ourselves with another \\"Eye of the World\\" or \\"The Great Hunt\\"."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"is the ability to end.There is nothing harder than to pull everything together, truly finish a work.Jordan with his last 5 books has firmly(and sadly) placed himself in the former category instead of the latter where I thought he was surely bound for the first 5.We read fantasy for storytelling. It's ok when there are no &quot;hack and slash&quot; action sequences. It is even just fine if most of a book is conversation. I understand when an author doesn't have the best grasp of human emotion and writes most of his characters as an endless stereotype. I'll forgive a fantasy author who can't write love at all other than having it just appear with no explanation and no build up(see Elayne and Rand), Jordan isn't a romance writer after all. But the plot needs to move. The story needs to flow. It simply does not here. When an author creates trivial new plot elements his characters need to deal with(and deal with for thousands of pages) in later books of a series, it isn't story telling. It is filler pure and simple no matter how ugly that word sounds.I understand that maybe this book and the books during the last 6 years of my life are leading up to something great. I understand that Jordan probably thinks this is the culmination of his life and I respect that he wants to make everything perfect and give us all there is in his head. He thinks that when we reach the end we'll all believe he was right. The problem simply is that he's not. Readers 50 years from now will be told by librarians to skip books 6-10(11) and just read a pamphlet or something that sums up all that happens.Tolkien was never a very good writer. Jordan is his superior easily in terms of writing talent. I think most of you readers objectively will agree Tolkien would have been better suited writing history. But that man had an imagination and a story to tell. He knew where it was going to go and he knew where it was going to end. He never published the stuff that is coming out now because he knew it was just garbage in his head, not a part of his vision, his tale that he was telling us.Jordan should have been great. Instead he'll forever settle for only being good.I will buy the rest of his books as I've bought every one up until now.But Mr. Jordan, please finish soon. Your loyal readers have been ready for a lifetime.Richard Yang"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I started this series in my early teens and was immediately enchanted by it. Like many others, I felt that RJ was an author than could rival J.R.R. Tolkein in intricacy, depth, and flavor. But now I'm 25 and there still does not seem to be any end in sight. I would sincerely like to know what happend to this man's once incredibly dynamic writing style. His newest book reads like some cheasy soap opera. What happend to all of the prophecy and allusions to future excitement. The few events that have occured of any interest in about the last 3 books have been like digging a gold nugget out of a pile of offal. In conclusion, if the next book does not start to really tie up some of those previous story lines I don't think I will continue to read the series. It makes me a little sad, as I have been reading these books for over 10 years and used to really enjoy them, but when I actually have time to read for pleasure, I want it to be something remotely interesting (call me crazy). As a personal plea to Mr.Jordan--try to remember your former genius-this last book was misguided and ill thought out at best."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Sadly, I've read this book. On the other hand, I'll never have to spend $25 again for any book written by Robert Jordan. I will no longer read about sniffing or hair tugging. Never again will I be plagued by trying to figure out who killed someone because the author &quot;just doesn't want us to know&quot;. I read because it is enjoyable to do so. Robert Jordan writes to kill that bit of us that enjoys it.I only add this note because of the readers who give the book four or five stars. They know its bad. I know its bad. You know its bad. So, to any of you tempted to give it 5 &quot;just because the other books were so good&quot; or &quot;because people keep beating up Jordan for setting up a stellar 11th book&quot;, just stop. Let the fog of idiocy lift from you and accept the fact the WOT Series is suffering from a long death by writing cancer (or greed, whichever).It's a terrible day when millions of fans can agree how bad something is, but the author simply ignores them. Doesn't he say he'll keep writing til they nail his coffin shut. Well, they did, but he's still writing so what the hell?!?Go away WOT and join the dead."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The Wheel of Time turns, and Book come and pass, leaving first memories that become legend. Legend faded to boredom, and even boredom is long forgotten when the next Book in line comes again. In one Book, called \\"A Crown of Swords\\", a Book yet to rewrite, a Book long written, a cry rose in the electronic reviews of Amazon.com. The cry was not the beginning. There are neither beginning nor ending to the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.From the valleys of readers to the heights of the writer, the cry flew. A cry of despair from the poor readers who waited for more action, more insights with the grand conflict between the Light and the Dark.Over and over again, with each publishing of the next Book in the serie, the cry grew about promises not fulfilled, of boring description and caricatural sex-oriented clich&eacute;s until the Pinnacle of \\"Crossroad of Twilight\\" was reached.Yet the Wheel weaves as the Wheel will, and Jordan the Creator, sheltered in the Light, never heard that cry, and never will.So the cry rose, to no avail, until that last Book and it is yet to be known if in the last Battle, the Dark Lord of Boredom will be defeated at last.Many readers forsook the Light and became Darkfriends, rejecting the prophecized word of Glory to come, with no patience enough to wait two more years for the Creator to spin \\"New Spring\\", a prequel to the \\"Wheel of Time\\" before again two years to the Eleventh Book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I fell in love with Robert Jordans world about 8 years ago. The charcters were rich, the story was intriguing, the writing was purposeful. I felt for Rand dealing with the reality of insanity and trying to protect his friends. All the characters seemed to have a heart a place in the wheel. But now we are inundated with every name of every peasant, aes sedai, king, queen, prince, lord, horse, dog, chef and lackey that Jordan can come up with. Obviously the publisher has seen Jordan's books as a cash cow and are trying to have him milk it out. The last few books could have easily been consolidated into one 700 page book. When you take a whole chapter to describe the quickness one can travel through a portal and yet it takes a whole chapter, it defies 'quick'. This may all be leading up to a grand finale, but who will care, who will be there. I think most readers will grow weary of the same old pace (if you can consider going no where a pace). I will now forgo any more WOT books, and read something worth while, like the phone book (it has a smaller cast of characters)."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is bad.Very very bad.I now know how to hand wash silk clothing without damaging it, and how to get out ash stains, but as far as a plot line advancing? nope. Jordan can't write about that.What's worse, the interesting bits happen &quot;off screen.&quot; Specifically, The former Red ruler of the White Tower, is able to escape the influence of her &quot;Keeper&quot; but we don't see how she is able to rebuild her powerbase, nor is it terribly clear why the Keeper left for so long.Rand just got done cleaning the male half of the source, but we only see him breifly, and almost fully recovered.

I have been a fan of Jordan since picking up The Eye of the World, but this book doesn't live up to the standard of any of the books in the series. At the beginning of this book, most of the characters are doing the same things as they were at the end. Each storyline moves slightly. Egwene story moves the most, and was fairly interesting, but not nearly enough to make this book worthwhile. Elayne's story is just downright bad. By far the wort part is the Perrin storyline. I don't even know why this is such a big deal. It is a boring and hideously pointless story. If it has to be in the book, it could have been relagated to at most 2 chapters. It really bogs down the book and makes it almost unreadable. As it was, it wasn't a very entertaining book. It felt more like a chore to read, than a joy.This was simply one of the biggest wastes of my money and time. I don't like to pay my money for filler. 300 pages (if not more) could have been cut from this book and it would have been the same story.Skip this book, wait for the next one, and pray that is actually advances the story in a noticable way."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"My sister in law tells a shaggy dog joke that has been in her family for generations. Essentially the joke is that a guy has a dog so shaggy that everyone who sees it says he should enter it in a shaggy dog contest. He does and it wins, with the judge exclaiming \\"that is the shaggiest dog I have ever seen\\". He continues to enter the dog in ever bigger contests and the dog continues to win. Eventually the dog is entered in a contest it looses, and the judge says \\"that dog isn't that shaggy\\". That's it. The joke is for the amusement of the teller; the longer you can drag out the joke before the mark demands the punch line, the funnier it is.Some people say that anything worth having is worth working for, and this is true ...UP TO A POINT. Allow me to illustrate this.Example 1: You are walking down the street and the wind blows a hundred dollar bill into your hand. You did not work for this money, but you are none the less quite happy to have your sudden \\"wind fall\\".Example 2: You do contract work for an entire year, expecting a share of the profits when the project ends. Instead of a nice paycheck though, your total compensation is a one hundred dollar bill. You did work for this money, but are irate because the payoff wasn't worth it.In both examples the payoff was the same, but the joy you would derive from it is in inverse proportion to the work you did to get it. This response is hardwired into humans by evolution. The people who think it is great to slave for years for meager compensation do not fair as well as those who work carefully to maximize their profit.Robert Jordan had the climax to the WOT series in mind before he started writing these books. The problem is that NO ending can possibly be worth this amount of labor. This is the trap that many creative people fall into; they drag their idea out until the last possible second. Unfortunately, this often diminishes the overall legacy of the story. A good author or movie director knows how to tell a good story without exhausting their audience's patience. A bad one builds so much expectation that the final product almost always falls short.This book is the 10th in the series and there is no end in sight. Hardcore fans are dutifully slogging through these books faithfully believing that the end will be worth it. I say you should prove you are not the bvtt of an evolutionary joke and stop while you are ahead. There are many great authors out there who can tell a complete story (Beginning, Middle and END) in a book or three. Give them a try, because Jordan is just telling you his Shaggy Dog Joke in book form."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The only reason I have this book is for the sake of the series.

If you want to read this book, read the first few pages the last few pages and a couple in the middle. That will catch you up with the story.

Those of opinion #1 (including me) are legion. The zillion or so careful explanations of why this book (and this series, since long ago) is worthless should be all the warning newbies might need: STAY AWAY! HORRIBLE PROSE WILL BE INFLICTED ON YOU! TOR CARES NOTHING FOR QUALITY! Those of opinion #2 apparently must resort to insulting the intelligent critics who panned this book, because there's little they can do to defend it. Simply put, this is NOT \\"deep thinking,\\" \\"quality set-up\\" or \\"worthwhile depth of detail,\\" as the few Jordanites here would trick you into believing. It's the same garbage as before. Jordan simply spawns more unimportant plotlines with more one-dimensional characters (and there's little to distinguish them, not even their names!), gives no character development, etc. etc. Those who argue that Egwene's stupid blunder at the end constitutes \\"plot advancement\\" are suckers. This is the same thing Jordan always does: garbage prose for hundreds of pages, then something exciting but out of nowhere (and often illogical) at the end. Remember when the women were being petty/searching for the never-again-heard-from Bowl of Winds? Recall how all of the sudden, BANG they happen upon it (even Mat SOMEHOW happens to find it)? And how that all happened right in the last few pages? That's an author sloppily ending a meandering book. This one is no different: the ending is contrived, makes NO sense in terms of character's actions/past behavior, and is just Jordan's way of saying, \\"Look! After 8000 pages of this book, I'll make something happen.\\" Too bad that something, like the rest of the book, is not worth our time."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The Wheel of Time Series started off with a BANG!! Eye of the World was one of the more engaging and well-paced fantasy novels I've read. Vividly drawn characters, excellent description, just enough plot twists and hooks to keep you guessing and involved. The part that was amazing to me was that Jordan kept this going for FIVE more books. Reading about these young adults growing up and beginning to make adult decisions was a rewarding experience. Jordan actually made you care about his characters.Something happened in book 7, Crown of Swords. The great and powerful beast was clearly leaking and weakening. The characters stopped evolving. I don't mean they plateaued or became well-balanced. They STOPPED. Worse, the plot stopped moving. I don't mean it required more exposition of back story or greater detail. It STOPPED. Literally, nothing happened. It became a chore to read through book after book at 1000 pages and more, only to be confused or aggravated because Nynaeve still sniffs when she's irritated, which is every other page or because Perrin still doesn't understand women but believes Rand and Mat do. These were clever and useful devices early in the series, but now, they just make me want to throw the book across the room.I sincerely feel that this series could have been finished 3 books ago, given the actual plot progress that's been made in books 7-10. Tack on another 60 or so pages to Lord of Chaos and that would amply cover what's happened in the last 4 books, given that only one event of significance has occured. Part of the problem could be that Jordan has created a monster with about a dozen minor subplots, each of which he cultivates like the series would wither and die if it weren't there. Shall we count? Rand and Tarmon Gaidon, Elayne on the Lion Throne, Egwene in the White Tower, Mat and Tuon, Perrin and the Shaido/Seanchan, the Forsaken/neuvo-Forsaken, not to mention whatever bit of confusing and overdone crap he throws at you with the prologue of each book. He will spend 300 pages illuminating one of these subplots but gives you no reason to care. The result is boredom.To be fair, something pretty huge did happen in the 9th book and that has led to some actual development, so there is hope. The hope is that this series will actually end at some point.If you've already started this series, then odds are you've been reading it for the better part of a decade or so. Personally, I go back to the release of the Great Hunt, so I've been struggling with this Krakon for almost 15 years. Will I buy the new one when it comes out? Embarassingly, the answer is YES!! At this point, I have too much time and money invested in this not to finish it.If you're new and contemplating starting this series, I advise you to wait. This isn't the place to start reading fantasy. Try David Edding's Belgariad. Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow and Thorn. George R.R. Martin's Song of Fire and Ice. DON'T try Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth. He's got the same problem Jordan has... diarrhea of the mouth."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I like the Wheel of Time series. It has grandiose scope, lots of important characters, unique concepts in fantasy, and many other good points. So, why did I rate this volume in the ongoing series with only one star while the rest have received four or five? The reason is simple: Once I finished the book, I sat back and reflected on it and realized that if I had not read it at all, I would not have missed anything important for the series at all.That's a pretty sad statement to make about a book that is around 850 pages in length! I actually believe that whether you have read the other volumes or not, this book can be completely skipped.Since the series is reputed to have twelve or thirteen volumes in all, it would appear that each volume should have some connection to the main story line and that each volume should bring us closer to the resolution of the complete series. This one does not do so. Could it be that it was intended to be simply filler material so that the series does contain thirteen volumes when it is complete? I am very close to saying yes on this point.The next part of this review is my condensation of the complete volume into a short series of sentences. If you are planning on skipping the actual book, read on. If, on the other hand, you are planning to read the book, then stop reading here and click on someone else's review!!!****************************************************************SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILERALERT ALERT ALERT ALERT ALERT ALERT****************************************************************Here is what happens in this book by main characters:* Mat - Decides to finally leave Ebou Dar with the travelling circus and ends up taking Tuon shopping for silks as part of his wooing of her.* Perrin - chases after the Shaido and find them (OK, we are up to page 650) then captures some Shaido and tortures them for information.* Rand - Is resting from his exertions in the previous book.

I remember when Rand killed his first Trolloc in the Two Rivers and Moiraine and the Two River people fleeing away in the middle of the night...I remember getting goosebumps as I read those scenes. Fast forward a decade or so, a tour in the military, and college, and we seriously haven't gotten anywhere. I read on Jordan's blog that he said that people write reviews on Amazon only to flame him, but dang, 1.5 stars is pretty lousy. This book plain sucked. Nothing happened. Nothing. Seriously. I have no idea what happened in this book. I think he might have introduced the golem in this book, that about sums it up.Robert Jordan, where the hell are you going with this story. I have fond memories of the first 6 books, you were able to wrap me up in a spell and take me to another place in those books. Now, I'm just wishing Egwene will get...lets just say I wish bad things will happen to her, Nynave should just pull her hair out by the roots and get it over with, Elaine, Min, and Advienda are a bunch of hoochies, Perrins a pu$$y wipped b!ach, and Mat...well Mats pretty cool.End it already. Please. If you die before finishing this series...AHHH. I've spend many weeks of my life reading and rereading your books as I forgot what happened by the time your next book came out.

To put it another way, I stopped sneaking the book into the bathroom at work because I found that staring at the door of the stall was more interesting.My problem is not that there are so many books in the series, or that it wont wrap up. I dont think anyone would be complaining if we had 10 books in quality like The Great Hunt or The Dragon Reborn (I still remember the goosebumps I had reading that). My problem is that the entire events of this book could have been covered in a 30 page epilogue to book 9. I mean, the cleansing had just taken place, what better place to recap where everyone else is at the time, and then set up all your cliffhangers and then make people wait for no-holds-barred slash-and-hack book 11.This book is a shameless money grab, but ill still buy the next one, and the on after that, and the one after that because I need to know how it ends (lets hope it involves Faile, Elayne, Gawyn, Elaida and Sevannah all dying gruesome deaths).My advice, get a friend to give you a synopsis and wait for Book 11. I hope stuff will actually start happening then, unless we are treated to a lengthy Mat+Tuon wedding ceremony, then a long negotiation between the Seanchan and Perrin to decide when to attack.. a long Rand travelling scene to Ebou Dar, and some hilarious torture of Egwene in the Tower, then a 40 hour labour scene by Elayne, where she says the same curse phrase over and over again, and then we are still left at the same point in every plotline as we are now.

That job gives one a unique perspective on popular literature. When a new Tom Clancy comes out, rather than thinking, &quot;I wonder if he'll have to promote Jack Ryan to Pope now,&quot; you think, &quot;Where the #@$% am I going to stack these forty 60-pound cartons, and what will be left of my sacroiliac when I'm done?&quot;When the new installment of &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; came out [number 6? number 7? Even the fans seem to be having a hard time telling them apart now] there was genuine excitement among the geekier book clerks to get their grubby little hands on a loaner copy before the book officially went on sale. [That's one of the few perks of working there. For example: I knew the shockingly lame ending of Thomas Harris's &quot;Hannibal&quot; before anyone else could even buy a copy.] One tried to evangelize me to the faith but as soon as he started saying things like &quot;Aes Sedai&quot; and &quot;Nynaeve&quot; my eyes glazed over. By that point, I had already unpacked, scanned, and security tagged hundreds of different fantasy titles - all with the same gibberish names [Tolkien was a professional linguist, folks - don't try this at home!], cheesy magic tricks, animatronic monsters, and epic quests against the Supreme Evil Whosit. His break finally ended and he went back to showing you good people where the cookbooks are and I went back to my box cutter and styrofoam &quot;peanuts&quot;.But having a primitive interest in all things Really Big [I love Wal-Mart, for example - even though I know how evil it is], I kept WoT in the back of my mind as the series continued to grow in size. What if it was really as good as the geek had said? Imagine the Wagnerian power that would have been amassed by the end after 9,000 pages [three times as long as &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;!] of build-up. So I stopped by here to see what the faithful had to say...Well, you know the rest. It seems obvious to me that Jordan is in the same situation that Chris Carter was with &quot;The X-Files&quot; [another geek fave that left me cold]. He managed to beguile people at the outset with intriguing portents, found himself in possession of a money-cow he lacked the willpower to walk away from, and thus was forced to keep artifically prolonging the suspense [at the cost of complicating things until even he couldn't untangle it any more] until people finally stopped caring.The hundreds and hundreds of betrayed Jordan fans here bemoaning their lost youth, money, and eyesight [let's stop piously invoking &quot;the trees&quot; though, shall we? Unless you volunteer your time to planting programs or contribute at least $100 a year to environmental groups, you're just advertising your hypocrisy] might have known better. The man isn't a prophet, after all - just a scribbling hack who got lucky. And until *you* walk away from a pile of money, you are in no position to sit in judgment on him. But we all choose our heroes and we all suffer the inevitable disappointment. That's what heroes are for, I guess.And to those die-hards trying to convince themselves that Jordan must be &quot;building up to something&quot; in the next book [or maybe the one after that? ...], I can only quote Sir Ian Holm's immortal line in &quot;Alien&quot;: &quot;I can't lie to you about your chances. But you have my sympathies.&quot;"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have to agree with most of the other reviews. As thick as this book is, the plot goes basically nowhere. Right up until the very last page, Mat is the only character who actually *does* anything, and it's not even all that much. In the meantime, we have to agonize over name after name after name, trying to remember the significance of minor characters introduced 2 or 3 or 4 books ago. Or we try to trudge through paragraph after paragraph of superfluous descriptions, more than in any of the previous books.I thought that the monumental events at the end of book 9 signified exciting changes, and yet nothing changes. Though the first half of this book occurs during book 9's big event, even after book 10 catches up with that point nothing comes of it. Instead we have Rand complaining about not having time to handle serious issues, all while he sits around doing nothing! We have Perrin fuming and buying grain! We have Elayne plotting!In the previous 4 or so books, I felt like the series took two steps back for every three steps forward. In the case of Book 10, no steps forward and one step back."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"With the first 6 books of the Wheel of Time series, Robert Jordan has proven that he is a most brillant writer. With the last 4 books however, he has proven that he knows how to crush momentum and interest- and Crossroads of Twilight seems to be the worst of them all. I say &quot;seems&quot;, because I have not yet finished the book. I am just over 400 pages into it, however, and NOTHING has happened. Minor characters are described and analyzed in painstaking detail, as are plots, subplots, settings, etc. Detail is good...but too much (WAY too much) of a good thing, isn't. If the last four books were written with the same flair and strength as the first 6, this would have been the last and greatest book. Jordan had established himself as a veritable legend with the first 6 books. Comparisons to Tolkien were VERY appropriate. Now, he needs to be succinct and INTERESTING in his last few to pull the series out of mediocrity and back into greatness."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Let me preface this review by saying that I loved the first 5 books of the Wheel of Time.Unfortunately the bloom is off the rose and Jordan's propensity for enormous plots has taken its toll over the life of the series. With so many intricately connected plotlines a characters, Jordan's style of storytelling (visiting each character or set of characters briefly and then moving on to another) is has broken down.&quot;Winter's Heart&quot; did little to move the plot or the action along but was salvaged at the end by Rand's assault on the the taint poisoning the male half of the Power. This action gave Jordan an excellent opportunity to follow up into the next book and break the logjam of plots and subplots.The story in &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; moves at a glacial pace. The story actually picks up prior to Rand's cleansing of saidin and follows various groups of characters and their reactions to the immense use of the One Power that it involved.However instead of focusing on the changes the cleansing of saidin has engendered, Jordan treats it as an aside and goes about his slow and merry way. The enemies of progress and the Light seem almost entirely mundane now, with few of the beastiary from earlier volumes making any lenghty appearance.Politics is the order of the day, between the Aes Sedai in Salidar, between factions in the Tower, amongst the Lords of Tear. While I enjoy the use of politics to advance the plot, create obstacles and move the story along, I found the overabundance of it in &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; to be offputting.That said, Jordan is a better than average writer and managed to hold my interest well enough that I finished the book in several days. Just for contrast, in the past when faced with a new Wheel of Time volume I have devoured it within 24 hours or so.My recommendation? Only for the true fans of the series and even then I would wait for paperback.George R.R. Martin's fine series &quot;A Song of Fire and Ice&quot; would be an excellent alternative for those who have not yet read it.Or if you like your fantasy with a slightly darker side check out Glen Cook's vernerable but still great &quot;Annals of the Black Company&quot;."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have jammed through all the previous books pretty quickly... always finding some free time to read, not wanting to put them down. Boy was this book different. It took a great deal of effort to read this one. The story has been slowing for a few books, and in this one the story seems to have totally stalled out. The plot hasn't really moved forward at all. Reading about Mat was still enjoyable, but even that bit lacked any real excitement. &lt;yawn&gt; The author is obviously writing for himself. Was there an editor at all on this book? I seriously think this book could be distilled down into a 50-100 page intro for the next book and little would be lost. This book has pretty much killed what interest I had left in the series. I'll probably check back in 10 years and see if it's done yet."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"what started as a great epic fantasy is unfortunately losing its pace, crossroads is more of a traffic jam with nobody(characters)moving. this series quickly got me hooked but the latest installment just got me mad, come on jordan, lets wrap it up. if your eagerly awaiting the paperback release wait til the next book comes out as croosroads goes nowhere, maybe the story will move in the next book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"jordans previous books were saved from his terrible, tedious writing style by some great action set pieces,some interesting leaps of imagination and, with rand, a compelling manichaean conflict but in the latest instalment there are no redeeming features. jordan appears to have no literary merit, his writing is graceless and his characterisation hackneyed and weak. the women are caricatures and so are the men, an assembly of cliches who mouth platitude after platitude. does every layer of clothing need to be described in such ridiculous detail, does every thought need to be forced upon us so, does he have an editor. jordan appears to think that every little thing needs to be spelt out to us again and again to the extent that one feels he thinks we lack sufficient intelligence to understand the most simplistic of notions and ideas. by continuing to buy this mind numbingly boring drivel he has spawned of late we may just be proving him right."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What started as a great series has run out of gas. Every story needs to have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Not only has this series reached the time for an ending, it has reached the point where the ending will be at best anti-climatic. A pity RJ either doesn't realize this or is contractually obligated to butcher this series. The book rambles on, but doesn't really go anywhere, building excitement, only to let it slip away."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I used to think Jordan was the most exciting, innovative and impressive fantasy author (or for that matter, almost ANY author) I'd ever read. Now, however, I'm beginning to doubt that he even writes his own stuff. No one who wrote the perfectly fantastic Eye of the World could possibly be responsible for this drivel. Remember when chapters used to fly and when you just knew the last chapter of each character would be explosive? Not anymore. Visions and prophecies were extremely important and revealed in intriguing ways, but in this book Min's vision of the bloody hand and an axe in connection with Perrin was fulfilled so poorly, I wish he hadn't even done it at all. It seemed so random - I thought his whole \\"will I kill for the right cause?\\" dilema was resolved before this, so throwing away his axe because of guilt over one Shaido's hand is just plain [bad] writing. There were plenty of other disappointments in the book, but mainly I was disappointed that he wasted an entire book on trite \\"smoothing her skirts\\" descriptions and not furthering anyone's plot when this series is said to be finished in two more books..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is only a transition book that kicks the can down the road and does very little to help the story.

I was very frustrated by this book. You wait for new chapters of this series to come out and when they finally do, the storyline is moved forward just a tiny bit. 90 some pages of prologue and Jordan seems to be introducing new story lines instead of angling things toward the end. I'm not asking for the series to end in the next few books or anything, I love this story, but a great story like this needs an ending to be complete, and frankly, the latest books haven't been worth reading for sheer enjoyment purposes. Read this book only if you have read the others and are like me and want to get through to the end. Then hope Jordan picks up the pace in his next book and decides to finish this series before he dies."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Do we really need 300 pages of the boring fight for the Throne of Andor. I'm only 2/3's of the way though the book yet almost nothing has happened. Enough build-up! Build-up is, in fact, a bad choice of words; the passages have become a quagmire of side stories. The Last Battle has become a side note as Jordan milks this saga for every possible tedious detail.The first three books were good, then, like a lizard being chilled, the pace becomes achingly slow as events are replaced with every errant thought about the quality of the wool some dame is wearing. I force myself to read on because I'm in this deep, but please Senior Jordan; give some sign that there is a conclusion somewhere in the future. I'm sort of at the same point that I get when I fill up too quickly at an all-you-can-eat joint; my eight bucks are wasted if I don't keep stuffing myself. But at some point, when the belt has run short of notches, and any further eating will result in plugging up my esophagus, I must give up.Sometimes it seems that Jordan's purpose for writing is to create a catalogue of near unpronounceable names for dames who, after smoothing their skirts, tugging the corners of their shawl or braid, will probably never be mentioned again. Of course there are the Old Faithful-like scenes where one of the main characters is forced to be nude.--Chris Neuhahn"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I write this review not to add any more commentary on the book. Everyone has already spoken to the paucity of interest this last novel spawned. I write now in the hope that RJ reads this and knows he lost another huge fan of the early series.In fact...the early series was written by RJ. The last several books (series II) was actually writeen by Bizzaro RJ.

Thanks for a love lost RJ."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I Have been waiting for years for this tenth book and am very disapointed in the author. It's been a long series and used to be fairly good but the author only had the main character appear only once in the entire book for one chapter. I believe this is called milking the reader for all the bucks he can get out of the series. I am very mad and would like the author to get on with the series or get off and quit. Finish it Mr. Jordon and don't milk me for more money. You used to be a decent author but you fooled the public."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The essence of the book requires at most 10 pages.

Yes you read right. I am a huge Jordan fan and I can not believe that this slop was published. The action peaks towards the end of the book with Matt ordering a woman shot in the back and Egwene falling in the water. That is the extent of the action in this book. Rand is hardly in the book at all and almost no mention of Nynaeve. It is nothing but a filler to sell books and take up space on the TOR book list. I have never been so disappointed with a book. No build up as in previous books. No suspense, almost all of the book was predictable. No climax, the ending of this book left drool on my pillow where my head was bobbing as I struggled against the sandman. Robert Jordan has never before failed to enthrall me with a literary work, but this one left me very unsatisfied. I buy the books as they are placed on the shelf in hardback, but if the next one is as bad as this, I may wait for the paperback or even the cliff notes."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"First let me say something to those reviewers who are critizing the majority opinion. Just because someone dislikes this book does not mean that they are dumb and and unsophisticated. You should not insult those who disagree with your opinion.Now let me explain why I disliked this book. There was very little closure (if any) to the various plots and subplots. The lack of closure alone is not too bad, but combine that with very little action, and very little face time with the main characters(Fortunatetly, my favorite character is not Rand or I would really dislike this book, I happen to be a Mat perosn.) and combine that with anti-climatic situations and you have a very dull read.One anti-climatic situation I have to point out is the fact that the cleaning of saidin was barely acknowledged. Another is the long anticipated meeting between Rand and Logain which turned out to be very uninteresting,I like Jordans style of heavy detail, I think that is his strength, but this time around he did not wrap it around enough drama to make it interesting.I will have to give this book one star."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Plot within plot, whithin plot, whithin....The wheel of time just spins and spins, and goes absolutely nowhere.This series started out so great, but now it is a total waste of your time and money."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Needless to say, this book does not pick up where the other one left off..The Male Half of the one source is clean, but hardly even mentioned as a major event.

There are way too many characters now, and the good ones from the first three are hardly mentioned (e.g. Lan...)Bottom Line: This whole series is getting very long in the tooth, and needs to be ended before all of his readers end up dead of old age..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"People keep writing that this book is just a setup for the next in the series, and we shouldn't be so hard on it. Any serious author doesn't use an entire book as a mere prologue to the next book. That's a horrible way to write a series, and the main reason this series has gone down the drain. What could have been a great fantasy series has turned into pointless drivel. I could sum up this book completely in a page summary. It's come to that point where there is -zero- plot advancement, the redundancy has become unbearable, and Jordan's writing has gotten worse and worse. This series is dead.For a real fantasy series go pick up George R.R. Martin's 'Song of Ice and Fire' saga. Now that's a truely great fantasy story by an author who knows how to progress a series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Please do not waste your money buying this book.

Nothing ever did. The entire book was a prologue. It became clear to me that Jordan is merely trying to get as much money from as little content as possible. The book ended almost exactly where it started. There was no suspense and no climax. In all, COT was rather less than ordinary. I can't believe I waited so long for this.Don't get me wrong, the book was successful in one way: it has quenched my anticipation for further books in the series.

Get your mug out of the bottle and start writing again."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have to say that I found this book truly dissappointing and wish that I had waited for it to come out in paper back or even picked it up at a used store. This one was very boring and I can't really believe that so little story could come out of so many pages. Enough already! Jordan needs to get back to the original characters and stop trying to follow so many at once. I do like the occasional chapter to see from another character's viewpoint, but he has really taken this too far. The book drags on and on needlessly...too much set up. It's not like it is great writing anyway, so get back to the storylines that first interested everyone---Rand, Matt, and Perrin. I could care less about what all the endless, interchangeable array of women are wearing! And putting all the 'female' chapters together really makes this book drag...I honestly think I could be happy just reading the 'male' chapters, but in this case that would only be about 1/4 of the book! I'm starting to feel that Jordan is just creating books for cash. He has a captive audience that will need to know what happens to the story they have been following for years so he has nothing to lose. It is like a microsoft 'interim' product, just a few new touches to make some cash until the next real installment. 2 years waiting in vain and now probably 2 more. I will abandon this series if he does this again."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Nothing happened in this book. I was more or less pleased with book nine, but this was little more than a few inches of fluff between nice shiny covers. In book nine, it took a while, but the plot progressed. Rand cleansed saidin of the power, and I was eagerly anticipating what he would do with it in the next book (this one). The Asha'man would have greater freedom and not be so villafied as word spread of the great happenings. But Crossroads doesn't even catch up to where Winter's Heart ended until around page 400! We don't read anything about Rand until well past chap. 20, and he takes up less than a chapter. The only really interesting part of the book involved Mat's steadily changing relationship with Tuon, his foretold wife-to-be who coincidentally is the future head honcho of the Seanchen. I loved reading about him and his half-battles with her. But he always seemed to lose, which is another problem with Jordan's books. Mat, Egwene, Elayne, even Rand and especially Perrin are allowing everybody to walk all over them. It seems like the author wants to undo what his characters accomplished in earlier books. It certainly seemed that way to me.It could be said that yes, in fact, this book sets us up for book eleven beautifully. Unfortunately, it takes over 600 pages to do so. We dont get anything new at all; it seems like the text is just cut and pasted from earlier novels and Jordan changed a letter or to. It wasn't quite as bad as some critics say it was, but it was a disappointment. Read it anyway, though, its better than nothing and it did have the writing we all know and love. It also left me wanting to read book eleven..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I can't believe that some people claim this book is the the best one yet.

A bad one, at that."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is the worst book out of the ten. Nothing happens, except that R. Jordan has made another million dollars. Those of us who loved the first 5 books, and suffered through the last four, are now crucified upon the tenth. Most of the interesting side plots are dropped in favor of new characters who overwhelm the reader by their staggering numbers and their seeming irrevelance to the storyline. I will probably buy the next book, because I am a glutton for punishment, and there is a tiny optimistic flame within me that says Mr. Jordan will return to form. Please come back to us, Mr. Jordan. Bring back the Wheel of Time that we once loved. We miss Rand and the rest of the Scoobie gang. Please, before it's too late, and we finally grow spines strong enough to resist your cover art."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Wow, I don't think I've ever seen a book from a popular series rated 1.5 stars, and am not sure why it is rated so low. But then, I have the pleasure of being able to read the Wheel of Time books back-to-back. I can imagine for those that waited a year (or however long it was since book 9), how this was a major disappointment. For me...and probably for you, that blight is inconsequential. As such, the book was good. At this point, we all known Mr. Jordan's scope and detail for this universe he has created. To that end, this book felt like it was one long footnote. And I don't mean that in a bad way, necessarily. But seriously, it is as if Mr. Jordan typed in an asterisk in \\"Winter's Heart\\" that leads the reader to a footnote to fill in some information that wouldn't do to be in the main body of text. And that's the plot of this book...filling in the gaps of what everyone else was doing while Rand did his thing (which is what I'll say instead of writing a spoiler) in WH. This is a big, complex world, and in a weird way, stopping to fill us in on where everyone is at and it not necessarily be huge battles or full of action, makes it a bit more realistic. Life has its calms and its battles.So take the 1.5 average rating with a grain of salt, realizing it is from dedicated readers who had to wait a long time for seemingly nothing to happen. But for those who are reading straight-through, it should be an entertaining journey."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Oh my god,I started reading WOT when I started University. 15 Years later I read that a new book is coming out, and that the series might end soon.So I take all my old books, buy the ones I do not have and actually enjoy reading all of them.TILL NOW.Man that book is bad, and the characters are a Pain. I really started to hate Elayne in this book. I still have close to 300 pages, and if I had not already read some good reviews of KOD, I would put that series away for good.I am still trying to figure out, what part sucked most till now, but I guess, it is Elayne and all that stupid subplots about getting the throne of Andor."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have invested a lot of time and money in the Wheel of Time series, and I am very close to calling it a loss and quitting it. I waited and waited for this book to come out in paperback so that I could read it. my advice to Wheel of Time readers is: don't read this one. It does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to progress the story. All of the new information and events could be summed up in a half-dozen sentences. not pages, not paragraphs, SENTENCES. And, to top that, Robert Jordan did not follow this book with the next installment in the interminable series, he went back and wrote a PREQUEL!!! This series, if it continues at this pace, will take forty years to complete, if indeed it is completed in any of our lifetimes. The book is over 800 pages, and covers approximately two days in the life of any given character. Which, by the way, there are so many of, I have lost track of who is who and whose side they are on, and what they are doing, and why. Mr. Jordan is an excellent writer, but a horrific storyteller.

Yes, they are quite imaginative. After reading the first half the series I was hooked. Now I find myself slogging through books like #10, Crossroads of Twilight, working to stay awake to find glimpses of his past good writing that occasionally show up in the reading. I still anticipate reading a better than average conclusion of this series, but find myself apprehensive that it may fail to leave a good taste in my mouth. I read A LOT of scifi-fantasy books every year. I find that Robert Jordan's writings have lapsed from B+ to a C- range. If you want to read \\"A\\" type authors/books try Terry Goodkind, Terry Brooks or R.A. Salvatore. When you get through a few of those books then compare the writing (storytelling, character development, dialogue, originality) with Robert Jordan's most recent work and you will find no comparison. Also, if you are interested in writing, read Terry Brook's Sometimes the Magic Works, it is very to the point about what works in writing.I am not (yet) a professional writer, yet I have written volumes as part of my work. I view my 40+ years experience as a reader to qualify myself to be a critic of what I have read."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After finishing this book, I got the feeling that there should have been at least another half a book. It doesn't follow the normal plot line with in a greater plot line that has marked the rest of the series. (You know, a begining, a middle and an end with a climax somewhere) This book ends in the middle. I have to wonder if Jordon actually wrote a much longer book and Tor balked at the thought of publishing the whole thing and forced Jordon to split the book in half. I hope this is the case as the next book in the series will hopefully be released at a much quicker pace than this one was."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Apparently the wheel of time revolves at various speeds! In this volume, it finally grinds to a dead stop. Never were more words spent describing irrelevant and unremarkable aspects of scenery and clothing. Now that the wheel has stopped, perhaps the next volume will reveal it moving again ... in reverse. Ten volumes of flashbacks? Perhaps the same tales will be told from a different perspective, e.g., the view from the underside of all the fallen leaves, rocks, and snow he feels compelled to describe. I'll wait for volume 21, when things may begin to move *forward* again."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I noticed that the rating for customers is 1 and a half stars, that speaks volumes, which it seems to be Jordan's aim now. I have never been this dissapointed in a book before. Mat and Perrin are the only people who move in the whole book and it is only down the road a little bit, everyone else is in the same spot at the end. On the plus side it is well written but fluff only takes you so far.

Too many characters are added unto each succeeding books that it becomes difficult to keep up with who is doing what, especially since the time lapse between books is much too long.

I no longer enjoy reading it and wish he would &quot;nail shut this coffin&quot; while he still has readers who are intrested in finding out how this lengthy saga ends."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Unfortunately, it seems Robert Jordan has fallen into the commercial trap that so many pulp fantasy writers do: serial placeholders. The first three or four books in this series were excellent, with a sufficient mix of character development and plot action. Now, it seems that we have 600+ pages of rehashed character un-development with a few new novelty characters thrown in to make it look like something is happening. After finishing reading the book and looking back, there is NO significant plot advancement at all. You could skip this book altogether and pick up book 11 without even realizing it. I'm very disappointed in Robert Jordan, and even though I've been forcing myself to read The Wheel of Time since it came out, if Mr. Jordan is trying to drag this series out for another ten books, I'm sure I won't be the only reader who moves on to fresher material long since."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Don't get me wrong the series is good but its getting a bit on the long side.

The story, the characters, everything seems to breathe with a life of its own... the characters LIVE for me.That having been said, I have to ask one thing: Why is RJ drawing this series out like a thin wire? It'll snap if he keeps this up... Not that I don't want to learn more about what's going to happen, but this whole book was a waiting process. It was &quot;We found what we're looking for. We're right outside the town/camp/etc., we can see what we're after... but we'll wait a while and let politics/numbers/honor/etc. distract us for a few weeks.&quot;I'm glad to find out I wasn't the only one 'skimming' the pages looking for quotations. The entire first 2/3 of the book, there were precious few to read.

Remind me again why I CARE that she's gone, please?Anyway, if anyone who has any influence over the editing process for the next book reads this: Remind Mr. Jordan, please, that we WoT fans are still waiting to find out what *really* happened to the removed taint on saidin - when Moiraine is coming back (I know she will) - when we're going to find out Elayne is really Ilyena reborn (who else saw this coming?) and more realistically - when Mat is going to slaughter the Shaidos and get Faile back (about time that happened anyway) once he finds out he, like his sister, can channel. :)I don't suppose I mind waiting another 2 years for the next book... but I hope Tarmon Gai'don comes before my not-yet-conceived firstborn gets sent to the bookstore in her new car to pick up the last book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This has to be the worst book in the series.

Even for die hards like me (yes I own and have read & reread all of them)it is getting to be very boring."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan has so many side plots going that it looks like he had to make this book entirely about developing them... Rand appears for less than 20 pages... No forsaken catch the ax... No real battles... I'm hoping this book is setting the stage for some real action in the next book... But I'm pretty disappointed about waiting two years for this... If this pace keeps up we will need another 10 books to finish the series...Heres to another two year wait..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Crossroads of Twighlight is yet another Jordan book. It is best characterized by its near-total lack of major developments. Readers who are becoming bored with the series will, frankly, probably be disappointed. Die hard fans will probably enjoy it--it has a lot of the flavor of older books, and is not poorly written.Most of the attention is focused on main characters, unlike Winter's Heart, which spent endless periods of time on new characters. Most of the main characters have points-of-view; Mat, Elayne, Egwene Perrin, and Faile all get screen time, with chapters for Rand, Alviarin, Pevara, Karede, and a few others.Most of the action is political, with very little fighting, travel, or discovery. Some new, so far minor threads were introduced. Some interesting decisions were made,although nothing has come of most of them in this book.In short, it wasn't bad, it was moderately interesting, and it was a pleasant book if you like Jordan, but the content could probably have been condensed into a much shorter book. It would have been much, much better if the plot had actually developed and some of the hanging situations been resolved."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is horrible. The dialogue is like something like this(think Bill And TEd)Perrin and Aram discussing the Shiado)P: Dude lets go kill some Shiado!A: Dude lets go! Uh, dude, who are the Shiado?P: Dude their the Aiel clan lead by that HOTTIE Sanahanna or what ever that chicks name is.A:Dude,she is a righteos babe! Dude, Uh, why do we want to kill a hottie like her?

I'll rate this book as a 3 right now because I'm not finished with it yet. I have read almost half this book and it has been utterly boring. Book 9 the male half of the true source was cleansed, yes? Not until page 310 does the channeling for that feat even stop... and this is in book 10. To me, the whole part with Elayne and her tedious plots to gain support for her claim to the lion throne are ridiculous and unnecessary. Didn't Jordan have something better to write about? The source is clean for God's sake at least have people rejoicing. Have Rand go back to Tear or Illian and pick up where he left off. Don't waste the readers' time by talking about worthless bargains with the Atha'an Miere or Elayne's complaints about having to drink watered-down tea, and if you do, don't take three hundred pages to do it!Now, the important question; should you read this book? Yes, certainly, you don't want to be lost when book 27 comes out and the bargain with the Atha'an Miere actually comes into play, but please, for the benefit of all the really good writers out there who right because they love it, don't buy this book! As another reviewer said, get it from the library! Download it from the internet, I don't care, just don't buy it!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Oh my god,I started reading WOT when I started University. 15 Years later I read that a new book is coming out, and that the series might end soon.So I take all my old books, buy the ones I do not have and actually enjoy reading all of them.TILL NOW.Man that book is bad, and the characters are a Pain. I really started to hate Elayne in this book. I still have close to 300 pages, and if I had not already read some good reviews of KOD, I would put that series away for good.I am still trying to figure out, what part sucked most till now, but I guess, it is Elayne and all that stupid subplots about getting the throne of Andor."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordon does what he does best: Milking the hell out of the WoT series. 600+ reviews and 2 stars. Even his die-hard fans are starting to have doubts. Someone in his editorial department or his publisher need to tap him on the shoulder and say \\"Hey, it's okay. Just end you. There's rehabs. Or you can always write \\"Wheel of Space\\". Same characters except in space. But please just finish the book\\"Plot summary: Nothing remotely interesting happens. Unless you like to know what type of clothes Elayne likes to wear. Rand (you know, the main character) is missing from the majority of the book. Take everything that's been written about all the main character from the previous book, cut and paste it to this one, and there you go. This is easily the worst WoT book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I want to start this review by saying that I truly believe Robert Jordan is one of the most talented and skillful writers I have had the pleasure of reading. I greatly appreciate his attention to detail and character development without the fear of crossing the 1,000 page mark (well, in the earlier WoT books anyway). I often get the feeling that other would-be great writers limit their talents by limiting their stories to a page limit, and now, sadly, it looks like RJ will be joining their ranks. Unlike others that have posted their reviews here, I prefer the plots to be tedious, difficult and confusing at times. That is what makes a great series great. If I wanted a wham-bam, get to the end quick, instant gratification story line, I'd watch a movie.Now with all that said, I found CoT to be an embarrassing disappointment. This is obviously not up to RJ's standards, and at best, reads more like an incomplete book that needs another 600 pages to get anywhere. I would gladly read the other 600 pages and look forward to the next installment, but don't insult me by making me wait another 2 years for the other half.In conclusion, if you're a WoT fan and you haven't bought the book yet, don't waste your time and money yet. Wait for the next book to come out and buy them both together, at least you'll save yourself from bitter disappointment. Let's just hope we don't have to wait another 2 years."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book needs to be put on the back shelf! It may sell, but only on the merits of the series. Did Jordan forget the standard format of a hero's journey? He forgot the most important part; the climax! Wheres the battle, the downed enemy, or the discorved hazard? Left out? LEFT OUT! How can a GOOD book end with out some milestone?So if you've been reading the series wait till it comes out in paperback then buy it.. read it.. throw it away! If you haven't been reading the series DON'T START!! Wait until its done then skip this novel when you do read it.Finaly to mister Jordan, FINISH the series!Thanks,Jim"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"So many characters to keep up with, plot keeps expanding. Losing track of storyline as it was in beginning books. He's still worth reading. I will continue to buy and read Jordan, as soon as he publishes. It's taking too long to move in the story. Rand, as one of the main characters, comes in almost at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Approximately five years ago I bought at a yard sale the first 7 books for $3.00 each. These books were wonderful and held my interest. I was somewhat disappointed, after waiting what seemed like forever for them to come out, in books 8 and 9. Now after finishing book 10 where once again the movement toward the final battle crawled; I wonder how many ages will have to come and go before the final battle?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have read about 1/2 of the book and it appears to be another &quot;set up&quot; book. It is laying the foundation for the concluding books (I have read there will maybe 3 more) of the Wheel of Time. This is a must for all WOT readers but not the best, not even the second or third best."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The book, I must say was great. But I was disappointed in the fact that so little happened. Perrin hasn't rescued Faile, Egwene is still besieging, etc. Nothing happens! The epilogue tells you more about the story than the rest of the book! OK, that is an overstatement. The book gives you alot of new information, but nothing happens. I suggest buying used or paperback. So, basically, I agree with almost everyone else. BUT THE BOOK WAS GREAT. I read it non-stop after I received it from Amazon(6 days ahead of schedule)"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"the book was good, but not very advancing in the series. if you have stuck with the series for this long, dont stop now. i liked it alright, but the book jackets for the 9th and 10th books almost sound the same."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I read this book when it came out, and it was the first WoT book I had to wait for (1-2 years). I was a little shocked to discover how many people hated it, but in retrospect I can see that it had a lot to do with how long some people had been waiting for the series to end, and that the effect was a cumulative thing which began for some as early as TSR (though now most people consider the books to get progressively slower beginning at ACOS; many older fans go further back, and some referred to LOC, now a fan favorite, as 'half a book').It's interesting to see how these things develop as the years go on. Now, most new readers don't even notice the blip in the slower books, and many seem as shocked as I was that COT is so hated. For its place in the series, it does I think exactly what it was supposed to do, and there is quite a bit of value in it that is overlooked."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I enjoyed the earlier books in this series much more than the later books. The plot in the series progresses at soap opera speeds. All of Robert Jordon's books in this series need to edited into smaller faster passed books. Each character is cursed with leading an interesting life which is followed on a day to day basis. Most of the characters no longer interest me, but I still want to find out what happens."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan is an incredibly gifted author. The book is nearly captivating. The reason it falls short of top honors is because so many plots have developed in the series that it has become confusing.Think of a three-ring circus with several side shows. It becomes a chore to keep track of what is going on to the point of lost emphasis on the main plot. I was hoping for some plot consolidation in this work. Unfortunately this didn't happen.This work left us hanging like the several that preceded it. I hope that in his next book, Robert Jordan consolidates the plots into an azimuth towards finale. He has laid the basis for possibilities for several other series if he wishes to do so. I recommend the book. Yet, like books six through nine, this one again falls short of expectations."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I wouldnt say that nothing happened, since after i read this book, an end to this series is very unlikely in my eyes. there wasnt any action at all and the story wasnt brought forward, but Jordan introduced some new problems and characters. This really got me frustrated, and i feel like a junkie, who doesnt get the thrill anymore, but cant let go of his addiction.Please Mr. Jordan: release us!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"OK, this was most definitely not Robert Jordan's best book, but I also don't think it was his worst. Overall, this series began with 7 great books, and then book 8 came. And it was terrible. Book 9 was much better than book 8, and I thought almost back to the high standard set in the first 7. This book is similar to book 8, yet I think it was much better. Tuon's character begins to develop and things start to move on with the rebel Aes Sedai. There was definitely not enough of Rand(only 30 pages!!) and the sections about Perrin were horrible, but it starts to move forward near the end. This used to be first rate fantasy, but now it is only just better than mediocre.If you want a real fantasy series, read George R R Martin's &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; or Terry Goodkind's &quot;Sword of Truth&quot;."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Not One Battle scene in the entire book.No major decisions or events.In fact, the entire thing was like reading deleted scenes from the last book. Scenes that could have been left deleted. Perrin chases his own tail, Matt courts his future wife, Egwene watches the rebels chase their tails, Rand makes a cameo appearance and the bad guys are either all on vacation or doing equally boring things of their own. Definitely NOT worth the price of buying in hardback. Very disapointing."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I believe the answer to this question is nothing happened in this book. Now I am a livid fan of this series, but honestly the characters did nothing but mosey around thier plots and nothing was accomplished. The descriptions were as always good, the dialogue was consistant with the other volumes, but the complete lack of any action, story conclusions, plot tie ups, or any progression of the story left me wondering if it is going to be worth picking up the 11th volume. (is it just me or were there only supposed to be 10 volumes three or so years ago) In addition I feel jipped, this book wasn't worth the twenty or so dollars I spent on it. In all actuallity I think it might be worth the hassle of skipping the tenth novel and simply wait for the eleventh, I don't see where any one will miss anything.Sorry if this offends."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If you are anticipating Robert Jordan's newest Wheel of Time installment to merely weave the tale more tightly and leave even more questions without a single answer, then I strongly recommend &quot;Crossroads of Twilight.&quot; However, if you are expecting book ten to reveal even a glimmer of an answer or wrap up any of the subplots, I would not- at least not until the eleventh book is released! Most of the characters are revisited and their situations updated, but no real advancements in the plot or subplots are made. We know barely any more at the end of &quot;Crossroads...&quot; then we do at the beginning. You must eventually read this book to continue on to the next. But, since we probably have another two years to wait for book eleven, I see no reason to read it now. Whether you read it now or wait until the next Wheel of Time release, remember patience is a virtue."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I had the same criticism of book 10 that I had of book 8 - nothing major happens. All the plot lines progress a little bit, but just when you think something major could happen, the novel ends. And it doesn't even seem like a good stopping point, it just ENDS. I've read somewhere that this is part of Jordan's plan, to make every other book a more intense book, which I can believe because book 9 was great.You might want to even put off reading book 10 until book 11 is due to come out, otherwise you'll end up like many of us, disappointed at the end of 10 and frustrated that you have to wait another 2 years for anything to happen."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"just wanted to say it isn't worth the wait nothing change but more ?????? then answear should of gave us something."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It took him 300 pages to get back to the point where Rand was cleansing the source (from the other characters perspectives). And another 300 to describe how the characters were talking to each other and nothing at all was happening. Even when some action did happen he moves quickly on. Every character is in exactly the same point as when we left them in the previous book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"First: if you want to do a favor for yourself and others, read this book with a pencil in hand and just \\"X\\" out the paragraphs that say nothing, do nothing, and speak of nothing. It will be about 3/4's of the book. So when book 11 comes out you can then review this volume in about 45 minutes.And let's get real, this is all about money. How much is Jordan getting per book? How much have I sunk into this series already? (Hint: I have a first addition hardcover of book 2, and have bought hard cover copies of each book since.) But this book is ridiculous.Just get on with the story already!Jordan has it in him, and I hope he's as frustrated as we are (I doubt it though, we write the checks, he receives them.) He can obviously write a fast moving, engaging, full length book, but this delving into the personal thoughts, dress, and customs of characters 3 levels (or more) below the main characters is boring, tedious, and a shameless abusing of loyal fans.This latest book is boring, confusing, and introduces you to hundreds of people NO ONE can keep straight anymore. (Jordan's story plot program must have a file in the gigabytes by now. (Is this what computers have brought us to, novels so complex even the author can't possibly keep it straight without a computer program to help?)) I find myself just skimming over pages with meaningless characters having conversations with each other over trivial matters. Has TOR assigned staff writers to just pick a minor character, develop it, and write dialog for it? Are there 15 staff writers all submitting their meaningless drivel and the editor just publishing it all knowing we are stupid enough to buy it, in hardcover?!If you must, buy this book now, but I'd wait a month or two, this one will end up in the \\"bargain book bin\\" very quickly."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have rather mixed views on this book. As in every series there seems to be certain areas of \\"filler\\". Where the author or director just makes an episode or book to take up space. I believe what occurred in CoT could have been condensed about 200 pages and added to WH. However, even though this is my least favorite book in the series, I am in no way dissapointed or giving up on WoT. Everything that Jordan wrote in CoT was as entertaining and enjoyable as every other book. I enjoy the amount of detail Jordan creates in his books, which CoT certainly doesn't lack. However, Jordan has delved to far into the microscopic details and has totally forgotten the macroscopic. The pacing of CoT suffers greatly from this and that is why I believe it's a \\"filler\\" book. No one but a die hard fanatic would care about the events in CoT. I hope RJ understands that and gets back to form."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I didn't read this book, but after reading reviews of the other people, and having read the other nine books in the series, I'm convinced it must suck, and I feel compelled to write a review.While the first few books of this series held my attention and held promise, everything after quickly goes on a downward spiral. And, I know one needs to reintroduce things to some extent, so that fools who start the series on the 4th or 8th book can know what's happening. HOWEVER, after those first few books, it seemed about 300 pages per book were uselessly wasted repeating stuff from prior books. I really think the nine books I read could've been published in only five or six volumes had that repetition been left out. Even worse though, the plot seemed to become less and less present as the series went on, with lots of little unimportant stuff and unimportant people dragging the story out.So, PLEASE, don't waste your time and money on this series like I did. And, if the author is reading this, its most certainly impractical to reimburse those of us who read your books here, either for time or money, but please - PLEASE - end the series and let us all move on!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Actually, I stopped at #8 and refuse to pick up any of the WoT series until he's FINISHED! That said, I get the basic plot from the other reviews here and so I feel good about my decision to wait. I remember (sigh) the early days when I was reading the first two or three in the series. Like the beginning of a new relationship, it held promise, I looked forward to each page, and scheduled &quot;dates&quot; where I could sit home and spend time with this wonderful story. Since about book 6, however, (like many relationships) it's gone quite stale. Wrap it up, Rob."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book goes absolutely nowhere. I thought maybe several hundred pages fell out of the end and I missed all the action. I'm kind of curious how long Mr. Jordon thinks people will keep paying for books that don't move the plot at all. I forgave him for book #9 thinking that he was building up to a blowout in book #10. But....nothing. Hundreds and hundreds of pages of characters that I don't care about talking about nothing important or advancing the story in any way. You've profited enough from me, Mr. Jordan. Never again. Why isn't there a zero star rating?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Review updated June 2010.I ran across a hardcover of this for $2 in a local bookstore, and figured \\"Why not?\\" I'd originally read it the week it came out in 2003, and complained about it, but who knows -- a lot of time has passed, and I'm no longer in the position of waiting two years for each WoT book. Maybe it's not so bad?Nope. Truly nothing happens. About 80% of the book is bad, and you can start skipping paragraphs, then skipping entire chapters as you realize they're filler. This is even more evident on a reread, because now you KNOW the chapter is worthless; you aren't guessing anymore! And even in the remaining 20% of the book that's not pure filler, at least every other paragraph is junk and gets skipped. And nothing really happens all the same. There are just some vaguely memorable scenes, like Shadar Haran visiting Alviarin, or Aviendha convincing Elayne not to open a gateway to Rand's cleansing. (Note: Someone deciding NOT to do something!)And yes, I think it ruins the series beyond redemption. 7-10 in general are inexcusably slow and rambling, and #10 tops it off and just ruins it all. Later books really do improve, and that's enough to placate EXISTING fans, but we can never recommend the series to NEW fans in good conscience. Ten or twenty years from now, the only people reading Wheel of Time will be artists deconstructing its failure."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'll start by readily admitting I did not read Crossroads. So why am I writing a review?Because I marched, with dilegence and fortitude through the last three books. I kept telling myself (after Lord of Chaos, in my view the last good book), that it had to get better. Something had to happen. The major characters had to stop whining, constantly. And Jordan had to stop milking his little cash cow and finish the series with a good pace.And then on one fateful night I decided, one week after Crossroads came out, that I would forgive Jordan the past books and run down to the store and buy it. The store closed two minutes before I got there.Frustrated, I went home and wrote my friends email about the experience. Chiefly, two friends of mine who had defended the prior few books. Both told me not to buy the book. That only the final two chapters were worth reading. That it was worse than all the previous ones combined.So I'm posting a review to say, fine. I won't buy it. I won't read it. I hope others come on here, thinking after all this time perhaps they'll buy the paperback when it comes out, and they join me in solidarity. Send a message to Mr. Jordan that if he wants to make more money, he needs to actually write something decent, not rest on his creative laurels, acheived ten years ago on the strength of a rapidly-dying series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This novel was just as good as all his other novels it is not like his writing has become poorer it is been like this from the begging. I do agree that it is time to stop making more plots but that doesn't make this a bad book. I enjoyed it as much as the others and was glad to read it and it is true he makes you wait a long time for the next book. I guess I am not as mad about it cause I just started the series a while a go and now that I am done. It is the first time I have had to wait for the next novel. But if your mad because of that your not mad that it was a bad book your mad cause you don't have the rest right now. So don't give a book a one star review because of that come on. If that's really how you feel just don't read the series any more till it is all written out. No the reason I gave it a three star review was because that is all I thought the series deserved. Now from here on in it is more a review on the series then just Crossroads of twilight. This might sound like I am giving Jordan a bash but this is just what I think and I believe it to be the plain and simple truth. The girls in his series are annoying most of the time although you can grow to not mind this but it is very sicking at times. Next sometimes he doesn't finish a character or say what happened to him but that is easy to forget as the books are so big and it would only make them longer. Eventually you forget about them any way. Next Rand seems more interested in his love life then his mission to save the world sometimes. Now that is why I did not give it five stars it also did not give me quite the excitement the Lord of the Rings gave me which I am a big fan of. I don't like making that comparison because the lord of the rings is one of the best if not the best fantasy novel ever. Yet the reason I gave it three stars (I would have given it three and a half) was because I enjoyed the book and didn't ever feel like the series was getting worse and I was exited to read every book. I didn't mind the length although there are times in the book were you want to skip a couple pages but I never stopped reading the series for while and then finished it later, which I will do with other books if they get to boring part that drags on tell it seems for ever. I doubt you would have got to book ten if you found this in the series you so called! Ex Fans! He writes the same the whole way thru although some books do move the plot more then others. Some say that he could have wrote more on other stuff that was interesting instead of clothes but I think that is a bit of an exaggeration. But I did not think that any thing he wrote was really un enjoyable did you if you did how did you get to book ten and why didn't you rate every book with 1 star. So I am saying it got three stars form me just for being an enjoyable read for entertainment (what else is fantasy unless you are trying to get a point across but I don't think he is, man those annoying girls). It wasn't as good as some books but was better then others. And I like things in the book like Perrins character he is truly noble so there were many thing I enjoyed but I won't give these parts away to people who have not read the series. So that is what I have to say judge a book by what is in it not how many pages are there are and are going to be. I don't care just as long as he writes an end. You will either like the whole series or hate it and those who liked only half are weird and have been persuaded by their friends and each other that it is just to long. The End"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I must say i injoyed the book even thou the end is no where in site. This book was no worse then any of his other novels it just that people want the end. So do I but i still enjoyed the book and i must admit it makes me mad to think there might not be an end. So i enjoyed the series a lot and read them in no time and was exited about reading every book. So i did not give this book a three star rating cause there was no end. Actually from here on end it is more like a series review on all the books. I gave it three stars because of the things i thought were a bit silly. Like the girls in this book they were annoying most of the time almost all the time. Yet when the weren't always taking about how boys cant do anything they were actually i repeat actually okay. Now this may look like i am goin to give the series a bit of a bash but i am talking why it did not get five stars later i'll take about why it got three. Now rands character during the series seems more interested in his love life then his mission to save the world. That and the fact that there are so many times in the series were Robert Jordan talks about something and then 3 books later on you remember it was there but he didn't talk about it anymore. And you go back in the book to see if it was acctually in the book or your making it up and it was and you think why did he stick that in it. and some still haven't been filled in from some of the yearliest books. Now this does not happen often just once or twice. But it's a big series and easy to over look that. Now the reason i gave it three star instead of one was because i found his book gave me pleasure and i read them with exitment. Some of the good things in the book are like Perrin's Character i mean he is always the Noblest yet doesn't like it when they____ people you have read the sereies no but others don't so i won't say. Any way he just has such a strong character. He has a great imagination that just takes you into the novel and cool ideas such as the game of houses and he proved he can kill of a character when ____died. And so that is all i have to say the still injoyable books i could care less how long the are just as long as they !End! I just like reading fantsy..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Could it get worse? Reading more books in this series is like watching a car wreck. You think you want to see it, but after you get a good look, you really regret it. There are too many problems with this series now, but one that I find particularly annoying is Jordan's tendency to write about 600 pages of drivel and then put a cliff-hanger at the end. These are seldom resolved. Why is everyone so surprised that there was no mention of the taint being cleansed? Remember the Bowl of the Winds that the three stupid gits went to get in Book 8? Remember the big scene where they used it? No? There's a good reason for that. I also find the characters to too similar, and I'm not just talking about the women don't get men/men don't get women garbage. The Forsaken are ALL ALIKE. RJ had a chance to make 13 tasty villains, and instead they're all alike. They're not particularly menacing and when they do show up, we don't get much. Is Halima one of the Chosen? (I forget who). Sure. But is he plotting? Scheming? Doing ANYTHING interesting? NO. And one last complaint: What's with RJ's ego? Does he actually think he's the greatest thing since JRRT? That junk in the bio about learning to read &quot;with the incidental aid&quot; of a brother...WHO CARES? Are we supposed to be impressed by this? I teach a lot of young kids who can read at a young age--and most write better than RJ."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I do not need to reiterate that this book is long and tedious with little actual action - you can read that in any other review. My problem instead is with the erosion of Jordan's writing. The original books in this series not only had much more active pacing, but they contained drastically fewer characters, to the credit of the writer. The number of characters in the early books left Jordan time to develop and realize each one in a believable way that is simply lacking in the more recent novels. These later books have many times the number of characters at the expense of character development.In a very real sense, each character is given a single trait that is played back ad nauseum - you find yourself counting how many times a basic device is used (such as an uptight character that tugs at a braid). The characters have each become eggshells with nothing inside, and that is what is truly disappointing about this series now. I'd rather Jordan muster 10 believable characters to fill his world than a thousand cardboard cut-outs. Don't scratch below the surface of this \\"epic\\" fantasy landscape - you'll only find that it is full of hot air."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The title of my review sums it up. There is simply no excuse for this, period. The only thing approaching a viable excuse is that book 10 has been &quot;setup&quot; for something else, which every review over 1 star seems to harp upon. Book 9 was setup. And book 8. And book 7. That's several thousand pages of setup.Which is, as I said, inexcusable.Books used for setup should not be permitted, end of story. (Assuming this is even &quot;setup&quot; to begin with, which is quite a stretch.) Prologues are for setup. Chapters are for setup. Novels are not used for setup, let alone two or three of them in a row. Some people claim book 9 somehow moved the plot, but that's only in comparison to the rest of this tedious nightmare.Wheel of Time was my obsession and love for almost ten years. I read every book four times. Now it's time to burn them all."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book nudges the complex plot of \\"The Wheel of Time\\" forward with no end in sight. The series is compelling and this book is a must read for those of us who have read the previous novels. Those unfamiliar with the series should start at the beginning with \\"The eye of the World\\""},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The good news is that Crossroads of Twilight is better than the last two books of this series. The bad news is this book is still nowhere close to the first six books of this series. The chapters with Elayne in the middle of the book did absolutely nothing for me and after the 3-4 chapters of her in the middle of the book, we never saw her again. Perrin continued the chase to free his wife from the Shaido. How long is this going to last? Matt traded barbs with the Daughter of the Nine Moons and then went shopping with her. Egwene led the rebel Aes Sedai and their army to Tar Valon but did absolutely nothing once they got there. Rand was hardly in this book. Isn't he supposed to be the main character? I guess this sounds like a one star review but I do have to admit, Jordan can make filler interesting. He goes into so much detail about this fantasy world, it's hard not to read it and lose track of time(except for the Elayne chapters). The opening at Cairhien interested me and the Alviarin, Mesana &amp; Elaida chapter was interesting. Mat is usually fun to read about even though he was involved in no action in this book. I also liked Perrin a little more after this book. I agree with one of the reviewers that Book 11 should really pick up. I hope."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book had the best moments when it dealt with the characters I cared about, but it was still a retread of elements of the past two or three books. (Unlike some reviewers, I loved up to book 6 - Lord of Chaos is one of my favorites).PLUSES:The major characters were all in this one.It's intricately plotted (which can be a plus or a minus).MINUSES:A certain main character not appearing until near the end of the book.Too much manouvering and conversations among lesser characters that I have no investment in. Most of these characters sound alike also.No picking up of the most exciting threads left over from the previous books. (The madness, resolution of some of the prophecies, various romantic entanglements, missing/departed friends and enemies, whatever happened to..?).Everyone in a kind of holding pattern waiting for something to happen.There are no new villains or heroes. The best of the old ones appeared in the first handful of books. The recently introduced ones are just ineffectual somehow.SUMMARY:I still liked bits of it, but I find I couldn't read the whole book straight through. I like to flick through to the chapters with characters I care about, and strangely enough, this did not skew the book's plot much at all. So I suppose what I really wish, is that Rand and his friends would be more integrated with eachother, the stories intertwining more, but everyone seems to be grinding their wheels in one spot in this installment. I also wouldn't mind seeing RJ tie off a few plot threads.Still, I have hopes maybe the next installment will shift the pace a bit."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I don't mind books that take a while to write, I don't mind a series that has taken an author a long time to write, but I do mind it when it takes him TWO books to tell us what they are all doing in a 2 or 3 month timeframe. Now, I know what you are thinking 2 or 3 months is a long time. You are right. However, we either get redundant amounts of information (Look over there!! Rand is doing something with a lot of the one power!!) or you get trivialities that really do not progress the overall story line (as far as anyone READING the series can tell). There really is no reason for it to take 2 books and 5 years to tell us those things. My only request to get on with the plot. 7 years to wait to see what the hell happens with the White Tower? When does Rand (or Logian) deal with Taim? What is going on with the overall plots? I am happy that Elayne is becoming queen (3-4 books?), I am happy that Rand married the girls (since book 4 or 5 I have been waiting), I just think he should move it along a bit.Overall, I give this book an 'eh'. Just not enough there to make me care that much."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The tenth volume in the series is not the strongest and does not deserve the 5 star ratings that some have granted it. But it also is not a disaster that deserves the many one star ratings that it has received. The book does not have any huge action scenes or major plot developments, but it does flow very well. I do miss the excitement that I had reading the earlier volumes of the series. But Jordan hasn't lost all of of his skill, I was able to enjoy this volume. I will be looking forward to book #11. If you're a fan of the series, don't hesitate to buy &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot;. It's not Jordan at his strongest, but it's a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have to agree with one of the fellow reviewers. I dont want to sound repetitive but eventhough this book is more of the same since Path of Daggers it is not as terrible as I thought it was going to be reading previous reviews. It is dull, many useless descriptions and a boring Prologue but... If you read between lines there are several clues that definetly show a glimpse finally on Tarmon Gaidon and a future conclusion. I kinda find it like the sequel to Lord of the Rings, the Two Towers, 900 pages /3 hours of movie about..nothing, but transitions are necessary for the conclusion. I do think, true that Mr Jordan has probably been seduced by the tainted power of marketing, sales and capitalism, \\"as long as there is profit, may the series extend!\\"... well we eagerly await a conclusion, no matter how many books left1, 3 5... as long as they are grasping and interesting!!!!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was very disappointed with this book, in comparison with the rest of the series, which was excellently written. instead of anything meaningful happening, almost the whole of the book is devoted to other characters being aware of the events at the end of Winter's Heart. aside from this, they seem to do not much but sit around and talk. while thsi could have been done well, they don't really seem to have much to talk about. I enjoy character interaction, but i like it to have some purpose.It would have been nice to have a little more action as well.As a result of this total lack of plot advancement, and its coexistance with the events ending book 9, i would rather call this Book 9A than book 10.and for the love of God, could someone please find a better person to do the cover art for these books? These look like teddy bears, not people. maybe one of the D&amp;D artists is available."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As is usually the case with Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time cycle, the writing is good to excellent, and the intrigue and mystery is very involving. As is also usually the case, Jordan has this thing for corporal punishment and loves to play around with power and hierarchy to a degree that almost seems... well, forced.What I've come to notice in many of these books is that Jordan likes to play games with power between groups and especially between people within groups and what happens when established barriers break down, resulting in a redistribution of power. There are numerous webs of interaction with this major theme, particularly with those who lose power to another greater force. He loves this theme and, if you're not paying attention, it's pretty interesting. If you are paying attention, it begins to wear on you because it's always the same. Of course, perhaps that's Jordan's point. Power is relative.As for any resolution of anything, don't expect it in this book. If nothing else, Jordan will have fans frothing at the mouth (likely in frustration, not anticipation) because not even a single sub-plot is resolved in this book. He does, however, set up massive implications for his next book. The question one has to ask is, \\"Was this 600 pager necessary? Could Jordan have maintained the same level of intensity, detail, and intrigue without forcing readers to go through another book in which nothing really happens, but events are just set up for a 'happening?'\\" The answer is, \\"Yes.\\"We spend a lot of time with all of the principles in this book (well, with the exception of Lan and Nynaeve), but we don't really learn anything new about them. Jordan has established these characters well already and, when there's no further development necessary in a book/series of this sort, then action is required in order to maintain the story's integrity. We get very little action here and a lot of talking. The talking would have been fine if we saw more about these characters that we didn't already know, but, with the possible exception of Perrin (and that's a real stretch), we don't really learn anything new.Another challenge with this book is a problem that will require most fans to re-read the entire series from start to finish once (well, if) Jordan finishes the cycle are the number of secondary and tertiary characters he introduces. There are so many different Aes Sedai, so many different rulers, so many different servants, so many different people to whom he dedicates a great deal of time and effort to, you would think that you could differentiate them from each other. Unfortunately, when you're waiting a year or two between books in which there is a cast of almost 100 characters, this becomes virtually impossible, especially when Jordan adds more and more characters to the mix. Because of Jordan's obsession with Power among people and groups and how that Power is manipulated, these characters are all very similar. Each is wondering how s/he ranks compared to this other character and how s/he can use that other character to get what s/he wants and how much they can trust, and so on, and so on. Again, this may well be the point Jordan's trying to convey (among others) but there are better ways of doing this.Is this a good book? Yes. It still captures the breadth of the world and the various cultures he's created and the massive past that these people must contend with, not to mention the certain, yet simultaneously uncertain, future that looms like a mountain before them. Also, let's remember that what Jordan has done has revitalized genre fantasy in many ways. His books have had a tremendous influence on the genre. Even at his worse, Jordan's books are significantly more sophisticated that much of the standard fare out there.Is it one of his better books in the cycle? No. Once again, this book reads like a filler. We are introduced to more and more mysteries without a single resolution. We are introduced to a few more characters (at least it seems that way) about whom we learn very little. We are reminded about threats, but receive no clarification. And we end with more questions than answers. Even within a series of books, there should be a central theme and plot (even a sub-plot) that ties the book together, within which there is some kind of resolution. Yes, the name of this is Crossroads of Twilight, and it's obvious that each character is facing a fork in their destiny. But there are no resolutions at all. In Tolkien's The Two Towers (more so the book than the recent movie), the sub-plot is dealing with Saruman and the Riders of Rohan. In Lucas's Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, it's determining why Darth Vader has an obsession with Luke and the resolution of Han and Leia's love affair. In Crossroads of Twilight (like the previous three books in the cycle), we really don't learn much of anything.So, until the next novel, we fans will wait until... Well, until Tarmon Gaidon I suppose to learn something new. And that's a real shame.As a fantasy novel, this is a B+. For Jordan, this is a D+."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Ho, hum...yet another Wheel of Time book in which nothing happens. I can't believe I wasted money on this book, let alone slogged all the way through it. Jordan is a workmanlike writer at best and is completely uninspired here, except by the large dollar signs this series continues to bring in based on its promising but now squandered beginnings seven books ago. Will this series ever end? Don't hold your breath as long as Jordan and TOR still make money from it. I wouldn't be surprised to see the 4 or so major characters split off into book series of their own in order to keep this tedious material going as long as people will pay for it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"what was the great thing about this story NOTHING!!!He's just trying to make it longer so he can get more moneyi loved all his storys some more than others but this one has nothing to like about it . It is his worst book ever im almost afraid to read the next one"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If Ed Wood's \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\" is considered the worst commercial movie ever made, then Robert Jordan's Crossroads of Twilight must be the worst novel ever written. Remember all those horrible books your teachers called literature in high school? This is worse, much worse. Following (and retreading) the explosive ending to Winter's Heart, it gets off to a somewhat interesting start at the prologue, in which the threads seem to be coming together, the story then spirals off to a complete lack of progress or any kind of closure whatsoever. Every character's dilemma is no closer to getting alleviated and in many cases they (Matt and co's run from the Seanchan, for instance) actually fall behind. Every major character follows the circular track that Jordan developed for each of them 7, 8, or 9 books back, thus ensuring that they fail to go forward on their goals. This circular development repeats the same set of descriptions over and over and only deviates when describing their garments; for example, how many times does RJ have to tell us Elayne's knocked up? How many times does he have to describe the alleged boys-against-girls/girls against boys conspiracy? When will the story end?Most distressing of all is that I skipped entire chapters and when subsequent ones returned to the passed over characters, nothing happened whatsoever in between and nothing happens thereafter! This book has no distinct beginning, middle, or most galling of all, an end; it is a quagmire of beginnings that go nowhere and it is safe to say that this non-story can be skipped and will take nothing away from its elusive sequel. I implore all of you to ignore this book, wait for the dust to settle for book 11 and then check that out from the library or get the paperback if you must read it. Likewise for this one."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Do you know what I liked about this book? The cover didn't fall off the paperback edition like with the beginning books. This book actually manages to move the plot backwards since the last book. Please note that 800 pages of building suspense isn't suspenseful at all when you are introducing completely new characters and even more plot lines that have nothing to do with the original narrative. Oh yeah, the two stars here are only in comparison with Jordan's other books, not with everything out there right now. Because this book is well written, it's just that nothing happens. And the thing that gets me the most - there is not one battle in this book. The death toll has to be the lowest of any of Jordan's books, I think maybe one guy dies. But no battles? Grraarrghhh! There are no words to express my anger right now. Remember the first four books when Shadowspawn were around every corner and we felt that any character could die at any moment? Now we get 10 page long scenes of Elayne walking around the palace in Caemlyn. Good work Jordan, maybe next time you should try not sucking. Bring back the Fades, bring back the Trollocs, bring back the Forsaken who are actually threatening (remember Ismael?). And instead of introducing more characters, how about killing off a few.

Jordon is now writing just to make a buck. What an insult to his loyal readers. I'm debating whether to even buy the paperback of the next installment. If it stinks as bad as this one I'm done with the series. Jordon should be ashamed of himself because he can't seriously believe his loyal readers would like this obvious stink bomb. The only explanation is that he is dragging out the story with unnecessary and excruciatingly boring details such as the color of mud on some peasant's boots just so he can sell a few more books. The book is a miserable disappointment. Given six weeks any hack could have written it. Watching ice melt would have been more interesting, and a lot cheaper.

It's not worth the waste of your time, and I suggest that, if you want to waste money, buy a good cigar instead and then you will at least have some pleasure out of burning your money. This book is simply a re-hash of the last 3-4. I get the impression that Jordan has just cut paragraphs at random out of the previous few books and stuck them together again to make this one. Perhaps we should all play &quot;Make Your Own Wheel of Time&quot; by doing the same thing. This would be a good cure for those whose memories of how bad the last book was fade over the twelve months between instalments.What happened to editing? The publishers should be ashamed of themselves for letting this drivel loose on the world. I suspect that they're using the series as a cash cow, and therefore aren't interested in seeing any progress. Well, the publishers should take note: I haven't bought any since No 6, and don't intend to until someone shows me the final one - maybe then there'll be some plot progression.

SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR GEORGE R.R. MARTIN'S OR TERRY GOODKIND'S NEW BOOKS."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm amazed at the number of negative reviews posted here. It is a measure of the intensity of the disappointment that people who have read the 9 previous books (would anyone read this as their first WOT book?) and really want to like this book are so annoyed with it.I too read this book with mounting annoyance, as I realised that Faile would not be rescued, or, in fact that virtually none of the issues outstanding at the beginning of the book would be settled, or even progressed much.On reflection, I think that Jordan has completely lost control of his work. There are just too many storylines going on for someone who now writes in such a laborious manner.There are at least 7 POV characters in this book - Mat, Perrin, Faile, Elayne, Rand, Egwene and the ones in the White Tower (I've probably missed one or two - I think there were some Seanchan POV characters as well).Now out of 680 pages, 94 get spent on a Prologue of at best tangential relevance to the rest of this book.This leaves him 600 pages for the main storylines, ie less than 100 per character. When you can spend 200 pages on setting up a meeting (Winters Heart) or spend 3 pages starting a meeting of Aes Sedai, you are not going to get a lot of plot progression.If all the characters were still together then he would have 600 pages to devote to one storyline, which might progress a bit.Another problem that he has created for himself is, that by giving most of his characters the ability to travel pretty much anywhere instantaneously, he's denied himself some of the mechanisms to put sub plots into the background for a while. For example, by having them spending time travelling (although with Jordan's current style he'd probably describe every rut on the road for all three months of marching!).My conclusion is that, unless he drastically prunes his sub plots and/or massively tightens his writing style that subsequent books are unlikely to accelerate the glacier like progress of this epic.I will definitely wait until the reviews to buy the next one, and I'm glad that I only paid a heavily discounted price from a bookshop's closing down sale."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If only I had bought it as an audio book, then I'd have the cure for sleeplessness.

I found it hard to keep track of all the minor incidental characters introduced at the beginning of the book and I was annoyed that the writer didn't get to any of the main characters until about 80 pages into the book. It is too long between books to remember the myriad of little characters that he spends so much time on. I lost track of the various generic Aes Sedai running around in the different cities. I feel like I need to reread the whole series each time a new book comes out just so I can remember who is who.What happened to all the great monsters he created in earlier books?

I don't have the excited anticipation of the next volume as I had after finishing all the previous volumes. It's more like \\"The next book better be really good to have made this one worth the reading.\\" The feeling is disappointment- disappointment that I had suffered through hours of anticipation, thinking maybe something exciting would resolve in the next chapter. That's the only thing that kept me from putting the book down half way though. All the book seemed to do was set up each individual story line in a new direction, in painful detail, but then nothing big came of any of them in this volume. Give me a crumb and I would have been at least partially satisfied and willing to wait in excited anticipation for the next book, but I wasn't even given a crumb. I expected something exciting to come of the cleansing of sadin but it was such an anti-climax that I was almost stunned. It was treated like it was almost meaningless to the characters & story- but when so much emphasis was put on the taint and how men who can channel go insane, and Rand's physical repulsion and struggle every time he touched the soruce because of it, and how the Ways were tainted by it, etc. how could the cleansing be treated as so unimportant? I still don't understand what happened!There are so many situations set up in this book without resolution that if the next book doesn't resolve them in an exciting way, I will probably be very angry. I find my sentiments strange in itself but I've just read every book 1 to 10 (for the second time, this time with no pause between books) for about a month now (that's 1 book read in about every 3 days.) Jordon has had me in his grips where I couldn't put a book down to get to sleep at a decent hour or take the appropriate time and effort to eat right, that I just can't believe he lost it with this book. I can't believe the author would keep his fans hanging so painfully unless he had a real whopper of a book 11. I believe that Robert Jordon has done too good a job in this series to fall flat now just when things are really building to such a critical mass. He may have needed this volume to begin changing the direction of the series and the characters so he could build the foundation for what's coming as he gets closer to the final battle. I just hate where he left off with a crisis at the end of each story-line and character, but maybe there's a reason why.I will hold judgement until I read the next volume.So I have to agree with the other reviewer who recommended that people should maybe wait to read book 10 until book 11 comes out and then read them one after another. To me, volume 10 seems like 1/2 a book- all the painful set-up to the excitement sure to come... Maybe book 11 will resolve what was built in book 10. I don't know, but I'm sure hoping that is the case....But I still can't help feeling like he should have had volume 11 written and published right after volume 10 to make up for what he put all his devoted fans through... to make it worth the suffering! :)"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I agree with some of the other reviews that it is indeed setting up the chess pieces and trying to put everything in the right place for what is to come, but I was hoping for more content than what came out of this segment of the story.

I have only started reading the Wheel of Time this year. Meaning that when this book got into my hands I had not been waiting for two years for it to be released. All I did was picked it off the shelf and started reading. So no high expectations. Heck from how bad the reviews are I had low expectations.The biggest complaint that I see about this book is that nothing happens. I would say that is very true. This didn't ruin my experience with the book because I knew that I was reading book 10 of 14. So while I do think RJ could have moved the story along better I was prepared for this. What I cannot answer is if I hadn't been prepared, if it would have made a difference.There was somethings I really liked about this one. First Mat's story is well told. How his arc raps up this time is well done. Then Egwene chapters are also very entertaining. Though I always seem to like her story.Rand is barely in this one is a big problem. Though since there is very little chapters of unimportant characters, that makes up for it.Though this may be a low point for the series I was prepared.

Read 1-6 and stop. 7-10 are painful, unenjoyable books.Personally, I tossed my collection and will not purchase him again."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If I hadn't gotten angry at the stereotyping and pure prejudice surrounding the relationships between men and women, I would have actually fallen asleep. It's rare these days to find such flat characters. Caricatures that mr Jordan actually believes or worse, that are the actual thing in the US. I finished the book on hope. Hope that something would happen. Alas.

As many others have already posted, I found myself skimming through pages of useless detail. You suffer whole chapters of the typical aes sedai tea parties. You know the ones that start out with people pulling their shawls and back biting everyone else, well get ready you suffer several of these.Jordan knows that his books are not anywhere near as good as they used to be, but he doesnt care. He and his publisher seemed to have come to the conclusion that charging you $... for 500 pages of fluff and 100 pages of actual plot, is great business.I told myself that this time, surely the pace and the plot will move forward. No dice people. I will not buy another. There are other writers out there who actually write a compelling story."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Save your money. Jordan is obviously milking this as much as he can. The plot line does not progress and everything is floating is useless wording and excessive descriptions. I cannot believe that his editor let him get away with half of the content. This book is not worth the heat it would throw off in your fireplace. You could go straight to book 11 without missing anything...although, I doubt that would be much better. Jordan should be ashamed."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Reading this book reminded me of a situation I got myself into once in Paso Robles, California. It had started out as a wonderful day and I was having a great time hiking the hills when suddenly it started to rain. I headed back to my truck but the last half-mile or so of the hike was across a plowed (and now soaked) field. About halfway across I realized I had made a mistake, my feet were so loaded up with the local gumbo mud that I could hardly lift my feet. Unfortunately I had already gotten too far into the field to go back and had to slog along one slow torturous step a time.After a two-year wait it is incredible how little movement occurs in the story with this book. The problem is I have gotten too far to turn back now. The quality of the first five books keeps me coming back, but it doesn't stop me from wanting to kick the butt of the person who introduced me to the Wheel of Time series... TEN YEARS AGO.My advice to first time readers of the Wheel of Time is to wait until the series is done. Since Jordan has not seen fit to let us know how many books will be in the series, at his present rate this torture could go on for another 8 or 10 years. I have to admit its one hell of a way to fund your retirement.With the current state of the world affairs we may well see our own Tarmon Gai'don before Rand gets to his. It's sad to say but after reading this book that may actually be a good thing."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I told myself after Winter's Heart I would stop reading thisseries.Why didn't I listen to myself!!!The first books in the series were sooo good, I keep thinking Robert Jordan will go back to the way he use to write.But now I know he's looking to drag this out to book 100. Some part of me is starting to think Robert Jordan is no longer writing these books,that maybe he sold it to some newbie writer off the street.I don't know, and I don't care anymore.Well, let my mistake be your good fortune. Save your money.If you are looking for a great fantasy book, type in a searchfor George R.R. Martin. His books could be called too good."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Arrrrrrrrggggggh. For the love of the light finish this story. I was actually enjoying the soap opera until now. This book could have been written in 300 pages or less and wouldn't have compromised the beauty of the tale. This however, has gone beyond the pale. I would almost think he has writer's block. My god there isn't any resolution to anything. Egwene is a coward. Rand is stupider than dirt (be connected to your leiutenants for chrissake). And as for Elayne... to quote the Wise Ones &quot;she will be very formidable when she realizes that she owns her pride and it does not own her.&quot; Crush your enemies.I can't believe it has taken nine books and six hundred plus pages for the Aes Sedai to realize they can't stand alone against Shai'Tan. Silly twits deserve the leash. Saddly the Asha'aman will probably spare them that fate only to be turned into little dogs.This was not the tale it was in the first six books. Fires of Heavan and Lord of Chaos were brilliant. But there is a distinct lack in the rest of the books. I'll read one more before I write my own ending to this tale and consider it done."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book read like the poetry my teachers made me read in high school: wonderfully written, but it never really went anywhere. It takes a good two thirds of the book to get chronologically past the end of &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; and even after that the plot barely moves. As another reviewer already said, you could simply read the last chapter and be up to date. There are no real shocking plot twists, and no real character development. I would reccomend checking this out from a library when they get it, or at the very least waiting until it comes out in paperback.

It is becoming obvious that Jordan has nothing left to right about, but is trying to squeeze a couple more volumes (and a couple million dollars) before the climax. I may come back for the climax but feel no need to read anything new in the series until then...DONT BUY IT"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I imagine Robert Jordan laughing his heart out on his way to the bank. Simply because we are all suckers to his wheel of time series! What kind of rip-off is this? You plow through 680 pages and none of the ongoing plots gets resolved? Book 11 should be given out free to all Book 10 buyers. Robert Jordan owes it to his fans. This book makes me question his love for the fantasy genre and his respect for his fans.

This book however, like the last two, is an extremely boring disappointment. There is no direction and it is obvious Jordan has lost control of the story. So many characters have simply disappeared that I have lost count; not to mention the fact that the prologue seems to be a prologue for book eleven more than book ten. The one redeeming part of the book was Mats story which of course was without any kind of character or plot arc, but at least he is entertaining. There are so many questions about who is where and what I am actually angry at this book. I am of course going to keep buying the books though. ..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is the literary equivalent of watching paint dry. It's obvious now that Jordan is being paid by the quantity of words and not the quality. He wrote 600+ pages that could have easily been reduced to 50. There were times when several pages would go by and no dialogue takes place. Instead, you have to wade through endless descriptions of how gray the sky was or what clothes someone was wearing. Then of course you're reintroduced to countless minor characters that you can't remember anything about because it's been 2 years since the last book. To top things off, the book covers only a couple of weeks in the lives of the characters and NOTHING HAPPENS!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"...this novel is a big waste of time. So we are all breathlessly waiting news on whether Rand succesfully cleansed saidin: we recieve instead endless descriptions of every minor characters amazement at the use of so much power. Is saidin cleansed? Eh, well, it's hard to know for sure. But we'll certainly tell you that Egwene, Cadsuane, Mat, the Ael, the farmers in Two Rivers, and a rat were really impressed with the effort expended.In the meantime, everyone goes about yanking on their braids in exasperation, as well as being surprised and embarrased at how they respond obediently to torture and humiliation. In addition, where did Nyneave go? Are we not interested in her anymore? Basically we end up where we started. No plot resolutions are resolved, no new information is given. It's like plowing through the Silmarillion in preperation for \\"the return of the king.\\" Not necessary, verbose, boring, full of factual data that is unnecesarry to advance the plot.I recommend waiting for the next book.

It seems like Jordan cannot exceed the pace of the series. If anything he slows down. At least the prior novels, while slow, had plot twists, ect. This book should have been double in length(yes i know it's long) so at least SOMETHING would happen. Where is the content????!!! I do not need battles every page, but why can't Jordan wrap up a thread or two? This series will never and I do mean never finish in two or three books without completely glossing over or dropping entire plot elements. At this point that wouldn't be so bad if we could just get a book dedicated to the main characters: Rand, Mat, Elayne, Aviendha, ect. There were enjoyable periods to Crossroads but mainly it felt like Jordan used a \\"large\\" font simply to create a long novel.

This reads almost like someone was doing a spoof on, &quot;Bad Robert Jordan &quot;,ala &quot;Bad Hemingway Contests&quot;.At one point I read pages of description what Egwene was viewing--and then discovered it had nothing at all to do with the plot.I got the feeling it was all filler for 70% of the book.Let me put it briefly--this was an enormous disappointment. I dont buy the &quot;setup&quot; theory anymore.After 10 books and over 7000 pages its time for some resolutions .If I have to wait another two years for MORE setup--count me,and thousands of other readers, out."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Books 1 through 7 take the reader on a fast a glorius journey through many lands, many battles and intertwined plots. All were extremely enjoyable reading. Books 8 and 9 slow the pace down, but they are still very worth while. Book 10 should never have been published, it has no plot and no pace. Hopefully Jordan will take an opportunity to read these reviews and re-energize Book 11. If not, I am thru reading them. There are too many other good fantasy writers out there to waste time on reading a boring book like this!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The Wheel of Time series started with such promise but has become hopelessly mired in political manuvering, sort of like the United Nations.The removal of one of the greatest stumbling blocks to our heroes, the taint on Saidin (the male half of magic) has caused a complete stop in the progress of the story.It appears that Robert Jordan relied so heavily on the problems assosiated with men using The One Power that removal of that obstacle has left the plot in the luch. Sort of like having the worlds most powerful military force but being to afraid to use it for fear of the political backlash.The good guys have the weapon they need, time to let them use it!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If you have read some of the other reviews you already know that nothing happens in this book, though minor and irrelevant detail is discussed in great lengths. Here are some additional complaints I hope the author will read and think about: (1) almost from the beginning, characters have been doing irrational things for no reason other than the &iexcl;weave of the wheel&iexcl; or the &iexcl;pull of ta&iexcl;avern.&iexcl; Cut it out. It is very annoying to read a book where characters just do things for no reason. (2) There are six distinct ways to quickly or instantly travel distances of hundreds of miles, yet the characters tend to stay out of touch with each other and to act purely on hearsay and rumors rather than direct contact. They all have the means to travel instantly and they are all friends: Why do they not communicate? (3) The characters are mostly unintelligent and care more about benign and petty issues that are of no consequence to them or to the story. I have read the entire series and I am as captive as most Jordan readers. I do wish, however, that I had never started reading his books. He gets exceedingly worse and wastes our time and money with these sequels. Knowing that we are captive, he has no incentive to use his imagination or intelligence in writing sequels. Shame on you Robert Jordan!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm not going to regurgitate what nearly all the reviewers say. Well, yes, I am! Plodding, uneventful, agonizingling boring attention to detail, and very little in the way of plot advancement. It was interesting that the most significant cliffhanger of the previous book wasn't resolved until well into COT, and then treated as an unimportant detail! Yet Jordan spends THOUSANDS OF WORDS discussing what each woman is wearing, each minor character's stray and petty thoughts and motivations, and other similar irrelevant items in excrutiating detail. You're nearly halfway through the book before you get your first mention of Rand. In fact, he only gets to the main characters two or three times in this entire book, there's so freakin' many of them. I was also trying to account for the dozens (feels like nearly a hundred) of plot lines, and I couldn't. There are so many left dangling from previous books that weren't even addressed in COT that it's impossible to account for all of them. I'll bet this book could have easily been edited to a fourth it's size, and nothing important would have been left out. Jordan must get paid by the word. Now, having said all that, if you read all the preceding books in the series, like I have, you MUST get this book if for no other reason than you can't afford to stop now. Robert Jordan probably couldn't care less what I think, but he should be ashamed of himself for wasting so many people's time. All I can say is the final book(s) had better be worth the wait. If they aren't, I don't know what I'll do, but surely karma will get him! Maybe all the plot lines he fails to resolve will strangle his creative ablilty to write any more books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The reason I became hooked on this series was because of the great characters (Rand, Mat, and Perrin) the complex plot twists, great writing, and the epic battles against evil. All, save great writing, have been absent from this book. I am tired of hearing about Aes Sedai and their petty differences. Get on to the siege of Tar Valon. There was no need to get so in depth and detailed with this aspect of the story. I, along with most readers would rather hear about how Rand is after his cleansing of Saidin, how Mat is doing, or Perrin's trek to rescue his wife. You can only take so much of Aes Sedai whining."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What started out as the most amazing story I have ever read has turned into so much drivel. After nearly 300 pages the characters, if you can call them that now, from this book have finally caught up to events from the LAST book. Which, of course, means that by the end of this book the story will have advanced an extremely minute amount. Enough with the going around is circles from one meaningless event to the next, get on with it. I don't particularly care how many books you write in the series as long as they have a purpose. This one, along with the last one, have been utterly stagnant in plot advancement."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I loved this series but the last few and certainly this one were terrible. SO LONG.. and nothing happens... I found myself dreading reading it but I so wanted things to get moving.. then it ended and I was compelled to write this review. If you have not bought this one.. don't bother"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan seems to be trying to appeal to many different types of readers. He started off getting the fantasy adventure group excited in what I thought were a handful of the best books I have ever read. Now it seems like he is trying to appeal to those interested in political intrigue.In my opinion, as well as it seems many other readers' opinions, he went down hill. This book was painful to get through. I kept reading thinking that it would get better, that there would be at least 20 pages at the end that kicked butt like the last one, but there was not even that. It is probably one of the worst books I have ever read (and it was so long ;-( ).As so many other readers have already said, there is absolutely no action. He also opens more subplots vs. closing some off. His attempt to spread the spotlight to other characters just diffuses evrything even more. Combine all of that with wasted time and effort on ridiculous details and it becomes a book that I bet I could have skipped and still not been very lost in the story.On the bright side, Jordan has set so many readers' expectations so low that a little bit of effort will make the next book seem amazing by comparison. Unfortunately, if Jordan is true to form, the next book will be out two presidential elections from now.*I really did try to like it*"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The other reviews are largely on target. The nearly 100-page prologue sums up the book and most of the recent series to date: let me introduce some new characters, give you lots more detail about them than you would ever care to know, and then let you figure out if they'll ever figure into the story. The first 500 pages of the book go nowhere. Chronologically they take place during Winter's Heart. Jordan apparently felt that he hadn't gone over those few days in agonizing enough detail in WH so had to catch everyone up on the latest fashion, cuisine, culture, etc. The last 200 pages are decent, but could have been done (with the rest of the book) in a 50 page prologue to a real story. It's interesting that even most of those (few) who rated this more than one star didn't have anything good to say about it. To 'Get Over It': Rand IS the main character. The series started with him and its main plot (hard to keep track of with the scores of them) is that he must confront the Dark One at the end.Jordan needs an editor who will come in and say, &quot;RJ no more talks about skirts, and faces, and reactions. Quit repeating yourself, such as mentioning an Illian accent every time someone says, 'I do be tired of hearing about this. No more than one paragraph between lines of dialogue. No more new characters. No more new subplots. No more fashion, architecture, culture, or similar references. Focus on the story. Reread 'The Eye of the World' and use its style.

I used to hope that the series would go on for 20 books, but instead it died after 6. The WoT and book 10 have devolved into mediocrity.

Like many, I was completely enthralled by the early books of this series, however the author and publisher seem to be more interested in prolonging the series (and I assume their cash flow) than completing a great work of art. COT, like its immediate predecessors, is a maddening jumble of fragmented plot lines that fail to move the master story ahead in any significant manner. Tor, like the author, has forgotten what made the earlier works in the series great- that each book was a self contained story that had a beginning, middle, and end; but somehow still supported the over riding plot line.At this point, the story may be unsalvagable as is the support of many fans."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Correct me if I am wrong, but at one time this story had a plot, right? In fact, I do recall that plot being rather interesting for about 5, maybe 6 books. However, where has it gone? Can anyone find Robert Jordan's lost plot? It doesn't take a good author an entire 680 page book to setup for the next book, especially when there are 9 previous 600-1,000 page books in the series. Besides, wasn't book 9 also called a setup by some? Hello, are we still paying attention here? If you think that this is just a good setup, why not just establish direct deposit into Robert Joradn's bank account. Really, it'd save you the trip to the bookstore, and it would accomplish just as much plot wise. Then you'd have those extra hours to clean lint from your toenails, or something equally more useful than reading this book. Robert Jordan started the series as an excellent author, captivating the audience. Therefore, either he's sleep writing, or having the novels ghost written. The story has become lost in detail. Jordan now expects his readers to trudge through every trivial event (which for some reason has a great deal to do with people bossing each other around) that goes on in this no longer fascinating world he created. I sped read the first 100 pages at the bookstore, and nothing, I mean NOTHING happened. The story hasn't even caught up to where the other one ended. There is ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE for such shoddy, lackluster authorship. It would be like Monet drawing a stick figure. We all know he is capable of much, much better. In an interview Jordan states that he can't put as much of the story into the book as he wants. Maybe that is because he is not putting ANY of the story into the books anymore. Is he writing fantasy/action, or the study of pathetically childish characters who can't deal with things like adults? Once again, if you're looking for teeny-bopper style foolish drama, here's the book for you. If not, please save your money and sanity."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Oh, how the mighty have fallen. What started out as one of the most promising fantasy series EVER has become...this. Robert Jordan and TOR, since you seem to want to milk as much money as possible from this, some advice: I hope that you know that the longer this series becomes, the harder it will be to sell the rights to the miniseries (you can forget about movies, no studio in their right mind would pay for the film rights of a 20 volume series).How is it possible to write almost 700 pages and have nothing happen? I don't get it. Do I really need five or six pages describing the thoughts of Alviaran as she walks from the basement of the Tower to Elaida's rooms? Especially since they are thoughts that we pretty much already knew she would be thinking. They added nothing to her character. Nynaeve and Lan (who I figure most people would consider main characters) are barely mentioned. They don't even speak. I guess that could be better understood with so many characters, but therein lies a major problem with the series. Too many characters. At least too many who RJ seems to want to be essential. It leaves readers confused. The only character who grows any is this book is Tuon, and she only marginally. You can completely skip this book and not really have missed anything dealing with Perrin, Faile, Elayne or Avhiendha. And you really ought to throw Rand in that list as well.There are some questions that arise with the book. What's going to happen to Egwene? Who is Rand going to meet with (since it doesn't seem like it can possibly be who is mentioned)? Of course, it doesn't mean that they will be answered any time soon. We still don't know who killed Asmodean.Book 10 and the series seems to be barely halfay through."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The WOT opens with a 9 foot Trolloc busting down Rand's door! Jordan wove Rand's narrow escape and ever greater danger and discovery of immense powers with enjoyable fun characters who kicked each other in the ..., argued constantly, but in the end supported each other amidst grave danger.In disappointing contrast, this book is 90% soap opera, describing clothing, hair ornaments, titles and relative standings in greater depth than Entertainment Tonights coverage of the Academy Awards!To quote Lan (barely mentioned) 'You're a long ways from Eomond's Field' Mr Jordan. Maybe you held Saidar too long and have lost the source. Or have one of the Forsaken bewitched our beloved writer? Notice how they are getting brought back, and no more head to heads with Rand? Maybe you need to watch WWE and have another Royal Rumble between Rand and one of the Forsaken (you'll bring them back anyways, so why not kill one or two off?)Bring back more real plot tension about the Forsaken, get Eqwene and the Aes Sedai on with it, and come out with a coloring book where interested readers can put the right outfit and hairstyles on the multitudes of superflous characters that absorb the True Source.Have you been Stilled? Call Nyneave to fix your writers block, please!No more comparisons to Tolkein please. Jordan is nowhere close unless you are referring to JRRs \\"Unfinished Tales\\" that are sort of anthologies of background stories to add flavor to the main event.

For those few (and very few I might add) reviews that praised the slow, plodding movement of the story as something worthy of good fantasy and imagination, let me point out a few things....even when he was writing well, the character interaction and plot development were wonderful, but placed on a cardboard cutout backdrop. Every city 95% consists of palaces and inns....and even the inns are fairly generic. Now that there is very little plot development and very predictable character interaction, the books drag uselessly on. Stories are not only supposed to be imaginative, innovative, etc., but they should also entertain the reader. I could write a 600 page book about the woes of my commute to work today, but why would anyone want to read it.....no matter how well I wrote the thing. No....either, this is just a poor excuse to make money, or... Jordan is so into the personal exploration of his story, that the interest his earlier efforts generated have fallen low on his priority scale. I could say the same about Lucas....and like Star Wars, I will likely pony up the cash to see the next installment, despite my great disappointment and lack of optimism of the story's redemption."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"With artistic skill, Robert Jordan makes Ethan Frohme look like a superhero. I was so inflicted with boredom from reading this book that I can now only see in shades of grey. Let's distribute this book to the military and bore every nation into submission and then issue future installments to keep everyone in line.RJ should really reconsider his profession; he has lost his passion for writing lively, interesting, purposeful literature and instead opts for complacency and mindless minutiae. His superhuman attention to detail would make him a kick-...quality control employee counting gravel, which is what I wished I was doing after 100 pages.Professionally, this book was nothing short of a noose for RJ. Nobody wants to pick up a series around book ten, and anybody picking up book one in a protracted fantasy epic will certainly read a few reviews...why begin reading over 6,000 pages when it's clear the author goes Walden around page 4,800?I hope that RJ will impart sympathy to his fans and grant them the one thing that they need more than anything: Book eleven and the words \\"The End.\\""},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan needs to get off the Pot and do something with these characters. We all waited for 2 years for a Book that could have been written in 2-3 Months. Nothing really happened Plot-wise. But it took over 500 pages simply to get back to Rand.Proving my point of running off at the word Processor. If he had bothered to actually advance one or two of his plotlines substantially it would have been acceptable. But every character that could channnel had nothing to say but \\"Holy ....\\" from all the power being channeled in the last book. Making no real headway whatsoever in any of the story lines.Jordan needs to stop his plotlines from wandering all over the place and consolidate some of them in the next book. Otherwise it will be another case of Plot Constipation. Because there wont be room for anything to advance at all. Since at least half the main characters can Travel it shouldn't take more than 5-10 pages per plotline to begin to bring things together. But jordan will probably spend 50-100 pages doing the samething while describing what each character had for breakfast.If we are lucky Book 11 will actually start to bring some of this mess to a close. So Book 12 will FINALLY be able to move the story along."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I started reading the Wheel of Time series before book 9 came out and finished the 8th just as the 9th was released. Subsequently between 9 and 10 was my first wait between books. My first aniticipation.I have always worked hard to defend Robert Jordan's books, especially 7-9 because, despite the drop in pace, I still very much enjoyed those books.After reading book 10 however I wish I hadn't bothered defending this series. It was literally &quot;work&quot; to complete this book. I had to think to myself &quot;I better not go out, I should sit down and get some of book 10 finished.&quot;I think a great number of us fantasy readers have been spoiled by the Song of Ice and Fire series by Martin. In those books the pace is fast and almost every chapter contains significant advancement to the plot, or at least has some stellar microplotting. At first I thought this was the equivalent to liking action movies more than award winning dramas. But now I don't think it's such a bad thing. If this is the future of fantasy then I'm afraid Robert Jordan needs to either pick up the pace or be left in the past.Some specific points of the book that I disliked were the time setting and lack of a climax.Anyone who read the 9th book was, like me, salivating at the thought of finding out how the events in the final chapter of book 9 will reshape the entire world. However this result isn't meantioned outright for about 530 pages, which constitutes about 80% of the book. Going back to Martin's works, when something in the world of Westeros happens, the next chapter has someone's reaction. Apperantly Jordan takes 2 books to give us what we want, assuming we will actually get those reactions in 11.The book has no climax at all. It just ends. Even the little thing that could almost be called a climax could have been drawn out in an action packed exciting way. But it just builds and builds then has a paragraph at the end of something happening then it's over. Jordan can draw out shirt washing for pages but squeezes the only action into a paragraph?I know Jordan has said many times he knows exactly what will happen for the rest of the books but I hope he pays attention to what his fans are saying. This is more than just the griping that was seen after books 7, 8 and 9. This is serious, almost unanimous concern over the integrity of a series we have all put a lot of time into."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"With \\"Crossroads of Twilight,\\" Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series becomes only the second fantasy series I've ever given up on. I've been strongly considering it since \\"The Path of Daggers,\\" and now my patience is finally at an end. The series' forward progress has slowed over the past few books until now it's almost at a standstill. What is resolved here?.I have defended the series in the past against detractors who said that Jordan is happily drawing this out with a sadistic cackle and dollar signs in his eyes, but this is too much. The first few books were great, so if you want to experience the Wheel of Time, read up through \\"Lord of Chaos.\\" Only imagine that the Dark One himself showed up at Dumai's Wells, Tarmon Gai'Don was won, and the world continued happily into the next Age.of adult characters who behave like spoiled children almost as much as I do of the never-ending plotlines. Farewell,"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"To WoT fans who have been there since the beginning: Remember when there would actually be a conflict that was resolved by the end of the book? Remember the action? The pitched one-on-one battles with the forsaken? Now granted, Jordan couldn't continue picking off forsaken at the rate of one per book or he wouldn't have much of a force for Rand to reckon with at the last battle, but he has slowed the series down to such a glacial crawl that, over the years, I can hardly remember important major points from the earlier books. And the series is now so lengthy that re-reading to catch up is no longer an option.Either Robert Jordan has become so ennamored of his own endless babbling that he doesn't ever intend to finish this series (or doesn't know how to), or his editor suffered a fatal heart attack and hasn't yet been replaced. There hasen't been enough plot advancement in the last 3 books together to equal one of his earlier works. For an example, there is a scene in CoT where the rebel hall is convening and Jordan spends at least 4 pages describing what everyones hair looks like and what color petticoats they are wearing and where they want to sit and why. Who cares?!!! I could summarize that whole 4-page sequence in one sentence \\"The sisters trickled slowely into the hall and once all were accounted for, the meeting began.\\" Where is this guy's editor?! Sleeping? Dead? The whole book is that way. Not only does it not advance the plot, it doesn't even advance the timeline, choosing instead to tell us in excrutiating detail what everyone in the world smelled like when Rand and Co. cleansed Saidin. You don't even get a hint of whether or not he was successful until 400-something pages into the book, and then only ONE SENTENCE.I will no longer fork out any $ for new books in the series without checking them out from the library first. For old Wheel of Timers: you could probably skip this one and not only would you not miss anything important, but you would save yourself a blood pressure crisis when you realized, about 300 pages into the book, that you had been robbed not only of your money, but of the last three years waiting to find out what happens next. To new readers: Do Not start reading this series until Robert Jordan has proven he can finish writing it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Absolutely nothing happens in the first 500 pages.

The last third of the book still doesn't have much going on, but at least some events occur."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Yes, like that reviewer under me posted:There were some memorable scenes in the early books. I mean, Jordan's weaknesses (Characters, Theme) where even then clearly there, but the strength's (mainly good paced Plot, Drama etc.)overshadowed them.The Guy who went mad because of the blade from Shadar Logoth was Padan Fain...and you know what i totally despised in Winter's Heart? When Shadar Logoth was destroyed...because it was an interesting concept: An evil City, that was in it's own way as powerful and sinister as the Dark One.And City and The Dark One were in a state of War. Hence, the crucifixion of the Myrdraal and Fains Charisma as someone utterly evil, who was also something entirely OTHER. And what happend in Book Number Nine? Didn't Fain fight with Lan and Rand? I remember Fain was quite easily overcome. Aaargh.Problem with Wheel of Time is that the Heroes are too powerful. I mean, Rand, Mat and Perrin never loose a Battle. Granted, Tolkien had the same problem, Sauren was a loosah who lost against a bunch of dwarfs with hairy feet, but come on! We're talking about dramatics here, Mr. Jordan. You have to make the Evil Side far stronger than the Good Ones.Now is just babble this babble that...women, who are not thinking and acting like women ( I mean,honestly, do you know women who are like Egwene or Nynaeve? I hope not!). It's just plain boring, and it's boring because TOR wants to cash in and Jordan doesn't have the guts to end this series and start a New One.Well, penny for your thoughts..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"OK, so i know the golden rule is not to judge a book until you've read the final word - but with Crossroads it is very difficult to get there. After reading another chapter filled with discriptions of every miner character and what they are wearing (and if they are women, how they straighten dresses that don't need straightening), in which all Elayne managed to do was walk across the camp and think about stuff (note: not actually do anything, just think about it), this is becoming an increasingly boring read. I'm sticking with it though because Jordan has already proved that he can write a brilliant story, and this is not yet the end - perhaps even these past few very slow novels are part of his grand plan for the whole series, and we'll all feel like idiots for critising once the series is finished.Still 3 stars though for the characters that we all love (although we loved them more when they actually did stuff), and for the hope that the series will pick up again and finish in the same glory that it began."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am proud to say that I did not get suckered into buying this book. I have gotten suckered into buying all of the rest of the series, but with the last couple of books I could see that Jordan really no longer cares about making a good story, but rather milking this financial situation for all it is worth. I won't be party to that, though he is smart enough to know that many of you will be."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"While shopping online today I saw that the anxiously awaited 11th book in the Wheel of Time is finally arriving November 28th of this year. Reading this, I found myself traveling back in time to when I was a lowly 14 year old Freshman in high school.One day I was forced to go grocery shopping with my mother at the local Piggly Wiggly (I know...), and being 14 I was much to cool to accompany her while she selected the family fare for the week. I found myself at the store's book rack, and being in that Wizards and Warriors, D & D stage of my young life, immediately noticed a book whose cover bore a man with a sword accompanied by a lady with a staff, both of which were followed by a train of people on horse back. I talked my mother into buying me \\"The Eye of the World\\" by Robert Jordan that evening, and have religiously read and awaited each offering by Jordan ever since that fateful and random encounter in Northern Wisconsin.I, like the other reviewers of this book, find the myriad plot lines that have developed, beginning in book 4, annoying in some ways. Frankly, all the story lines involving Elayne, Egwene, Aviendha, and especially Nynave (sp?)or any Aes Sedai for that matter, completely annoying. Matt is by far the most successful character, followed by Rand, and the only saving grace to Perrin is Elyas, that crafty, ex-warder, tracker, and wolf brother that no one really knows anything about even now with the forthcoming release of book 11.Compounding the snail pace at which this latest book moves (along with the last 3) is the fact that Jordan refuses to even allow a small bit of progress towards that Last Battle by continually ressurecting fallen members of the Forsaken with new names and new bodies. We, his collective readers, I feel are tired of rehashing the same cloak and dagger, strike from the shadows, web of intrigue, etc. plot lines that seemingly all of these characters try, only to be destroyed by Rand or others in the last 30 pages of each book. I remember a time that I cared and anguished over who Aran'gor, Moradin, and Osan'gor (Sorry for the spelling again, I'm not looking it up)were originally...now I just don't care anymore about their characters. Let them die and give us a little hope that we may see the end of this series before we turn 70.That said, I am now 30 years old, 16 years removed from that day at Piggly Wiggly and book 1, and even with all the braid tugging, the insufferably long winded descriptions of lace embroidered jackets and dresses, the 30 plus meandering plot lines that continually go nowhere, and the fact that every female character in these books reminds me everytime that I read the latest installment why I choose to remain unmarried; I still have to admit that I will buy, devour, and recommend to anyone who will listen, the Wheel of Time series.It has been a part of my life since I was a young sprout and full of imagination, and I still find myself going to bookstores and inquiring every year or so when Jordan's next one is slated for release. Besides, giving up at this stage without knowing the fate of all the characters that I grew to love, hate, and wonder about, would be like abandoning your children at a New Jersey truck stop, and no one in their right mind would do that."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"\\"Crossroads of Twilight\\" is pretty widely agreed to be the worst book of the Wheel of Time series.

True, they have been diminishing in quality and readability over the past few years, but this one just takes the cake. Seriously, RJ must have bored himself to death writing this. You know what happens in this book? NOTHING. Seriously... NOTHING. A half page is spent describing WASHING A SHIRT. One character comes up to Perrin and says \\"walk with me [so I can speak to you privately]\\". Not another word is said because the next 4 pages are spent describing what in a movie would be \\"extras\\" making up the people in the camp, what each one was cooking for dinner, and whether each should spend time mending his socks. And the repetition! Oh GOD! Save Me! We Get It! Egwene is not respected as Amyryllin! Matt has trepidations about marriage, and he hears dice rolling in his head (OVER and OVER and OVER). And every single woman is tough and wants to be in control while every man is confused and clueless. We Freakin' Get It!On a positive note, Nynaeve did not tug her braid once. That's cuz she wasn't in this episode.Please Mr. J, continue the STORY! Don't turn into an old man who just likes to hear himself talk. Or are you just trying to cash in on dragging the story out? I think if that is true, it will backfire, because people are really starting to lose interest. How about this, FINISH this story then start on a prequel about the origin of the Forsaken.This whole book could have been condensed to Chapter 1 of a book. In all honesty, so little happens that when the next book comes out, if you haven't read this one, you won't have missed anything and you will be able to pick up without missing a beat."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I think the other reviews say it all. This books is a break from Jordans normal writing style. In most of the previous WOT books Jordan would touch on all of his plot lines but concentrate on advancing two story lines. In this book he trys to spend too much time on everything and you end up going nowhere. Not only does he not close off any story lines, but he opens up several new ones. The end result is you only get half a book here. There are alot of interesting things that happen, but I suggest waiting for the next book and then buying both at once. In fact if Jordan wants to salvage most of his readers after this debacle he will need to release a followup book to this in a hurry. If we have to wait another two years or more I can see alot of fans not comming back."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This series started out as one of the best of all time, and now it's sunk to this. 690 pages of garbage.

How did one of my favorite series deteriorate into a play by play account of ordinary, mundane activities? Nothing was accomplished in this book, that is, nothing that couldn't have been covered in three or four chapters, leaving the extra 500 pages for a real book. The painfully slow pacing of this installment has me seriously considering whether I should even bother picking up the next one, and I am truly disturbed by the prospect of seeing this cherished series continue to degrade. It would be better to leave it unfinished then continue on in this manner.I'm sure it's obvious, but I advise you not to purchase this book. Get an unlucky friend to summarize it for you. Or go to one of the many fan sites on the web and read a summary of this book, but do it quickly, because this book has the potential to drive off all but the most fanatical &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; fans."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is by far the worst book of the entire series. I consider myself to be a true Jordan fan, having started my reading back in 1990 and continued faithfully ever since. First eagerly awaiting the next book every year, then every other year, now it is just a little longer still.Unfortunately, the longer the wait between books has become, the less the pages written actually progress the story. This book is the worst example of story management I have ever read. The entire first 580 pages are simply used to give an update of where the characters have been since the end of the last book. Jordan has too many stories going at once to write an interesting story about each character to the detail he has chosen and still fit that story into a book he can write in less than 2 years. There are no exiting events that actually take place, just hints that there could be some in the next book. That is, if you are willing to wait another 3 years to find out what happens.It seems to me that Jordan can't figure out how to get from point A to point B. It is either that or GREED has overcome him and he now feels that because his fans have been so eager to praise his work that he can write whatever he wants about even the most boring and mundane details and people will keep reading. Maybe that is so, but I am about at the end of my rope. Ten books into the series and the majority of this book is still set-up. Wasn't that done before in the last book? He should be providing more answers about the story and foreshadowing in these books than adding to the questions that are outstanding. At least in the last few books some things have actually been resolved. This book resolves nothing!! Unless of course we consider Mat going shopping to be a major EVENT in the story.Wait for the paperback, or enen better wait for the next book to come out. This book won't satisfy your desire for good reading, it will just frustrate you to the extreme. By this time you should be accustomed to waiting, why spoil that. If you read this book and the next at the same time, you may actually feel as if you have read one whole book.However, that assumes that Jordan can figure out where to take the story from here and the next book is not just as useless.For potential Jordan readers, don't start yet. Jordan is starting to show signs that he can't finish what he started. The first books were great, however it is heading down hill and there is no sign that he can recover."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I own all of the WoT, the last several in hardback. I've read all of them twice or more. I've had CoT on pre-order with Amazon for about a year. Suffice it to say that I'm a fan of the series. However, after reading this one, I'm thinking about just quitting. How an author could do so little in 680 pages absolutely boggles the mind. Glacial would be a compliment. I mean, this is ridiculous.I have no problem with Jordan spending a fair amount of time setting the stage for big events to come. However, he could have easily compressed everything in this book into a prologue or 2-3 chapters. Why bother reading it?I really thought RJ was going somewhere with this series. I thought it might end in 12-13 books, as he's been claiming for awhile. ... Give me a break."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Okay, so I have been waiting patiently for two years for this book. I admit I am addicted to this series, but if the series continues as it does, I am going to quit cold turkey. I think this last book has been the worst one yet.In September I started reading from the first book. It was a joy to read the first four books. This last one was a decided chore. I have a sneeky suspicion that the word count is dropping with each book. It only took me two days to read this one, and it is not exactly a page turner. More happened in the prologues to previous books in the series.In many ways it seems like this is only half a book. The characters are introduced, put in context of what happened at the end of Winters Heart, they re-hash thoughts already beaten to death in previous books, then just as they begin to develop the story, it ends. I think you could have safely tacked on another 500 page to this book and actually told a story. The 680 pages in this book could have easily been chopped down by a good editor to under 300 pages.The main problems with the 680 pages I did read? The discriptions are getting so long winded and unnecessary. I don't care what someone is wearing anymore, especially a two page discription. How many more minor characters are to be introduced? I only care about the main ones and only if they are doing something. The 100 or so pages devoted to Egwene are the least readable, because she does absolutely nothing. A little bit of action or conflict would have been nice. I would have settled for someone skinning their knee by the end of the book; at least someone important to the story.So what did I like? It is still Jordans universe, even if nothing happens. The relationships between characters are entertaining. Thats about it.My recommendation? If you have read the first nine books, you will buy this one too. Just don't expect too much. It is starting to become a soap opera disguised as a fantasy novel.Final note for Mr Jordan. Think of all the classic fantasy novels that have lasted. Would you want Wheel of Time to be considered a classic. If so you need to write the story and not think about the ... per unit sales."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is definately the worst of the series so far. I agree that you could easily skip this book altogether. This book frustrated me to no end in that all storylines carried over from the last book were left unresolved and the only progression is that we now understand the different characters intentions. It is not enough to simply learn a few details while you read 600 some odd pages of dialogue and observations while the plot of the characters I have grown to love did not advance at all. At all! I just cant understand how Robert Jordan could let this go to publish. I have to remind myself when reading this that this is the same guy who wrote Eye of the World, Great Hunt, and Dragon Reborn which in my opinion standing by themselves comprises one of the greatest fantasy epics ever written.

I find myself going to the glossary trying to remember them, only to find an obscure geographical name that no one cares about.

I've also read all previous WoT books, and this one tops them all for the tediousness of its reading and the complete lack of action or plot development.This book reads like the product of a novelist completely out of ideas or any idea of how to advance the plot. The first 5 books in the series had action, character twists, and sociological descriptions that left me on the edge of my seat wanting to read faster and faster. This latest \\"installment\\" is purely an insult to its readers: there are no meaningful character developments, virtually no plot whatsoever, and no new sociological descriptions. Remember how wonderful it was to read of the Two Rivers, Tar Valon, Aiel, or Sanchean societies? Nothing like that in this book.Here's the \\"plot,\\" and all you need to know: Mat is still yellow-bellied, stuck with yet another stupid woman no man would want to be near. Aes Sedai in his company sense a tremendous use of the power far off. Everybody say \\"oooh.\\" Perrin then looks for Fayle, and finds her in the company of Lots Of Aiel. She doesn't do anything.

I guess he too has had enough of Jordan's incessant rambling, purposeless detail, and has left us for greener pastures.What tripe. Hard to believe that Tor's publishers let this dog off or Jordan's PC. Quick, get a stick and kill it.Whatever you do, don't buy this. Check it out from your library. Better yet, stand in the aisle in your library, read the last page of every chapter, and consider yourself blessed that you didn't give time to it. Hold off reading the remaining books until after the series of finished, if Jordan ever finishes it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"An avid Wheel of Time reader, I eagerly snap up each new volume. Those like me can save their time and money. If you feel you simply must read this book, check it out of the library and avoid buyer's remorse. Better plan: Assuming the WOT will eventually roll to a conclusion wait for the final book. If future volumes have the same impact as recent volumes we will be easily able to pick up the final book not having missed a thing. I am beyond frustrated with this author and can no longer recommend the series. Yes there is often a less than stellar book in the midst of a great series, but COT gives us the third? fourth? plodding volume. I will reread the early volumes again, as I have before, and savor every word. But I'm done holding my breath in anticipation of the next installment and will not be suckered into spending my money on another book. I deeply resent Jordan having 'done' this to his so faithful readers."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've been a WoT fan for a while, and foolishly ignored allthe negative reviews I had seen about CoT. Now that I'veread the book, I must strongly agree with every negativereview about it here, while seriously questioning the rosecolored glasses if not straight sanity of anyone who'd goabove one star. It's insulting to have this released. Ofall the books I've read, including grade school literatureclasses, and quite possibly textbooks, I have never, ever,EVER seen something so boring, that served no purpose moreeffectively. Some may say he's setting up future happenings,and there is intrigue and detail. Detail yes, intrigue no.You're going to read about how thick the mud is. For 2paragrapghs.

You geto to know how warm orcold the mud, cloth, or food is. Doing your TAXES is moreentertaining than this!Usually I'm not too critical, and fairly easy to please, andquite forgiving.

It basicly was nothing more then a very long prolouge. How the hell did Robert Jordan's editors let him pass this off as an installment to the series. Well I'll defiantly be leary before shelling out $[amount] on the next one to come out. I cannot express how disaponting this book was. 30 odd chapters of women drinking tea and having conversations. I want my money back!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Oh goodness. Where to start? Like everyone else with some semblance of taste, I am disgusted by Jordan's latest effort. Check the increasingly-bitter reviews people seem to post as each new book is turned out. Only masochists can continue to read. It's as though RJ wrote this book as an in-your-face to the people who have complained that the previous three had too little plot development. Think those were bad? His loudest defenders can only insist that it will be in 'the next book' that great things will happen. 'Ha,' says Jordan. 'Nothing will happen in the next book too.'I have never before this book skimmed prose. I had to. Page upon page of reflection in which characters reveal much the same things they felt six books ago. I'm not sure, but I'll bet he snuck a few pages in there from Shadow Rising. Men don't understand women. Women don't understand men. Will the hilarity never cease? 'Never,' sayeth RJ.Save yourself the money. Refuse to give this as a gift. It will only end your friendship with the recipient. I disowned my own father after presenting this to me. This series is like a bear trap. There are just too few of us willing to gnaw our own legs off. Light, please give me the strength."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Let me start off by saying that I have thoroughly enjoyed every book in this series up until now. I am not one of the band wagon Jordan haters and people who have been bitter for over half a decade now regarding this series... But, having said that, you can see where I'm going obviously. This book was simply terrible... Oh, don't get me wrong, it was well written, had the usual attention to detail and amazing character depth we all are familiar with. The problem was simply... nothing happened. Nothing at all. Despite wide criticism, the previous books in the series all had at least one major event, a notable climax even if not much else.Crossroads of Twilight consists of these(and don't worry aobut spoilers, nothing to spoil)... Mat kills one sul'dam and goes slightly(a few days!) further away from Ebou Dar. Perrin goes a few days closer to the Shaido. Rand... sits there. Cadsuane... sits there. Faile... sits there. Egwene... whines a bit and sits there. I can't even remember if Elayne and Aviendha are even in the book or not and I just finished it about 10 minutes ago if that tells you anything about them. The only decent chapter in the whole book that even takes a single step forward(not including the half assed ending which I'll cover in a second) is the short section on events covering Elaida and the White Tower.Now... As for the ending... Well, near the end of the book I started counting pages left. I kept telling myself, something will happen. Something has to happen. ... It didn't. What was presnted instead was trash. Utter trash. It would have been decent at the beginning of the book and presented as the main storyline perhaps, but as it was... ugh.The book amounts to what should have been quite literally a few paragraphs of recaps for each character if that, with the one White Tower chapter worthy of actually being called a chapter. It is one step of short of being \\"*insert character name here* walks here. Then they walk over there. Then they walk back. They walk around again. Walking, walking. Stop to say something about foods they like! (Seriously, there is more ranting about various foods than anything else.) Walk around a bit more. Sleep. Oh look theyre snoring. Snoring... still snoring! The End.\\"On top of everything else, Jordan basically ignored the events of the last book. In book nine, the male half of the source was finally cleansed... The inner flap of the jacket has more about the aftermath of that than the book itself does! And I am being 100% literal in that statement, it is just flat out disgusting that it is not brought up except for one or two lines over the course of the near 700 pages! And minute references to a single Asha'man smiling(in one of the Perrin chapters) doesn't count in the least as suitable acknowledgement. So basically, Jordan not only offers nothing in this book at all, he actually takes away from what happened in the previous installment!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I love the WOT. The many characters, plotlines, cultures, settings, and general sense of history that run through this series are, in my opinion, second to none. I have spent many happy hours reading the books and avidly look forward to each new release.And then came Crossroads at Twilight.While I fully understand that this is meant to be a transitional book, I cannot comprehend why Jordan seems unable to nudge the plot forward even a millimeter.First of all, there is no climax to this book and the &quot;prologue&quot; is around 90 pages long, which comprises nearly 15% of the book. Second, I could summarize this book in 5 sentences - that's how little happens (I won't, though, because I hate spoilers). Third, Rand's, Matt's, and Perrin's storylines all resolve (and I use that word facetiously) with the same answer. Even worse, for 99.9% of her story arc in COT, Egwene is arguing with various Aes Sedai in her camp outside of Tar Valon. When she finally does take action, which is the &quot;climax&quot; of the book, it is given perhaps 2 pages and ends, like everything else in COT, with absolutely no resolution.To people who are fans, I can only implore you to wait for the paperback. To people who are considering starting the WOT series, wait unitl the last book is published. Otherwise, you are going to be very frustrated.Personally, I will give Robert Jordan one last chance. If the next book is as bad (and by bad, I mean glacially slow) as COT, I will give up the series. As it is, anyone who bought the hardcover version of COT should be entitled to their money back."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"is what I wish I could rate this."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Ok Ok Mr Jordan you have written some really good books # 1 thru 7 then you wrote 8 and blew it in my eyes.

It is a wordless ululation, an onslaught of skirt smoothing and braid tugging and tea drinking and sniffing and some more tea and some more skirt smoothing and perhaps...more braid tugging? Correct! This book is nothing but a wordless scream, a cry, a moan, as a series dies. Yes I know there is a Book 11, and a newly released Book 1 of Book 12, by Brian Sanderson, but I don't care to read them. Once again I come to the same place I did so many years ago on my first read through of the Wheel of Time. I remeber the thrill of Dumai's Well, the beauty of Rand in Rhuidean with the memories of a people washing over him, the rush into the Great Blight to the Green Man. I remember all of those moments that made me love the series. But then I came to Book 10. And I couldn't read the Wheel of Time anymore. That is the point I came to and have recently come to.

By volume 6, I truly found myself hoping that a bomb would fall on and obliterate every lead character. Not that we should come to love each fantasy lead character, in fact, some I love to hate, but I remain absolutely indifferent to Jordan's characters, as I've grown indifferent to the whole Wheel of Time thrust."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Mr. Jordan:The entire book could have been written in 20-25 pages.Stop it with the drama and cut to the chase.

For the rest of us, however, this is simply garbage. Men and women still treat each other like morons, the Forsaken are neither scary nor interesting, and the main characters, when they do appear, are pathetic. This kind of book could have been written by any hack, as most of these reviews suggest. Jordan's style does not add depth, only volume for his books. Minute details without plot advancement simply leaves the adult reader bored, and that is the majority of this &quot;book.&quot; The kinds of clothing someone wears might be interesting in brief bits, but when an entire chapter (!!!) is devoted to meaningless detail, critical readers suddenly realize they have a stinker on their hands. Neither Jordan nor his characters seem to mature with this volume, and given that the previous 3 were also quite awful, it's clear that this is one writer who has lost whatever touch he might have had. It's clear now that only Jordan's relatives and his wife (perhaps RJ, too) are writing reviews on his behalf. The rest of the world has wisely moved on. If you're thinking about buying this book, don't. If you're thinking about reading this book, well, don't say you weren't warned.

Literally 3 or 4 events occurred in this book - Nothing is happening in the series since book 6.Please Mr Jordan, give us a book like books 1 - 6 and let us know how the series ends. Some suggestions... Moiraine returns from limbo where she was sent (book ?), Lan unites the north behind Rand, Perrin unites old Manetheran, Matt is the general, they all meet to fight the Trollocs, etc., and Rand and company win. Rand writes a book entitled &quot;From there and back again&quot; and sails off with the Seachan. The end. Please, please, finish this up versus making me read through endless details of no value to the series. The last few books have felt like reading the phone book.

I could have wrote this book in half the pages he did. Of course then I would miss the thouroughly interesting paragraph about the Aes Sedai smoothing her skirts for the fifth time in six lines and how the pale green embroidery did not quite mach with the faded lace that shouhdn't be worn in Tear, where usually people wear dark green. Oh darn. I have heard so much description of clothing and how people look from each city that I'm about ready to give up. As for the plot, well that needs help to. I find it amazing that in the first book they went from Edmonds Field to the Blight while in the last three books they can hardly leave one city. What happened to the fast paced action from the first to books? ANd for crying out loud, nobody stays in touch anymore. Even though the Dragon Reborn is huge and is shaking the world, Egwene doesn't have a clue what he is doing. You think she would of heard something about him, somehow. Yet then again, Salidar was found in two books and is located in a forest, while the &quot;black tower&quot; is just outside of camelyn, recruits are pouring in, and hardly anyone knows where it is.Anyway, the book isn't quite as negative as I make it out to be, but it is the worst of the series. Out of a hundred, here are my ratings for all the other books.1-100Book 1:95Book 2: 99Book 3: 88Book 4: 93Book 5: 89Book 6: 89Book 7: 93Book 8: 88Book 9: 89Book 10: 78Hope you found this review helpful!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I thought that the crossroads of twilight was a really great book.

That seems to be the biggest complaint of most reviewers and hardcore fans.Perhaps its getting such a low rating because there was no huge climax in the book. There were a lot of little climaxes for several of the major characters.I found it an enjoyable addition to the series and it makes me yearn for more."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is my first review and granted, I agree with most of the reviews that this book is not the expected works from Robert Jordan that we have all come to love. But with the developments of the fisrt nine books, I feel that our expectations are set way too high. I have yet to read a series with more than three books that have not turned me away from wanting to read beyond that. WOT is one series that has me anticipating each and every release. COT may not have the in depth plots and all out battle against the dark one at the conclusion, but has many little nuances that Mr. Jordan will undoubtedly tie in with the next book or two. As with all of Mr. Jordans books, if you miss something, you will be missing an important aspect that will undoubtedly tie in later down the road. Everything leads to something else if one just picks up all the hints. There are times when I want the epic to continue forever, but I am also eager to find out the outcome in the Last Battle. Even though that is a foregone conclusion, but I am sure that RJ will make it an end to remember. As for COT, the entire book focuses not where WH left off, but concurently with the events that transpired throughout Winters Heart. I for one will certainly re-read COT just to pick out the events that will make the next book in the series easier to follow. If you enjoyed the first nine books in the series, I definitely would not give up on one book that is building up for the end even if it goes a little overkill on details of frivolent technicalities. COT is still well worth the read and I will stick it out to the end."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Most people say this book is just plain boring, but I think that it is a really intricate book that deserves recognition.

Not a lot happens, but a lot is foreshadowed. It is this that drew me to Jordan in the first place. Sure, I'm all for the hero hacking the baddies to bits for the sake of his true love, but I find it much more fulfilling to read a story where I am engaged in the plotline and invited to bring my own sense of right and wrong to bear on the situations described. Jordan's work is engaging if not always exciting."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"With the ending of the last book, I expected something a little more...entertaining. That said, I continue to identify with the series, and it did only take me two days to read the sucker. What I just can't seem to digest is how can Rand let the Black Tower have gotten so completely out of his control? It is obviously the most powerful thing he has got going for him other than those two huge sa'angreal. Unless of course he is letting some plot of Taim's come to fruition so he can catch him at it or something. Also, to quote from some review \\"glacially slow\\" does seem to sum it up. But I keep on reading."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As it stands, many of reader reviews for this book (one star rating) share one thing in common more strongly than any other - impatience. These reviewers act like rude dinner guests that try to inhale their food and take down their drink in one gulp without taking a moment to actually enjoy the meal. They seem to take no pleasure in the extension of a rich, unparalelled story line that a more savvy reader knows would be a shame to end quickly. Crossroads of Twilight is a fantastic book, another wonderful display of the creative storytelling that we have come to appreciate with Robert Jordan. This book adds depth to many of the side characters and plots in the Wheel of Time series, thereby enabling events and revelations in subsequent books of the series to feel much more powerful--and enjoyable--to the patient reader that wants to get the most out of Robert Jordan's work. If you liked the previous books in this series, do yourself a favor: take your time and indulge yourself on this one. Good things come to those who wait."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Must add my voice to the general feeling of disappointment around this series. Have been reading for 15 years or something like that. The last 5 have had little if any plot progress. Read George R.R. Martin instead."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Why don't we all stop buying his drivel, and chip in to get a ghost writer to finish the story once and for all!!!I am a former fan of Mr Jordan's work. I have nothing against long books (although if you do a comparison of earlier works to later works, you'll notice the much larger margins and fonts in the later works - the books aren't quite as long as everyone thinks, wordcount-wise). In fact, I prefer them. I also understand the occassional need for a &quot;setup&quot; book. For all of the really optomistic, hard-core fans out there, I salute you, as your optomism makes this a better world to live in. If everyone had the anger towards Mr. Jordan that I have, Global Warming would be even worse due to the steam shooting out of everyone's ears. How people can keep confusing &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;no development&quot; with &quot;setup&quot; is rather mind-boggling to me. If it were only 1 &quot;setup&quot; book, I could overlook it. If it were 2 &quot;setup&quot; books that had a book or two of reasonable plot development/character development/closure in between them, then I also could overlook it. But this is the fourth straight book of nonsense, with nothing in between.The writing style, as others have noticed, is much too detailed. Which in and of itself is not necessarily bad, but it's the SAME detail, over and over again, about things no one cares about (fashion and tantrums, as one astute observer put it).In the last book, the Prologue was ~75 pages, with a few pages on many (but not all) subplots, to help the readers get back into sync with all of the threads. This is ridiculous. That's almost as long as some good books in their entirety. It would be ok if A) the writing style was interesting, B) The threads were interesting, or C) The threads were somehow relevant to the main plotline. Unfortunately, this was not true (for most of the last 4 books)Mr Jordan has simply bit off more than he can chew. There are too many characters and subplots for him to keep track of, and he tries to cover this (albeit unintentionally) with verbosity. My bit of optomism is to believe that RJ is not stringing this series out for the moulah. I think he is simply confused.Apparently RJ has answered some criticism by stating that he's writing this for himself. Well then, STOP PUBLISHING IT (which, by definition makes it for others). Some wise fans have suggested to the disillusioned such as myself to stop reading. Well, I have. I can only hope others follow suit. The fact that this book is currently getting 1/2 out of 4 stars (subtract the required 1 star that you're forced to give) is sad, as this means there are others still wating their time and money. Hopefully next book there will be more like myself, and the review average will skyrocket. Get George R.R. Martin to finish the series up, and you'll have me back on the wagon in a heartbeat."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Ok. I bought it. I read it. I wish I hadn't.Will the real Robert Jordan please stand up?Have you ever bought a really cool product only to find that the only way to get the really good stuff to work is to buy 15 other add-ons? I really feel that way with the WoT series.This book feels just like what it is: a giant hook for the next few books. If you have read the first 9 installments then you should read this one just to keep yourself up to date. If you are thinking of getting into this series for the first time, read the first 4 books then wait for the final one to come out.Robert, please don't make us wait 3 years for 600+ pages of treading water."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What little happens is contained in the last last 50 pages of the book.

Absolutely nothing. No one really went anywhere, no one did anything. It contributed nothing to the series. You could not read this book and you would miss, well, nothing. I think Jordan has lost track of where he wanted the story to go. He has no clue how to end it. Either that or he's become enamoured of his own prose (and the big checks.) I'm not looking forward to the next book and I probably won't read it. The Wheel of Time series has become ridiculous. End it already! Here I'll end it for you. Rand goes nuts, breaks the world and kills everybody. How tough was that. Yeesh. (By the way, I think Jordan's biggest fan may be Terry Goddkind. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.)"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I want to preface this review by saying I've enjoyed most of this series, even the last few books but after reading the final pages of 'Crossroads of Twilight' I found myself pacing my apartment trying to think of a way to express my outrage, finally I just threw the book across the room. This is the first time in my life that finishing a book actually made me furious. I don't mind when a story leaves a few threads dangling to increase tension or to keep me involved but this novel takes that to a ridiculous extreme ... this 'book' was the last straw. Jordan's continuing saga has been leaving more and more threads unresolved as the series has progressed and it's finally gone so far that NOTHING is resolved. You could go from book 9 to 11 without missing anything but a bit of exposition about as important as what Rand had for breakfast or what color of socks Perrin prefers. It's not even the artificial extension of this series that really makes me mad, many authors have done this and been entertaining (one of my favorite literary series is 27 books long so far and I enjoy each one). It's Jordan's obvious contempt for his audience that really burns me, he didn't even try to hide the fact that this novel is meaningless filler. How could such a promising and rich story become so empty? Somehow Mr.Jordan has taken a universe, characters and story I love and drawn them out to the point I no longer care how it ends. I will never pick up another 'Wheel of Time' novel unless it is the last and likely not even then. To say I'm disappointed with this book would be a dramatic understatement. DO NOT, under any circumstances, purchase this book. If you absolutely must read it buy a used paperback or better yet get it from a library."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I will not delve into the poor plot development, slow pace and repetitive dialouge. Many others on this list have done so already. However, like most I feel I have to warn away anyone who is considering the arduous trek of winding through this tale. As many have said the first 5 books are quite compelling, but like a fly trap they draw you in and hold you while you suffer through the next 5 books. At this point I am through, Mr. Jordan you have beaten me. I know longer have any interest in knowing what happens to your characters, even though at one time I would have stood in line to buy the next installment the day it came out. It is now simply a sad, painful day when I see one of your books hit the shelf."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"1833 reviews and this enormous doorstop has only garnered 1.5 stars... Jordan says, &quot;I don't read the reviews because they don't matter to me... blah blah blah...&quot; If anyone close to him finds this, tell him to stop hiding. The people have spoken."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well, I am one of the suckers who cannot stop reading these books. I expect that I will continue to read them as long as they keep coming out, with the ever-fading hope that the series will someday end, and end well.Unfortunately, if the current pace continues, it will never end. In Book 10, nothing happened to further the plot. Perrin did nothing. Mat did nothing. Rand did nothing. The Forsaken did nothing. The Aes Sedai did nothing. Elayne did nothing. This book did nothing.But incredibly, I still have hope. Maybe Mr. Jordan will read all these negative reviews and try to pick up the pace in the next book. Maybe he will write an outline beforehand so he can plan what happens in the plot. This way he can make sure that something productive happens in the book.Although I was sorely disappointed with Book 10, I will continue to take read his books (from the library) as long as he writes them."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After I read the piece of absolute horse manure that was _The Path of Daggers_, I vowed that I wouldn't buy another Robert Jordan book until Egwene's forces finally began the battle to retake the Tower. When Winter's Fart came out (no, I didn't misspell it), I immediately discovered from a friend that, indeed, nothing happened. So I waited. Surely Book Ten would finally bring on the battle I had been waiting for since Egwene became the Amyrlin! And guess what! Nothing!!! Absolutely nothing!! We're still waiting for it! I have come to the conclusion that Robert Jordan has died and TOR has hired ghost writers to string out this worthless cash cow for all they can get. I will keep my vow and wait until the battle finally occurs before I read another stinking page of this garbage, but at this point, I'm not holding my breath.By the way, I give five stars to the wonderful reviewers of this book. Perhaps we should all get together and finish writing this series ourselves. I guarantee something would finally happen."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I just finished your tenth book in the wheel of time and I can&quot;t tell you how dissapointed I am! To waste that many pages of good trees, when you could have done the same in just over 100 pages is beyond any of your readers minds. This series started out so great and so many of your books carried on this greatness, but your last 3 or 4 have just not done your readers justice. Why wait to finish this series? You add so many unneeded and terribly boring facts, are you just trying to sell books?We all know what is going on why postpone the climax. Please just let Rand,Mat, Perrin, and the rest just get to the last battle. Then if you feel it is needed start a new series!Please do not dissapoint us AGAIN.Thank You, Barry PetersP.S. Tolkien would never do this."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"For at least the last 3 of Jordan's books, I kept saying to myself, &quot;ok, I'll just read one more and maybe things will pick up.&quot; For this book, I decided not to buy it until after I read some reviews, so that I could avoid all the frustration if it just turned out to be another long-winded book with no plot advancement. Based on the reviews so far, I have decided not to bother with this one. Maybe in 5 or 10 years, when the series is finished, I'll pick it back up, but until then, I'm finished."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I wont repeat the words of the other reviewers. Crossroads should be about 100 pages long max. Taking chapter after chapter after chapter to tell us about how the aes sedai hate chairs that fold up under them is not quite what I had in mind when I purchased the book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I picked up on this series just after The Dragon Reborn was released in paperback, and have, with a declining degree of eagerness, awaited every new installment in the series. When Lord of Chaos was released I even cut some highschool classes so that I could attend a book signing! What reckless and passionate youth. Alas, my fondness is not what it once was and I have to agree with the overwhelming majority here on Crossroads of Twilight and the current state of the series.Still, I will undoubtedly purchase the 11th book and may even reread the entire series before it is released, though I'm seriously thinking about killing that tradition after reading some reviews and being reminded of the last few books. Also, while digging around in storage for my collection I was reminded of another disturbing trend with the more recent books that I haven't seen anyone mention here yet.Now, I've only read the first 100 or so of the user submissions here, so I hope you'll forgive me if this damning evidence has been mentioned overly much: The last three (maybe four, I can't seem to find my Crown of Swords) books in the series, though having a hefty page count in line with the previous, are in fact much shorter works! They are formatted differently! Larger font, fewer lines per page, increased indentation. Double-yoo tee eff! I wouldn't be surprised if a WORD count on them together ended up equalling that of just one of the other books. How can anyone deny that Jordan's lost sight of it all and is just pumping out junk to satisfy a contractual obligation, or something? Go grab a copy from Winter's Heart on and a copy of The Fires of Heaven or before and see if you don't spit blood after comparing a page to a page. It makes me so damn angry, much more so than lack of story development, which I can endure in the hopes that the series will end satisfyingly eventually. The padding out of the page count so blatantly with formatting is just insulting. His storytelling is wearing thin so he not only stylistically stretches out the words but it must be done physically as well to meet a standard expectation... I know I employed that trick a time or two to meet writing assignment requirements when I just wasn't feeling it, though perhaps less obviously. Ok, so maybe he's had medical trouble and weren't there rumors of a lost manuscript and a need to rewrite one of those books from scratch, or something? Well, that sucks for him, but I don't agree with some very poor choices that were made. I wonder what those few of the reviewers that defend the recent books have to say about that.I think I've developed a new phobia as a result of this. I have an irrational fear of any series that exceeds a stand alone trilogy being doomed to fall apart from lack of full conception or commitment no matter how promising the beginning. I'll call it Jordanphobia."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book could have gone unwritten.It gave me not much insight to the Dragon reborns adventure and didn't advance the story line. This book only talked about the other charachters who may or may not have been germain to the advancement of the saga. I was left wondering why did I waste my time reading this book when I probably could have waited for next issue and there would not have been a gap in the story line."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The first five books in the Wheel of Time series were excellent additions to the world of Fantasy. I thought that we finally had a writer in Robert Jordan who could easily rival JRR Tolkien for plot, characterization and drawing the reader into a great world. Books six to nine slowly disabused me of that notion, as they increasingly became confused and mundane. But this book is by far the worst of Robert Jordan's entire series. Its a filler, like a bad Saturday night TV show, something to hold you over until the movie you wanted to watch begins. The lack of action, the poor attention to previous plots and storylines make this a book without purpose. There is no tension or motive in this text, one may as well have condensed the book into three or four chapters in a book that moved the story along. If it wasn't for the fact that this book would leave a gapping hole in your collection, I would say don't buy it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Okay. I've read the first ten books in this series, and I am going to finish the series if it kills me. But enough, already, with adding new characters and wasting time with dress-smoothing Aes Sedai, man-tall female Aiel, childishly bull-headed Nynaeve, Shaido and Brother-less Aiel, and all the rest. Blah, blah, blah! Just write the last $%&amp;*#(@$! book in the series and get it over with! Action, man, I want action!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After wading through the first nine books in this series, I'm wondering why I bothered to read the tenth. I thought for certain that this would end the series but to my dismay, I find that Rand, et al were still firmly emeshed in what now seems to be an endless soap opera. I've read about all I can stand about the &quot;ageless&quot; Aes Sedi, what all the women are wearing, Rand's apparently incurable pain and suffering, and an entire host of other repetitive and boring self-serving details which I could do without. Despite my aversion to leaving a tale unfinished, I don't think I'll be reading Jordan's 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, etc., etc., etc. offerings. Too I take fervent exception to the New York Times' claim that, &quot;Robert Jordan has come to dominate the world Tolkien began to reveal.&quot; Nonsense. Mr. Jordan's epic cannot even begin to measure up to the genius of Tolkien's work, except perhaps in the respect of how much room it takes up on the bookshelf."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It pains me that so many fans(or should i say ex-fans) are trashing this great series and its even greater author.This is the only reason i am writing this review.I think this man has been wrongly treated.His talent for misdirectionIt was not only saidin that was tainted by the dark one but saidar as well.For example,Nynaeve,Egwene,Elayne and Aviendha have all grown progressively worse over the series.This is why every Aes Sedai(and to be fair,the Aiel Wise Ones and their apprentices) seem to be spoilt,idiotic and bullying(because of the long usage of the power). They hide information when there is no reason to do so.And their actions border on the senseless.They have more concern about their dresses than about awakening of the dark one (who for the present is content to stay in his prison because he and the forsaken have realised that the Aes Sedai and Ashaman's capacity for self destruction is unequalled).This is what he has been hinting all along the series and we fans were not enlightened enough to recognise it.That is why we see no mention of the Forsaken or the dark one in this book.Political maneuvering at its best!!His innovativeness ......... in keeping the interest in his series alive.He has never answered who killed Asmodean.He has never answered who freed Fain in the Great Hunt? These are only two of the many questions which have never been answered.how could he.The message boards cannot be filled with the various dresses the women wear.His foresighthe cannot resolve all the plotlines.He has covered his back by saying that he doesnt beleive in happy endings. So if a lot of plotlines are unresolved in the end,well,he told us before didnt he?His daringwriting prequels before the main series is complete.which self-respecting author has done it?His compassionHearing the pleas from his fans, Jordan has condescended to resolve a few things in his next book(even though he would like every plotline to run for ever).Never mind that all the currently running plot lines have nothing to do with the Shadow.So even if all the current plotlines are resolved, there is material left for at least 5 more books.With all these great qualities, how could any one find fault with the books written by him?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Horrible book. Robert Jordan should be embarrassed. The other reviews state this. I must say it have made me feel better reading them. I am so happy that this got a 1.5 star rating.But I'd like to add that the editors of this book should be embarrassed also. There are multiple transitions in the book that just don't make sense or are confusing because RJ hasn't given enough details on what is going on (because he's too busy describing what each person is wearing).Shame on the publishers for putting this book out and shame on RJ. RJ must have contracted Alzheimers because his books have deteriorated horribly. You suck RJ."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I first read Crossroads of Twilight when the Hardcover came out. I struggled through it finding myself continually reading the glossary for names of characters I couldn't tell apart. I felt (as I had with the previous two books) that insufficient progress was being made and the plot was being sidelined by new threads. I swore I would not buy the next release, but rather to check it out of the library.Four weeks ago I began rereading the series starting with book one. To my surprise, Books 8 - 10 gained a richness and depth I had missed reading them two years+ apart. Each plotline was comprehensible and the progress of each plot was much easier to see. I still feel Jordan could have cut out 50 pages from each, but the stories stood up to the rest of the series.The strange wooing of Tuon by Matt in COT is richly displayed and well done. Interesting light is shed on the character and world-view of both the &quot;brotherless&quot; of the Shaido and of elements of Seanchen society. I cannot give this slightly slow read four or five stars as I have given earlier volumes, but I believe the character development, plotting, and cultural detail stands up to Jordan's earlier work. I enjoyed the second reading of this book thoroughly and will once again be waiting to buy the next installment."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I loved it! The plot and character set up were excellent yet again. A WOT novel is something to savor like a fine wine not gobble up like a burrito from Taco Bell. Those who read these must remember to use patience and to let your self savor the excellent story. Its hard to find a fantasy author thats willing to write to such high standards and I for one am eternally grateful that Mr. Jordan has."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"We spend a lot of time catching up on what everybody has been doing across the cast of Jordan's main characters, although there are a few mid-level characters who don't get much time. There is a lot of perspective on what each main character or party was doing at the time of Rand's major actions at the end of book 9. Not a whole lot &quot;new&quot; happens, but the stage is set for a lot of cool stuff down the road. Much time is given to character development, and setting the scene for mood and attitude of the people of this land.Having summarized, I must say that there are a lot of harsh reviews for this book, and I feel they are out of line. If somebody has made it all the way to book 10 (6000-7000 pages in the first 9 volumes), they should be well familiar with Jordan's writing style. Sure, he takes a lot of time to describe things. That's exactly why his world is so lush and believable! That's why people READ this series! If you made it this far and prefer a terse Hemingway style of prose, man, you must be a glutton for punishment!Not as much &quot;exciting&quot; happens in this volume, but we learn what is going on everywhere, and the scene is set for the actions of the next volume. Yes, it could have been a little longer, okay, maybe a lot longer, but I would rather have had the volume as it is today, than waited another 6 months for it to grow more substantial. And that (relatively short) is the only reason I give this volume 4 stars instead of 5.If you've made it up to book 10 in this series, you would be really really silly to not read this one."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"most of the people who reviewed this book need to learn some patience. CoT is slow, true, but its the description and character depth that makes the series great. by now any avid reader of robert jordan should be used to the detailed description. also, this book has more dialogue and less action, especially with the white tower and egwene, but its necessary for the forwarding of plot. bottom line is, its not as fast paced as the others, but still a good page-turner"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Books one throuh nine in my opinion all deserve 5 stars. The first time reading this series through i was upset that the later books 5-9 diddnt have the fast pace that i came to enjoy from the first 4. That being said A year later i re read the series and actually found that the later books in the series are amazing. Just because there arnt epic battles every chapter or the one power being used to kill things doesnt mean that this story isnt progressing. The fact is the smarter you are the more you catch the plot twists and foreshadowing used by R.J. Furthermore if anyone actually is a fan of the series they would know that crossroads of twilight was never intended to be seperate from Winters Heart. R.J. himself says that He had to split it up because Winters Heart would simply be to big to produce.
