Stratton's definitive history of the making of The Wild Bunch, named one of the greatest Westerns of all time by the American Film Institute. Sam Peckinpah's film The Wild Bunch is the story of a gang of outlaws who are one big steal from retirement. When their attempted train robbery goes awry, the gang flees to Mexico and falls in with a brutal general of the Mexican Revolution, who offers them the job of a lifetime. Conceived by a stuntman, directed by a blacklisted director, and shot in the sand and heat of the Mexican desert, the movie seemed doomed. Instead, it became an instant classic with a dark, violent take on the Western movie tradition. In The Wild Bunch, W.K. Stratton tells the fascinating history of the making of the movie and documents for the first time the extraordinary contribution of Mexican and Mexican-American actors and crew members to the movie's success. Shaped by infamous director Sam Peckinpah, and starring such visionary actors as William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Edmond O'Brien, and Robert Ryan, the movie was also the product of an industry and a nation in transition. By 1968, when the movie was filmed, the studio system that had perpetuated the myth of the valiant cowboy in movies like The Searchers had collapsed, and America was riled by Vietnam, race riots, and assassinations. The Wild Bunch spoke to America in its moment, when war and senseless violence seemed to define both domestic and international life. The Wild Bunch is an authoritative history of the making of a movie and the era behind it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cQ5kDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Architecture and Urbanism","description":"\\"A classic book authored by the foremost architectural historian in America, this fully illustrated history of American architecture and city planning is based on Vincent Scully's conviction that architecture and city planning are inseparably linked and must therefore be treated together.

C. Heinz embarked on his illustrious career as one of the premier sports writers of the past fifty years, he served as a war correspondent for the New York Sun. Now for the first time ever, Heinz's finest work on World War II, written both during and after the war, is collected in one volume. From his first-person account aboard the U.S.S. Nevada during D-Day in 1944 to his legendary dispatches from the towns and battlefields of the European front, Heinz vividly conveys the courage, humor, and humanity of men under fire. Whether describing a battle scene or a soldier, Heinz brings home the war like few others ever have. In the second half of the book, he and his fourteen-year-old son, Bud, revisit the beaches of Normandy with D-Day veteran Major General Earl Rudder, who recounts his experiences there; in another story he describes, in his patented you-are-there style, the morning three German spies were executed; and in the concluding piece, Heinz revisits many of the towns he journeyed through as the American army fought its way across Europe twenty years before.When We Were One is a superb collection of writing on World War II that ranks with the finest ever assembled on any war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V2-vMN6mwyoC&dq=When+We+Were+One:+Stories+of+World+War+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alphabets & Samplers: 40 Cross Stitch and Charted Designs","description":"This exquisite collection of usable, unusual, royalty-free lettering includes 1,685 bizarre and ornamental letters, including 50 full alphabets in a variety of motifs, including 11th centuy Anglo-Celtic, military, silhouettes, mathematics, and many more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PNyY4aUiL1kC&dq=Alphabets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Breath of Snow and Ashes (Outlander)","description":"Eagerly anticipated by her legions of fans, this sixth novel in Diana Gabaldon s bestselling Outlander saga is a masterpiece of historical fiction from one of the most popular authors of our time.

But from his wife Jamie knows that three years hence the shot heard round the world will be fired, and the result will be independence   with those loyal to the King either dead or in exile.

Whether they are caused by traffic accidents, or violence, or occur during sports and leisure activities , these injuries can dramatically and tragically alter the victim's ability to cope with life. In many countries,after-care of the victim, once the injury is no longer life-threatening, is often inadequate, and all too often families are left to manage as best as they can. The book is written for families who find themselves in this situation. The authors have had many years of experience working withhead-injured people in both research and rehabilitation roles. The effects of injury are explained in non-technical terms and, where possible, practical ways of overcoming these effects are described. Because they also have many years of experience working with organisations that have been formedto help the families of the head-injured, the authors know the main areas of concern that these families have. Beginning with the injury itself, the stages that the patient will go through are described, and the procedures and techniques that will be used to chart progress are explained. As wellas these direct effects of the injury on the victim, the book also examines the ways that head trauma can affect families and friends. For the person who will eventually recover sufficiently to do so, there are suggestions on managing the return to work or school most effectively. For those whowill never reach this level, there is a section which describes the long-term adjustments that these people and their care-givers need to make. The final section outlines the requirements of a head injury rehabilitation system, and gives some suggestions about the steps that individuals can take toensure that this sort of service is provided in their area. This new edition has been fully updated, to reflect the recent advances in medical science that mean that many more people with head injury survive, and also new trends in health care and rehabilitation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xywuKU8FQR0C&dq=Head+Injury:+The+Facts:+A+Guide+for+Families+and+Care-givers+(The+Facts+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The life of Sir Isaac Newton","description":"I consider philosophy rather than arts and write not concerning manual but natural powers, and consider chiefly those things which relate to gravity, levity, elastic force, the resistance of fluids, and the like forces, whether attractive or impulsive; and therefore I offer this work as the mathematical principles of philosophy.In the third book I give an example of this in the explication of the System of the World.

A volatile and precocious Native girl growing up in Kitamaat, the Haisla Indian reservation located five hundred miles north of Vancouver, Lisa came of age standing with her feet firmly planted in two different worlds: the spiritual realm of the Haisla and the sobering  real  world with its dangerous temptations of violence, drugs, and despair.

Materialism has been the subject of extensive and rich controversies since Robert Boyle introduced the term for the first time in the 17th century. But what is materialism and what can it offer today? The term is usually defined as the worldview according to which everything real is material. Nevertheless, there is no philosophical consensus about whether the meaning of matter can be enlarged beyond the physical. As a consequence, materialism is often defined in stark exclusive and reductionist terms: whatever exists is either physical or ontologically reducible to it. This conception, if consistent, mutilates reality, excluding the ontological significance of political, economic, sociocultural, anthropological and psychological realities. Starting from a new history of materialism, the present book focuses on the central ontological and epistemological debates aroused by today s leading materialist approaches, including some little known to an anglophone readership. The key concepts of matter, system, emergence, space and time, life, mind, and software are checked over and updated. Controversial issues such as the nature of mathematics and the place of reductionism are also discussed from different materialist approaches. As a result, materialism emerges as a powerful, indispensable scientifically-supported worldview with a surprising wealth of nuances and possibilities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k9JyEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winter, Awake","description":"Ready for the rest that cold weather brings, trees, animals, and insects try to awaken Winter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y2Sv4egu4R8C&dq=Winter,+Awake&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Self-Ownership, Freedom, and Equality (Studies in Marxism and Social Theory)","description":"In this book, G.

Since 1993, China has been the second largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world and is now considered to be the world's third biggest economy. Its greater economic integration with the rest of the world, especially since its accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), has further accelerated its market-oriented economic reforms. China is now opening its protected markets and beginning to submit to the rule of international law. This ongoing transition and increasing participation in the world economy has resulted in significant changes in human resource management and social welfare practices in China's enterprises. The book examines the key areas, all of which are linked, where China is grappling with institutional reforms as it opens up to the outside world: state-owned enterprise reform, capital markets and financial reform, human resources and labour market reform, social welfare reform, and China's accession to the WTO and the growth of the private sector.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bhSAAgAAQBAJ&dq=China%27s+Business+Reforms:+Institutional+Challenges+in+a+Globalised+Economy+(Routledge+Contemporary+China+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mastering Option Trading Volatility Strategies with Sheldon Natenberg (Wiley Trading Video)","description":"Now you can learn directly from Sheldon Natenberg!

Orgyan Chokyi (1675-1729) spent her life in Dolpo, the highest inhabited region of the Nepal Himalayas. Illiterate and expressly forbidden by her master to write her own life story, Orgyan Chokyi received divine inspiration, defied tradition, and composed one of the most engaging autobiographies of the Tibetan literary tradition. The Life of Orgyan Chokyi is the oldest known autobiography authored by a Tibetan woman, and thus holds a critical place in both Tibetan and Buddhist literature. In it she tells of the sufferings of her youth, the struggle to escape menial labor and become a hermitess, her dreams and visionary experiences, her relationships with other nuns, the painstaking work of contemplative practice, and her hard-won social autonomy and high-mountain solitude. In process it develops a compelling vision of the relation between gender, the body, and suffering from a female Buddhist practitioner's perspective. Part One of Himalayan Hermitess presents a religious history of Orgyan Chokyi's Himalayan world, the Life of Orgyan Chokyi as a work of literature, its portrayal of sorrow and joy, its perspectives on suffering and gender, as well as the diverse religious practices found throughout the work. Part Two offers a full translation of the Life of Orgyan Chokyi. Based almost entirely upon Tibetan documents never before translated, Himalayan Hermitess is an accessible introduction to Buddhism in the premodern Himalayas.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-zRZowYxQDwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Dictionary Hebrew-English Illustrated Dictionary for Children","description":"About the Book: Learn colors with this bilingual children's picture book dictionary.

The recipient of the 2000 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, he ranks among the most beloved -- and widely read -- of American authors. In The Cat's Pajamas, this \\"latter-day O. Henry\\" (Booklist) takes us on an amazing walk through his six-decade career, presenting twenty-two tales -- some old, some new, all but two never before published. Here you will find stories strange and scary, nostalgic and bittersweet, humorous and heart-touching, ranging from the not-so-long-gone past to an unknowable future: a group of senators drinks a bit too much -- and gambles away the United States; a newlywed couple buys an old house and finds their fledgling relationship tested; two mysterious strangers arrive at a rooming house and baffle their fellow occupants with strange crying in the night; a lonely woman takes a last chance on love. The final piece in the collection is a story-poem, a fond salute from Bradbury to his literary heroes Shaw, Chesterton, Dickens, Twain, Poe, Wilde, Melville, and Kipling. The Cat's Pajamas is just that -- the bee's knees -- a touching, timeless, and tender collection from the incomparable Ray Bradbury, and a anoramic view of an amazingly long, rich, and fertile creative career.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q1I2KeTavWsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Unsentimental Education: Writers and Chicago","description":"A collection of twenty-one interviews--presented as first-person essays--with contemporary poets and novelists who have studied, taught at, or had other ties with the University of Chicago, includes Philip Roth, Hayden Carruth, Marguerite Young, and Susan Sontag.

In preparing Environmental Geomorphology, the author has given priority to methodology and illustrative case-histories. Schemes and classifications that would be ill-suited for a naturalistic, empirical and non-systematic discipline like geomorphology have been avoided. The concepts outlined in the text are based on a subdivision of geomorphological resources and hazards (as well as their links with man) together with the consequent risk and impact problems. Each investigation, study or intervention concerning the environment, cannot ignore either the human context in which it occurs or man's history and prospects. It is necessary to have the right dialogue and relationship with the other disciplines making up this system so as to apply the most suitable methodologies and offer the most valid solutions. For some subjects covered in the book, specialists concerned with a particular section of environmental geomorphology were consulted. The text of each chapter is accompanied by several illustrative schemes, figures and photographs, derived from real research and professional experiences. The volume is addressed both to university students studying topics of geomorphology as part of their syllabus, and to researchers and consultants (geologists, geographers, engineers, naturalists, etc.) working in the field.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WzpX5uDn-uYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foundations for a Practical Theology of Ministry","description":"The pastoral ministry is in danger of losing its focus, say the authors of this perceptive and timely study. Specialization in preaching, counseling, evangelism, administration, and education has diffused the impact of practical theology. And because of competing ideas as to what now is central, the very image of ministry may be breaking down. Foundations for a Practical Theology of Ministry responds to the problem by introducing a specific method for doing practical theology which will be welcomed by concerned church leaders everywhere. Presenting a realistic, workable answer to those who call for a revival of this vital discipline, Drs. James N. Poling and Donald E. Miller propose that the unifying image for ministry becomes the formation of the community of faith. After developing this as the most appropriate base for the practice of theology, they carefully outline their method and show how it will work by demonstrating its success in the actual experiences of typical congregations. For Christian leaders who seek to renew the integrity of ministry and restore the character of pastoral leadership, this significant book will provide a solid foundation. And for individuals interested or involved in education for the future of the church, this important resource will prove invaluable.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k1okPwAACAAJ&dq=Foundations+for+a+Practical+Theology+of+Ministry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"People and Nature: An Introduction to Human Ecological Relations (Primers in Anthropology)","description":"This book provides a lively and thoughtful introduction to ecological anthropology by examining the evolving relations between human communities and nature.

As this novel by the author of Blindness and All the Names begins, Tertuliano M ximo Afonso is a divorced, depressed history teacher. To lift his spirits, a colleague suggests he rent a certain video. Tertuliano watches the film, unimpressed. But during the night, when he is awakened by noise, he finds the VCR replaying the video and watches in astonishment as a man who looks exactly like him or, more specifically, exactly like he did five years earlier, mustachioed and fuller in the face appears on the screen. Against his own better judgment, Tertuliano decides to pursue his double. As he roots out the man s identity, what begins as a whimsical chase becomes a probing investigation into what makes us human. Can we be reduced to our outward appearance, rather than the sum of our experiences? The inspiration for the film Enemy starring Jake Gyllenhaal and directed by Denis Villeneuve, The Double is a timeless novel from a writer John Updike described in The New Yorker as  like Faulkner, so confident of his resources and ultimate destination that he can bring any impossibility to life by hurling words at it.

In this book, he tells the story of the negotiations that led to a number of landmark agreements, such as the Vienna Convention on Ozone and its Montreal Protocol, the Basel Convention on Hazardous Wastes, and the Biodiversity Convention. The book stands as the legacy of an important and charismatic figure who played a pivotal role during the first phase of global environmental diplomacy. Tolba concentrates on the context in which governments conclude that particular issues are ripe for binding international cooperation and on the factors that influence them during negotiations such as science, the media, nongovernmental organizations, politicians, business and industry, and the public. The areas he discusses include the evolution of environmental law, environmental soft laws (principles and guidelines rather than treaties), binding regional regimes such as the Regional Seas Program and the Shared Freshwater Resources Program, the ozone layer, global warming, hazardous wastes, the loss of biological diversity, and ways to make international agreements work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HukeRAxxzaYC&dq=Global+Environmental+Diplomacy:+Negotiating+Environmental+Agreements+for+the+World,+1973-1992+(Global+Environmental+Accord:+Strategies+for+Sustainability+and+Institutional+Innovation)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Anatomy & Physiology","description":"For courses in two-semester A&P.

Whether they are caused by traffic accidents, or violence, or occur during sports and leisure activities , these injuries can dramatically and tragically alter the victim's ability to cope with life. In many countries,after-care of the victim, once the injury is no longer life-threatening, is often inadequate, and all too often families are left to manage as best as they can. The book is written for families who find themselves in this situation. The authors have had many years of experience working withhead-injured people in both research and rehabilitation roles. The effects of injury are explained in non-technical terms and, where possible, practical ways of overcoming these effects are described. Because they also have many years of experience working with organisations that have been formedto help the families of the head-injured, the authors know the main areas of concern that these families have. Beginning with the injury itself, the stages that the patient will go through are described, and the procedures and techniques that will be used to chart progress are explained. As wellas these direct effects of the injury on the victim, the book also examines the ways that head trauma can affect families and friends. For the person who will eventually recover sufficiently to do so, there are suggestions on managing the return to work or school most effectively. For those whowill never reach this level, there is a section which describes the long-term adjustments that these people and their care-givers need to make. The final section outlines the requirements of a head injury rehabilitation system, and gives some suggestions about the steps that individuals can take toensure that this sort of service is provided in their area. This new edition has been fully updated, to reflect the recent advances in medical science that mean that many more people with head injury survive, and also new trends in health care and rehabilitation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xywuKU8FQR0C&dq=Head+Injury:+The+Facts:+A+Guide+for+Families+and+Care-givers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Novice Driver's Road Map- A Parent's Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gtgitAEACAAJ&dq=Novice+Driver%27s+Road+Map-+A+Parent%27s+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bringing Together: Uncollected Early Poems 1958-1988","description":"\\"The power that Kumin draws from and brings to literature is potent and seemingly inexhaustible.\\"--Booklist","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K4aHHAAACAAJ&dq=Bringing+Together:+Uncollected+Early+Poems+1958-1988&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Something In The Way She Moves: Dancing Women From Salome To Madonna","description":"Filled with fascinating anecdotes from the world of dance, this survey of the sensuality of dance takes readers on a dizzying tour of the erotic in feminine motion, from the ancient stylized movement of the geisha to the wild improvisation of jazz dance. 25,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LW61AAAAIAAJ&dq=Something+In+The+Way+She+Moves:+Dancing+Women+From+Salome+To+Madonna&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Inductor Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide For Correct Component Selection In All Circuit Applications.

Lewis called him the wittiest man in Europe, and Ronald Knox was a deft apologist, an astute translator of the Bible, and the preacher for occasions great and small throughout the first half of the twentieth century in England. But he was first and last a priest, and it is in his sermons and retreat conferences that we meet Ronald Knox the spiritual guide. \\"A Retreat for Lay People\\" brings together a collection of his conferences preached over a period of fifteen years. His opening topic is Discouragement in Retreat, and he concludes with a reflection on Our Ladys Serenity. In between, Knox addresses the big questions the fear of death, the problem of suffering, the world to come but he also explores the little questions that loom large in our daily lives, like minor trials, liberty of spirit in prayer, and the use of Gods creatures. Msgr. Knox shapes his collection around the classic \\"Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius.\\" The first eight conferences address the foundations of our spiritual life; the next eight offer reflections on the life of Our Lord; the final eight take up practical questions of living our faith in daily life. These pieces of eight are punctuated by two meditations suitable for a Holy Hour. The Eucharist was at the heart of Knoxs life and his profound love for Christ in the Blessed Sacrament shines through in these talks. As in all his writing, in these conferences Ronald Knox combines love for Scripture, commitment to the Catholic faith, and sympathy for the struggles and joys of Christian discipleship. \\"A Retreat for Lay People\\" is solid spiritual food, served up with refreshing simplicity and a dash of wit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YazkwAEACAAJ&dq=A+Retreat+for+Lay+People&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Geography For Dummies (For Dummies (Career/Education))","description":"Geography is more than just trivia, it can help you understand why we import or export certain products, predict climate change, and even show you where to place fire and police stations when planning a city.

Still determined to serve in the navy, he fought his way through another difficult and demanding training regimen to become a nuclear submariner.

Jerry proves himself and more when Memphis  crew makes an unexpected and dangerous discovery. With each following book, Jerry s skill set grows as he takes on more responsibilities on board different classes of submarines. He reaches the pinnacle of an outstanding naval career as the commanding officer of USS North Dakota, then becomes a squadron commodore, a job that has more to do with pushing paper than driving submarines.

The Catholic Church values both Faith and Reason, and Catholicism has given rise to extraordinary ideas and whole schools of remarkable thought, not just in the distant past but throughout the troubled decades of the twentieth century. Royal presents in a single volume a sweeping but readable account of how Catholic thinking developed in philosophy, theology, Scripture studies, culture, literature, and much more in the twentieth century. This involves great figures, recognized as such both inside and outside the Church, such as Jacques Maritain, Bernard Lonergan, Joseph Pieper, Edith Stein, Alasdair MacIntyre, Charles Taylor, Romano Guardini, Karl Rahner, Henri du Lubac, Karol Wojtyla, Joseph Ratzinger, Hans Urs von Balthasar,Charles Peguy, Paul Claudel, George Bernanos, Francois Mauriac, G. K. Chesterton, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Christopher Dawson, Graham Greene, Sigrid Undset, J. R. R. Tolkien, Czeslaw Milosz, and many more. Royal argues that without rigorous thought, Catholicism - however welcoming and nourishing it might be - would become something like a doctor with a good bedside manner, but who knows little medicine. It has always been the aspiration of the Catholic tradition to unite emotion and intellect, action and contemplation. But unless we know what the tradition has already produced - especially in the work of the great figures of the recent past - we will not be able to answer the challenges that the modern world poses, or even properly recognize the true questions we face. This is a reflective, non-polemical work that brings together various strands of Catholic thought in the twentieth century. A comprehensive guide to the recent past - and the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pp6BCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In a mirror (A Dell Yearling Book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WlautAEACAAJ&dq=In+a+mirror+(A+Dell+Yearling+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America's UFO Cover-Up","description":"Using recently declassified government files, the authors present a compelling argument that the government knows a great deal more about UFOs than it has sshared with the public, and has in fact deliberately concealed the findings of more than 30 years of investigations.

In this paradigm-shifting analysis, University of Chicago political scientist Robert Pape has collected groundbreaking evidence to explain the strategic, social, and individual factors responsible for this growing threat. One of the world s foremost authorities on the subject, Professor Pape has created the first comprehensive database of every suicide terrorist attack in the world from 1980 until today. With striking clarity and precision, Professor Pape uses this unprecedented research to debunk widely held misconceptions about the nature of suicide terrorism and provide a new lens that makes sense of the threat we face. FACT: Suicide terrorism is not primarily a product of Islamic fundamentalism. FACT: The world s leading practitioners of suicide terrorism are the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lankaa secular, Marxist-Leninist group drawn from Hindu families. FACT: Ninety-five percent of suicide terrorist attacks occur as part of coherent campaigns organized by large militant organizations with significant public support. FACT: Every suicide terrorist campaign has had a clear goal that is secular and political: to compel a modern democracy to withdraw military forces from the territory that the terrorists view as their homeland. FACT: Al-Qaeda fits the above pattern. Although Saudi Arabia is not under American military occupation per se, one major objective of al-Qaeda is the expulsion of U.S. troops from the Persian Gulf region, and as a result there have been repeated attacks by terrorists loyal to Osama bin Laden against American troops in Saudi Arabia and the region as a whole. FACT: Despite their rhetoric, democraciesincluding the United Stateshave routinely made concessions to suicide terrorists. Suicide terrorism is on the rise because terrorists have learned that it s effective. In this wide-ranging analysis, Professor Pape offers the essential tools to forecast when some groups are likely to resort to suicide terrorism and when they are not. He also provides the first comprehensive demographic profile of modern suicide terrorist attackers. With data from more than 460 such attackersincluding the names of 333we now know that these individuals are not mainly poor, desperate criminals or uneducated religious fanatics but are often well-educated, middle-class political activists. More than simply advancing new theory and facts, these pages also answer key questions about the war on terror: ? Are we safer now than we were before September 11? ? Was the invasion of Iraq a good counterterrorist move? ? Is al-Qaeda stronger now than it was before September 11? Professor Pape answers these questions with analysis grounded in fact, not politics, and recommends concrete ways for today s states to fight and prevent terrorist attacks. Military options may disrupt terrorist operations in the short term, but a lasting solution to suicide terrorism will require a comprehensive, long-term approachone that abandons visions of empire and relies on a combined strategy of vigorous homeland security, nation building in troubled states, and greater energy independence. For both policy makers and the general public, Dying to Win transcends speculation with systematic scholarship, making it one of the most important political studies of recent time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SOlnH3f_dXwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Grim Reader","description":"San Francisco book-restoration expert Brooklyn Wainwright was hoping for a fun, relaxing weekend at a local book fair, but a murderer made other plans in the latest in this New York Times bestselling series.

Yet there was an innocence about Antoinette, thrust as a child into the chillingly formal French court. Married to the maladroit, ill-mannered Dauphin, Antoinette found pleasure in costly entertainments and garments. She spent lavishly while her overtaxed and increasingly hostile subjects blamed her for France's plight. In time Antoinette matured into a courageous Queen, and when their enemies finally closed in, Antoinette followed her inept husband to the guillotine in one last act of bravery. In To the Scaffold, Carolly Erickson provides an estimation of a lost Queen that is psychologically acute, richly detailed, and deeply moving.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wHPT054L7AIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clanbook: Ventrue, Revised Edition (Vampire: The Masquerade Clanbooks)","description":"What are we?

Rightly or wrongly, the book has widely been seen as a blueprint for how Republicans, using the so-called Southern Strategy, could build a durable winning coalition in presidential elections. Certainly, Nixon's election marked the end of a \\"New Deal Democratic hegemony\\" and the beginning of a conservative realignment encompassing historically Democratic voters from the South and the Florida-to-California \\"Sun Belt,\\" in the book s enduring coinage. In accounting for that shift, Kevin Phillips showed how two decades and more of social and political changes had created enormous opportunities for a resurgent conservative Republican Party. For this new edition, Phillips has written a preface describing his view of the book, its reception, and how its analysis was borne out in subsequent elections. A work whose legacy and influence are still fiercely debated, The Emerging Republican Majority is essential reading for anyone interested in American politics or history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SGuYDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Emerging+Republican+Majority&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Boer in Peace and War","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cAAwAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Good Life","description":"Transform your life in 30 days.We are all working hard, but are we working on the right things?

Freehling highlights all the key moments on the road to war, including the violence in Bleeding Kansas, Preston Brooks's beating of Charles Sumner in the Senate chambers, the Dred Scott Decision, John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, and much more. As Freehling shows, the election of Abraham Lincoln sparked a political crisis, but at first most Southerners took a cautious approach, willing to wait and see what Lincoln would do--especially, whether he would take any antagonistic measures against the South. But at this moment, the extreme fringe in the South took charge, first in South Carolina and Mississippi, but then throughout the lower South, sounding the drum roll for secession. Indeed, The Road to Disunion is the first book to fully document how this decided minority of Southern hotspurs took hold of the secessionist issue and, aided by a series of fortuitous events, drove the South out of the Union. Freehling provides compelling profiles of the leaders of this movement--many of them members of the South Carolina elite. Throughout the narrative, he evokes a world of fascinating characters and places as he captures the drama of one of America's most important--and least understood--stories. The long-awaited sequel to the award-winning Secessionists at Bay, which was hailed as \\"the most important history of the Old South ever published,\\" this volume concludes a major contribution to our understanding of the Civil War. A compelling, vivid portrait of the final years of the antebellum South, The Road to Disunion will stand as an important history of its subject. \\"This sure-to-be-lasting work--studded with pen portraits and consistently astute in its appraisal of the subtle cultural and geographic variations in the region--adds crucial layers to scholarship on the origins of America's bloodiest conflict.\\" --The Atlantic Monthly \\"Splendid, painstaking account...and so a work of history reaches into the past to illuminate the present.

The Haber-Bosch process, which he invented at the turn of the twentieth century, revolutionized agriculture by converting nitrogen to fertilizer in quantities massive enough to feed the world. The invention has become an essential pillar for life on earth; some two billion people on our planet could not survive without it. Yet this same process supplied the German military with explosives during World War I, and Haber orchestrated Germany's use of an entirely new weapon -- poison gas. Eventually, Haber's efforts led to Zyklon B, the gas later used to kill millions -- including Haber's own relatives -- in Nazi concentration camps. Haber is the patron saint of guns and butter, a scientist whose discoveries transformed the way we produce food and fight wars. His legacy is filled with contradictions, as was his personality. For some, he was a benefactor of humanity and devoted friend. For others, he was a war criminal, possessed by raw ambition. An intellectual gunslinger, enamored of technical progress and driven by patriotic devotion to Germany, he was instrumental in the scientific work that inadvertently supported the Nazi cause; a Jew and a German patriot, he was at once an enabler of the Nazi regime and its victim. Master Mind is a thought-provoking biography of this controversial scientist, a modern Faust who personifies the paradox of science, its ability to create and to destroy. It offers a complete chronicle of his tumultuous and ultimately tragic life, from his childhood and rise to prominence in the heady days of the German Empire to his disgrace and exile at the hands of the Nazis; from early decades as the hero who eliminated the threat of starvation to his lingering legacy as a villain whose work led to the demise of millions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b3W7Fk63dbIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji/The Fifty-three Stage of the Takaido","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J4J2QwAACAAJ&dq=The+Thirty-six+Views+of+Mount+Fuji/The+Fifty-three+Stage+of+the+Takaido&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chariots of the Gods?","description":"The author attempts to explain such perplexing archaeological discoveries as the stone figures on Easter Island and various temple and cave drawings","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m08EEAAAQBAJ&dq=Chariots+of+the+Gods%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE COMPLETE MODEM REFERENCE: THE TECHNICIAN'S GUIDE TO INSTALLATION, TESTING, AND TROUBLE-FREE COMMUNICATIONS (WILEY PROFESSIONAL COMPUTING, SECOND EDITION)","description":"A comprehensive guide to buying, testing, installing and troubleshooting modems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QYooAQAAMAAJ&dq=THE+COMPLETE+MODEM+REFERENCE:+THE+TECHNICIAN%27S+GUIDE+TO+INSTALLATION,+TESTING,+AND+TROUBLE-FREE+COMMUNICATIONS+(WILEY+PROFESSIONAL+COMPUTING,+SECOND+EDITION)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New American Diet","description":"Unbelievable, impossible--but true!

Years later he would learn that this tree was carved with symbols associated with the Knights of the Golden Circle, a Civil War-era secret society that had buried gold coins and other treasure in various remote locations across the South and Southwest in hopes of someday funding a second War Between the States. These secret caches were guarded by sentinels, men whose responsibility it was to watch and protect these sites. To his astonishment, Bob discovered that both his uncle and his great-uncle had been twentieth-century sentinels, and that he had grown up near an important KGC treasure site. In Shadow of the Sentinel, Bob Brewer and investigative journalist Warren Getler tell the fascinating story of the Knights of the Golden Circle and the hidden caches the KGC established across the country. Brewer reveals how, with agonizing effort, he eventually deciphered the fiendishly complicated KGC codes and ciphers, which drew heavily on images associated with Freemasonry. (Many of the key KGC post-Civil War leaders were Scottish Rite Masons, who used the cover of that secret fraternity to conduct their activities.) Using his knowledge of KGC symbolism to crack coded maps, Brewer has located several KGC caches and has recovered gold coins, guns, and other treasure from some of them. Shadow of the Sentinel is the most comprehensive account yet of the activities of the KGC after the Civil War and, indeed, into the 1900s. Getler and Brewer suggest that the clandestine network of KGC operatives was far wider than previously thought, and that it included Jesse James, the former Confederate guerrilla whose stage and bank robberies helped to fill KGC treasure chests. This is a rousing and provocative adventure that weaves together one man's personal quest with an intriguing, little-known chapter in America's hidden history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VZByj1_Xs8cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best Quick Breads: 150 Recipes for Muffins, Scones, Shortcakes, Gingerbreads, Cornbreads, Coffeecakes, and More","description":"Collects such quick and easy recipes as Santa Fe scones, vanilla Belgian waffles, and pumpkin gingerbread, and includes instructions for syrups, jams, and variations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kyQisa_z8X0C&dq=The+Best+Quick+Breads:+150+Recipes+for+Muffins,+Scones,+Shortcakes,+Gingerbreads,+Cornbreads,+Coffeecakes,+and+More&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mallworld","description":"Our solar system, locked in a force field and towed to an uninhabited parallel universe, occupies its time, when not trying to escape, at a shopping center the size of a planet","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M2SLJAAACAAJ&dq=Mallworld&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Earth (Isaac Asimovs 21st Century Library of the Universe, the Solar System)","description":"A description of Earth, the third planet from the sun, which includes information on its origins, composition, and unique characteristics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R9z6PQAACAAJ&dq=The+Earth+(Isaac+Asimovs+21st+Century+Library+of+the+Universe,+the+Solar+System)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Triumph of Allende: Chile's Legal Revolution","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rVA9AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Triumph+of+Allende:+Chile%27s+Legal+Revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"There Are 508 Stars In The Sky","description":"Jane and her cousin Madison go out one evening to count how many stars are in the sky.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3iE7AAAACAAJ&dq=There+Are+508+Stars+In+The+Sky&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"City of Coughing and Dead Radiators: Poems","description":"Espanda's poems range from his childhood in Brooklyn to Puerto Rico and the struggle of Latinos in the United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wpGfQgAACAAJ&dq=City+of+Coughing+and+Dead+Radiators:+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Desiree (Spanish Edition)","description":"When monsters Mike and Sully discover a little girl in Monstropolis, they must find a way to return her to her home in the human world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bn7Saa1AmkUC&dq=Desiree+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deconstruction and Pragmatism","description":"Deconstruction and pragmatism constitute two of the major intellectual influences on the contemporary theoretical scene; influences personified in the work of Jacques Derrida and Richard Rorty. Both Rortian pragmatism, which draws the consequences of post-war developments in Anglo-American philosophy, and Derridian deconstruction, which extends and troubles the phonomenological and Heideggerian influence on the Continental tradition, have hitherto generally been viewed as mutually exclusive philosophical language games. The purpose of this volume is to bring deconstruction and pragmatism into critical confrontation with one another through staging a debate between Derrida and Rorty, itself based on discussions that took place at the College International de Philosophie in Paris in 1993. The ground for this debate is layed out in introductory papers by Simon Critchley and Ernesto Laclau, and the remainder of the volume records Derrida's and Rorty's responses to each other's work. Chantal Mouffe gives an overview of the stakes of this debate in a helpful preface.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wp6IAgAAQBAJ&dq=Deconstruction+and+Pragmatism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emma (Radio Collection)","description":"From the New York Times bestselling author of The Girls comes an eagerly anticipated story collection exploring the dark corners of human experience. \\"A thrilling new voice in American fiction.\\"--Jennifer Egan, about The Girls An absentee father collects his son from boarding school after a shocking act of violence.

They want connection, but what they provoke is often closer to self-sabotage. What are the costs of one's choices? Of the moments when we act, or fail to act?

L. R. James. Raised in Fresno, California, Webb became an ardent Trotskyist while still a teenager. After moving to Los Angeles, she remained politically active and met James on his first US tour when he visited the city to speak. He fell in love instantly with her and established an epistolary relationship, offering advice and support during her two short-lived marriages, the launching of her modeling career, an ill-fated affair with a well-known actor, and her move to New York City in the early 40s. In New York, where she continued to model and act, she became a member of the inner circle of James's Johnson-Forest Tendency, and eventually James's wife. She also established an enduring friendship with novelist Richard Wright and championed his work. Despite a sometimes-rocky marriage, James and Webb had a son together, but when James finally left the United States for England (under threat of deportation), Webb did not accompany him. Webb offers a candid memoir of political, sexual, and social awakening at a pivotal time in twentieth-century America. Politically committed, she was nevertheless repelled by the misogyny and petty feuds that often marred the actions of the Left. She was able to earn her living by using her beauty, but she was compelled to live a double life because of the virulent racism that surrounded her working days. Through James, before their marriage, she became a close friend of Wright, Ralph Ellison, Chester Himes, and James Baldwin. Webb provides vivid, first-hand portraits of the radical left, the African-American literary scene, and especially, the intimate daily life and thoughts of C. L. R. James.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ltvgliX4Qw4C&dq=Not+Without+Love:+Memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Man's Castle : Clarence Darrow in Defense of the American Dream","description":"In the tradition of \\"Praying for Sheetrock,\\" this account explores a forgotten chapter of American history and serves as a dramatic story of murder, mayhem, and the Klan.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=68_NwAEACAAJ&dq=One+Man%27s+Castle+:+Clarence+Darrow+in+Defense+of+the+American+Dream&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shapes to Cut: Hats and Vehicles (Shapes to Cut Books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U82FzQEACAAJ&dq=Shapes+to+Cut:+Hats+and+Vehicles+(Shapes+to+Cut+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Course of Lectures on Dramatic Art and Literature","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6CMwAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Love You, Ronnie: The Letters of Ronald Reagan to Nancy Reagan","description":"No matter what else was going on in his life or where he was traveling to make movies, at the White House, or sometimes just across the room Ronald Reagan wrote letters to Nancy Reagan, to express his love, thoughts, and feelings, and to stay in touch.

An eloquent and gripping first-hand account of the turbulent struggle for civil rights and the willingness and courage to change the course of history. Forty years ago, a teenaged boy named John Lewis stepped off a cotton farm in Alabama and into the epicenter of the struggle for civil rights in America. The ideals of nonviolence which guided that critical time of American history established him as one of the movement's most charismatic and courageous leaders. Lewis's leadership in the Nashville Movement a student-led effort to desegregate the city of Nashville using sit-in techniques based on the teachings of Gandhi established him as one of the movement's defining figures and set the tone for the major civil rights campaigns of the 1960s. During this decade, he was repeatedly a victim of violence and intimidation, but his singular belief in non-violent action, inspired by his mentor, Dr. Martin Luther King, was a defining characteristic of his leadership and vision. In 1986, he ran and won a congressional seat in Georgia, and remains in office to this day. Walking with the Wind is the story of an American hero. A boy from rural Alabama whose journey led him to Washington, and whose vision and perseverance changed a nation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mm58BgAAQBAJ&dq=Walking+With+the+Wind:+A+Memoir+of+the+Movement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sleeping Giant: An Illustrated History of Southern California's Inland Empire","description":"Sleeping Giant is a thoughtful and robust narrative of the inland region of Southern California's transition from a wild desert wilderness held together by nothing much more than Indians, sagebrush, and adobes, to the vibrant economic and industrial engine that it is today.

We have all been quoting Maslow for years and to now have such an excellent compilation of his seminal thoughts on management and organization comes like a timely gift from heaven. The values and principles he taught decades ago are even more relevant today.\\" -Stephen Covey, author, The Seven Habits of Highly Successful People. \\"Maslow's book is a readable, impressionistic masterpiece that extolled the virtues of collaborative, synergistic management decades ahead of its time. This edition reveals just how much the management thinkers of our day, including Peter Drucker, W. Edwards Deming, and Peter Senge, owe to Maslow, and how much, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, management can still learn from his insights.\\" -Andrea Gabor, author, The Man Who Discovered Quality. \\"Maslow's brilliant and humane perspectives are made easily accessible in this exceptional book. It's also quite humbling-why haven't we yet actualized the truths about human nature and the nature of work?\\" -Margaret J. Wheatley, author, Leadership and the New Science and A Simpler Way. \\"Maslow's profound concept of self-actualization could generate a Copernican Revolution of work and society, catapulting us out of what future generations will look back on as the dark ages of management.\\" -Jim Collins, coauthor, Built to Last. The pioneer behind the hierarchy of needs and the concept of self-actualization, Dr. Abraham Maslow was-and is-one of the world's most esteemed experts on human behavior and motivation. However, while perhaps most famous for his work in the area of humanistic psychology, his legacy of work encompasses much more, extending into the realms of business and management. Having explored and studied the relationship between human behavior and the work situation, Maslow translated the science of the mind into the art of management=an important interpretation first published in the far-sighted treatise, Eupsychian Management, and whose impact continues to be felt today. Now, this seminal work has been updated, primed to introduce new readers to-and reacquaint old admirers with-what some have called the renowned psychologist's best book. Bringing into perspective the lasting impact of Maslow's groundbreaking principles, Maslow on Management illustrates how they have withstood the test of time to become integral components of current management practices, such as continuous improvement, Theory X, and empowerment. Offering insight into using these and other tools to effectively tackle present-day business situations, from heightened competitiveness to globalization to emerging technologies, Maslow on Management covers a wealth of timeless topics, including: * Self-actualization-the freedom to effectuate one's own ideas, try things out, make decisions, and make mistakes * Synergy-what is beneficial for the individual is beneficial for everyone; individual success should not occur at the expense of others; align organizational goals with personal goals * Enlightened management policy-assume that all your people have the impulse to achieve; everyone prefers to be a prime mover rather than a passive helper; everyone wants to feel important, needed, useful, successful, and proud; there is no dominance-subordination hierarchy. To complement Dr. Maslow's original writings and to demonstrate how his forward-thinking ideas are being played out in today's business world, Maslow on Management features interviews with Perot Systems Chairman Mort Meyerson, Non-Linear Systems founder Andrew Kay, Esalen Institute founder Michael Murphy, and other prominent figures who provide incisive commentary on subjects ranging from creativity in business to leadership lessons for the digital age. Epitomizing the genius of its author and embodying his elegant ruminations, Maslow on Management is still as important as it was when it first appeared. A true classic, this is essential reading for all managers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=keNmCgAAQBAJ&dq=Eupsychian+Management&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mei veritas","description":"Visit the mind of an unprofessional Philosopher Culled from an online blog, whose content was compiled over months, the entries express the author's (often humorous) personal view on varying aspects of Philosophy/existence, and on Spirituality.

Full facsimile of the original edition and not reproduced with Optical Recognition software. The novel describes the problems of a family in which husband and wife are oppressed and frustrated by the roles that they are expected to play. Evangeline Knapp is the ideal housekeeper, while her husband Lester is a poet and a dreamer. Suddenly, through a nearly fatal accident, their roles are reversed; Lester is confined to home in a wheelchair and his wife must work to support the family. \\"This 1924 novel... deals in a seemingly contemporary with the issue of how a married couple can feel oppressed and frustrated by the roles they are expected to play and what happens when these roles are reversed.\\" -- Philadelphia Inquirer. \\"What if a husband likes to keep house and is good at it? What if a wife wants to have a job? In the early part of the 20th century, switching roles was an unthinkable solution, but the author uses the frame of a serious accident to set up the situation in this book. \\"The Home-Maker\\" is a great commentary on gender roles and Fisher is a keen observer of human nature, so the characters are wonderful. However, the real reason to read this book is something additional. It contains some of the very best writing I have ever seen on the unfolding of a child's character and the responsibility of a parent. The scenes with the children are charming and appealing, but they are also intensely insightful. Fisher had strong views on the need for children to grow up strong and independent, and she found few obligations more serious that than of parents who must carefully accord respect to their children, while nurturing their children's nature to the fullest. She makes her serious point in the framework of an irresistible tale of a loving father and mother who just happen to be miscast in their family roles. Don't miss this one if you want a great book about what children need from adults.

FINALIST: National Book Critics Circle s Award In Autobiography and John Leonard Prize For Best First Book ? PEN/Jean Stein Book Award ? Los Angeles Times Book Prize Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, Tara Westover was seventeen the first time she set foot in a classroom. Her family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education, and no one to intervene when one of Tara s older brothers became violent. When another brother got himself into college, Tara decided to try a new kind of life.

These stories in this Big Book of Fairy Tales are accompanied by a set of dazzling illustrations from a true master of the  Golden Age of Illustration   Charles Robinson (1870-1937). An active painter in his own right, and brother of the famous Thomas and William Heath Robinson, his illustrations still delight both young and old over a century later. Robinson started his illustrative career with 100 pen and ink drawings for A Child s Garden of Verses (1895). The book was an instant hit, and from that point onwards, Robinson continued to illustrate fairy tales and children s books  with his characteristic style of subtle line, combined with delicate watercolours. Pook Press celebrates the great  Golden Age of Illustration  in children s literature  a period of unparalleled excellence in book illustration from the 1880s to the 1930s.

Stars roam the Strip and decadence is always available at a price, but never are the stakes higher in Las Vegas than inside the ring. It's here where lives are shattered, and sometimes lost, in search of the glory and riches that come in the squared circle. This is Fight Town, a place where fame is only one big punch away and the high-rolling gamblers with their fat bankrolls look on to the next big win. Dahlberg tells the stories behind the fights. It was in Las Vegas where Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack were the stars in the showrooms, but fighters like Sonny Liston and a brash Cassius Clay were stars of the ring. The faces and places are all there, spread out over more than 200 pages. This is truly a tribute to both the city and the sport it loves.

Wild Heron, located just south of Savannah on the Little Ogeechee River, is the oldest plantation house still standing in Georgia. A one-and-a-half story farmhouse built in the style of a West India cottage, it is being restored to reflect the period of the early 1800s.Farther to the interior, in the area around Augusta, are such homes as Fruitlands, now the clubhouse of the Augusta national Golf Club; Meadow Garden; Ware's Folly; and Montrose, built in 1849 and one of the Loveliest Greek Revival houses in the area. Houses photographed along the Plantation Trail, from Athens to Macon, include the white-columned President's House, home since 1949 to the presidents of the University of Georgia; the Howell Cobb House, in Athens; Whitehall, in Covington; Glan Mary, in Sparta; and the Woodruff House, in Macon.Gleason devotes considerable attention to the homes of the western side of the state, from Chickamauga to Thomasville. The Gordon-Lee House, constructed in 1847, was headquarters fro the Union army during the battle of chickamauga. Other houses in this part of Georgia are valley View, which overlooks the Etowah River, west of Cartersville; the Archibald Howell House, near downtown Marietta; Lovejoy, in Clayton Country; The oaks, in the vicinity of LaGrange; and Greenwood and Pebble Hill, near Thomasville.In all, Gleason captures more than one hundred of Georgia's most beautiful antebellum homes, including many lesser-known houses. In addition to exterior photographs, Antebellum Homes of Georgia contains a number of interior views as well as aerial photographs that show the relationship between the houses and their environs: outbuildings, formal gardens, and recd clay fields that were once white with cotton. Captions provide brief histories of the houses and their owners as weel as notes on construction and outstanding architectural details.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VLCce56TE_wC&dq=Antebellum+Homes+of+Georgia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moses in the Twentieth Century: A Universal Primer","description":"Coffee Table Limited Edition of the Eternal Book of Psalms by King David;1,000 copies only;High quality paper;Elegant case.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-HjrP5wBHfkC&dq=Moses+in+the+Twentieth+Century:+A+Universal+Primer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lily Theater: A Novel of Modern China","description":"When her mother, a historian, is forced into a reeducation camp during the Cultural Revolution, an ailing Lian joins her in the prison, where she is given a remarkable educational opportunity by some of China's leading scholars, all prisoners of Mao's regime, in a novel that captures the harsh reality of life in Communist China.

Its content is organized around key grammatical themes that form the empirical base of research in generative grammar: nominal and verbal inflectional morphology, subject and object pronouns, complex structures involving movement (topicalizations, questions, relative clauses), and aspects of verb meaning that have consequences for syntax. The book argues that Universal Grammar constrains all instances of language acquisition and that there is a fundamental continuity between monolingual, bilingual, child and adult early grammatical systems. While stressing their similarities with respect to linguistic representations and processes, the book also considers important differences between these three acquisition situations with respect to the outcome of acquisition. It is also shown that many linguistic properties of Spanish are acquired earlier than in English and other languages. This book is a must read for those interested in the acquisition of Spanish from different theoretical perspectives as well as those working on the acquisition of other languages in different contexts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nIRgMn83Rr8C&dq=The+Acquisition+of+Spanish:+Morphosyntactic+development+in+monolingual+and+bilingual+L1+acquisition+and+adult+L2+acquisition+(Language+Acquisition+and+Language+Disorders)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Milarepa: Songs on the Spot","description":"High-quality trade paperback","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WC0AAAAACAAJ&dq=Milarepa:+Songs+on+the+Spot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mindful Conservatism: Re-thinking the Ideological and Educational Basis of an Ecologically Sustainable Future","description":"Mindful Conservatism examines how the misuse of our political vocabulary contributes to governmental, corporate, and educational policies that degrade the Earth's natural systems, and suggests ways to overcome this linguistic confusion to help recognize the fundamental connections between communities, sustainability, and the conservation of the world's diverse cultures.

It depicts the black soldiers of the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts Infantry marching alongside their young white commander, Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. When the philosopher William James dedicated the memorial in May 1897, he stirred the assembled crowd with these words: \\"There they march, warm-blooded champions of a better day for man. There on horseback among them, in the very habit as he lived, sits the blue-eyed child of fortune.\\" In this book Shaw speaks for himself with equal eloquence through nearly two hundred letters he wrote to his family and friends during the Civil War. The portrait that emerges is of a man more divided and complex--though no less heroic--than the Shaw depicted in the celebrated film Glory. The pampered son of wealthy Boston abolitionists, Shaw was no abolitionist himself, but he was among the first patriots to respond to Lincoln's call for troops after the attack on Fort Sumter. After Cedar Mountain and Antietam, Shaw knew the carnage of war firsthand. Describing nightfall on the Antietam battlefield, he wrote, \\"the crickets chirped, and the frogs croaked, just as if nothing unusual had happened all day long, and presently the stars came out bright, and we lay down among the dead, and slept soundly until daylight. There were twenty dead bodies within a rod of me.\\" When Federal war aims shifted from an emphasis on restoring the Union to the higher goal of emancipation for four million slaves, Shaw's mother pressured her son into accepting the command of the North's vanguard black regiment, the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts. A paternalist who never fully reconciled his own prejudices about black inferiority, Shaw assumed the command with great reluctance. Yet, as he trained his recruits in Readville, Massachusetts, during the early months of 1963, he came to respect their pluck and dedication. \\"There is not the least doubt,\\" he wrote his mother, \\"that we shall leave the state, with as good a regiment, as any that has marched.\\" Despite such expressions of confidence, Shaw in fact continued to worry about how well his troops would perform under fire. The ultimate test came in South Carolina in July 1863, when the Fifty-fourth led a brave but ill-fated charge on Fort Wagner, at the approach to Charleston Harbor. As Shaw waved his sword and urged his men forward, an enemy bullet felled him on the fort's parapet. A few hours later the Confederates dumped his body into a mass grave with the bodies of twenty of his men. Although the assault was a failure from a military standpoint, it proved the proposition to which Shaw had reluctantly dedicated himself when he took command of the Fifty-fourth: that black soldiers could indeed be fighting men. By year's end, sixty new black regiments were being organized. A previous selection of Shaw's correspondence was privately published by his family in 1864. For this volume, Russell Duncan has restored many passages omitted from the earlier edition and has provided detailed explanatory notes to the letters. In addition he has written a lengthy biographical essay that places the young colonel and his regiment in historical context.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6m5h0Ax6tr4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The history of Atlantis","description":"The History of Atlantis may, in the light of our present knowledge of Plato 's sunken island, appear as a somewhat presumptuous title for a work, the object of which is to present a general outline of what is known concerning Atlantean civilisation.

In its beautiful simplicity, this structure, along with the table of codons worked out in the following decade, had entranced us into believing that we can fully understand the information content of a DNA sequence, simply by treating it as text that is read in a linear fashion. While we have learned much based on this assumption, there is much we have missed. Far from a passive tape running through a reader, genomes contain information that appears in new forms which create regions with distinct behavior. Some are \\"gene rich\\", some mobile, some full of repeats and duplications, some sticking together across long evolutionary distances, some readily breaking apart in tumor cells. Even protein-coding regions can carry additional information, taking advantage of the flexible coding options provided by the degeneracy of the genetic code. The chapters in this volume touch on one or more of three interconnected themes; information can be implied, rather than explicit, in a genome; information can lead to focused and/or regulated changes in nucleotide sequences; information that affects the probability of distinct classes of mutation has implications for evolutionary theory.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TWgRDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pro Sports Car Racing in America 1958 - 1974 (Motorbooks Classics)","description":"Penske, Shelby, Hall, Gurney, Hill, Ginther, Reventlow, Miles, Cunningham, Krause -- these are the men who dominated sports car racing in North America at the start of the 1958 racing season.

When fighting breaks out between a husband and wife, the husband's typical reaction is to withdraw, either emotionally or physically. When he does, his wife often becomes more frustrated and angry, which in turn causes the husband to withdraw even more. The fighting escalates with each subsequent outbreak. But it doesn't have to. During her fifteen years of clinical and laboratory research, couples therapist Jamie Turndorf, Ph.D., has developed a proven program that breaks the conflict cycle for ninety percent of the couples who use it. She advises couples to start with a series of cool-down steps and to move on to resolution exercises that will allow them to address difficult issues and subjects in a nonadversarial manner. Filled with easy-to-follow advice and helpful anecdotes, Turndorf's book gives couples the advice they need to calm an emotional exchange before it becomes a fight.

In contrast to other parts of the world where conservation was introduced at a later date to remediate the effects of modernization, in Yemen the two processes have been more or less concurrent. This has resulted in a paradox: unlike many other countries in the Middle East that abandoned traditional construction practices long ago, in Yemen these practices have not died out. Builders and craftsmen still work in 'traditional' construction, and see themselves as caretakers of the old city. At the same time, social forms that shaped the built fabric persist in both the old city and the new districts. Yemenis, in effect, are not separated from their heritage by an historical divide. What does it mean to conserve in a place where the 'historic past' is, in some sense, still alive? How must international agencies and consultants readjust theory and practice as they interact with living representatives of this historic past? And what are the implications of the case of Sanaa for conservation in general? Building a World Heritage City addresses these questions and also fosters greater cultural understanding of a little known, but geopolitically important, part of the world that is often portrayed exclusively in terms of unrest and political turmoil.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AxSrCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Concrete Cowboy","description":"A street-smart tale about a displaced teen who learns to defend what's right-the Cowboy Way.

An unlikely pair, George and Lennie, two migrant workers in California during the Great Depression, grasp for their American Dream. They hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. For George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. When they land jobs on a ranch in the Salinas Valley, the fulfillment of their dream seems to be within their grasp. But even George cannot guard Lennie from the provocations, nor predict the consequences of Lennie's unswerving obedience to the things George taught him. Of Mice and Men represents an experiment in form, which Steinbeck described as  a kind of playable novel, written in a novel form but so scened and set that it can be played as it stands.  A rarity in American letters, it achieved remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films. This edition features an introduction by Susan Shillinglaw, one of today s leading Steinbeck scholars. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Even more shocking than the sexual acts themselves is the fact that they were caught on videotape. A Pandora's box of revelations, the tape triggers a chorus of voices -- those of the men, women, teenagers, and parents involved in the scandal -- that details the ways in which lives can be derailed or destroyed in one foolish moment. Writing with a pace and intensity surpassing even her own greatest work, Anita Shreve delivers in Testimony a gripping emotional drama with the impact of a thriller. No one more compellingly explores the dark impulses that sway the lives of seeming innocents, the needs and fears that drive ordinary men and women into intolerable dilemmas, and the ways in which our best intentions can lead to our worst transgressions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B1w_VXw3aOIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stained Glass Rain","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=03BkQgAACAAJ&dq=Stained+Glass+Rain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"England (Mod Wld Nat) (Modern World Nations)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Tg0caI1-EToC&dq=England+(Mod+Wld+Nat)+(Modern+World+Nations)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Portrait of Tradition: One Hundred Years of the Michigan Marching Band","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nALiAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Portrait+of+Tradition:+One+Hundred+Years+of+the+Michigan+Marching+Band&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"College Oral Communication 1: English for Academic Success (Bk. 1)","description":"The Oral Communication strand is dedicated to meeting the academic needs of students by teaching them how to comprehend the spoken English used by instructors and students in college classrooms.

The first one is purely algebraic. Its objective is the classification of quadratic forms over the field of rational numbers (Hasse-Minkowski theorem). It is achieved in Chapter IV. The first three chapters contain some preliminaries: quadratic reciprocity law, p-adic fields, Hilbert symbols. Chapter V applies the preceding results to integral quadratic forms of discriminant   I. These forms occur in various questions: modular functions, differential topology, finite groups. The second part (Chapters VI and VII) uses \\"analytic\\" methods (holomor phic functions). Chapter VI gives the proof of the \\"theorem on arithmetic progressions\\" due to Dirichlet; this theorem is used at a critical point in the first part (Chapter Ill, no. 2.2). Chapter VII deals with modular forms, and in particular, with theta functions. Some of the quadratic forms of Chapter V reappear here. The two parts correspond to lectures given in 1962 and 1964 to second year students at the Ecole Normale Superieure. A redaction of these lectures in the form of duplicated notes, was made by J.-J. Sansuc (Chapters I-IV) and J.-P. Ramis and G. Ruget (Chapters VI-VII).

Dr. Gary Habermas will address the questions surrounding the debate over the historical Jesus and show a significant number of historical facts about Jesus in secular and non-New Testament sources that prove that the Jesus of history is the same Jesus of the Christian faith. The author of EVIDENCE FOR THE HISTORICAL JESUS is Dr. Gary Habermas, author of the book, The Historical Jesus and about twenty other volumes. He received his Ph.D. from Michigan State University. Dr. Habermas is chairman of the Department of Philosophy at Liberty University.

A complex, intriguing, and important verbal entity, the proverb has been the subject of a vast number of opinions, studies, and analyses. To accommodate the assorted possible audiences, this volume outlines seven views of the proverb -- personal, formal, religious, literary, practical, cultural, and cognitive. Because the author's goal is to provide a scientific understanding of proverb comprehension and production, he draws largely on scholarship stemming from the formal, cultural, and cognitive views. The only book about proverbs that is written from the standpoint of cognitive science, cognitive psychology, and experimentalism, this text provides a larger, more interdisciplinary perspective on the proverb. It also gives a theoretically more integrated approach to proverb cognition. The conceptual base theory of proverb comprehension is extended via the \\"cognitive ideals hypothesis\\" so that the theory now addresses issues regarding the creation, production, and pragmatics of proverbs. This hypothesis also has strong implications for a taxonomy of proverbs, proverb comprehension, universal vs. culture-specific aspects of proverbs, and some structural aspects of proverbs. In general, the book extends the challenge of proverb cognition by using much of what cognitive science has to offer. In so doing, the proverb is compared to other forms of figurative language, which is then discussed within the larger rubric of intelligence and the inclination for using indirect modes of communication. Child developmental and brain substrates are also discussed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U8jORqznKfsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eric Dickerson's Secrets of Pro Power","description":"A training guide to building strength, speed and endurance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uyH5HAAACAAJ&dq=Eric+Dickerson%27s+Secrets+of+Pro+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Improvisational Design: Continuous, Responsive Digital Communication","description":"Traditional visual design expresses information in fixed forms, such as print or film, so the message can be stored or distributed.

Understanding political violence is a complex task, which involves a variety of operations, from examining the social macro-structures within which actors engage in violence, to investigating the motives and drives of individual perpetrators. This book focuses on the faculty of imagination and its role in facilitating our normative and critical engagement with political violence. It interrogates how the imagination can help us deal with past as well as ongoing instances of political violence. Several questions, which have thus far received too little attention from political theorists, motivate this project: Can certain forms of imagination  artistic, historical, philosophical  help us tackle the challenge of comprehending and responding to unprecedented forms of violence? What is the ethical and political value of artworks depicting human rights violations in the aftermath of conflicts? What about the use of thought experiments in justifying policy measures with regard to violence? What forms of political imagination can foster solidarity and catalyse political action? This book opens up a forum for an inclusive and reflexive debate on the role that the imagination can play in unpacking complex issues of political violence.

Though considered a financial failure, the 1964-65 World' s Fair was a Sixties flashpoint in areas from politics to pop culture, technology to urban planning, and civil rights to violent crime. In an epic narrative, the New York Times bestseller Tomorrow-Land shows the astonishing pivots taken by New York City, America, and the world during the Fair. It fetched Disney's empire from California and Michelangelo's La Pieta from Europe; and displayed flickers of innovation from Ford, GM, and NASA from undersea and outerspace colonies to personal computers. It housed the controversial work of Warhol (until Governor Rockefeller had it removed); and lured Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. Meanwhile, the Fair and its house band, Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians sat in the musical shadows of the Beatles and Bob Dylan, who changed rock-and-roll right there in Queens. And as Southern civil rights efforts turned deadly, and violent protests also occurred in and around the Fair, Harlem-based Malcolm X predicted a frightening future of inner-city racial conflict. World's Fairs have always been collisions of eras, cultures, nations, technologies, ideas, and art.

Except for moral and political issues that aroused in me a desire to speak out, I have done my utmost throughout my life, for the sake of my children and myself, to remain silent. . . . But now, in my seventieth year, I have decided to tell the story of my life as best I can, so that my children can separate the truth from the myths that others have created about me, as myths are created about everyone swept up in the turbulent and distorting maelstrom of celebrity in our culture.  To date there have been over a dozen books written about Marlon Brando, and almost all of them have been inaccurate, based on hearsay, sensationalist or prurient in tone. Now, at last, fifty years after his first appearance onstage in New York City, the actor has told his life story, with the help of Robert Lindsey. The result is an extraordinary book, at once funny, moving, absorbing, ribald, angry, self-deprecating and completely frank account of the career, both on-screen and off, of the greatest actor of our time. Anyone who has ever enjoyed a Brando film will relish this book.

They escorted convoys, chased submarines, picked up downed pilots, and led the landing craft to the invasion beaches, yet they received little credit and less glory. This book is a stirring tribute to their heroic efforts, written by a naval officer who served in the Abercrombie during the war and later became a best-selling author. First published in 1984, it has long been acclaimed for presenting a view of the navy as the sailors actually saw it--the joys and pains, the humor and gravity, the successes and defeats. Ed Stafford provides an authentic, day-by-day account of life on board DE343, from the Battle of Leyte Gulf and picket duty against kamikazes at Okinawa to the signing of the peace treaty in Tokyo Harbor. To create an accurate picture he consulted ship logs and after-action reports and interviewed members of the crew. Although the book focuses on events in a particular warship, it tells the story of every small ship and their valiant crews that rose to the challenge and fought with everything they had until the war was won.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5WVpdZt_e8wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Guiding Star","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yd8CAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Outworlder","description":"He wanders the stars in search of a home.

Before he knows it, he's back on his ship, alone with his accidental bride. Since neither of them speak the same language, he has no way to tell her that there's been a terrible mistake. And because of the deadly famine ravaging her home, there's no going back. She's entirely at his mercy, and that terrifies him more than anything. Jeremiah isn't ready to take responsibility for anyone. He's a star wanderer, roaming the Outworld frontier in search of his fortune. Someday he'll settle down, but for now, he just wants to drop the girl off at the next port and move on.

Contraction provides an explanation for their development from analytic forms by creating a paradigm of historical evolution that utilizes the formal and functional attributes of both the earlier and later forms. Triggered by a variety of different factors, Contraction guides the evolution of complex verb forms by using markedness relations to correlate their morphological, syntactic, and lexical dimensions. An original work in comparative Dravidian linguistics, Analysis to Synthesis provides etymologies for fifteen conjugations which have hitherto resisted explanation. All fifteen show the same general development, allowing us to extract a common historical pattern and clarify the reconstruction of Proto-Dravidian typology. Thanks to Contraction, the verb morphology and syntax of the protolanguage, as well as its lexical structure, are shown to exhibit a relatively analytic structure. Because it correlates general dimensions of linguistic structure, Contraction may readily be applied to languages beyond the Dravidian family. Detailed and closely argued, this study provides a model for the analysis of similar forms in other languages and language families.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LcqCAAAAIAAJ&dq=Analysis+to+Synthesis:+The+Development+of+Complex+Verb+Morphology+in+the+Dravidian+Languages&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rightly dividing the word of truth (2 Tim. 2:15): Being ten outline studies of the more important divisions of scripture","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p6R4qyhQGtgC&dq=Rightly+dividing+the+word+of+truth+(2+Tim.+2:15):+Being+ten+outline+studies+of+the+more+important+divisions+of+scripture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Da Capo Catalog of Classical Music Compositions","description":"Lists the titles, opus numbers, keys, and nicknames of the works of 132 major composers from Isaac Albeniz to Hugo Wolf","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KiYKAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Da+Capo+Catalog+of+Classical+Music+Compositions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The CRC's Guide to Coordinating Clinical Research","description":"This guidebook is filled with valuable information on the role and responsibilities of a clinical research coordinator (CRC) and explains the research process from the site and CRC perspective.

The first recipient of the Pritzker Prize and MoMA's founding architectural curator, Johnson made his mark as one of America's leading architects with his famous Glass House in New Caanan, CT, and his controversial AT&T Building in NYC, among many others in nearly every city in the country--but his most natural role was as a consummate power broker and shaper of public opinion. Johnson introduced European modernism--the sleek, glass-and-steel architecture that now dominates our cities--to America, and mentored generations of architects, designers, and artists to follow. He defined the era of \\"starchitecture\\" with its flamboyant buildings and celebrity designers who esteemed aesthetics and style above all other concerns. But Johnson was also a man of deep paradoxes: he was a Nazi sympathizer, a designer of synagogues, an enfant terrible into his old age, a populist, and a snob. His clients ranged from the Rockefellers to televangelists to Donald Trump. Award-winning architectural critic and biographer Mark Lamster's The Man in the Glass House lifts the veil on Johnson's controversial and endlessly contradictory life to tell the story of a charming yet deeply flawed man. A rollercoaster tale of the perils of wealth, privilege, and ambition, this book probes the dynamics of American culture that made him so powerful, and tells the story of the built environment in modern America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i4pgDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Spy Two Eyes: Numbers in Art","description":"Uses the subjects of well-known paintings to introduce the numbers from one to twenty.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w5zf5mjLrAIC&dq=I+Spy+Two+Eyes:+Numbers+in+Art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wounded Healer","description":"A hope-filled and profoundly simple book that speaks directly to those who want to be of service in their church or community, but have found the traditional ways often threatening and ineffective. In this book, Henri Nouwen combines creative case studies of ministry with stories from diverse cultures and religious traditions in preparing a new model for ministry. Weaving keen cultural analysis with his psychological and religious insights, Nouwen has come up with a balanced and creative theology of service that begins with the realization of fundamental woundedness in human nature. Emphasizing that which is in humanity common to both minister and believer, this woundedness can serve as a source of strength and healing when counseling others. Nouwen proceeds to develop his approach to ministry with an analysis of sufferings a suffering world, a suffering generation, a suffering person, and a suffering minister. It is his contention that ministers are called to recognize the sufferings of their time in their own hearts and make that recognition the starting point of their service. For Nouwen, ministers must be willing to go beyond their professional role and leave themselves open as fellow human beings with the same wounds and suffering in the image of Christ. In other words, we heal from our own wounds. Filled with examples from everyday experience, The Wounded Healer is a thoughtful and insightful guide that will be welcomed by anyone engaged in the service of others.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6bC6AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LIFE OF JOSEPH SMITH The Prophet","description":"Sermons and writings of Joseph Smith, the Prophet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q4zqk3Mslx8C&dq=LIFE+OF+JOSEPH+SMITH+The+Prophet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ezekiel Option (Political Thrillers Option #3)","description":"New York Times best-selling author Joel Rosenberg brings readers this thrilling new novel.

Odom was part of the U.S. Embassy team that responded to the Goma refugee crisis. He witnessed the deaths of 70,000 refugees in a single week. In the previous three months of escalating violence, the Rwandan genocide had claimed 800,000 dead. Now, in this vivid and unsettling new book, Odom offers the first insider look at these devastating events before, during, and after the genocide. Odom draws on his years of experience as a Defense Attach  and foreign area specialist in the United States Army to offer a complete picture of the situation in Zaire and Rwanda, focusing on two U.S. embassies, intelligence operations, U.N. peacekeeping efforts, and regional reactions. His team attempted to slow the death by cholera of refugees in Goma, guiding in a U.S. Joint Task Force and Operation Support Hope and remaining until the United States withdrew its forces forty days later. After U.S. forces departed, Odom crossed into Rwanda to spend the next eighteen months reestablishing the embassy, working with the Rwandan government, and creating the U.S.-Rwandan Demining office. Odom assisted the U.S. Ambassador and served as the principal military advisor on Rwanda to the U.S. Department of Defense and National Security Council throughout his time in Rwanda. His book candidly reveals Odom s frustration with Washington as his predictions that a larger war was coming were ignored. Unfortunately, he was proven correct: the current death toll in that unfortunate country is close to three million. Odom s account of the events in Rwanda illustrate not only illustrate how failures in intelligence and policy happen, but also show that a human context is necessary to comprehend these political decisions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-s_qxmy_UDkC&dq=Journey+into+Darkness:+Genocide+in+Rwanda+(Williams-Ford+Texas+A&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Component-Based Software Engineering: Putting the Pieces Together","description":"Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) is the way to produce software fast.

She was seventeen when her father was appointed to the Irish Legation in Washington DC, where he was Irish Minister throughout World War II. Maeve worked writing fashion copy at Harper's Bazaar until 1949, when William Shawn invited her to join the New Yorker. Tiny, impeccably groomed, and devastatingly witty, in William Maxwell's words, 'to be around her was to see style being invented'. She wrote important fiction, criticism and Talk of the Town pieces for the New Yorker magazine throughout its most influential period in the 1950s and '60s, focusing on memory, migration and identity; her material, and women's lives. As this richly researched and wide-ranging book makes clear, Maeve Brennan's effect on the people who met her, her eye for human behaviour, clothing and domestic settings, her unsparing reading of literature, her memory of home and her courageous life as a woman alone in metropolitan America make her an icon of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bEhaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Maeve+Brennan:+Homesick+At+The+New+Yorker&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Children of The Law of One & The Lost Teachings of Atlantis","description":"This is the account of an American teenager who discovered a monastery in Tibet that was the inspiration for the legend of Shangri La.

Hard to believe, but interestingly, the sub-tropical region amongst the Himalayas that he describes finding, was later documented by explorers from National Geographic, then 'covered up' (there is still evidence of this). Also interesting is that the author was apparently mentioned in the Edgar Cayce readings (the famous American psychic whose books have sold millions of copies), as someone who would one day bring an important message to the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iEXJrq3q5HEC&dq=The+Children+of+The+Law+of+One&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Towards a Rogue Reality (Studies in Modern European History)","description":"Arthur Schopenhauer articulated a rogue reality that contrasts with the intelligible (aristocratic) reality defined by Kant as the -thing in itself- and the quantifiable (bourgeois) reality embodied in the notion of energy.

Sheridan Germann, an acclaimed scholar and practitioner in the field of harpsichord decoration, offers the first comprehensive illustrated conspectus of thesubject. In Part I Ms. Germann tells us that the styles of the decoration of harpsichords (and spinets, virginals and clavichords) tended to follow contemporary furniture fashions, but usually lagged conservatively behind the prevailing fashions. Because, unlike most furniture, the instruments are often dated, they provide rare documentation of how long these styles remained in common use. This survey follows chronologically the five major regional traditions of keyboard instrument decoration-Italian, Flemish, French, German and English-but with emphasis on the international changes in taste on which each region produced its own variations.In Part II, Richard Rephann of the Yale Musical Instrument Collection describes his research into the uniquely experimental construction of the 1770 Pascal Taskin harpsichord. This essay forms a pendant to William Dowd's in Vol. I that treats the surviving instruments of the Blanchet-Taskin workshop up to 1770. The romantic provenance of the 1770 Taskin, concocted by the antique trade to enhance the instrument's market value, is revealed as a fable.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-B8gT5Muw5AC&dq=The+Historical+Harpsichord&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Approaches to God (World perspectives)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iAMnzQEACAAJ&dq=Approaches+to+God+(World+perspectives)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Random House Book of Fairy Tales","description":"A lush treasury of 19 fairy tales that generations of children have grown up on, lushly illustrated by Diane Goode.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N5hFHVmvv2UC&dq=The+Random+House+Book+of+Fairy+Tales&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat","description":"George, J., Harris and Montmorency, the dog, are the best of friends.

Zeuschner focuses on the key concepts and presumptions of 13 major philosophers from around the world. He utilizes a systematic approach in his writing that describes the basic components of each system and discusses how each has maintained its appeal for so many centuries. In this text, Western tradition is represented by major classical figures: Socrates and Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, St. Augustine, Aquinas, Butler, Hume, Kant, and Mill. Eastern ethical tradition is represented by Indian Buddhist ethics, Chinese Confucian ethics, and Chinese Taoist ethics of Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzu. This work broadens a student's perspective and enriches one's understanding of ethical principles as they occur and have developed historically in different cultural contexts. Robert Zeuschner teaches Philosophy at Pasadena City College. He received his Ph.D. in Asian and Comparative Philosophy from the University of Hawaii at Manoa and has taught at Occidental College, University of California, University of Southern California, and several Hawaiian institutions. He has published translations of Chinese Buddhist texts and numerous articles in philosophical journals. Dr. Zeuschner also has many interests, including collecting rare books and art, playing acoustic guitar, and studying Zen gardens.

In this definitive biography, Virginia Spencer Carr has captured Bowles in his many guises: gifted composer, expatriate novelist, and gay icon, to name only a few. Born in New York in 1910, Bowles' brilliance was evident from early childhood. His first artistic interest was music, which he studied with the composer Aaron Copland. Bowles wrote scores for films and countless plays, including pieces by Tennessee Williams and Orson Welles. Over the course of his life, his intellectual pursuits led him around the world. He cultivated a circle of artistic friends that included Gertrude Stein, W.H. Auden, Gore Vidal, Truman Capote, Allen Ginsburg, William Burroughs, Stephen Spender, and Carson McCullers. Just as fascinating for his flamboyant personality as for his literary success, Bowles' leftist politics and experimentation with drugs make him an ever-controversial character. Carr delves into Bowles' unconventional marriage to Jane Auer and his self-exile in Morocco. Close friends with him before his death in 1999, Carr's first-hand knowledge of Bowles is undeniable. This book encompasses her personal experiences plus ten years of research and interviews with some two hundred of Bowles' acquaintances. Virginia Spencer Carr has written a riveting biography that tells not only the story of Paul Bowles' literary genius, but also of a crucial period of redefinition in American culture. Carr is simultaneously entertaining and precise, delivering a wealth of information on one of the most mythologized figures of mid-century literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eN8URnGh_oAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lindisfarne: The Cradle Island","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WXQ9AAAAIAAJ&dq=Lindisfarne:+The+Cradle+Island&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chef Chu's Distinctive Cuisine of China","description":"Explains how to prepare Hunan, Szechuan, Mandarin, and Cantonese dishes, from appetizers to desserts, and discusses cutting and cooking techniques, utensils, ingredients, and diet information","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7to7cTLHMzYC&dq=Chef+Chu%27s+Distinctive+Cuisine+of+China&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The great forest","description":"The very ancient Eastern forest of North America is characterized by an extraordinary variety of plants, animals, and human communities.

Codevilla illustrates that as people shape their governments, they shape themselves. Drawing broadly from the depths of history, from the Roman republic to de Tocqueville's America, as well as from personal and scholarly observations of the world in the twentieth century, The Character of Nations reveals remarkable truths about the effects of government on a society's economic arrangements, moral order, sense of family life, and ability to defend itself. Codevilla argues that in present-day America, government has had a profound negative effect on societal norms. It has taught people to seek prosperity through connections with political power; it has fostered the atrophy of civic responsibility; it has waged a Kulturkampf against family and religion; and it has dug a dangerous chasm between those who serve in the military and those who send it in harm's way. Informative and provocative, The Character of Nations shows how the political decisions we make have higher stakes than simply who wins elections.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wBkz-XyZGRQC&dq=The+Character+Of+Nations:+How+Politics+Makes+And+Breaks+Prosperity,+Family,+And+Civility&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spectrum Math, Grade 4","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"First Day in an Actor's Life: A Comedy Based on the Life of Charles Laughton","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0t04AAAACAAJ&dq=First+Day+in+an+Actor%27s+Life:+A+Comedy+Based+on+the+Life+of+Charles+Laughton&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cult Movies in Sixty Seconds: The Best Movies in the World in Less than a Minute","description":"Ever wanted to know more about the cult films that \\"everyone else\\" hasatched?

Each 12-week study leads participants through one book of the Bible and is made up of four basic components: (1) Reflection questions designed to help readers engage the text at a deeper level; (2)  Gospel Glimpses  highlighting the gospel of grace throughout the book; (3)  Whole-Bible Connections  showing how any given passage connects to the Bible s overarching story of redemption culminating in Christ; and (4)  Theological Soundings  identifying how historic orthodox doctrines are taught or reinforced throughout Scripture. With contributions from a wide array of influential pastors and church leaders, these gospel-centered studies will help Christians see and cherish the message of God s grace on each and every page of the Bible. Pastor Drew Hunter helps readers understand and apply the challenging words of the prophet Isaiah in this 12-week study. Isaiah s prophecy, which alternates between promises of judgment and restoration, reminds God s people of the magnitude of humanity s sin, the judgment that we all deserve, and how God displays his glory by saving sinners. Throughout the study, Hunter continually shows how Isaiah s promise of cosmic renewal ultimately anticipates the work of Jesus Christ, the servant-king whose death would result in new life for all who trust in him.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4EdfZe2A9lgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Moon Witch","description":"The essential text and classic study of Neo-Paganism Since its original publication, Drawing Down the Moon continues to be the only detailed history of the burgeoning but still widely misunderstood Neo- Pagan subculture.

Unlike any earlier films, Godard's work shifts fluidly from fiction to documentary, from criticism to art. The man himself also projects shifting images cultural hero, fierce loner, shrewd businessman. Hailed by filmmakers as a if not the key influence on cinema, Godard has entered the modern canon, a figure as mysterious as he is indispensable. In Everything Is Cinema, critic Richard Brody has amassed hundreds of interviews to demystify the elusive director and his work. Paying as much attention to Godard's technical inventions as to the political forces of the postwar world, Brody traces an arc from the director's early critical writing, through his popular success with Breathless, to the grand vision of his later years. He vividly depicts Godard's wealthy conservative family, his fluid politics, and his tumultuous dealings with women and fellow New Wave filmmakers. Everything Is Cinema confirms Godard's greatness and shows decisively that his films have left their mark on screens everywhere.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HD1KAipFwQ4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Healing the Wounds of Emotional Abuse","description":"Examines the prevalence and psychological damage associated with emotional abuse, counseling readers on how to overcome the past while rebuilding a self-image, and including in the new edition coverage of such areas as how to manage an abuser and achieve spiritual healing.

Based on the notes from Spencer's 1986 series of ten lectures, this new edition contains an additional lecture: The Janson inequalities. These inequalities allow accurate approximation of extremely small probabilities. A new algorithmic approach to the Lovasz Local Lemma, attributed to Jozsef Beck, has been added to Lecture 8, as well. Throughout the monograph, Spencer retains the informal style of his original lecture notes and emphasizes the methodology, shunning the more technical \\"best possible\\" results in favor of clearer exposition. The book is not encyclopedic--it contains only those examples that clearly display the methodology. The probabilistic method is a powerful tool in graph theory, combinatorics, and theoretical computer science. It allows one to prove the existence of objects with certain properties (e.g., colorings) by showing that an appropriately defined random object has positive probability of having those properties.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HTxo3kP7_5gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Criminalistics (Lab Manual)","description":"The Criminalistics Laboratory Manual: The Basics of Forensic Investigation provides students with little to no prior knowledge of forensic science with a practical crime scene processing experience.

The 73 Republican freshmen who entered the House of Representatives after the 1994 election were a well-organized group with majority status and a commitment to change. This book examines the extent to which they were successful in redirecting policy and reforming the institutions of representative government--and the extent to which those same institutions moderated, and even frustrated, efforts to introduce radical, rapid--indeed revolutionary--change. Contrasts are drawn both with the role of the Republican freshmen in the Senate and with the power of the President as manifested in the 1995-96 budget battle. The book is based on interviews conducted by the author when he was an APSA Congressional Fellow in the offices of Rep. George P. Radanovich, president of the freshman Republican class, and Sen. Thad Cochran, chairman of the Senate Republican Conference.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gTVgaIHHgfMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hardtack and coffee,: The Unwritten Story of Army Life (The Lakeside Classics)","description":"Annotation: First published more than 100 years ago, Hard Tack And Coffee is John Billings? absorbing first-person account of the everyday life of a U.S. Army soldier during the Civil War.

Adrian Goldsworthy explores the influence of the Roman army's organization on its behaviour during a campaign, emphasizing its great flexibility in comparison to most of its opponents. He considers the factors determining the result of a conflict and proposes, contrary to orthodox opinion, that the Roman army was able to adapt successfully to any type of warfare. Following the technique pioneered by John Keegan in The Face of Battle (1976), Dr Goldsworthy builds up a precise picture of what happened during battle: tactics employed, weaponry, leadership, behaviour of individuals as well as groups of soldiers, and, of utmost importance, morale.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=55KE-nNtTRUC&dq=The+Roman+Army+at+War:+100+Bc-Ad+200+(Oxford+Classical+Monographs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Strange Career of Jim Crow","description":"Presents a discussion of the development of the Southern social movement called \\"Jim Crowism\\" and segregation in post-Reconstruction United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u6Eirru04cgC&dq=The+Strange+Career+of+Jim+Crow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"P.B.

He reinvented himself as a world-leading technologist and director of research. All through his adult life, his outer life was on a parallel and sometimes divergent course to his inner spiritual search under the guidance of P.D. Ouspensky and G.I. Gurdjieff. After his career in the coal industry came to an abrupt end in his sixth decade, he entered the path of a single-minded seeker. For fifteen years, he travelled widely, seeking knowledge and sharing knowledge. Although he began a written account of his ideas in 1940, it was only in the last four years of his life that he declared his willingness to teach and worked intensively with large groups of students at his International Academy for Continuous Education. Subsequent history has revealed over end over that Bennett was ahead of his time, and that he developed and presented a vision of the next stage of evolution of humanity in the Synergic Epoch.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pw2BswEACAAJ&dq=Witness:+The+Story+of+a+Search&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Head Hunters of the Amazon: My Adventures in the Jungle, 1894-1901","description":"One of the all-time greatest adventure books.

An Age-Old Secret Conspiracy. . . Now the Truth Is Revealed. . . . Marco Valoni, chief of Italy s Art Crimes Department, is convinced that a fire in the Cathedral of Turin that leaves a strangely mutilated, unidentifiable body on the scene was no accident. It is only the last in a long line of mishaps, going back over a hundred years, that have occurred in the church  which happens to be home to what millions of the faithful believe is that authentic burial shroud of Jesus Christ. Valoni and his crack team of specialists embark on an investigation that soon leads them into dangerous territory, territory controlled by some of the most powerful men in the world. Not only do they discover evidence of a secret Christian sect that traces its priests to the very disciples of Jesus himself, but also that the Knights Templar  supposedly destroyed forever when Philip the Fair of France watched their last Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, burn at the stake in 1314  may not have disappeared at all, and may indeed be very much alive and active in the 21st century. Julia Navarro skillfully weaves the Italians  thrilling present-day investigation with the spine-tingling history of the Holy Shroud itself, and with a chilling tale of ancient rivals, equally devoted to the relic, and equally willing to sacrifice anything  perhaps even their immortal soulsto possess it. From communities of the Middle East founded by Jesus himself, to medieval Byzantium, to the highest councils of the Vatican and the boardrooms that run the world today, The Brotherhood of the Holy Shroud is a provocative page-turner of the highest order  one that will challenge you to believe. \\"The screams of the tortured men echoed within the thick walls of the dungeons. How many days had passed since they were arrested? The Templars had lost count. . . . A man, his face concealed by a hood, watched the suffering of the knights from the shadows, these knights who had once wielded their swords and risked their very lives to defend the Cross. Reveling in their torment, sick with avarice and cruelty, Philippe signaled the torturers to go on . Broken and bloodied, Jacques de Molay could hardly see, but he sensed who it was beneath the hood. A smile came to the Grand Master s lips when the king demanded that he confess where he had hidden the holy shroud of Jesus. At last Philippe saw that it was futile to continue. De Molay would not yield . Fire began to burn the Templars  ravaged flesh. Jacques de Molay s eyes remained fixed on Philippe, and before him and the people of Paris the Grand Master proclaimed his innocence and called down divine justice on the king of France and Pope Clement, summoning them to stand with him before the judgment of God within the year. A shiver ran down Philippe s spine as de Molay s words rang out. No, God could not be on the side of these Templars, these heretics. He, Philippe, king of France, was obeying the laws of the Church. But was he obeying the laws of God?\\"  From The Brotherhood of the Holy Shroud","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s-hhJf3U3BoC&dq=The+Brotherhood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Health Is the Foundation of Success","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qpk2X7NornoC&dq=Health+Is+the+Foundation+of+Success&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Name Is Morgan","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-16VQAAACAAJ&dq=My+Name+Is+Morgan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Captain Underpants and the Attack of the Talking Toilets","description":"Not so long ago, George and Harold created the greatest super-hero in the history of their school, and brought him to life by mistake.

This luminous new edition continues on that important tradition while seamlessly weaving in modern touches, making it all the more indispensable for generations to come.   Samin Nosrat, author of Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat In the nearly ninety years since Irma S.

John and Megan developed more than six hundred new recipes for this edition, tested and tweaked thousands of classic recipes, and updated every section of every chapter to reflect the latest ingredients and techniques available to today s home cooks.

You will find tried-and-true favorites like Banana Bread Cockaigne, Chocolate Chip Cookies, and Southern Corn Bread all retested and faithfully improved as well as new favorites like Chana Masala, Beef Rendang, Megan s Seeded Olive Oil Granola, and Smoked Pork Shoulder.

New techniques include low-temperature and sous vide cooking, fermentation, and cooking with both traditional and electric pressure cookers. Barbecuing, smoking, and other outdoor cooking methods are covered in even greater detail. This new edition of Joy is the perfect combination of classic recipes, new dishes, and indispensable reference information for today s home cooks.

In July 1993, a scientific event made front-page news: the discovery that genetics plays a significant role in determining homosexuality. In The Science of Desire, Dean Hamer the scientist behind the groundbreaking study tells the inside story of how the discovery was made and what it means, not only for our understanding of sexuality, but for human behavior in general. In this accessible and remarkably clear book, Dean Hamer expands on the account of his history-making research to explore the scientific, social, and ethical issues raised by his findings. Dr. Hamer addresses such tough questions as whether it would be possible or ethical to test in utero for the gay gene; whether genetic manipulation could or should be used to alter a person's sexuality; and how a gay gene could have survived evolution.

Betrayal. Forgiveness. Redemption. Real families aren t always the ones you know about . that s the tagline for the first book in Mary Campisi s bestselling Truth in Lies series, A Family Affair. But this book and the others in this series are about so much more than a secret family. Set in the small town of Magdalena, New York, the people have big hearts and good intentions at least most of them do! Magdalena is a place of family, forgiveness, redemption, and second chances. And hope. Lots of hope. This town, and the people in it are about helping others get through the tough times and broken dreams, and doing it with the help of family, friends, sometimes even strangers. A Family Affair When Christine Blacksworth s larger-than-life father is killed on an icy road in Magdalena, New York, a hundred miles from the  getaway  cabin he visited every month, she discovers a secret that threatens everything she s always held to be true. Her father has another family which includes a mistress and a daughter. Determined to uncover the truth behind her father s secret life, Christine heads to Magdalena, prepared to hate the people who have caused her to question everything she thought she knew about her father. But what she finds is a woman who understands her, a half-sister who cherishes her, and a man who could love her if she ll let him. The longer she s around them, the more she questions which family is the real one. . . A Family Affair: Spring Harry Blacksworth is rich, handsome, the ultimate playboy with a killer smile and a clever wit. He s fought it, denied it, ignored it, but the damn truth won t go away: He s fallen in love. And just when he s accepted that fact, Greta Servensen, the only woman he s ever trusted, breaks his heart. Christine Blacksworth and Nate Desantro beat the odds when they fell in love and married. But staying married is threatened when the foundation behind every good relationship trust is challenged. Angelo  Pop  Benito is The Godfather of Magdalena. Nothing happens in that town without his knowledge or approval. And Pop doesn t do anything without a long sit-down with his dead wife, Lucy, and a half dozen pizzelles by his side. He ll need a lot of lung power and a tray of his favorite treat to help Nate and Christine out of a real mess. And he may need the help of his checkers buddy and Magdalena s shining star, Lily Desantro. A Family Affair: Summer Eight years ago, tragedy struck the town s perfect couple, Daniel  Cash  Casherdon and Tess Carrick, days before their wedding. That tragedy shredded their dreams of a life together and sent them fleeing Magdalena. Now, destiny has brought them back and the town is determined to see this couple mend their differences. Angelo  Pop  Benito will lead the crusade to march Cash and Tess down the aisle with the help of The Bleeding Hearts Society, a garden group more interested in healing people s hearts than helping a sick basil plant. But they re not the only ones cheering for this couple s second chance. Who would have thought Nate Desantro would be giving advice on relationships, love, and marriage? But when a man finds the right woman, anything is possible. Add a baby to the mix; well, that s pure  hero  material.

Thus are we introduced to Jason Arnold, occasional writer, bon vivant, and acerbic observer of life on Martha's Vineyard - the exclusive preserve of the rich, the privileged, and the famous. And few of the island's denizens are more determinedly rich, privileged, and famous than Millie Silk. Famous most of all for her acid tongue and general mean-spiritedness, Millie is about to publish her most extravagant no-holds-barred celebrity expose ever. But the presses may never roll once she is murdered at her own party, in plain sight of nearly two dozen witnesses. All the island - enemies and admirers alike - is aghast. Rounding up the suspects is easy; the killer must have been present at the party, and every last one of the guests seems to have had an excellent motive. But as the police begin to investigate, the most likely suspects also begin to die, one by one, and all by cyanide.

But for any of us who scratch that surface, we recognize anxiety, shame, disappointment, and regret. And yet, in the depths of these feelings, in the things we hate about ourselves, others, and this world, we can invite God's presence. This is the essence of holy vulnerability. To enter into holy vulnerability is to intentionally expose our raw wounds so that God can heal and mend and transform us. What happens when we refuse this depth of healing? Something that author Kellye Fabian calls \\"unholy leakage\\"--that thing that happens when we are afraid, ashamed, or anxious, and instead of facing the reality of what we're experiencing, we just spill it on everyone around us. Where is anxiety occupying our hearts and minds? Where is fear hindering our relationships and limiting our faith and joy? Where is shame causing us to question our self-worth? Is there another way? Yes. Holy Vulnerability unpacks six atypical, unexpected spiritual practices intended to open us to God's healing and transformation. Through practices like laughter, community, and tangible engagement with creation, Kellye guides us to notice where brokenness is breaking into our lives. And as we intentionally seek God in the midst of these practices--as we step out in holy vulnerability--God will meet us there.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oAspEAAAQBAJ&dq=Holy+Vulnerability&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion","description":"The role of women in Roman culture and society was a paradoxical one. On the one hand they enjoyed social, material and financial independence and on the other hand they were denied basic constitutional rights. Roman history is not short of powerful female figures, such as Agrippina and Livia, yet their power stemmed from their associations with great men and was not officially recognised. Ariadne Staples' book examines how women in Rome were perceived both by themselves and by men through women's participation in Roman religion, as Roman religious ritual provided the single public arena where women played a significant formal role. From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins argues that the ritual roles played out by women were vital in defining them sexually and that these sexually defined categories spilled over into other aspects of Roman culture, including political activity. Ariadne Staples provides an arresting and original analysis of the role of women in Roman society, which challenges traditionally held views and provokes further questions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cCqmzwXnHhcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mammoth Book of Nostradamus and Other Prophets: A Complete Guide to Prophets and Prophecies from Babylon to the Present Day and Beyond (Mammoth Books)","description":"Explores the predictions of such seers as Nostradamus, John Dee, Mother Shipton, Edgar Cayce, and Wolf Messing while exploring the predictive powers of the I Ching, the tarot, palmistry, and other oracles","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TAS-HAAACAAJ&dq=The+Mammoth+Book+of+Nostradamus+and+Other+Prophets:+A+Complete+Guide+to+Prophets+and+Prophecies+from+Babylon+to+the+Present+Day+and+Beyond+(Mammoth+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poor Mouth, The - A Bad Story About the Hard Life","description":"\\"O'Brien was one of the comic geniuses of the 20th century . . .

Dostoevsky s original idea for the novel centered on the Marmeladov family and the impact of alcoholism in Russia, but inspired by a double murder in France he decided to rework it around the new character of Raskolnikov. The novel was first serialized in The Russian Messenger over the course of 1866, where it was an instant success. It was published in a single volume in 1867.

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) adopted the story of the wandering conjuror who accepts Mephistopheles's offer of a pact, selling his soul for the devil's greater knowledge; over a period of 60 years he produced one of the greatest dramatic and poetic masterpieces of European literature. David Luke's recent translation, specially commissioned for The World's Classics series, has all the virtues of previous classic translations of Faust, and none of their shortcomings. Cast in rhymed verse, following the original, it preserves the essence of Goethe's meaning without sacrifice to archaism or over-modern idiom. It is as near an \`equivalent' rendering of the German as has been achieved. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe.

This definitive edition of The Black Book, including for the first time materials omitted from previous editions, is a major addition to the literature on the Holocaust. It will be of particular interest to students, teachers, and scholars of the Holocaust and those interested in the history of Europe. By the end of 1942, 1.4 million Jews had been killed by the Einsatzgruppen that followed the German army eastward; by the end of the war, nearly two million had been murdered in Russia and Eastern Europe. Of the six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust, about one-third fell in the territories of the USSR. The single most important text documenting that slaughter is The Black Book, compiled by two renowned Russian authors Ilya Ehrenburg and Vasily Grossman. Until now, The Black Book was only available in English in truncated editions. Because of its profound significance, this new and definitive English translation of The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry is a major literary and intellectual event. From the time of the outbreak of the war, Ehrenburg and Grossman collected the eyewitness testimonies that went into The Black Book. As early as 1943 they were planning its publication; the first edition appeared in 1944. During the years immediately after the war, Grossman assisted Ehrenburg in compiling additional materials for a second edition, which appeared in 1946 (in English as well as Russian).

When B rylune says that it is wrong for the rich not to share their cakes with Tyltyl and Mytyl, the boy corrects her. It is enough that he gets to watch others  happiness; their joy does not create envy in him. The theme is emphasized again when the children meet the Luxuries, particularly the biggest one of all, the Luxury of Being Rich. When Tyltyl turns the diamond, the hall is bathed with a dazzling brightness, and the Luxuries run wildly in search of a dark corner where they may hide their ugliness from the ethereal light. At the end of the play, Tyltyl shows what he has learned about happiness. He looks out the window at the forest and remarks how beautiful it is. The inside of the house looks much lovelier to him than it did before.

But as Douglas L. Wilson shows us in Honor's Voice, Lincoln's transformation was not one long triumphal march, but a process that was more than once seriously derailed. There were times, in his journey from storekeeper and mill operator to lawyer and member of the Illinois state legislature, when Lincoln lost his nerve and self-confidence - on at least two occasions he became so despondent as to appear suicidal - and when his acute emotional vulnerabilities were exposed. Focusing on the crucial years between 1831 and 1842, Wilson's skillful analysis of the testimonies and writings of Lincoln's contemporaries reveals the individual behind the legends. We see Lincoln as a boy: not the dutiful son studying by firelight, but the stubborn rebel determined to make something of himself. We see him as a young man: not the ascendant statesman, but the canny local politician who was renowned for his talents in wrestling and storytelling (as well as for his extensive store of off-color jokes). Wilson also reconstructs Lincoln's frequently anguished personal life: his religious skepticism, recurrent bouts of depression, and difficult relationships with women - from Ann Rutledge to Mary Owens to Mary Todd. Meticulously researched and well written, this is a fascinating book that makes us reexamine our ideas about one of the icons of American history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KCM50uZMsQMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Auto Repair For Dummies","description":"Auto Repair For Dummies, 2nd Edition (9781119543619) was previously published as Auto Repair For Dummies, 2nd Edition (9780764599026).

Drawing upon original journals and reports, Morgan builds Puget?s Sound around individuals, interweaving portraits of well-known historical figures with those who are more obscure but have a special significance: a colorful parade of saloonkeepers, politicians, union organizers, schemers, and swindlers. Morgan begins his account with the landing of Captain Vancouver in Puget Sound in 1792 and ends with the founding of Fort Lewis in 1916, the year the author was born. Between are the arrival of the transcontinental railroad, the boom-and-bust of lumber mills, the anti-Chinese riots of 1885, and more unique Northwest history that will intrigue both new arrivals and longtime residents. With a new introduction by historian and historic preservationist Michael Sean Sullivan, this redesigned edition of Puget?s Sound brings new life to Morgan?s landmark history of the South Sound and the early days of Tacoma.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ye9zDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emotional Anatomy: The Structure of Experience","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A5dOAAAAYAAJ&dq=Emotional+Anatomy:+The+Structure+of+Experience&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Multiplicity and Becoming: The Pluralist Empiricism of Gilles Deleuze","description":"In this book Patrick Hayden provides an original and exceptionally clear interpretation of the work of the increasingly important French philosopher Gilles Deleuze. \\"Multiplicity and Becoming\\" argues that one of the most crucial yet overlooked aspects of Deleuze's thought is his conception of a radical empiricism of dynamic and creative difference. Hayden examines all of Deleuze's major works from the perspective of this compelling vision of empiricism.

It was early Spanish explorers who named a part of this territory ?Texas,? borrowing the Caddo word for ?friend.? Today there are approximately thirty-five hundred Caddos, most of whom live in Oklahoma. Their original language, which is related to the Plains languages?Pawnee, Arikara, Kitsai, and Wichita?is rapidly dying and is spoken only by a diminishing number of Caddo elders. Drawing on interviews with Caddo speakers, tapes made by earlier researchers, and written accounts, Lynette R. Melnar provides the first full-length overview and analysis of Caddo grammar. Because Caddo is an extremely complex language, Melnar?s clear description will be important to linguists in general as well as to those specializing in Native languages.

Willie Ottogary's letters have the distinction of being firsthand reports of an Indian community's ongoing social life by a community member and leader. The Northwestern Shoshone residing at the Washakie colony in northern Utah descended from survivors of the Bear River Massacre. Most had converted to the Mormon Church and remained in northern Utah rather than moving to a federal Indian reservation. For over twenty years, local newspapers in Utah and southern Idaho regularly published letters from Ottogary reporting happenings-personal milestones and health crises, comings and goings, social events, economic conditions and activities, efforts at political redress-at Washakie and other Shoshone communities in the intermountain West. Matthew Kreitzer compiled and edited the letters of Ottogary and added historical commentary and appendices, biographical data on individuals Ottogary mentioned, and eighty-five rare historical photographs. Written in a vernacular English and printed unedited in the newspapers, the letters describe a society in cultural transition and present Ottogary's distinctively Shoshone point of view on anything affecting his people. Thus, they provide an unusual picture of Shoshone life through a critical period, a time when many Indian communities reached a historical nadir. While the letters unflinchingly report the many difficulties and challenges the Shoshone faced, they portray a vital and dynamic society, whose members led full lives and actively pursued their own interests. Ottogary lobbied constantly for Shoshone rights, forging alliances with Shoshone throughout the region, visiting Washington D.C., advocating legislation, and participating in Goshute-Western Shoshone draft resistance during World War I.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8dx1AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Washakie+Letters+of+Willie+Ottogary:+Northwestern+Shoshone+Journalist+and+Leader,+1906-1929&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biography - Singer, Israel Joshua (1893-1944): An article from: Contemporary Authors","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X73iAAAAMAAJ&dq=Biography+-+Singer,+Israel+Joshua+(1893-1944):+An+article+from:+Contemporary+Authors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creepy-Crawly Birthday (Bunnicula and Friends)","description":"When Toby Monroe has a birthday party, his pets' curiosity is aroused by seven strange suitcases which they investigate, with surprising consequences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qYIsx7L2CMAC&dq=Creepy-Crawly+Birthday+(Bunnicula+and+Friends)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Habsburg Monarchy 1618-1815 (New Approaches to European History)","description":"This is a revised and updated edition of an acclaimed introduction to the Habsburg monarchy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ncgq08FZYlQC&dq=The+Habsburg+Monarchy+1618-1815+(New+Approaches+to+European+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Herbs for the Soul: Emotional Healing with Chinese and Western Herbs and Bach Flower Remedies","description":"Before the advent of the modern pharmaceutical industry, mankind relied for thousands of years on medicinal plants and herbs to cure its ills.

For many of us, physics has always been a thing of mystery and complexity. K. C. Cole, an award-winning science writer, specializes in making its wonders accessible to the everyday reader. This book uses lively prose, metaphors, and anecdotes to allow us to comprehend the nuances of physics: gravity and light, color and shape, quarks and quasars, particles and stars, force and strength. It also shows us how the physical world is so deeply intertwined with the ways we think about culture, poetry, and philosophy, and explores the workings of such legendary scientific minds as Richard Feynman, Victor Weisskopf, brothers Frank Oppenheimer and J. Robert Oppenheimer, Philip Morrison, Vera Kistiakowsky, and Stephen Jay Gould.  An exemplary science writer . . . For readers without scientific background, Cole gracefully introduces relativity, quantum theory, optics, astrophysics, and other significant disciplines, never getting bogged down in unnecessary explanation. Thus, you may not learn all about thermodynamics from reading her chapter on it, but you will learn enough to think seriously about the entropy in your own life. Cole sprinkles her text with comments from famous scientists  Space is blue, and birds fly in it,  said Heisenberg, and Faraday said,  Nothing is too wonderful to be true  that are not only delightful in themselves but perfectly suited to her own text.

On June 4, 1942, one of the most powerful figures of the Nazi regime died in agony from wounds sustained during an assassination attempt in Prague. This is the story of the killing of Reinhard Heydrich, a man of extraordinary intelligence, ruthlessness, and ambition who had risen from obscurity to become head of the Nazi security police and Governor of Bohemia-Moravia. Regarded by many as Hitler s most likely successor, he was feared and hated even by other high-ranking Nazi officials. Heydrich s death caused shockwaves throughout the Nazi leadership, provoking ferocious reprisals against Czechs and Jews. Those who carried out the assassination were hunted down, and, trapped like rats in the cellar of a Prague church, they committed suicide rather than face the certainty of torture and execution at the hands of the S.S. Based on original archive material, interviews with surviving members of the Special Operations Executive who trained the Czech assassins in the United Kingdom, and Czech military intelligence, Callum MacDonald s book is a well-researched and gripping account of one of the most audacious assassinations of the Second World War.  Aided by previously unpublished files of the British Foreign Office, English author MacDonald provides the most complete account yet of the assassination of Heydrich.

The text deals with a selected number of the clearer issues that arise in analyzing a limited set of English constructions, and it is restricted to a \\"classical\\" framework.

How can we influence the outcome? This action-oriented book identifies the key issues, explores the evidence, and suggests some answers. Avoiding both utopianism and despair, the book presents the voices of technology enthusiasts and skeptics, as well as social activists. The book is organized into three parts. Part I examines the issues in their socio-technical, economic, and historical contexts. Part II--the core of the book--proposes five initiatives for using computers and electronic communications to benefit low-income urban communities: - to provide access to the new technologies in ways that enable low-income people to become active producers rather than passive users;- to use the new technologies to improve the dialogue between public agencies and low-income neighborhoods;- to help low-income youth to exploit the entrepreneurial potential of information technologies;- to develop approaches to education that take advantage of the educational capabilities of the computer;- to promote the community computer: applications of computers and communications technology that foster community development. Part III presents a synthesis of the various topics. Its main questions are, What are the prospects and problems of initiatives to enable the poor to benefit from the new technologies? and What federal, state, and municipal policies would enhance the prospects for success?

The author challenges Sir James Frazer's thesis that the vegetation god Adonis-- whose premature death was mourned by women and whose resurrection marked a joyous occasion--represented the annual cycle of growth and decay in agriculture. Using the analytic tools of structuralism, Detienne shows instead that the festivals of Adonis depict a seductive but impotent and fruitless deity--whose physical ineptitude led to his death in a boar hunt, after which his body was found in a lettuce patch. Contrasting the festivals of Adonis with the solemn ones dedicated to Demeter, the goddess of grain, he reveals the former as a parody and negation of the institution of marriage. Detienne considers the short-lived gardens that Athenian women planted in mockery for Adonis's festival, and explores the function of such vegetal matter as spices, mint, myrrh, cereal, and wet plants in religious practice and in a wide selection of myths. His inquiry exposes, among many things, attitudes toward sexual activities ranging from \\"perverse\\" acts to marital relations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4r0-EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Distant Trumpet (Paperback Library)","description":"Tells of a company of U.S. cavalry in Arizona in the 1880s, and their part in the wars against the Chiricahua Apaches.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GVLvKkV_xY0C&dq=A+Distant+Trumpet+(Paperback+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oedipus at Colonus","description":"Three tragedies recount the downfall of Oedipus, his death in exile, and the actions by his daughter Antigone following his death.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q2CfLfseBzsC&dq=Oedipus+at+Colonus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gifts of Love: New Hymns for Today's Worship","description":"This text-only collection contains 45 contemporary hymns on a wide variety of topics, including biblical stories, the church, the seasons and special occasions in the church year.

They feel like frauds and imposters, and Lynch's real-girl's voice will be instantly recognizable to them. Lynch will walk and talk new moms through it all: from lamenting the hot dogs and second-hand smoke they were raised on (and, of course, \\"you turned out just fine\\") to the realization that kids are kind of germy and gross (but feeling that way doesn't make one a bad mother) to keeping it together at work with Cheerios in the old nursing bra.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B3UUjoLhnPEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Julian Grenfell","description":"A biography of the First World War poet Julian Grenfell.

His reacquaintance with Venice, a city he loved, provided the inspiration for Across the River and into the Trees, the story of Richard Cantwell, a war-ravaged American colonel stationed in Italy at the close of the Second World War, and his love for a young Italian countess. A poignant, bittersweet homage to love that overpowers reason, to the resilience of the human spirit, and to the worldweary beauty and majesty of Venice, Across the River and into the Trees stands as Hemingway's statement of defiance in response to the great dehumanizing atrocities of the Second World War. Hemingway's last full-length novel published in his lifetime, it moved John O'Hara in The New York Times Book Review to call him  the most important author since Shakespeare.

Recognized today as the founder of modern art history and as one of the key thinkers of the nineteenth century, Burckhardt changed not only the way we think about the Renaissance in relation to European and world history, but the value placed on art as a tool for understanding historical developments. The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy begins with a section on the historical events which sparked the Renaissance, focusing especially on the frequent military conflicts which marred the era as well as on the constant political upheavals undergone by such Italian regions and cities as Rome, Venice, and Florence. Burckhardt then moves to a philosophical discussion of the development of individuality in Italian culture, arguing that the political circumstances of those living in the Republics enabled such thinkers as Dante and Petrarch to create art that corresponded with that newfound sense of individuality. The third section discusses one of the key elements of Renaissance culture: the revival of interest in the cultural products of the ancient world, especially Greece and Rome. Part four focuses on the prominence of discovery in Renaissance culture, for which Burckhardt looks to the colonial expedition of Columbus, the growth of the natural sciences, and the achievements of such poets and writers as Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio in discovering new ways to describe humanity and the human spirit. In the fifth section, the importance of societal customs and festivals is discussed, and in the sixth and final part, Burckhardt observes the profound shifts undergone by religion and morality in Italy at the time. The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy is a thorough, dynamic work of art history that not only changed the study of history at universities around the world, but elevated the status of art in understanding the process of cultural change. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of Jacob Burckhardt s The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy is a classic of European art history reimagined for modern readers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mhQ-EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Painted Field: Poems","description":"In these forty-two poems, Robin Robertson demonstrates an astonishing range of style and concerns, in a voice that is utterly original.

He shows now, during the years of colonization, especially in the century from 1660 to 1760, many ideas and institutions were transferred virtually unchanged from Britain, while, simultaneously, others were being transformed in the New World environment. As he unravels the tangled origins of our  bittersweet  culture, Mr. Kammen makes us see that unresolved contradictions in the American experience have functioned as the prime characteristic of our national style. Puritanical and hedonistic, idealistic and materialistic, peace-loving and war-mongering, isolationist and interventionist, consensus-minded and conflict-prone these opposing strands go back to the roots of our history. He pursues them down through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries from the traumas of colonization and settlement through the tensions of the American Revolution making clear both the relevance of this early experience to ninetieth and twentieth-century realities and the way in which America  dualisms have endured and accumulated to produced such dilemmas as today s poverty amidst abundance and legitimized lawlessness. Far from being a study in social pathology, People of Paradox is a depiction of a complex society and am explanations of its development a bold interpretation that gives an entirely new perceptive to the American ethos.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vxIZL1ZTSQAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Mathematical Methods for Business and Economics","description":"Confused by the math of business and economics?

Yet we know little about the conversational engine that drives our everyday lives. We are pushed and pulled around by language far more than we realize, yet are seduced by stereotypes and myths about communication. This book will change the way you think about talk. It will explain the big pay-offs to understanding conversation scientifically. Elizabeth Stokoe, a social psychologist, has spent over twenty years collecting and analysing real conversations across settings as varied as first dates, crisis negotiation, sales encounters and medical communication. This book describes some of the findings of her own research, and that of other conversation analysts around the world. Through numerous examples from real interactions between friends, partners, colleagues, police officers, mediators, doctors and many others, you will learn that some of what you think you know about talk is wrong. But you will also uncover fresh insights about how to have better conversations - using the evidence from fifty years of research about the science of talk.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=odFbDwAAQBAJ&dq=Talk&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Four Plays: The Bald Soprano; The Lesson; Jack, or the Submission; The Chairs","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=piLuAAAAMAAJ&dq=Four+Plays:+The+Bald+Soprano%3B+The+Lesson%3B+Jack,+or+the+Submission%3B+The+Chairs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cutest Pets of 2005","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EZaJAAAACAAJ&dq=Cutest+Pets+of+2005&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zen Paths to Harmony","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3lL6zgEACAAJ&dq=Zen+Paths+to+Harmony&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spirituality Simplified","description":"\\"Spirituality Simplified\\" is an easy-to-understand overview of basic spiritual principles, supported by passages from the works of many respected spiritual teachers.

Yet shared social systems, firmly grounded in religious beliefs, provide the cohesive force that unites over a billion people of different backgrounds. Hinduism is the main religion of India, and this new dictionary provides an unrivaled insight to all aspects of Hindu life, past and present. Some thousand illustrated entries elucidate the history of Hinduism, its mythology, art, architecture, religion, laws, and folklore. The development of Hinduism is presented from its ancient manifestations in local cults and epic poems to modern-day festivals and customs worldwide. The complex relationship between the multitude of gods, goddesses, and semi-divine beings is brought to light in the articles on religion and mythology, while its rich imagery is revealed in the entries on architecture, sculpture, painting, dance, and theater, including works of art illustrated here for the first time. Food and etiquette, the caste system, Ayurvedic medicine, love and marriage, and contemporary practices are just a few of the topics explored. Maps and entries on the major cities and places of pilgrimage in India, as well as a concise chronology and a list of principal dynasties, provide a clear overview of the geography, history, languages, and vibrant religious and cultural traditions of Hinduism.

Euphemism for Hedonism","description":"Intercourse is a book that moves through the sexed world of dominance and submission. It moves in descending circles, not in a straight line, and as in a vortex each spiral goes down deeper. Its formal model is Dante's Inferno; its lyrical debt is to Rimbaud; the equality it envisions is rooted in the dreams of women, silent generations, pioneer voices, lone rebels, and masses who agitated, demanded, cried out, broke laws, and even begged. The begging was a substitute for retaliatory violence: doing bodily harm back to those who use or injure you. I want women to be done with begging. The public censure of women as if we are rabid because we speak without apology about the world in which we live is a strategy of threat that usually works. Men often react to women's words - speaking and writing - as if they were acts of violence; sometimes men react to women's words with violence. So we lower our voices. Women whisper. Women apologize. Women shut up. Women trivialize what we know. Women shrink. Women pull back. Most women have experienced enough dominance from men - control, violence, insult, contempt - that no threat seems empty. Intercourse does not say, forgive me and love me. It does not say, I forgive you, I love you. For a woman writer to thrive (or, arguably, to survive) in these current hard times, forgiveness and love must be subtext. No. I say no. Intercourse is search and assertion, passion and fury; and its form - no less than its content - deserves critical scrutiny and respect.---- PREFACE","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l61tffRhufAC&dq=When+The+She-Wolf+Wore+Lamb%27s+Clothing/Feminism%3F+Euphemism+for+Hedonism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miss Billings Treads the Boards (Signet Regency Romance)","description":"An impoverished vicar's daughter desperate to escape a lecherous employer, Katherine Billings is asked by a handsome marquess, Lord Henry Grayson, to join him in masquerading as his wife.

One filled with convictions, another with loss, the third with a worldly pragmatism, they traverse an air-conditioned landscape eccentric with signs and portents from the preservation of the living dead in a nursing home to the presentation of the dead as living in a wildlife museum accompanied by restless, confounded adults. A father lusts after his handsome gardener even as he's haunted (literally) by his dead wife; a heartbroken dog runs afoul of an angry neighbor; a young stroke victim drifts westward, his luck running from worse to awful; a sickly musician for whom Alice develops an attraction is drawn instead toward darker imaginings and solutions; and an aging big-game hunter finds spiritual renewal through his infatuation with an eight-year-old the formidable Emily Bliss Pickless. With nature thoroughly routed and the ambiguities of existence on full display, life and death continue in directions both invisible and apparent. Gloriously funny and wonderfully serious, The Quick and the Dead limns the vagaries of love, the thirst for meaning, and the peculiar paths by which all creatures are led to their destiny.

This is the first book to reflect on an increasingly visible new form of sexualised gay masculinity, and the first monograph to move debates on condomless sex amongst gay men beyond discourses of HIV and/or AIDS. It contributes to existing critical histories of sexuality, pornography and other sex media at a crucial juncture in the history of gay male sex cultures and the HIV epidemic. The book draws from fieldwork, interviews, archival research, visual analysis, philosophy, queer theory, and cultural studies, using empirical, critical, and speculative methodologies to better think gay \\"pig\\" masculinities across their material, affective, ethical and political dimensions, in a future-oriented, politically-inflected, reflection on what queer bodies may become. Spanning historical context to empirical and theoretical study, Bareback Porn, Porous Masculinities, Queer Futures will be of key interest to academics and students in sexuality studies, film, media, visual culture, cultural studies, and porn studies concerned with masculinities, sex and sexualities and their circulation across an array of media.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Dw_2DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jesus and Mary: Finding Our Secret Center","description":"Wer bin ich?

Sallie Clayton would have been the same age as the fictional Scarlett O'Hara during the Civil War. Sallie Clayton's memoirs, however, are not a work of fiction but bittersweet reminiscences of growing up in a doomed city in the midst of losing a war. Although her memoirs provide invaluable detail on Civil War Atlanta, they also tell of her personal experiences on a plantation in Montgomery, Alabama, and in postwar Augusta and Athens. Sallie Clayton belonged to one of Georgia's wealthiest and most prominent families. Her memoirs are colored by the losses suffered by her family. Robert Davis's introduction to this work illustrates the background of the Claytons, Sallie's writings, and Civil War Atlanta, providing a balanced account of life at \\"the crossroads of the Confederacy.\\" The introduction also provides a corrective to the popular, Gone With the Wind view of Civil War Atlanta.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w5VoBeyKjD0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Approaching the Shadow","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IItiQgAACAAJ&dq=Approaching+the+Shadow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz","description":"A Philadelphia lad returns to Oz and joins forces with Jack Pumpkinhead to rescue Ozma and the Emerald City from conquest.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wQNbRAAACAAJ&dq=Jack+Pumpkinhead+of+Oz&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who Counts: The Politics of Census-Taking in Contemporary America","description":"One of Choice Magazine's Outstanding Academic Books of 2000 For those interested in understanding the historical and scientific context of the census adjustment controversy, Who Counts? is absolutely essential reading.  Science Ever since the founding fathers authorized a national headcount as the means of apportioning seats in the federal legislature, the decennial census has been a political battleground. Political power, and more recently the allocation of federal resources, depend directly upon who is counted and who is left out. Who Counts? is the story of the lawsuits, congressional hearings, and bureaucratic intrigues surrounding the 1990 census. These controversies formed largely around a single vexing question: should the method of conducting the census be modified in order to rectify the demonstrated undercount of poor urban minorities? But they also stemmed from a more general debate about the methods required to count an ever more diverse and mobile population of over two hundred million. The responses to these questions repeatedly pitted the innovations of statisticians and demographers against objections that their attempts to alter traditional methods may be flawed and even unconstitutional. Who Counts? offers a detailed review of the preparation, implementation, and aftermath of the last three censuses. It recounts the growing criticisms of innaccuracy and undercounting, and the work to develop new enumeration strategies. The party shifts that followed national elections played an increasingly important role in the politization of the census, as the Department of Commerce asserted growing authority over the scientific endeavors of the Census Bureau. At the same time, each decade saw more city and state governments and private groups bringing suit to challenge census methodology and results. Who Counts? tracks the legal course that began in 1988, when a coalition led by New York City first sued to institute new statistical procedures in response to an alleged undercount of urban inhabitants. The challenge of accurately classifying an increasingly mixed population further threatens the legitimacy of the census, and Who Counts? investigates the difficulties of gaining unambiguous measurements of race and ethnicity, and the proposal that the race question be eliminated in favor of ethnic origin. Who Counts? concludes with a discussion of the proposed census design for 2000, as well as the implications of population counts on the composition and size of Congress. This volume reveals in extraordinary detail the interplay of law, politics, and science that propel the ongoing census debate, a debate whose outcome will have a tremendous impact on the distribution of political power and economic resources among the nation's communities.

This fundamental fact has generally been overshadowed by popular and scholarly images of the plantation household as the source of slavery's redeeming qualities, where 'gentle' mistresses ministered to 'loyal' slaves. This book recounts a very different story. The very notion of a private sphere, as divorced from the immoral excesses of chattel slavery as from the amoral logic of market laws, functioned to conceal from public scrutiny the day-to-day struggles between enslaved women and their mistresses, subsumed within a logic of patriarchy. One of emancipation's unsung consequences was precisely the exposure to public view of the unbridgeable social distance between the women on whose labor the plantation household relied and the women who employed them. This is a story of race and gender, nation and citizenship, freedom and bondage in the nineteenth century South; a big abstract story that is composed of equally big personal stories.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oMunAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Poetics of Childhood (Children's Literature and Culture)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Wild Blue","description":"Stephen E. Ambrose, acclaimed author of Band of Brothers and Undaunted Courage, carries us along in the crowded and dangerous B-24s as their crews fought to destroy the German war machine during World War II. The young men who flew the B-24s over Germany in World War II fought against horrific odds, and, in The Wild Blue, Ambrose recounts their extraordinary heroism, skill, daring, and comradeship with vivid detail and affection. Ambrose describes how the Army Air Forces recruited, trained, and selected the elite few who would undertake the most demanding and dangerous jobs in the war. These are the boys turned pilots, bombardiers, navigators, and gunners of the B-24s who suffered over fifty percent casualties. With his remarkable gift for bringing alive the action and tension of combat, Ambrose carries us along in the crowded, uncomfortable, and dangerous B-24s as their crews fought to the death through thick black smoke and deadly flak to reach their targets and destroy the German war machine. Twenty-two-year-old George McGovern, who was to become a United States senator and a presidential candidate, flew thirty-five combat missions (all the Army would allow) and won the Distinguished Flying Cross. We meet him and his mates, his co-pilot killed in action, and crews of other planes. Many went down in flames. As Band of Brothers and Citizen Soldiers portrayed the bravery and ultimate victory of the American soldiers from Normandy on to Germany, The Wild Blue illustrates the enormous contribution that these young men of the Army Air Forces made to the Allied victory.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nJw-o7Rm988C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art and Reflections of Rupert Conrad","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B7f3xfxttwgC&dq=The+Art+and+Reflections+of+Rupert+Conrad&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harriet & Octavia","description":"Examines the life of the nineteenth-century author famous for the novel \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\\" which denounced slavery and intensified the disagreement between the North and South.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=egs4DwAAQBAJ&dq=Harriet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"50 Great Curries of India (Card Edition)","description":"Fifty authentic, traditional recipes from all the regions of India include Chicken and Cashew Curry from Bombay and Rogan Josh from Kashmir, and come with information on the basics of curry-making. 15,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TYCFJMLZ_-4C&dq=50+Great+Curries+of+India+(Card+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The counterpane fairy,","description":"The Counterpane Fairy is a children s story written and illustrated by Katherine Pyle.

During the course of the interview, which took place at Duke's Texan home, the telephone rang and Charlie left the room to answer it. When he returned, some twenty minutes later, he seemed visibly upset. It seemed that he'd just heard that, the previous day, one of his fellow moon walkers, the astronaut Pete Conrad, had died. The more Charlie spoke the more Andrew realised that his grief was something more than the mere fact of losing a friend. 'Now theres only nine of us,' he said. Only nine. Which meant that, one day not long from now, there would be none, and when that day came, no one on earth would have known the giddy thrill of gazing back at us from the surface of the moon. The thought shocked Andrew, and still does. Moondust is his attempt to understand why. The Apollo moon programme has been called the last optimistic act of the 20th Century. Over a strange three year period between 1969 and 1972, twelve men made the longest and most eccentric of all journeys, and all were indelibly marked by it. In Moondust Andrew sets out to interview all the remaining astronauts who walked on the moon, and to find out how their lives were changed for ever by what had happened. 'Where do you go after you've been to the moon?' In addition to this question that would prove hugely troubling to many of the returned astronauts, they also had to deal with the fantasies of faceless millions at their backs, for this was the first truly global media event. The walkers would forever be caught between the gravitational pull of the moon and the earth's collective dreaming.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cc0kUuYR6RcC&dq=Moondust+:+In+Search+of+the+Men+Who+Fell+to+Earth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Half of Paradise","description":"Meet Avery Broussard, the last in a line of once-substantial land owners whose weakness for alcohol lands him in prison; J.P.

For another group, including young vets, it meant a return to car building and racing. Money, exciting new cars, and speed parts all flowed freely in post-war America. Robert Petersen, a young SoCal-based photographer and Army Air Corps vet, noted the rapidly growing hot rod scene in and around Los Angeles. His first move was to organize the Los Angeles Hot Rod Exhibition in 1948. His second, and brilliant, move was to launch at the same event the first edition of Hot Rod magazine. From this launch pad, Petersen Publishing Company would grow to become the most influential enthusiast publisher in America. Petersen s magazines were rallying points for all aspects of the car, truck, and motorcycle hobbies, well as nurturing and promoting all aspects from car building to racing to show events.

As electronics spread through every type of aircraft, there is a rising need for technicians who understand \\"systems,\\" not circuits. Such knowledge is required to identify faulty units aboard the airplane, often during a quick turn time on the ramp. The book explains systems in simple terms, with over 400 full-color photos and drawings. The book assumes no knowledge of electronics, containing neither formulas nor schematics. It describes over 30 systems and how they relate to each other. Confusing acronyms and abbreviations are avoided; they're spelled out on every page. The book deals with two major trends. First, airlines are insisting that mechanics troubleshoot avionics on the flight line. It's becoming too costly for airlines to staff outlying line stations with \\"radio mechanics.\\" Many carriers already require all maintenance people to obtain an FCC license and cross-training in avionics is growing. The second trend is the disappearing \\"avionics bench technician.\\" When today's computerized avionics go bad, they're sent back to the factory because shops can't afford large automatic test stations and software to repair them. The demand today is for people skilled in \\"R&R\\" (remove and replace)---which requires systems-level knowledge. The scope of \\"Avionics Training\\" includes all legacy systems---VOR, ILS and ADF, for example---because they will continue to fly for decades. The book also covers the new generation now entering flight decks; satellite navigation, data communications and electronic flight instruments (EFIS). Weather detection, collision avoidance (TCAS) and Mode S transponders are also covered. Much of the book is devoted to hands-on guidance on how to install instruments, wiring harnesses, radio trays, connectors, antennas and other practical topics related to systems. A final section describes test and troubleshooting techniques. Besides the technician, \\"Avionics Training\\" should prove of interest to the engineer and executive wanting a broader knowledge of avionics industry practices.

Seine Kriminal- und Abenteuerromane, dessen Themen er aus seinem abenteuerlichen Leben sch?pfte und verfremdet in ferne L?nder verlegte, spielen in der Arktis, auf den ?lfeldern Venezuelas, auf hoher See, im Himalaya, in den USA, Asien oder den Gro?st?dten Deutschlands und in D?nemark. Seinen Lebensweg kreuzten zahlreiche illustre und bekannte Personen, darunter der Afrika-Sachbuchautor Hermann Freyberg, unter dessen Namen er nach dem Ausschluss aus der Reichsschrifttumskammer  was praktisch ein Berufsverbot bedeutete  weitere Romane ver?ffentlichte. Rudolph ver?ffentlichte unter seinem Namen und den Pseudonymen Heinrich Weiler und Richard Erden. Silvester 1943 wurde der Autor verhaftet, weil er  trotz seiner unbeschwerten Literatur  w?hrend des zweiten Weltkriegs privat kein Blatt vor den Mund nahm. Dies kostete ihn letztendlich das Leben: Am 18. Juli 1944 stand er vor dem ?Volksgerichtshof\\" und wurde zum Tode verurteilt. Am 30.

It must not stand as a foreign factor in our life, but it must be the passion that breathes throughout our whole existence.\\" The meditations reflect the blending of spiritual vigor with doctrinal loyalty so consistently expressed in the life of Abraham Kuyper. These are devotions with true substance, avoiding the extremes about which Kupyer adds a word of caution: \\"Stress in creedal confession, without drinking from the Living Fountain, runs dry in barren orthodoxy, just as truly as spiritual emotion, without clearness in confessional standards, makes one sink in the bog of sickly mysticism.\\" This treasure of inspiration is supplemented with a complete index of Scripture texts. ABRAHAM KUYPER (1837-1920) was Calvinist theologian and major political figure in recent Dutch history. Elected to parliament in 1874, he became Prime Minister in 1901 and served to that capacity until 1905. As a theologian, he revived a systematic, orthodox Calvinism. He founded the Free Reformed Church and the Free University of Amsterdam. His other works include Principles of Sacred Theology, Lectures on Calvinism, The Work of the Holy Spirit, and The Death of Resurrection of Christ.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2RvTAAAACAAJ&dq=To+be+near+unto+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mouse Makes Magic: Phonics Reader (Step-Into-Reading, Step 2)","description":"By changing their middle vowels, Mouse magically transforms words into totally new ones, in a magical beginning reader that emphasizes vowel substitution.

All was well until that day when they ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil and went scrambling for fig leaves to cover their bodies. Since then, lucrative businesses have arisen to provide many stylish ways to cover our nakedness, for the naked human body now evokes powerful and often contradictory ideas it thrills and revolts us, signifies innocence and sexual experience, and often marks the difference between nature and society. In A Brief History of Nakedness psychologist Philip Carr-Gomm traces our inescapable preoccupation with nudity. Rather than studying the history of the nude in art or detailing the ways in which the naked body has been denigrated in the media, A Brief History of Nakedness reveals the ways in which religious teachers, politicians, protesters, and cultural icons have used nudity to enlighten or empower themselves as well as entertain us. Among his many examples, Carr-Gomm discusses how advertisers and the media employ images of bare skin or even simply the word  naked  to garner our attention, how mystics have used nudity to get closer to God, and how political protesters have discovered that baring all is one of the most effective ways to gain publicity for their cause. Carr-Gomm investigates how this use of something as natural as nakedness actually gets under our skin and evokes complicated and complex emotional responses. From the naked sages of India to modern-day witches and Christian nudists, from Lady Godiva to Lady Gaga, A Brief History of Nakedness surveys the touching, sometimes tragic and often bizarre story of our relationships with our naked bodies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1rwBFAz-En0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nuevo Diccionario Cuyas De Appleton: Espanol-Ingles Ingles-Espanol/Thumb Indexed","description":"First multi-year cumulation covers six years: 1965-70.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MznVRJRVtsIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NERO Rule Book","description":"NERO RULE BOOK 9TH EDITION","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6nZKewAACAAJ&dq=NERO+Rule+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good News a Novel 1ST Edition Inscribed","description":"A new movement has replaced Project Mayhem, and even Tyler Durden doesn't know how to play by these rules.

According to N. J. Habraken, intimate and unceasing interaction between people and the forms they inhabit uniquely defines built environment. The Structure of the Ordinary, the culmination of decades of environmental observation and design research, is a recognition and analysis of everyday environment as the wellspring of urban design and formal architecture. The author's central argument is that built environment is universally organized by the Orders of Form, Place, and Understanding. These three fundamental, interwoven principles correspond roughly to physical, biological, and social domains. Historically, \\"ordinary\\" environment was the background against which architects built the \\"extraordinary.\\" Drawing upon extensive examples from archaeological and contemporary sites worldwide, the author illustrates profound recent shifts in the structure of everyday environment. One effect of these transformations, Habraken argues, has been the loss of implicit common understanding that previously enabled architects to formally enhance and innovate while still maintaining environmental coherence. Consequently, architects must now undertake a study of the ordinary as the fertile common ground in which form- and place-making are rooted. In focusing on built environment as an autonomous entity distinct from the societies and natural environments that jointly create it, this book lays the foundation for a new dialogue on methodology and pedagogy, in support of a more informed approach to professional intervention.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k7MrXW8er90C&dq=The+Structure+of+the+Ordinary:+Form+and+Control+in+the+Built+Environment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Behind the Moss Curtain: And Other Great Savannah Stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ho-rugAACAAJ&dq=Behind+the+Moss+Curtain:+And+Other+Great+Savannah+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ugly Duckling Sticker Storybook (Dover Little Activity Books)","description":"14 charming, full-color stickers help illustrate an easy-to-read book about the little duckling that just didn t seem to fit in anywhere.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dW6kPAAACAAJ&dq=Ugly+Duckling+Sticker+Storybook+(Dover+Little+Activity+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lassie Come Home","description":"Presents the classic tale about a prize collie's homeward journey after she is sold to a wealthy family because hard times befall her original owners.

The daughter of a Government official far from the capital, on the Silk River, she was, most unusually, brought up with her brothers whom she far outshone. Falling on evil times, her father sells her to the best Blue House on the Silk River. Hung Tu's poetry and calligraphy bring her great renown, and the story traces her rise from Flower-in-the-Mist to Official Hostess at the court of the governors of the Silk City, and her love affair with the poet Yuan Chen. Set against the backdrop of the scholars, poets, officials, and warring factions of ninth century China, this wonderful story reconstructs one of the great periods of China - turbulent, cruel, yet with a sense of beauty remarkable by any standards and in any age. Go Ask the River is a tale not only of historical China, but of the human struggle to discover how to be alive. 'Throughout runs the Taoist Philosophy - the Eight Signs of the Golden Flower, the meaning of Tao, the place of women in Oriental society. Hung Tu emerges as a vibrant figure, radiating a sense of beauty, balance, and well-being.' - Montreal Star 'The stylized sensuality of the world that Miss Eaton writes about is so clearly defined by the cool simplicity of her language that as we read this tale of ninth-century China we see that it all happened just as she tells it, and her characters are as real to us as though we read about them in the newspapers every day.' - The New Yorker 'A many-splendored trip through a rainbow world.' - Publishers Weekly","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PPeXZuRgnNIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species (Oxford World's Classics)","description":"'Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin' On topics ranging from intelligent design and climate change to the politics of gender and race, the evolutionary writings of Charles Darwin occupy a pivotal position in contemporary public debate. This volume brings together the key chapters of his most important and accessible books, including the Journal of Researches on the Beagle voyage (1845), the Origin of Species (1871), and the Descent of Man, along with the full text of his delightful autobiography. They are accompanied by generous selections of responses from Darwin's nineteenth-century readers from across the world. More than anything, they give a keen sense of the controversial nature of Darwin's ideas, and his position within Victorian debates about man's place in nature. The wide-ranging introduction by James A.

Janice Hudson, who's seen her share of death, ventures an assuring yes in this memoir about her years as a trauma nurse. In May 1987, newlywed intensive-care nurse Hudson was recruited to join a helicopter ambulance service and \\"fly out to accidents, scrape up the patients and try to get them to qualified care in that first 'golden hour, ' when they'd have the best chance for meaningful survival after traumatic injuries.\\" Hudson hits on the usual suspects: barroom brawls, failed suicide attempts, and grisly car wrecks. She also recounts what are likely to be some of the more unusual cases, including a call from a woman who insisted that her mountaintop home was being overrun by an army of mountain lions (which turned out to be a single housecat, amplified thanks to the caller's diet of alcohol and crystal meth). Death is a constant in her pages, but so is Hudson's belief that something interesting awaits us afterward, as a few of her eerie anecdotes attest. -Amazon","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u4xYAAAAYAAJ&dq=Trauma+Junkie:+Memoirs+of+an+Emergency+Flight+Nurse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Breaking Out: A Woman's Guide to Coping with Acne at Any Age","description":"An essential and comprehensive guide to acne for women of all ages Acne is no longer just a teenage affliction.

God has put these pictures in the Bible to reveal his character. By examining them, we discover who God is and why he s worth knowing better. And we discover something else: who he wants us to be. He wants us to copy his picture into our own character. Wild Truth Bible Lessons--Pictures of God 2 is a guide to 12 God-pictures taken straight from the Photo Album. They are active Bible lessons for junior high and middle school Sunday school classes or youth group meetings, each one based on one of the 50 pictures of God and presented energetically, relevantly, and scripturally in the companion student book Wild Truth Journal: Pictures of God. The lessons are loaded with off-the-wall and easy-to-do discussion starters, video ideas, scripts, games with a point. And, of course, Bible passages and studies that springboard junior highers from the abstract into the concrete as (open Bibles in hand) they explore the nature of God in a lively, relevant way, and then begin practicing in their own lives the traits of God.Here s how the lessons are organized: * Picture Prep grabs your group s attention to prepare them for what s ahead.* Action Shot takes your students into the Bible to catch God in the act of revealing his character.* Self-Portrait explores the given aspect of God s character...how it makes God just that much more awesome...and why it s a very good trait for us to have, too.* Print It! challenges your students to print God s picture into their own lives by living out his character in an immediately practical way.12 lessons","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nk1wO8PZg4sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Something Old Something New","description":"Beloved bestselling author Beverly Jenkins introduced readers to the delightful town of Henry Adams and its unforgettable residents in Bring on the Blessings and returned for another visit in A Second Helping.

Less than three years later he is dead, driven to suicide by isolation and despair. A fate befitting a murderer, perhaps, but what if he were innocent? Thirty years on, Jonathan Hughes, an anthropologist specializing in social stereotyping, comes across the case by accident. He finds alarming disparities in the evidence and has little doubt that Stamp's conviction was a terrible miscarriage of justice. But how far is Hughes prepared to go in the search for justice?

Smith in 1903, \\"I take this opportunity of writing to ask you if I can get my endowments and also finish the work I have begun for my dead.... Your sister in the Gospel, Jane E. James.\\" A faithful Latter-day Saint since her conversion sixty years earlier, James had made this request several times before, to no avail, and this time she would be just as unsuccessful, even though most Latter-day Saints were allowed to participate in the endowment ritual in the temple as a matter of course. James, unlike most Mormons, was black. For that reason, she was barred from performing the temple rituals that Latter-day Saints believe are necessary to reach the highest degrees of glory after death. A free black woman from Connecticut, James positioned herself at the center of LDS history with uncanny precision. After her conversion, she traveled with her family and other converts from the region to Nauvoo, Illinois, where the LDS church was then based. There, she took a job as a servant in the home of Joseph Smith, the founder and first prophet of the LDS church. When Smith was killed in 1844, Jane found employment as a servant in Brigham Young's home. These positions placed Jane in proximity to Mormonism's most powerful figures, but did not protect her from the church's racially discriminatory policies. Nevertheless, she remained a faithful member until her death in 1908. Your Sister in the Gospel is the first scholarly biography of Jane Manning James or, for that matter, any black Mormon. Quincy D. Newell chronicles the life of this remarkable yet largely unknown figure and reveals why James's story changes our understanding of American history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JiKQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Increasing Access to College: Extending Possibilities for All Students (S U N Y Series, Frontiers in Education)","description":"Focuses on pre-college enrichment programs as a solution to the problem of minority and low-income student access to postsecondary education.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZjM1nFHiXl8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Political Rhetoric","description":"American Political Rhetoric is the only reader for introductory classes in American politics, government, and political communication designed to explore fundamental political principles through classic examples of political rhetoric.

Maccoby traces the now topical discussion of the origins of Anti-Semitism, and especially its development in the modern world. The key questions that are addressed include: How is it that this medieval prejudice proved so lasting and potent? Are the roots of anti-Semitism religious? If so, how do these roots differ in Christianity and Islam? By what means did it bridge the gap between medievalism and Enlightenment? How was it that many of the most respected Enlightenment figures (such as Voltaire) dedicated as they were to tolerance and pluralism, retained a virulent anti-Semitism? These questions, and many more, are dealt with as Maccoby explores the roots of the anti-Semitism, tracing it from its origins, and shows how it has changed in accordance with the shifting ideas of the modern world but without changing in its essence. Antisemitism and Modernity is essential reading for those with interests in the development of anti-Semitism, its manifestation in the current world and its future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ub6EbnopW7cC&dq=Antisemitism+and+Modernity:+Innovation+and+Continuity+(Routledge+Jewish+Studies+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Did you ever!","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ufZ7iP5imKQC&dq=Did+you+ever!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The State of Women in the World Atlas: New Edition","description":"Maps and charts provide information on the status of women around the world","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uVTWAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+State+of+Women+in+the+World+Atlas:+New+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Afterlife Beliefs and Phenomena","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dear Daughter, About Your Baby : A Guide for the Mom-to-Be","description":"In a letter that expresses both the love and concerns of every grandmother-to-be, Robison shares timeless insights into what to expect during the early days of motherhood. \\"Dear Daughter, About Your Baby\\" is filled with invaluable guidance on the practical aspects of daily baby care as well as the motherly wisdom that is often only available in hindsight.

Times Higher Education Supplement 'Timm's lucid prose, his masterly organization of the voluminous material he treats, his excellent translations of the documents he cites and his broad, readable portrayal of Viennese fin-de-siecle culture makes this study accessible to the average reader and a pleasure for the literary professional ...

This new book of classic tales brings the stories of the ancients to life, from the birth of creation by Ra, the sun god, to the murder of Osiris, and the revenge of Horus. We gain glimpses of the underworld and the afterlife, as the rulers of Egypt claimed lineage from the Gods both worshipped and fashioned by the people of Egypt, at a time when humankind had begun to shape the world around it.

The Conservative party dominated British politics for 120 years from Disraeli's victory in 1874, culminating in an unprecedented eighteen-year spell in government after 1979. And yet at the very end of the century the Tories imploded so disastrously as to suggest the party might be doomed to follow the Liberals into oblivion. Geoffrey Wheatcroft has observed this extraordinary drama at close hand, interviewing all the key players on (and, more often, off) the record: from spirited exchanges with Margaret Thatcher to unprintable asides from Alan Clark. In this provocative and often acerbically funny book he first examines how the Tories came to enjoy their unlikely triumph: what was meant to be the century of the common man', with the unstoppable ascent of Labour, turned out to be the era of the Conservative, as the Tories reinvented themselves over and over again, not least entirely changing the party's class character. The Strange Death of Tory England demonstrates brilliantly how two profound truths explain the Conservatives' decline: that the Right had won politically, but the Left had won cultu","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Kw2IAAAAMAAJ&dq=Strange+Death+of+Tory+England&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Friendship Book","description":"With charming art and poetry, this honest primer on friendship, and companion to The Thank You Book, captures the many ways friendships are formed and what it means to be a friend.

Has trouble being close to others? Has a strong need to be right   all the time? Acts self-centered and egotistical? Never asks for help? Has to look good all the time? Works long hours but never finishes? Expects perfection in self and others? Seldom appears vulnerable or weak? Has difficulty relaxing? If so, this person may suffer from counter-dependency, the little-known flip side of co-dependency. The Flight from Intimacy, by psychologists Janae and Barry Weinhold, reveals counter-dependency as the major barrier to creating intimate relationships. People with counter-dependent behaviors appear strong, secure, and successful on the outside, while on the inside they feel weak, fearful, insecure, and needy. They function well in the world of business but often struggle in intimate relationships. Being in a relationship with this kind of person can be extremely frustrating. The Flight from Intimacy shows readers how to recognize and cope with counter-dependent people. And if you recognize yourself in the description above, this book will help you learn how to change. It teaches readers how to use committed relationships to heal childhood wounds and provides proven ways to use conflicts as opportunities for creating intimate, partnership relationships.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6gN8C7Bb0rUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Symbols of Faith: 44 Quilt Blocks","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M6qGAAAACAAJ&dq=Symbols+of+Faith:+44+Quilt+Blocks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Nietzsche means,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9WwlAQAAIAAJ&dq=What+Nietzsche+means,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Concentration a Guide to Mental Mastery","description":"Written in a simple and easily understandable style, Concentration is a classic among books on the art of meditation.

First and foremost among the myths it dispels is the idea that developing concentration is really of no consequence in the practical application of the art of meditation, as some so-called New Age gurus would have people believe.

Its awesome.Now ask yourself how you feel each day as you get ready for work. It probably sounds something like this.Your alarm clock buzzes you awake. You drag yourself out of bed, dreading another day at a job thats high on stress and short on satisfaction.I guess what Im asking you is this:Are You Truly Happy Working In A Career Thats Fulfilling And Enjoyable?Because when you really love your work you greet the day like this:You dont need an alarm clock because you cant wait to get out of bed and dive into another workday where your work feels more like play.Maybe you think its too late. Maybe you believe that youve somehow missed your True Calling and that well youre not getting any younger.Nonsense.

At an age when most people are contemplating retirement, Beverly decided to pursue a long-held dream of becoming an attorney. A lot of people told her she was too old. Undaunted, Beverly went to law school while working full-time, passed the bar exam, and at 61, landed a job at a law firm, explaining, I thought this age stuff was baloney.So as you see, just because youre all grown up, it doesnt mean you cant find your own life mission and live it.But this leads me to my next questionHow Do You Find Work That Will Feed Your Soul?When you discover your True Calling, you may find your life taking you in unexpected directions.You see, anyone can get a 9-to-5 (or maybe for you its more like 8-to-late) J-O-B.

Research conducted by Duke University found that out of 788 factors considered, the top predictor of a long life in the U.S. even more than good health habits or good genes was found to be work satisfaction!I guess its not surprising then that the word Vocation comes from the Latin word vocare which means to call. And when respond to your TRUE Calling you feel renewed, fulfilled, and deeply happy.So heres your million-dollar question:Do you believe you were put on this earth to sit in commuter traffic, to suffer through the performance evaluations and reorganizations, to have to answer to a boss that is well you know. Were you really created to spend your life having the Sunday night blues?Or Do You Believe, As I Do, That You Were Put Here To Follow A Calling That Is Uniquely Yours?If the idea of loving what you do appeals to you, the way I see it here are your options: You can keep plodding along week after week hoping that inspiration will somehow, someway suddenly strike and in a flash your true calling will be revealed.Or, you can make a promise to yourself right here, right now to take the first bold step on behalf of your dreams.This is where Changing Course comes in.By the way, in case you dont know me, Im Valerie Young, the Dreamer in Residence here at Changing Course.

The Tonkinese breed is one breed of cat with many clubs established by Tonkinese cat owners across the world. Elliott Lang says: I have always been in the company of animals. That is the one thing I am most thankful for. My lovely pets have always been around to provide unconditional affection and love when I needed it the most. My father was instrumental in making me grow fond of animals. He always kept me around animals. My family have always been hands on with the pets in the household. Whether it was bathing, feeding or taking care of these animals, my family ensured that the animals got the best of everything. These animals were the centre of all our activities. There was not a single day that did not begin with a discussion about these pets. What to feed them? How to take care of a cat or dog that is ailing? What is the most nutritious thing to feed them? These were common dinner table conversations while I was growing up. So, needless to say, I have had a lot of practical training with respect to taking care of different breeds of animals. Today, I am in a very privileged place where I can share this information with pet lovers across the globe. I would have never been able to provide you with so much comprehensive information without the knowledge that I gained from my father, my family and of course my beloved cats.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MPXRoQEACAAJ&dq=Tonkinese+Cats&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dominick Dunne: Three Complete Novels- The Two Mrs. Grenvilles / People Like Us / An Inconvenient Woman","description":"A trio of best-selling novels from one of America's most popular authors features An Inconvenient Woman, The Two Mrs. Grenvilles, and People Like Us.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HZDZOwAACAAJ&dq=Dominick+Dunne:+Three+Complete+Novels-+The+Two+Mrs.+Grenvilles+/+People+Like+Us+/+An+Inconvenient+Woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of Old Church Slavonic: Texts and Glossary Pt. 2 (London East European series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oo3YgsZAoNAC&dq=Handbook+of+Old+Church+Slavonic:+Texts+and+Glossary+Pt.+2+(London+East+European+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Like This, Like That","description":"What can the Bible teach us about unconditional, everlasting, life-changing love?

In this book, Jan Wrede has compiled a field guide to more than 125 species of mostly native, mostly woody plants of the Texas Hill Country. A thoughtful introduction discusses deer, cedar, water, oak wilt, and invasive species timely issues of increasing importance for a growing number of Texas landowners. Plant descriptions contain information about the leaves, flowers, fruit, and bark of each plant and also give insights into the species  range and habits. A color photograph accompanies each account. Especially useful is a comprehensive plant chart with tips about color, scent, flowering period, height, site preference, and wildlife and livestock utilization.

Although re-routed via Bordeaux (ie 'backwards'), they discovered at long last a magical kingdom of steam, wind and rain, poetry and pubs, lochs and bens, Dickens and Scott. The experience so moved Verne that he wrote a book about it, his first full length narrative. The publisher Hetzel thought something more topical might sell better - and the manuscript was set aside. But Verne obstinately persisted as a writer of prose, often starring British heroes or with a Scottish setting. In the end he became the best-selling novelist ever, and the most translated in the world. Backwards to Britain is now published in English for the first time.

At the same time, many have discovered that there are serious problems associated with wood heat and iron stoves: chimney fires from creosote, air pollution from poor combustion, and structural fires caused by faulty stove installation. The masonry stove, widely used in Europe and Asia for centuries, surmounts these problems. Masonry stoves offer good solutions to many of the problems associated with wood burning. They provide clean combustion at a high temperature, good efficiency, a high degree of safety, and little or no pollution. Masonry stoves require little care, needing to be fed only once or twice a day. They come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes from simple to elegant and from austere to gothic. And they are easily adapted to a variety of structures including solar designs. The Book of Masonry Stoves represents the first comprehensive survey ever published of all the major types of masonry heating systems, ancient and modern. Detailed plans and building information are included in the book. As a complete introduction to masonry stoves, it will help many people rediscover an old way of warming, using masonry stoves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h25d3GJVnQ8C&dq=The+Book+of+Masonry+Stoves&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This Here's A Stick-Up: The Big Bad Book of American Bank Robbery","description":"The comprehensive history of American bank-robbing.

Neher and B. Sakman were the first to monitor the opening and closing of single ion channels and membranes by conductance measurements. In 1976, they used firepolished micropipets with a tip diameter of 3-5 pm to record currents from a small patch of the membranbe of sk- etal muscles, thereby decreasing background membrane noise. In order to reduce the dominant source of background noise-the leakage shunt under the pipet rim between m- the muscle membrane had to be treated brane and gla- enzymatically. Despite these early limitations, a new te- nique was born -the patch-clamp technique. The final bre- through came in 1981 when the same authors, in collaboration with 0. P. Hamill, A. Marty, and F. J. Sigworth, developed the gigaohm seal. Not only did this improve the quality of recordings, it was now possible to gently pull the membrane patch with the attached pipet off the cell and study its trapped ion channels in isolation. Another offshoot of the gigaohm seal technique was the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, in which the patch is ruptured without breaking the seal. This technique is really a sophisticated voltage-clamp technique and also allows for the altering of cytoplasmic constituents if the experimenter so wishes. The first part of Patch-Clamp Applications and Protocols presents modern developments associated with the techn- ogy of patch-clamp electrodes, of cell-free ion channel reco- ing, and of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0f_ToAEACAAJ&dq=Patch-Clamp+Applications+and+Protocols+(Neuromethods)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Autumn of Fury: The Assassination of Sadat","description":"\\"Autumn of Fury reads like a political thriller.

It proves efficiency and pollution regulation didn't kill the musclecar and that current regulation, which picks winners by favoring SUVs is the real threat. Harless has mined auto literature from the 1960s to the present to reveal granular detail on specific models, while at the same time providing broad perspective on the tectonic shifts in domestic auto making. He approaches political issues as an auto enthusiast, but instead of being an apologist for industry, he offers principles that embrace market rationality, and enhance the long-term sustainability of cars through rational transportation and energy policy. Harless re-discovers the principles of \\"conspicuous waste\\" and \\"conspicuous consumption\\"--phrases coined by economist Thorstein Veblen, author of Theory of the Leisure Class--to unmask the unacknowledged assumptions of both U.S. consumers and automakers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1smsFpLmtIoC&dq=Horsepower+War:+Our+Way+of+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Henry and Mudge and the Wild Goose Chase","description":"Henry and his dog Mudge tangle with a grumpy goose when they visit a farm.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hyCPW2kNHeIC&dq=Henry+and+Mudge+and+the+Wild+Goose+Chase&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Net of Dreams","description":"The author of The Devil s Candy and Wendy and the Lost Boys herself the daughter of Holocaust survivors shares her family s stories, which take them from the Carpathian Mountains of Eastern Europe to the small Appalachian town where she was raised.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VjoaBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Window: Inspired Ideas for Framing Your View (Leisure Arts #3422)","description":"The Window, -Photos and tips from a professional designer show the reader how to choose and make the perfect window fashions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S0sDAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Window:+Inspired+Ideas+for+Framing+Your+View+(Leisure+Arts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bill Neal's Southern Cooking","description":"Southern cooking, the most interesting and complex regional cuisine in America, remains a mystery to many professional cooks and southerners.

The Japanese term for mobile phone, keitai (roughly translated as \\"something you carry with you\\"), evokes not technical capability or freedom of movement but intimacy and portability, defining a personal accessory that allows constant social connection. Japan's enthusiastic engagement with mobile technology has become along with anime, manga, and sushi part of its trendsetting popular culture. Personal, Portable, Pedestrian, the first book-length English-language treatment of mobile communication use in Japan, covers the transformation of keitai from business tool to personal device for communication and play. The essays in this groundbreaking collection document the emergence, incorporation, and domestication of mobile communications in a wide range of social practices and institutions. The book first considers the social, cultural, and historical context of keitai development, including its beginnings in youth pager use in the early 1990s. It then discusses the virtually seamless integration of keitai use into everyday life, contrasting it to the more escapist character of Internet use on the PC. Other essays suggest that the use of mobile communication reinforces ties between close friends and family, producing \\"tele-cocooning\\" by tight-knit social groups. The book also discusses mobile phone manners and examines keitai use by copier technicians, multitasking housewives, and school children. Personal, Portable, Pedestrian describes a mobile universe in which networked relations are a pervasive and persistent fixture of everyday life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wr1NEAAAQBAJ&dq=Personal,+Portable,+Pedestrian:+Mobile+Phones+in+Japanese+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What to cook for company: For lovers of good cookery","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cjmVuwAACAAJ&dq=What+to+cook+for+company:+For+lovers+of+good+cookery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Employment Law in a Nutshell (Nutshell Series)","description":"This Nutshell provides an overview of individual employee rights and responsibilities.

Miller has written what critics are calling one of the most powerful accounts of warfare ever published. Here are the horror and heroism of World War II in the words of the men who fought it, the journalists who covered it, and the civilians who were caught in its fury. Miller gives us an up-close, deeply personal view of a war that was more savagely fought -- and whose outcome was in greater doubt -- than readers might imagine. This is the war that Americans at the home front would have read about had they had access to the previously censored testimony of the soldiers on which Miller builds his gripping narrative. Miller covers the entire war -- on land, at sea, and in the air -- and provides new coverage of the brutal island fighting in the Pacific, the bomber war over Europe, the liberation of the death camps, and the contributions of African Americans and other minorities. He concludes with a suspenseful, never-before-told story of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, based on interviews with the men who flew the mission that ended the war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=43Nk5lzO_oIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical Housebuilding for Practically Everyone (McGraw-Hill/VTX series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rtMLAQAAMAAJ&dq=Practical+Housebuilding+for+Practically+Everyone+(McGraw-Hill/VTX+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wild Truth Bible Lessons--Pictures of God 2","description":"The Bible is a photo album, brimming with self-portraits of a God who wants to be known. God has put these pictures in the Bible to reveal his character. By examining them, we discover who God is and why he s worth knowing better. And we discover something else: who he wants us to be. He wants us to copy his picture into our own character. Wild Truth Bible Lessons--Pictures of God 2 is a guide to 12 God-pictures taken straight from the Photo Album. They are active Bible lessons for junior high and middle school Sunday school classes or youth group meetings, each one based on one of the 50 pictures of God and presented energetically, relevantly, and scripturally in the companion student book Wild Truth Journal: Pictures of God. The lessons are loaded with off-the-wall and easy-to-do discussion starters, video ideas, scripts, games with a point. And, of course, Bible passages and studies that springboard junior highers from the abstract into the concrete as (open Bibles in hand) they explore the nature of God in a lively, relevant way, and then begin practicing in their own lives the traits of God.Here s how the lessons are organized: * Picture Prep grabs your group s attention to prepare them for what s ahead.* Action Shot takes your students into the Bible to catch God in the act of revealing his character.* Self-Portrait explores the given aspect of God s character...how it makes God just that much more awesome...and why it s a very good trait for us to have, too.* Print It! challenges your students to print God s picture into their own lives by living out his character in an immediately practical way.12 lessons","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nk1wO8PZg4sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Synopsis and Codification of the Laws and Ordinances of the Kitab-I-Aqdas","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3izlAAAAMAAJ&dq=Synopsis+and+Codification+of+the+Laws+and+Ordinances+of+the+Kitab-I-Aqdas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Families and Family Therapy.","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=axghpmx-540C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cyberspaces of Their Own (Digital Formations, V. 25)","description":"Cyberspaces of Their Own interrogates the social and spatial relations of the rapidly expanding virtual terrain of media fandom.

At the time, the Romanian Ploesti oil fields produced about a third of all Axis oil, and was Germany's single most important fuel source. In the summer of 1943, the USAAF decided to stage a major raid on Ploesti from air bases in Libya. The resulting Operation Tidal Wave raid on 1 August 1943 was one of the costliest to date, losing 53 aircraft, about a third of the starting force. Of the more than 150 bombers that took part in the raid, only 88 B-24s returned to Libya, 55 of which were damaged. On the other hand, of the 17 Medals of Honor awarded to US soldiers and airmen from Pearl Harbor in 1941 to D-Day in 1944, 5 were awarded to pilots of the Tidal Wave mission in recognition of their extraordinary performance. Although undoubtedly bold and heroic, the mission had questionable results. Initial assessments argued that the mission caused 40% of the refinery capacity at Ploesti to be lost but subsequent studies concluded that the damage was quickly repaired and that output had exceeded August levels within a month. This new study examines the raid in detail, exploring the reasons why its dubious success came at such a high price. Supported by maps, diagrams, and full-colour artwork including battlescenes and bird's-eye views, this is the full story of the audacious Ploesti raid of 1943.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gGCWDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Study Skills, A Landmark School Student Guide","description":"\\"Designed for students who have difficulty organizing the information they must learn in school, this book provides practical strategies for improving study skills.\\"--Page [4] cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=34noAAAACAAJ&dq=Study+Skills,+A+Landmark+School+Student+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Japanese Kitchen (Non)","description":"250 recipes reflecting Japanese culinary history from ancient to modern times.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=43puKgiAK2YC&dq=The+Japanese+Kitchen+(Non)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wings on Her Petticoat","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TyKgpwAACAAJ&dq=Wings+on+Her+Petticoat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great Theft : Wrestling Islam from the Extremists","description":"Despite President George W. Bush's assurances that Islam is a peaceful religion and that all good Muslims hunger for democracy, confusion persists and far too many Westerners remain convinced that Muslims and terrorists are synonymous. In the aftermath of the attacks of 9/11, the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the recent bombings in London, an unprecedented amount of attention has been directed toward Islam and the Muslim world. Yet, even with this increased scrutiny, most of the public discourse regarding Islam revolves around the actions of extremist factions such as the Wahhabis and al-Qa'ida. But what of the Islam we don't hear about? As the second-largest and fastest-growing religion in the world, Islam is deemed by more than a billion Muslims to be a source of serenity and spiritual peace, and a touchstone for moral and ethical guidance. While extremists have an impact upon the religion that is wildly disproportionate to their numbers, moderates constitute the majority of Muslims worldwide. It is this rift between the quiet voice of the moderates and the deafening statements of the extremists that threatens the future of the faith. In The Great Theft, Khaled Abou El Fadl, one of the world's preeminent Islamic scholars, argues that Islam is currently passing through a transformative period no less dramatic than the movements that swept through Europe during the Reformation. At this critical juncture there are two completely opposed worldviews within Islam competing to define this great world religion. The stakes have never been higher, and the future of the Muslim world hangs in the balance. Drawing on the rich tradition of Islamic history and law, The Great Theft is an impassioned defense of Islam against the encroaching power of the extremists. As an accomplished Islamic jurist, Abou El Fadl roots his arguments in long-standing historical legal debates and delineates point by point the beliefs and practices of moderate Muslims, distinguishing these tenets from the corrupting influences of the extremists. From the role of women in Islam to the nature of jihad, from democracy and human rights to terrorism and warfare, Abou El Fadl builds a vital vision for a moderate Islam. At long last, the great majority of Muslims who oppose extremism have a desperately needed voice to help reclaim Islam's great moral tradition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fIrLjWF98FIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This Affair is Over!!","description":"Drawing on newly declassified government files, this is the dramatic story of how a forbidden book in the Soviet Union became a secret CIA weapon in the ideological battle between East and West. In May 1956, an Italian publishing scout took a train to a village just outside Moscow to visit Russia s greatest living poet, Boris Pasternak. He left carrying the original manuscript of Pasternak s first and only novel, entrusted to him with these words:  This is Doctor Zhivago. May it make its way around the world.  Pasternak believed his novel was unlikely ever to be published in the Soviet Union, where the authorities regarded it as an irredeemable assault on the 1917 Revolution. But he thought it stood a chance in the West and, indeed, beginning in Italy, Doctor Zhivago was widely published in translation throughout the world. From there the life of this extraordinary book entered the realm of the spy novel. The CIA, which recognized that the Cold War was above all an ideological battle, published a Russian-language edition of Doctor Zhivago and smuggled it into the Soviet Union. Copies were devoured in Moscow and Leningrad, sold on the black market, and passed surreptitiously from friend to friend. Pasternak s funeral in 1960 was attended by thousands of admirers who defied their government to bid him farewell. The example he set launched the great tradition of the writer-dissident in the Soviet Union. In The Zhivago Affair, Peter Finn and Petra Couv e bring us intimately close to this charming, passionate, and complex artist. First to obtain CIA files providing concrete proof of the agency s involvement, the authors give us a literary thriller that takes us back to a fascinating period of the Cold War to a time when literature had the power to stir the world.

Glynn writes with exceptional clarity and offers telling examples: to help explain vision, for instance, he discusses optical illusions as well as cases of patients who suffer disordered seeing through healthy eyes (such as the loss of the ability to recognize familiar faces). The breadth of Glynn's erudition is astonishing, as he ranges from parallel processing in computers to the specialization of different regions of the brain (illustrated with fascinating instances of the bizarre effects of localized brain damage). He explains the different types of memory (episodic and semantic, as well as short-term and implicit memory), traces the path through the brain of information leading to emotional responses, and engages in a discussion of language that takes in Noam Chomsky and Hawaiian pidgin. Moreover, for every subject Glynn addresses, he offers a thorough-going scientific history. For example, before discussing the evolution of the brain, he provides an account of the theory of evolution itself, from the writing and success of The Origin of Species to recent work on the fossil record, DNA, and RNA. No other single volume has captured the full expanse of our knowledge of consciousness and the brain. A work of unequaled authority and eloquence, An Anatomy of Thought promises to be a new landmark of scientific writing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CXB2CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secret of the Three Treasures","description":"While pretending to be the heroine of her father's adventure novels, Tiernay discovers new friends, buried Revolutionary War treasure, and answers to a long-ago mystery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A8pevgAACAAJ&dq=Secret+of+the+Three+Treasures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marion Jones: The Fastest Woman in the World","description":"Race for the record!

This concern may at first appear to have little to do with the study of budgeting, but for Wildavsky budgeting made living together possible. Indeed, as he argues here, if you cannot budget, you cannot govern. Budgeting and Governing gathers in one place a mass of material that otherwise would be lost in a wilderness of journals and edited volumes. With few exceptions, Wildavsky chose the articles in this collection. They are organized largely chronologically so that the reader can trace the progression of his thought which moved from studies of the American federal government, through comparative work, and on to placing budgeting within a broader theory of political culture. Wildavsky wrote about budgeting because in his words, \\"when a process involves power, authority, culture, consensus, and conflict, it captures a great deal of national political life.\\" Wildavsky was interested in budgeting because of what it could tell us about the classic questions of politics: who gets what, how, and why? His earlier analyses focus narrowly on budgeting personnel and agency actors in answering these questions, while in his later work the contending actors become sub-cultural types. To Wildavsky politics was about finding terms for living together in spite of ideological differences. Budgetary incrementalism helped to manage this otherwise unmanageable task. He thought synoptic budgeting and all related reforms would increase disagreement and raise the stakes, and so were unwise. Analysis had to serve politics, not try to displace it. Aaron Wildavsky is considered one of the most innovative and prolific scholars in the field of political research in our time. He was the author most recently of Culture and Social Theory and Federalism and Political Culture, as well as Dilemmas of Presidential Leadership (with Richard Ellis), The Beleaguered Presidency, and Craftways: On the Organization of Scholarly Work, all available from Transaction. Brendon Swedlow is a visiting processor in the political science department at the University of California, Los Angeles. Joseph White is an associate professor in the Department of Health Systems Management at Tulane University Medical Center. \\"...this collection of essays is to show the development of the late Wildavsky's ideas on budgeting from the beginning of his career to the end....Recommended for research libraries and gradute students in public administration.\\"-Choice \\"Brendow Swedloe and Transaction Press have rendered policy scholars, budget specialists, and public managers a tremendous service by pulling together this posthumous collection of Aaron Wildavsky's writings on the vital, it often politically tense, relationship between budgeting and governing.\\"--Journal of Policy Analysis and Management","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iJEdCzGWa20C&dq=Budgeting+and+Governing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holy Land, Holy City: Sacred Geography and the Interpretation of the Bible","description":"What connections exist between the physical geography of Israel and the spirituality of biblical faith?

It is one of Verne's most acclaimed works. The story starts in London on Tuesday, October 1, 1872. Fogg is a rich English gentleman living in solitude. Despite his wealth, Fogg lives a modest life with habits carried out with mathematical precision. Very little can be said about his social life other than that he is a member of the Reform Club. Having dismissed his former valet, James Foster, for bringing him shaving water at 84  F (29  C) instead of 86  F (30  C), Fogg hires a Frenchman by the name of Jean Passepartout as a replacement. At the Reform Club, Fogg gets involved in an argument over an article in The Daily Telegraph stating that with the opening of a new railway section in India, it is now possible to travel around the world in 80 days. He accepts a wager for  20,000 (equal to about  1.6 million today) from his fellow club members, which he will receive if he makes it around the world in 80 days. Accompanied by Passepartout, he leaves London by train at 8:45 P.M. on Wednesday, October 2, 1872, and is due back at the Reform Club at the same time 80 days later, Saturday, December 21, 1872.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=01QGkAEACAAJ&dq=Around+the+World+in+Eighty+Days+(BBC+Radio+Collection)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Warrior on His Path: A Manual for Better Understanding Humankind, God, Life and Death","description":"The author deals with the genuine origin of the thinking mind, its influence upon humanity and other ignored ancient knowledge.

Bislama began as a plantation pidgin based on English in the nineteenth century, but it has since developed into a unique language with a grammar and vocabulary very different from English. It is one of very few national languages for which there is no readily available reference grammar. This book aims to fill this gap by providing an extensive account of the grammar of Bislama as it is used by ordinary Ni-Vanuatu. It does not, therefore, aim to describe any kind of artificial written norm but sets out to capture a range of different kinds of ways that Ni-Vanuatu will say things in various contexts, both written and spoken, formal and informal. The thrust of this volume is to show that Bislama has a grammar an unfamiliar concept for those educated in Vanuatu. It also shows that Bislama is a language of considerable complexity, which will come as a surprise to many of its users, who have been taught to view their language as somehow \\"simple\\" and even \\"deficient.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V7Td_VMSh9gC&dq=Bislama+Reference+Grammar+(Oceanic+Linguistics+Special+Publication,+31)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A text-book of astronomy, (Twentieth century text-books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2ykcngEACAAJ&dq=A+text-book+of+astronomy,+(Twentieth+century+text-books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Deliberate Church: Building Your Ministry on the Gospel","description":"Dever and Alexander propose a model of complete reliance and submission to the gospel when building a healthy church.

This form of meditation, brought to the West by S.N. Geoneka, provides a means to experience emotions directly and nonverbally accessing the mind through the body. One of the main principles of this school of meditation is that meditation alone is not sufficient practice, but that it must be combined with a whole-life and ethical commitment. M.Glickman's approach is unique he takes a mediation practice deeply rooted within a historic Buddhist framework, and gives it a modern-day, scientific spin he presents sensation based viapassana meditaiton and Buddhist principles in 20th-century language, secularizing ideas that may sound exotic, off-putting, or out-dated.

Unfortunately there are too many people who continue aimlessly along, overshadowed psychologically and physically because they are not aware of their own abilities. Such people are a great minus from their own viewpoint and from the viewpoint of society as well. The principles of ki lie in bringing to light man's natural strength and his hidden natural abilities. The author's earlier works, in which he introduced the principles of ki and aikido with mind and body coordinated, met with great response in many countries and created a demand for a still more detailed explanation of what ki really means. The present work is an answer to that demand. In the first section, while delving deeply into the principles of ki, the author gives a number of practical examples which anyone can easily follow. These examples are straight to that point, concrete and avoid abstractions such as how much power is there in spirit and the nature of feeling. The author's point is to have the reader learn the proper method of mastering the spirit and to have the spirit pervade the reader's body so that he will be able to grasp the basic meaning of ki. In part two of the book, the author gives detailed and concrete examples of how to apply the principles of ki to our daily lives.

Fat and cholesterol were as closely monitored as his blood pressure and pulse. Equally concerned about our young son Jordan, who was tested and found to have hereditary high cholesterol, diet and nutrition became my primary focus. After many consultations with hospital dieticians and outside nutritionalists, we were given charts, books, and the clear message, No Red Meat! As a good dietary student frightened by our situation, I diligently followed the dictates of the hospital, making the directives a learning process. We eliminated red meat from our diet and transformed all of the gourmet cooking my family had become accustomed to into healthy and acceptable heart smart cuisine. Challenges always entice me... the bigger the challenges, the more interesting it becomes. We began eating endless quantities of vegetables, fruits, chicken, turkey, and tofu (higher in fat, but still legitimate). Still, we longed for that juicy burger or succulent rare steak. Three years later and tofued into oblivion, David and I were in South Dakota, as David was commissioned to do the painting for Mt. Rushmore's fiftieth anniversary celebration. Numerous local eateries were serving buffalo burgers and other bison specialities -- touting this game as a healthy alternative to beef. The claims were accurate; there was virtually no fat present in the meat. Buffalo/bison became the salvation of our dietary dilemma.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2QofPQAACAAJ&dq=Buffalo+Cookbook:+The+Low+Fat+Solution+to+Eating+Red+Meat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Corpse Steps Out","description":"A Chicago cad blackmails a torch singer in this thriller:  Why can t all murders be as funny as those concocted by Craig Rice?

But her press agent and manager, Jake Justus, is familiar with another side of the darling of the airwaves: her crackpot marriage to a penniless tycoon, disastrous string of lovers, and propensity for flying into spectacular fits of rage. Now, it appears she s being burned by an ex-flame who s holding her scandalous love letters for ransom. The missives could ruin Nelle s career, but so could the scoundrel s murder.

Malone, Chicago s rumpled yet resourceful legal beagle is tasked with finding both. But as every new unscrupulous lead turns up dead, Malone isn t sure whether Nelle is orchestrating a killer cover-up to save her pretty neck or if she s about to belt out her own swan song.

All believe in the immortality of the soul. Some believe in reincarnation. Jews, Christians, and Muslims believe that good people will go to Heaven, evil ones will go to Hell. Many devout Jews pray to their Saints in Heaven. Catholics pray to their Saints, especially to Mary -- \\"The Queen of Heaven.\\" Protestants pray to their loved ones in Heaven. Devout Muslims believe that their Prophet Muhammad ascended up to Heaven from Jerusalem. They regard this city as the third holiest place to Islam. As a consequence, much of the Jew/Arab conflict centers over the holiness of the City to both Jews and Muslims -- and the alleged \\"Temple Mount\\" true location. Fanatic Muslim terrorists believe the road to Paradise as Shahids, immediately after death, must be paved over the body parts of their indiscriminate victims. According to Iran's president, Ahmadinejad, the purpose of the revolution and nuclear Iran is to prepare for the imminent return of the Mahdi, the twelfth Imam. Hence Israel must be destroyed, the West must be subjugated, and the rest of the world must submit to the coming Mahdi's \\"reign of peace on earth.\\" If the belief in an afterlife -- immediately after death -- is true, then both the Bible and the Qur'an should fully confirm it in plain words. But what if they, instead, contradict it? What if God, Jesus, and Muhammad are not the source of this doctrine? What if the doctrine of an afterlife immediately after death is a hoax? What if man has no immortal soul?

Yet despite widespread discontent with the intellectual standards in marketing, very little has changed over the past thirty years. In this ground-breaking new work, Chris Hackley presents a social-constructionist critique of popular approaches to teaching, theorising and writing about marketing. Drawing on a wide range of up-to-date European and North American studies, Dr Hackley presents his argument on two levels. First, he argues that mainstream marketing's ideologically driven curriculum and research programmes, dominated by North American tradition, reproduce business school myths about the nature of practically relevant theory and the role of professional education in management fields. Second, he suggests a broadened theoretical scope and renewed critical agenda for research, theory and teaching in marketing. Intellectually rigorous yet comprehensible, this work will be of vital importance to all those interested in the future of teaching and research in business and management.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ESMVVp27Vx0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grenadiere (German Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LVklzgEACAAJ&dq=Grenadiere+(German+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American History: The Modern Era Since 1865","description":"Print student edition","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LNoJAAAACAAJ&dq=American+History:+The+Modern+Era+Since+1865&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Four Benefits of the Liturgy: A Benedictine Monk","description":"Since the Second Vatican Council, the liturgy has become the source of conflicting opinions. This situation has given rise to disputes that continue to divide those who practice their faith. But what has created this state of affairs? Author Denis Crouan shows how the decisions made by Vatican II that aimed at restoring the Roman rite were presented poorly, applied incorrectly, and often not applied at all. In many places the Mass has been turned into a permanent work-in-progress, in which the objectivity of the liturgy yields to the subjectivity of those who take part in it. Where does the current unwillingness to apply the liturgical rules come from? Why have the directives of the last council been ignored or circumvented? This book offers answers to the questions asked by Catholics who want to understand their liturgy better, so as to put an end to deviant practices that threaten Church unity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dYxHDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inconceivable","description":"A memoir of hope for the thousands of women struggling with infertility, from one who beat the odds by simply tuning in to her body and tapping her well of sheer determination. At a time when more and more women are trying to get pregnant at increasingly advanced ages, fertility specialists and homeopathic researchers boast endless treatment options. But when Julia Indichova made the rounds of medical doctors and nontraditional healers, she was still unable to conceive a child. It was only when she forsook their financially and emotionally draining advice, turning inward instead, that she finally met with reproductive success. Inconceivable recounts this journey from hopeless diagnoses to elated motherhood. Anyone who has faced infertility will relate to Julia s desperate measures: acupuncture, unidentifiable black-and-white pellets, herb soup, foul-smelling fruit, even making love on red sheets. Five reproductive endocrinologists told her that there was no documented case of anyone in her hormonal condition getting pregnant, forcing her to finally embark on her own intuitive regimen. After eight caffeine-free, nutrient-rich, yoga-laden months, complemented by visualization exercises, Julia received amazing news; incredibly, she was pregnant. Nine months later she gave birth to a healthy girl. Unlike the many infertility books that take a clinical  how to  approach, Inconceivable simply professes the wisdom of giving expert status back to the patient. Julia s self-discovery, and her ability to see her body as an ally once again, yield a beautiful message about the importance of honoring the body s innate powers, and the power of life itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U-AiTw6RvhsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Invisible Radios: re-mixes, statistics, jokes, etc.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J1-jPQAACAAJ&dq=Invisible+Radios:+re-mixes,+statistics,+jokes,+etc.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pipe Major's Handbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fuMJGwAACAAJ&dq=The+Pipe+Major%27s+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mats Sundin (Hockey Heroes Biography Series) (Hockey Heroes (Greystone))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uGYWAQAAMAAJ&dq=Mats+Sundin+(Hockey+Heroes+Biography+Series)+(Hockey+Heroes+(Greystone))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essentials of Veterinary Microbiology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=50HkY4W7bq4C&dq=Essentials+of+Veterinary+Microbiology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teaser And the Firecat: Cat Stevens","description":"The instant #1 New York Times and Indie bestseller!

Divine providence is one of the most pressing issues in analytic theology and philosophy of religion today, especially in view of scientific evidence for a natural world full of indeterminacies and contingencies. Therefore, we need new ways to understand and explain the relations of divine providence and creaturely action. The volume is structured dynamically, going from chapters on human providence to those on divine providence, and back. Drawing on insights from virtue ethics, psychology and cognitive science, the philosophy of providence in the face of contingent events, and the theology of grace, each chapter contributes to an original overall perspective: that human providential action is a resource suited specifically to personal action and hence related to the purported providential action of a personal God. By putting forward a fresh take on divine providence, this book enters new territory on an age-old issue. It will therefore be of great interest to scholars of theology and philosophy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cRb8DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Up Words for Down Days","description":"A collection of quips, quotes and anecdotes to bring a little cheer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eErLiVg13_EC&dq=Up+Words+for+Down+Days&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Irish Devil","description":"He was her only chance for survival. . .
