This powerful tale written by a consummate Charleston insider and set in the historic city resonates with universal appeal. Daring to touch on topics that had been taboo, Three O'Clock Dinner reveals how the modern world has intruded in a most unwelcome way upon the Redcliffes, a Charleston family long on pedigree but short on cash. Mortified when their son \\"Tat\\" elopes with the henna-haired daughter of the Hessenwinkles, an especially galling bourgeois clan, the Redcliffes are determined to respond with civility. They invite their son, his new wife, and her family for Sunday dinner, served at the traditional time of three in the afternoon. Tension builds across an expanse of white damask. After mint julep aperitifs, dinner claret, and Madeira toasts, a chance remark ignites the novel's climax amid a flurry of raised voices, hurt feelings, and broken china. Their new daughter-in-law's revelation further shatters the Redcliffe's well-ordered society but opens a door to forgiveness and redemption. Barbara L. Bellow's introduction places the novel in its historical context, illuminates the history of its publication and treatment in the hands of Hollywood producers, and provides an in-depth critical analysis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rRhMH0JS1QUC&dq=Three+O%27Clock+Dinner&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Everstone: Blood Legacy D20 Core Role-Playing Game","description":"For three hundred years the world has been the battleground of the Hollow Lords; god slayers who have broken free of their prison and almost brought the races of mortals to extinction.

John Collins. Examining the biblical storyline as the worldview story of the people of God, Collins shows how that story presupposes a real Adam and Eve and how the modern experience of life points to the same conclusion. Applying well-informed critical thinking to common theological and scientific questions, Collins asserts the importance of a real man at the beginning in God's plan for creation, a plan that includes \\"redemption\\" for all people since sin entered the world. Did Adam and Eve Really Exist? addresses both biblical and Jewish texts and contains extensive appendices to examine how the material in Genesis relates to similar material from Mesopotamian myths. Collins s detailed analysis of the relevant texts will instill confidence in readers that the traditional Christian story equips them better than any alternatives to engage the life that they actually encounter in the modern world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jNgi-kiMZmsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"IBM Smalltalk: The Language (Addison-Wesley Object Technology Series)","description":"More than a guide to the Smalltalk language.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W8_Une9cbbgC&dq=IBM+Smalltalk:+The+Language+(Addison-Wesley+Object+Technology+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"T.

The presentation is self -contained and accessible to the nonspecialist. Part II concerns the theory of monotone operators. It is divided into two subvolumes, II/A and II/B, which form a unit. The present Part II/A is devoted to linear monotone operators. It serves as an elementary introduction to the modern functional analytic treatment of variational problems, integral equations, and partial differential equations of elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic type. This book also represents an introduction to numerical functional analysis with applications to the Ritz method along with the method of finite elements, the Galerkin methods, and the difference method. Many exercises complement the text. The theory of monotone operators is closely related to Hilbert's rigorous justification of the Dirichlet principle, and to the 19th and 20th problems of Hilbert which he formulated in his famous Paris lecture in 1900, and which strongly influenced the development of analysis in the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sk1M2Vw-Y24C&dq=Nonlinear+Functional+Analysis+and+its+Applications:+I:+Fixed-Point+Theorems+(Zeidler,+Eberhard//Nonlinear+Functional+Analysis+and+Its+Applications)+(Pt.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Medieval Women's Visionary Literature","description":"These pages capture a thousand years of medieval women's visionary writing, from late antiquity to the 15th century.

Kennedy at Parkland Hospital in November of 1963 agreed-either out of respect or fear-not to publish what they had seen, heard, and felt. Then in 1990, one of the Dallas surgeons who worked on JFK in Trauma Room One, Dr. Charles Crenshaw, decided after much deliberation that the American people ought to know the truth. \\"The wounds to Kennedy's head and throat that I examined were caused by bullets that struck him from the front, not the back, as the public has been led to believe,\\" says Crenshaw. When the first edition of this book was published in 1992, under the title JFK: Conspiracy of Silence, Crenshaw revealed what he never had to opportunity to tell the Warren Commission. In the aftermath, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) called Crenshaw's book \\"a fabrication.\\" But JAMA's claim did not hold up in court and Crenshaw subsequently prevailed in a defamation suit against JAMA. In the process, a number of new medical disclosures and discoveries have emerged on the startling medical cover-up of the JFK assassination. CHARLES A. CRENSHAW, M.D. (1933-2001), a Texas native, was Chairman Emeritus of the Department of Surgery and a member of the Board of Directors of the Tarrant County Hospital District in Fort Worth. He received his BS from Southern Methodist University and his MS from East Texas State University. He worked on his Ph.D. at Baylor University Graduate Research Institute in 1957 and, in 1960, he earned his M.D. from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas. He interned at Veteran's Administration Hospital and completed his residency at Dallas's Parkland Memorial Hospital, where he worked for five years. He taught at many institutions, including the UT Southwestern Medical School.

Among these are several highly significant sources that scholars have used over and over again in their attempts to reconstruct the founding era of Mormonism, usually by focusing solely on content, without a deep appreciation for how and why a document was produced. This book offers case studies of the sources most often used by historians of the early Mormon experience. Each chapter takes a particular document as its primary subject, considering the production of a document as an historical event in itself, with its own background, purpose, circumstances, and consequences. The documents are examined not merely as sources of information but as artifacts that reflect aspects of the general culture and particular circumstances in which they were created. This book will help historians working in the founding era of Mormonism gain a more solid grounding in the period's documentary record by supplying important information on major primary sources.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ET5MDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Loudest Scream (Fear Street: Fear Park, No. 2)","description":"In the wake of several terrible accidents at Fear Park, Diedre Bradley pursues a relationship with the intense and mysterious Robin Fear and learns of his plans to destroy the park, even at the cost of Diedre's life.

Paul's young converts in Colossae also had a keen interest in the subject, but some of them allowed this interest to distort their newfound Christian faith. Defining the exact nature of the Colossian heresy, however, has been a perennial challenge to interpreters. The Colossian Syncretism offers groundbreaking evidence on the true nature of the problem that the Apostle Paul opposed so vehemently. Drawing upon little-known angel inscriptions, magical texts, and archeological evidence from Asia Minor, the author argues that the Colossians tried to combine Paul's teachings about Christ with local pagan and Jewish folk beliefs. The result was a syncretism that kept them captive to the fear of evil spirits, dependent on the power of magic and amulets, and blind to the liberating power of the indwelling Christ, the supreme Creator and Lord of all spiritual principalities and powers. In addition to unearthing the historical background of Paul's letter to the Colossians, The Colossian Syncretism presents Paul's strategy for addressing the religious syncretism he faced there. It thus provides a working model for Christian missionaries and evangelists discipling converts from today's religiously pluralistic societies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iWbDCAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Colossian+Syncretism:+The+Interface+Between+Christianity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Sourcebook: A Guide to Healing, Recovery, and Growth","description":"How millions of PTSD suffers learned to live without fear, pain, depression, and self-doubt The Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Sourcebook, Revised and Expanded Second Edition introduces survivors, loved ones, and helpers to the remarkable range of treatment alternatives and self-management techniques available today to break through the pain and realize recovery and growth.

Born out of this experience, A Stricken Field follows a journalist who returns to Prague after its annexation and finds her efforts to obtain help for the refugees and to convey the shocking state of the country both frustrating and futile.

In hotel rooms and airplanes, on beaches and Sundays, at junctures of personal happiness or its opposite, poetry has comforted me with its hope of permanence, its packaging of flux.  Thus John Updike writes in introducing his Collected Poems. The earliest poems here date from 1953, when Updike was twenty-one, and the last were written after he turned sixty. Almost all of those published in his five previous collections are included, with some revisions. Arranged in chronological order, the poems constitute, as he says,  the thread backside of my life s fading tapestry.  An ample set of notes at the back of the book discusses some of the hidden threads, and expatiates upon a number of fine points. Nature tenderly intricate, ruthlessly impervious is a constant and ambiguous presence in these poems, along with the social observation one would expect in a novelist. No occasion is too modest or too daily to excite metaphysical wonder, or to provoke a lyrical ingenuity of language. Yet even the wittiest of the poems are rooted to the ground of experience and fact.  Seven Odes to Seven Natural Processes  attempt to explicate the physical world with a directness seldom attempted in poetry.

Beneath the cobwebs and stale perfumed air is a goldmine, and not because of the actual gold (or painted ostrich eggs or mounted rhinoceros horns or bronze bathtub). First, there's a portrait by one of the masters of the Belle Epoque, Giovanni Boldini. And then there are letters and journals written by the very woman in the painting, Marthe de Florian. These documents reveal that she was more than a renowned courtesan with enviable decolletage. Suddenly April's quest is no longer about the bureaux plats and Louis-style armchairs that will fetch millions at auction. It's about discovering the story behind this charismatic woman. It's about discovering two women, actually. With the help of a salty (and annoyingly sexy) Parisian solicitor and the courtesan's private diaries, April tries to uncover the many secrets buried in the apartment. As she digs into Marthe's life, April can't help but take a deeper look into her own. Having left behind in the States a cheating husband, a family crisis about to erupt, and a career she's been using as the crutch to simply get by, she feels compelled to sort out her own life too. When the things she left bubbling back home begin to boil over, and Parisian delicacies beyond flaky patisseries tempt her better judgment, April knows that both she and Marthe deserve happy finales. Whether accompanied by croissants or champagne, this delectable debut novel depicts the Paris of the Belle Epoque and the present day with vibrant and stunning allure. Based on historical events, Michelle Gable's A Paris Apartment will entertain and inspire, as readers embrace the struggles and successes of two very unforgettable women.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Bc5nAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making the fascist state","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V18cAAAAMAAJ&dq=Making+the+fascist+state&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hooked on Math(Multiplication) (Master the Facts, Level 3)","description":"Hooked on Phonics Hooked on Math puts kids on the fast track to mastering basic math concepts at their own pace, with exercises and games designed to teach young students math skills from addition and subtraction, all the way through multiplication and long division.

Because of later German conquests, the world has largely forgotten this initial success. Yet in one respect the rapid annihilation of the Polish Army was Germany's most important conquest. This campaign demonstrated to Germany, if not to the rest of the world, the correctness of her military doctrine. It furnished the proving ground for her organization and weapons. The rapidity of Poland's complete destruction came as a shocking surprise to the world at large. Eight days after the beginning of the war, all Polish forces were in demoralized retreat; and a month later, the entire fighting force of a million men had been annihilated. Military history offers no prior example of a conquest so rapid and complete. In this victory the new German air and mechanized forces played an unprecedented part. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to say that German success was due to these two arms alone. Simply stated, Germany's stupendous conquest may be attributed to the superiority of the entire German Army over the outmoded Polish war machine. Germany's balanced, well-trained, and ably led forces found no match in those of her smaller rival. This account of the campaign in Poland has been written for use in the instruction of cadets at the United States Military Academy. It is based for the most part on material prepared by the Military Intelligence Service, War Department. -- Abstract.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hcJOAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Karate Dojo","description":"Learn the background of Japanese Karate along with the ins and outs of belonging to a dojo with this readable martial arts guide.

Filled with short, well-written pieces, the encyclopedia covers the names and ideas that preceded Keynes, that carried his work to the center of the profession, and that eventually supplanted him there . . . There are excellent and unexpected articles on the Austrian school, the Lausanne school, and the Ricardo effect. There are well-done pieces on all the basic theoretical models at the heart of Keynesianism . . . [the] volume has been well put together. The editors deserve special praise for letting each contributor tell his own story. Those who oppose Keynes?s ideas are just as well represented as those who carry the torch for him. This evenhandedness helps to ensure a volume that is truly representative and that will allow its users to get a full picture of the life and times of Keynesian economics.? D Bradley W. Bateman, Grinnell College, US ?The book will also be of some interest to serious scholars, partly because it includes biographies of many economists too young to have been included in the New Palgrave, such as Dornbusch, Fisher, Herschel Grossman, Kregel, Lucas, and Robert Townsend. It also includes some very interesting longer essays.? D Peter Howitt, The Economic Journal ?This book provides an excellent summary of the many strands of ?Keynesian?- style thought both before and after 1936. Its well-considered entries take care to make explicit the assumptions and fundamental points of difference between theories too often concealed by the parents and advocates of specific theories in their zeal to promote the universality of the ideas. There is scarcely an entry that suffers from wordiness and repetition; the reader?s scarce time is not abused.? D Elizabeth Webster, Economic Record ?This reviewer found using this source exhilarating and endowed with additional interest in view of the 1997 discussion on the inclusion or noninclusion of Keynesian economics in introductory economics textbooks. The editors should be applauded for helping to preserve a part of intellectual heritage.? D Bogdan Mieczkowski, American Reference Books ?It is the best single reference source on Keynesian economics and will be welcomed by students and teachers in economics as well as scholars in related social sciences and government policy makers.? D Educational Book Review This thoroughly revised and updated second edition of a highly acclaimed and authoritative reference work introduces the major concepts in the field of Keynesian economics. The comprehensive Encyclopedia features accessible, informative and provocative contributions by leading international scholars working in the tradition of Keynes. It brings together widely dispersed yet theoretically congruent ideas, presents concise biographies of economists who have contributed to the debate on Keynes and the Keynesian Revolution, and outlines the basic principles, models and tools used to discuss the economic consequences of The General Theory. Longer entries on specific topics associated with Keynes and the Keynesian Revolution analyse the principal factors that contributed to The General Theory, the economics of Keynes and the rise and apparent decline of Keynesian economics in greater detail. The second edition will ensure that An Encyclopedia of Keynesian Economics will remain the best single reference source on Keynesian economics and will continue to be welcomed by academics, students and teachers of economics as well as by scholars in related social sciences and government policymakers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VZv7y22zDfoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Civilian at War (WWII)","description":"This intimately researched work tells the story of the thousand-plus Depression-era civilian contractors who came to Wake Island, a remote Pacific atoll, in 1941 to build an air station for the U.S. Navy. Author Gilbert charts the contractors' hard-won progress as they scramble to build the naval base as well as runways for U.S. Army Air Corps B-17 Flying Fortresses while war clouds gather over the Pacific. Five hours after their attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese struck Wake Island, which was now isolated from assistance. The undermanned Marine Corps garrison, augmented by civilian-contractor volunteers, fought back against repeated enemy attacks, at one point thwarting a massive landing assault. The atoll was under siege for two weeks as its defenders continued to hope for the U.S. Navy to come to their rescue. Finally succumbing to an overwhelming amphibious attack, the surviving Americans, military and civilian, were taken prisoner. While most were shipped off to Japanese POW camps for slave labor, a number of the civilians were retained as workers on occupied Wake. Later in the war the last ninety-eight Americans were brutally massacred by their captors. The civilian contractors who had risked distance and danger for well-paying jobs ended up paying a steep price: their freedom and, for many, their lives. Written by the daughter and granddaughter of civilians who served on Wake Island, Building for War sheds new light on why the United States was taken by surprise in December 1941 and shines a spotlight on the little-known, virtually forgotten story of a group of civilian workers and their families whose lives were forever changed by the events on the tiny atoll that is Wake. Bonita Gilbert has an MA in history from the University of Oregon and teaches history at North Idaho College.

E-I-E-I-O Tressa Jayne Turner has had it up to here with the dumb-blonde jokes and a childhood nickname that's harder to get rid of than her favorite pair of cowboy boots. Thanks to one Rick Townsend, Iowa Department of Natural Resources officer, local hottie, and general pain in Tressa's behind, everyone knows her as \\"Calamity Jayne\\". Just because she may be a little accident prone and trouble seems to sometimes find her, Tressa can't get anyone in her small town to take her seriously. That is, until Tressa finds a seriously dead body and an opportunity to get \\"Ranger Rick\\" and a skeptical citizenry to see that she's no longer that skinny kid with scraped knees. How? By resurrecting her job as a reporter for the hometown paper and solving a murder no one else believes happened... no one, that is, except the killer. Now Tressa is one not-so-dumb blonde who's out to gain a little hometown respect or die trying.

The Wersgorix, whose scouting ship it is, are quite expert at taking over planets, and having determined from orbit that this one was suitable, they initiate standard world-conquering procedure. Ah, but this time it's no mere primitives the Wersgorix seek to enslave?they've launched their invasion against free Englishmen! In the end, only one alien is left alive?and Sir Roger's grand vision is born. He intends for the creature to fly the ship first to France to aid his King, then on to the Holy Land to vanquish the infidel. Unfortunately, he has not allowed for the treachery of the alien pilot, who instead takes the craft to his home planet, where, he thinks, these upstart barbarians will have no choice but to surrender. But that knavish alien little understands the indomitable will and clever resourcefulness of Englishmen, no matter how great the odds against them...

This book offers the first detailed account of the popular film as it has grown and changed during the tumultuous decades of Indian nationhood. The study focuses on the cinema s characteristic forms, its range of meanings and pleasures, and, above all, its ideological construction of Indian national identity. Informed by theoretical developments in film theory, cultural studies, postcolonial discourse, and  Third World  cinema, the book identifies the major genres and movements within Bombay cinema since Independence and uses them to enter larger cultural debates about questions of identity, authenticity, citizenship, and collectivity. Chakravarty examines numerous films of the period, including Guide (Vijay Anand, 1965), Shri 420 [The gentleman cheat] (Raj Kapoor, 1955), and Bhumika [The role] (Shyam Benegal, 1977). She shows how  imperso-nation,  played out in masquerade and disguise, has characterized the representation of national identity in popular films, so that concerns and conflicts over class, communal, and regional differences are obsessively evoked, explored, and neutralized. These findings will be of interest to film and area specialists, as well as general readers in film studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l8T0uwJtMxkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hawaiian folk tales;: A collection of native legends,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YCbjDfB7mFgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Agriculture and the State in Soviet and Post-Soviet Russia (Pitt Russian East European)","description":"A comprehensive, original, and innovative analysis of the social, economic, and political factors affecting contemporary Russian reform, the book is organized around the central question of the role of the state and its effect on the course of Russian agrarian reform. In the wake of the collapse of the USSR, contemporary conventional wisdom holds the the Russian state is  weak.  Stephen Wegren feels that the traditional approach to the weak/strong state suffers from measurement and circular logic problems, believing that the Russian state, thought weaker than in its Soviet past, is still relatively stronger than other actors. The state s strength allows it to intervene in the rural sector in ways that other power contender cannot. Specifically, as a measure of state intervention, Wegren analyzes how the state has influenced urban-rural relations, rural-rural relations, and the nonstate (private) agricultural sector. Several dilemmas arose that have complicated successful agrarian reform as a result of the nature of state interventions, how reform policies were defined, and the incentives rhar arose from state-sponsored policies. During contemporary Russian agrarian reform, urban-rural differences have widened, marked by a deterioration in rural standards of living and increased alienation of rural political groups from urban alliances. At the same time, within the rural sector, reform failed to reverse rural egalitarianism. In addition, the nature of state interventions has undermined attempts to create a vibrant, productive private rural sector based on private farming. Wegren s research is based upon extensive field work, interviews, archival documents, and published and unpublished source material conducted over a six-year period, and he demonstrates the link between agrarian reform and the success of overall reform in Russia. This learned and often controversial volume will interest political scientists, policy makers, and scholars and students of contemporary Russia.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LRK78K_6yWUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mrs. Seely's Cook-Book: A Manual of French and American Cookery with Chapters on Domestic Servants, Their Rights and Duties, and Many Other Details of Household Management (Antique American Cookbooks)","description":"Combination French and American cookbook, with insights and suggestions for household management","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ddJNAQAAMAAJ&dq=Mrs.+Seely%27s+Cook-Book:+A+Manual+of+French+and+American+Cookery+with+Chapters+on+Domestic+Servants,+Their+Rights+and+Duties,+and+Many+Other+Details+of+Household+Management+(Antique+American+Cookbooks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Storytellers Sourcebook","description":"The first edition provides descriptions of folktales and references to more than 700 published sources of folktales.

NPR ? Chicago Tribune ? San Francisco Chronicle ? The Economist ? Deadspin Oklahoma City was born from chaos. It was founded in a bizarre but momentous  Land Run  in 1889, when thousands of people lined up along the borders of Oklahoma Territory and rushed in at noon to stake their claims. Since then, it has been a city torn between the wild energy that drives its outsized ambitions, and the forces of order that seek sustainable progress. Nowhere was this dynamic better realized than in the drama of the Oklahoma City Thunder basketball team s 2012-13 season, when the Thunder s brilliant general manager, Sam Presti, ignited a firestorm by trading future superstar James Harden just days before the first game. Presti s all-in gamble on  the Process  the patient, methodical management style that dictated the trade as the team s best hope for long-term greatness kicked off a pivotal year in the city s history, one that would include pitched battles over urban planning, a series of cataclysmic tornadoes, and the frenzied hope that an NBA championship might finally deliver the glory of which the city had always dreamed. Boom Town announces the arrival of an exciting literary voice. Sam Anderson, former book critic for New York magazine and now a staff writer at the New York Times magazine, unfolds an idiosyncratic mix of American history, sports reporting, urban studies, gonzo memoir, and much more to tell the strange but compelling story of an American city whose unique mix of geography and history make it a fascinating microcosm of the democratic experiment. Filled with characters ranging from NBA superstars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook; to Flaming Lips oddball frontman Wayne Coyne; to legendary Great Plains meteorologist Gary England; to Stanley Draper, Oklahoma City's would-be Robert Moses; to civil rights activist Clara Luper; to the citizens and public servants who survived the notorious 1995 bombing of the Alfred P.

People who claim to value freedom, tolerance, and the rule of law have increasingly embraced illiberal politicians and platforms. These citizens justifytheir rejection of democratic norms and traditions as a protest against a cast of \\"elite\\" villains, including globalists, militarists, journalists, bureaucrats, intellectuals, and of course, politicians. The only people these voters do not blame for the parlous state of their own democracies isthemselves. Is this just a passing moment in history, or a tide that threatens to wash away the democratic experiments of the past three centuries?In Our Own Worst Enemy, Tom Nichols challenges the current depictions of the rise of illiberal and anti-democratic movements in the United States and elsewhere as the result of the deprivations of globalization or the malign decisions of an undifferentiated \\"elite.\\" Rather, he places the blame forthe rise of illiberalism on a different source: the people themselves. Nichols traces the illiberalism of the 21st century to the growth of unchecked narcissism, rising standards of living, global peace, and a resistance to change -- all of which have been enabled by a hyper-connected internetculture of resentment. The grievances of ordinary citizens, legitimate or otherwise, are then exploited by political entrepreneurs who thrive on the creation of rage rather than on the encouragement of civic virtue and democratic cooperation. Is there any way out of this predicament? While it willbe difficult, Nichols argues that first and foremost, we need to revitalize civic culture, which we can only do by resurrecting the virtues of stoicism, compromise, and cooperation. We also need to recognize how good we actually had it in the immediate pre-COVID era - the period when the trendtoward illiberalism took off and accelerated.Trenchant, contrarian, and highly engaging, Our Own Worst Enemy reframes the debate about how democracies have ended up in this dire state of affairs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Opg5EAAAQBAJ&dq=Our+Own+Worst+Enemy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oliver's Wars","description":"When his father is assigned to Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, Oliver his mother and twin brother move east to live with his grandparents.

The story that inspired Dark Waters, the major motion picture from Focus Features starring Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway, directed by Todd Haynes. 1998: Rob Bilott is a young lawyer specializing in helping big corporations stay on the right side of environmental laws and regulations. Then he gets a phone call from a West Virginia farmer named Earl Tennant, who is convinced the creek on his property is being poisoned by runoff from a neighboring DuPont landfill, causing his cattle and the surrounding wildlife to die in hideous ways. Earl hasn t even been able to get a water sample tested by any state or federal regulatory agency or find a local lawyer willing to take the case. As soon as they hear the name DuPont the area s largest employer they shut him down. Once Rob sees the thick, foamy water that bubbles into the creek, the gruesome effects it seems to have on livestock, and the disturbing frequency of cancer and other health problems in the area, he s persuaded to fight against the type of corporation his firm routinely represents. After intense legal wrangling, Rob ultimately gains access to hundreds of thousands of pages of DuPont documents, some of them fifty years old, that reveal the company has been holding onto decades of studies proving the harmful effects of a chemical called PFOA, used in making Teflon. PFOA is often called a  forever chemical,  because once in the environment, it does not break down or degrade for millions of years, contaminating the planet forever. The case of one farmer soon spawns a class action suit on behalf of seventy thousand residents and the shocking realization that virtually every person on the planet has been exposed to PFOA and carries the chemical in his or her blood. What emerges is a riveting legal drama  in the grand tradition of Jonathan Harr s A Civil Action  (Booklist, starred review) about malice and manipulation, the failings of environmental regulation; and one lawyer s twenty-year struggle to expose the truth about this previously unknown and still unregulated chemical that we all have inside us.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hzjsDwAAQBAJ&dq=Exposure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scheherezade in the Marketplace: Elizabeth Gaskell and the Victorian Novel","description":"Specifically, she explores how Gaskell used what seems to be the most conventional plot her culture offered, the heroine's courtship plot, to revise cultural expectations, and to open up the novel to new ideas and new forms. Examining the structure of Gaskell's final novels, Schor illustrates the possibilities offered therein for alternative fictions. By following the evolution of the heroine's plot throughout Gaskell's career, and tracing her development as a novelist, this study places Gaskell's fiction back in the marketplace of Victorian literature. Bringing to light her connections with Pre-Raphaelite aesthetics, her response to Darwin, changes brought on by industrialization, and her continuing battles over publication with Charles Dickens, Schor re-orients discussion of the seemingly ahistorical forms of the novel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VMJaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Scheherezade+in+the+Marketplace:+Elizabeth+Gaskell+and+the+Victorian+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Calcutta","description":"A biography of the founder of the Missionary Sisters and Brothers of Charity, known for her work with the destitute and dying in the streets and slums of Calcutta and other cities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=irChNAAACAAJ&dq=Calcutta&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","description":"A Soviet journalist documents the experiences of Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan, detailing the soldiers' morale, the prevalence of drug problems, and the Russian withdrawal and the aftermath.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2yBpaabsHgEC&dq=The+Hidden+War:+A+Russian+Journalist%27s+Account+of+the+Soviet+War+in+Afghanistan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Back Bay","description":"When the Golden Eagle tea set given to George Washington mysteriously disappears in 1814, there is reason to suspect Horace Taylor Pratt, the founding father of a family cursed with a legacy of unaccountable deaths and outright murders that continues foreight generations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RqHroQEACAAJ&dq=Back+Bay&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hospital industrial engineering;: A guide to the improvement of hospital management systems (Reinhold industrial engineering and management sciences series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c4VrAAAAMAAJ&dq=Hospital+industrial+engineering%3B:+A+guide+to+the+improvement+of+hospital+management+systems+(Reinhold+industrial+engineering+and+management+sciences+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Promise Keepers and the New Masculinity","description":"This collection of essays explores the varied, sometimes contradictory, and often misapprehended nature of the Promise Keepers. The various media portrayals of this group do not adequately address important questions about their significance for American religious, social, and cultural life. Is this movement anti-feminist, or are the men involved using their faith to become more responsible husbands and fathers? Is this a political movement, or just another example of an American religious revival? Using interviews, surveys, and on-site participations, the scholars writing here find little truth in the popular depictions of Promise Keepers. In fact, they demonstrate how this group represents a variety of templates that contemporary American culture brings to religion as a general social phenomenon. The volume examines the ways religion affects social movements, and also puts the current interest in men and masculinity in a larger historical context of changing gender roles. As a phenomenon that strikes right at the intersection of religion, gender, racial relations, public life, and national identity, Promise Keepers will be provocative reading for students, scholars, and educated readers alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CsHmN5K29iAC&dq=Promise+Keepers+and+the+New+Masculinity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Formula For Happiness","description":"The Formula for Happiness is a self-help book which popularizes cutting-edge discoveries made by a board certified clinical psychologist about the nature of happiness and the behaviors and beliefs which enable people to become and remain happy. His groundbreaking way of understanding life and how to live has attracted worldwide attention since it was originally introduced to the scietific community in New Ideas in Psychology: an international journal of innovative theory in psychology in 1996. This is a peer reviewed journal produced by the world's largest publisher of original scientific work and overseen by an editorial board consisting of faculty from departments of psychology in several of the world's leading universities. The Formula for Happiness presents this paradigm for the pursuit of happiness in a format which is entertaining and easily understood. It familiarizes readers with what they need to become and remain happy and how to proceed with their personal pursuit of happiness. Readers are provided with an objective means of measuring current levels of happiness as well as methods for increasing happiness and forecasting the effect potential courses of action are likely to have on their happiness at some future point in time. The Formula for Happiness is the product of an innovative approach to the study of happiness which incorporates and surpasses research currently going on in the field of positive psychology in a number of important ways. It is based on generalizations emerging from the review of massive amounts of positive psychology research integrated with insights into the nature of happiness emerging from the fields of clinical and developmental psychology. It provides a comprehensive and coherent set of propositions about the nature of happiness which is different from anything available elswere in scientific and self-help literature today. The Formula for Happiness is the first solidly scientifically-based self-help book to assert that happiness is primarily a matter of how people are situated with respect to the circumstances of their lives. Beyond making this assertion, it actually specifies exactly which circumstances make a difference in the of quality of human life. It precisely identifies what we require in order to become and remain happy. The Formula for Happiness is also the first solidly scientifically-based self-help book to assert that happiness is a matter of choice. In addition to advancing this proposition, it provides readers with the only set of scientically formulated guidelines for making choices which have happiness as their effect. It is the first book to present a set of principles for the pursuit of happiness which, like the principles of nutrition and health, are the product of scientific reasoning and research. In showing readers how happiness is mainly a matter of circumstances and that circumstances are largely a matter of choice, The Formula for Happiness provides a new and much needed counterpoint to most of the thinking within psychology as well as much of what is available on the self-help market today. Instead of promoting the notion that happiness is a matter of what we think, how we perceive, or how we interpret things, The Formula for Happiness shows readers how quality of life is a matter of the way things really are and what we actually do. It is the first self-help book to provide a blueprint for constructing a durable high quality life. In addition to presenting a pioneering paradigm for the pursuit of happiness, The Formula for Happiness contains a set of newly developed psychometric instruments. Readers can use these instruments to measure happiness, to develop goals for personal strategic planning, and to make momentous decisions such as what to major in at college, which career to pursue, whether to take a particular job, whether to remain in a romantic relationship, whether to g","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gRtwEoLschIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dynasty of Death (Dodens Dynasti)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yyJRvQEACAAJ&dq=Dynasty+of+Death+(Dodens+Dynasti)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Cannot Tell A Lie: The True Story of George Washington's African American Descendants","description":"The First President: Documented national history tells us that the nation's first president had no children.

Quartet and The Underworld USA Trilogy, James Ellroy, presents another literary masterpiece, this time a true crime murder mystery about his own mother. In 1958 Jean Ellroy was murdered, her body dumped on a roadway in a seedy L.A. suburb. Her killer was never found, and the police dismissed her as a casualty of a cheap Saturday night. James Ellroy was ten when his mother died, and he spent the next thirty-six years running from her ghost and attempting to exorcize it through crime fiction. In 1994, Ellroy quit running. He went back to L.A., to find out the truth about his mother--and himself. In My Dark Places, our most uncompromising crime writer tells what happened when he teamed up with a brilliant homicide cop to investigate a murder that everyone else had forgotten--and reclaim the mother he had despised, desired, but never dared to love.

Revised and expanded in 1568, Vasari s monumental work comprises more than two hundred biographies; for centuries it has been recognized as a seminal text in art history and one of the most important sources on the Italian Renaissance. Vasari s biography of Michelangelo, the longest in his Lives, presents Michelangelo s oeuvre as the culminating achievement of Renaissance painting, sculpture, and architecture. He tells the grand story of the artist s expansive career, profiling his working habits; describing the creation of countless masterpieces, from the David to the Sistine Chapel ceiling; and illuminating his relationships with popes and other illustrious patrons. A lifelong friend, Vasari also quotes generously from the correspondence between the two men; the narrative is further enhanced by an abundance of colorful anecdotes. The volume s forty-two illustrations convey the range and richness of Michelangelo s art. An introduction by the scholar David Hemsoll traces the textual development of Vasari s Lives and situates his biography of Michelangelo in the broader context of Renaissance art history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4PI9DwAAQBAJ&dq=Michelangelo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AMERICAS BIRTHDAY","description":"This little book presents the story of the founding of America in words that are simple enough for a toddler to understand.

In 1976 the inhabitants of Pukapuka, a Polynesian island in the South Pacific, revived a traditional form of social organization that several authoritative Pukapukan informants claimed to have experienced previously in their youth. Yet five professional anthropologists, who conducted research on the island prior to 1976, do not mention it in any of their writings. Had the Pukapukans 'invented' a new tradition? Or had the anthropologists collectively erred in not recording an old one? In unraveling this puzzle, Robert Borofsky compares two different ways of 'making history', two different ways of constructing knowledge about the past. He examines the dynamic nature of Pukapukan knowledge focusing on how Pukapukans, in the process of learning and validating their traditions, continually change them. He also shows how anthropologists, in the process of writing about such traditions for Western audiences, often overstructure them, emphasizing uniformity at the expense of diversity, stasis at the expense of change. As well as being of interest for what it reveals about Pukapukan (and more generally Polynesian) culture, Making History helps clarify important strengths and limitations of the anthropological approach. It provides valuable insights into both the anthropological construction of knowledge and the nature of anthropological understanding.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kP5la8DMWGsC&dq=Making+History:+Pukapukan+and+Anthropological+Constructions+of+Knowledge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Food and Cookery for the Sick and Convalescent","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8noEAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Revenge by Love","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mvtaAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Revenge+by+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Double Your Sales by Asking a Few More Questions: Making More Sales by Helping People Get What They Really Want","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EDewAAAACAAJ&dq=How+to+Double+Your+Sales+by+Asking+a+Few+More+Questions:+Making+More+Sales+by+Helping+People+Get+What+They+Really+Want&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Photo Journal Guide to Comic Books (VOL I: A-J & VOL II: K-Z)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HaBfcgAACAAJ&dq=The+Photo+Journal+Guide+to+Comic+Books+(VOL+I:+A-J&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Awesome Book of Bible Trivia","description":"This fun collection of more than 1700 trivia questions brings together some of the very best in Bible brainteasers, riddles, and puns.

New York Times bestselling author Brian Herbert chronicles the amazing exploits of these gallant seamen, assembling a fascinating array of data from historical documents, government records, diaries, and interviews with surviving veterans. This brilliant history details the heroism, self-sacrifice and grim determination that have always been the hallmark of the United States Merchant Marine. Herbert also reveals one of the great injustices of American history. The civilian fighters of the Merchant Marine performed feats of extraordinary bravery during World War II; they were the lifeline of the entire Allied war effort, delivering troops, materiel, food, fuel, and every essential needed for victory over the Axis. In doing so, the Merchant Marine suffered losses so high that the casualty rates were kept secret. At war's end, the men and women of every other service branch were honored by parades and given medical and educational benefits--but the members of the Merchant Marine, who were so vital to our victory, have received neither the benefits nor the recognition they deserved.

Can these strategies still work for other countries? If changes are required, what resources can be mobilized in the public and private sectors?

In this major reinterpretation of epic poetry beginning with Virgil, David Quint explores the political context and meanings of key works in Western literature. He divides the history of the genre into two political traditions: the Virgilian epics of conquest and empire that take the victors' side (the Aeneid itself, Camoes's Lus adas, Tasso's Gerusalemme liberata) and the countervailing epic of the defeated and of republican liberty (Lucan's Pharsalia, Ercilla's Araucana, and d'Aubign 's Les tragiques). These traditions produce opposing ideas of historical narrative: a linear, teleological narrative that belongs to the imperial conquerors, and an episodic and open-ended narrative identified with \\"romance,\\" the story told of and by the defeated. Quint situates Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained within these rival traditions. He extends his political analysis to the scholarly revival of medieval epic in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and to Sergei Eisenstein's epic film, Alexander Nevsky. Attending both to the topical contexts of individual poems and to the larger historical development of the epic genre, Epic and Empire provides new models for exploring the relationship between ideology and literary form.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7Q4CEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lions of Tsavo : Exploring the Legacy of Africa's Notorious Man-Eaters","description":"Through field research and forensic evidence, a scientist reveals his theory on why two Kenyan lions killed humans and then ate their prey.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JaJs5YlW-RIC&dq=The+Lions+of+Tsavo+:+Exploring+the+Legacy+of+Africa%27s+Notorious+Man-Eaters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wire Song","description":"This youth songbook features 156 group songs, and is designed especially for academy and college use.

David Hilbert Over the last 15 years I have given lectures on a variety of problems in nonlinear functional analysis and its applications. In doing this, I have recommended to my students a number of excellent monographs devoted to specialized topics, but there was no complete survey-type exposition of nonlinear functional analysis making available a quick survey to the wide range of readers including mathematicians, natural scientists, and engineers who have only an elementary knowledge of linear functional analysis. I have tried to close this gap with my five-part lecture notes, the first three parts of which have been published in the Teubner-Texte series by Teubner-Verlag, Leipzig, 1976, 1977, and 1978. The present English edition was translated from a completely rewritten manuscript which is significantly longer than the original version in the Teubner-Texte series. The material is organized in the following way: Part I: Fixed Point Theorems. Part II: Monotone Operators. Part III: Variational Methods and Optimization. Parts IV jV: Applications to Mathematical Physics. The exposition is guided by the following considerations: (a) What are the supporting basic ideas and what intrinsic interrelations exist between them? (/3) In what relation do the basic ideas stand to the known propositions of classical analysis and linear functional analysis? ( y) What typical applications are there?

Mangual offers an incisive critique of America's increasingly radical criminal justice reform movement, and makes a convincing case against the pursuit of \\"justice\\" through mass-decarceration and depolicing. After a summer of violent protests in 2020 sparked by the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Rayshard Brooks a dangerously false narrative gained mainstream acceptance: Criminal justice in the United States is overly punitive and racially oppressive. But, the harshest and loudest condemnations of incarceration, policing, and prosecution are often shallow and at odds with the available data. And the significant harms caused by this false narrative are borne by those who can least afford them: black and brown people who are disproportionately the victims of serious crimes. In Criminal (In)Justice, Rafael A. Mangual offers a more balanced understanding of American criminal justice, and cautions against discarding traditional crime control measures. A powerful combination of research, data-driven policy journalism, and the author's lived experiences, this book explains what many reform advocates get wrong, and illustrates how the misguided commitment to leniency places America's most vulnerable communities at risk. The stakes of this moment are incredibly high. Ongoing debates over criminal justice reform have the potential to transform our society for a generation for better or for worse. Grappling with the data and the sometimes harsh realities they reflect is the surest way to minimize the all-too-common injustices plaguing neighborhoods that can least afford them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JVFVEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oval Web","description":"This second edition of The Principles of Beautiful Web Design is the ideal book for people who can build websites, but are seeking the skills and knowledge to visually enhance their sites.

Turn the oval panel to the required date and time to reveal the whole sky visible from your location.The map, by the well-known celestial cartographer Wil Tirion, shows stars down to magnitude 5, plus several deep-sky objects, such as the Pleiades, the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and the Orion Nebula (M42). Because the planets move round the Sun, their positions in the sky are constantly changing and they cannot be marked permanently on the map; however, the back of the planisphere has tables giving the positions of Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn for every month until 2020.The planisphere is supplied in a full-colour wallet that contains illustrated step-by-step instructions for how to use the planisphere, how to locate planets, and how to work out the time of sunrise or sunset for any day of the year. It explains all the details that can be seen on the map - the magnitudes of stars, the ecliptic and the celestial coordinates. In addition, the section 'Exploring the skies, season by season' introduces the novice astronomer to the principal celestial objects visible at different times of the year. Major constellations are used as signposts to navigate the night sky, locating hard-to-find stars and some fascinating deep-sky objects.

Indeed, proposes Stephen Wilson, the role of the artist is not only to interpret and to spread scientific knowledge, but to be an active partner in determining the direction of research. Years ago, C. P. Snow wrote about the \\"two cultures\\" of science and the humanities; these developments may finally help to change the outlook of those who view science and technology as separate from the general culture. In this rich compendium, Wilson offers the first comprehensive survey of international artists who incorporate concepts and research from mathematics, the physical sciences, biology, kinetics, telecommunications, and experimental digital systems such as artificial intelligence and ubiquitous computing. In addition to visual documentation and statements by the artists, Wilson examines relevant art-theoretical writings and explores emerging scientific and technological research likely to be culturally significant in the future.

In Puerto Rico under Colonial Rule, academics and intellectuals from the fields of political science, history, sociology, and law examine three themes: evidence of state-sponsored political persecution in the twentieth century, contemporary issues, and the case of Vieques.

An anarchist who has been in exile from his native Spain for more than twenty years, he lives with his daughter in Paris, but in his mind he is still fighting the Spanish Civil War. He fulminates against the daily papers; he brags about his past exploits. He has become bigoted, self-important, and obsessed; a bully to his fellow exiles and a tyrant to his daughter, Pascualita. Then a family member dies in Madrid and there is an inheritance to sort out. Pascualita wants to go to Spain, which is supposedly opening up in response to the 1960s, and Don Celestino feels he has no choice but to follow. He is full of dread and desire, foreseeing a heroic last confrontation with his enemies, but what he encounters instead is a new commercialized Spain that has no time for the past, much less for him. Or so it seems. Because the last act of Don Celestino s dizzying personal drama will prove that though  there is nothing serious . . . , there is tragedy.  An astonishing modern take on Don Quixote, Chaos and Night untangles the ties between politics and paranoia, self-loathing and self-pity, rage and remorse. It is the darkly funny final flowering of the art of Henry de Montherlant, a solitary and scarifying modern master whose work, admired by Graham Greene and Albert Camus, is sure to appeal to contemporary readers of Thomas Bernhard and Roberto Bola?o.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BQGf2CIPqugC&dq=Chaos+and+night,:+A+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Neptune: The planet, rings and satellites (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","description":"This is the most comprehensive and up-to-date book on the topic of planetary rings systems yet written.

From cell-phones to personal computers, no human being today can escape it. Automobiles are no exception to this rule. With the ever changing emission laws of today, the one constant in the automotive industry is that things always change and will continue to do so. OBD II was designed from the beginning to do so as well. Late model vehicle systems are much more demanding, in both the amount of technology they posses and in the knowledge necessary to repair them. This work was designed to just that, a step-by step diagnostic approach to OBD II systems. It is also written with the State Inspections in mind. This is in direct response to the increasing adoption of OBD II inspections by most States throughout the country. OBD II repair don t have to be difficult or cumbersome and knowledge is the key to successful OBD II diagnostics and repair. About the Author Mandy Concepcion has worked in the automotive field for over 21 years. He holds a Degree in Applied Electronics Engineering as well as an ASE Master & L1 certification.

Thus we are able to share our special skills to the benefit of patients. This book is an excellent example of the advantage of interdisciplinary communication and demonstrates a refreshing holistic approach to the problems of incontinence and pelvic pain. Written with physiotherapists in mind, the editors have invited contributions from many distinguished experts in their own field. These have been compiled into a comprehensive book, which will appeal to many healthcare professionals. I have had great pleasure in reading this book. During the time that I have been involved with 'pelvic dysfunction' there have been many exciting advances. These are all included in a most readable sequence, some presented with a refreshing new twist. In particular, I would like to bring to your attention the section on 'pelvic pain'. Because of our lack of understanding it has been a problem that is too often ignored and here at last are some practical ideas for therapeutic management. There is still much progress to be made in the field of incontinence and pelvic pain and as yet, no editors can be expected to produce a definitive work. However, I would like to recommend this book most strongly. It has a new approach to this topic, which is still a major problem for many people.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h-8xBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bonfires and Beacons: Great Lakes Lighthouses","description":"Husband and wife team Larry and Patricia Wright travelled throughout the Great Lakes region to capture the most interesting and beautiful lighthouses.

This knowledge is vital because, as author Tom Rosenbauer notes, trout are shy and careful and can be fussy about what they eat. In addition, they won t hesitate to swim away and leave a meal if they feel threatened. In The Orvis Streamside Guide to Trout Foods and Their Imitations, Rosenbauer explains how and when to use many types of trout foods, including aquatic insects, terrestrial insects, crustaceans, and more. Designed with both the novice and intermediate fly fisher in mind, Rosenbauer teaches readers how to: Ambush trout Identify types of insects Present trout food properly Observe what trout are eating Use imitation trout foods And more With The Orvis Streamside Guide to Trout Foods and Their Imitations at their sides, fly fishermen will be able to tell the difference between mayflies, stoneflies, caddisflies, midges, and a variety of other insects. In addition, they will also know when to use real foods and when to rely on the imitations in their tackle boxes. Skyhorse Publishing is proud to publish a broad range of books for fishermen. Our books for anglers include titles that focus on fly fishing, bait fishing, fly-casting, spin casting, deep sea fishing, and surf fishing.

High-school English textbooks answer this question, with regard to what is taught in English class anyway, and the answer is what students have always suspected: There is no good reason to know much of what they are being taught. English textbooks are full of such egregious errors that their publication demonstrates that one needs no more than a superficial knowledge of their subject matter to edit or write for them. If those who are responsible for introducing students to literary studies do not need to know the subject, indifferent adolescents have a right to wonder why they should bother to do their schoolwork. Indeed, if teachers are passing on the information that is being provided by textbook companies, students may be better off ignoring their reading assignments. Excerpt The examination of the lives of Desiderius Erasmus and Thomas More is particularly revealing of the kind of ignorance that a book publisher will accept from its employees. After briefly reviewing his life and interests, the text notes that Erasmus was friends with More and points out that the two friends \\"had much in common\\" (199). This is true enough, but having stumbled upon the fact that Erasmus and More had much in common, the text proceeds to explain what they had in common, and error, egregious as well as obvious, raises its ugly head. To determine the commonalities between these two thinkers, the person working on the text must have decided that what was true of Erasmus must also have been true of More. Both thinkers, the person thus concludes, must have been \\"dedicated churchmen\\" (199). Erasmus was a churchman: He was a monk. More, by contrast, was a lawyer who became Lord Chancellor of England, something mentioned in the text. He was, in other words, a layman, not a churchman, despite his refusing to acknowledge that Henry VIII was Supreme Head of the Church of England and losing his head for his intransigence. A churchman, as Catholics understand the term, is one who has taken religious vows and become a member of the clergy, as More considered doing before he settled into his career as a lawyer. The word churchman, it is true, began to mean a member of a Church in the late seventeenth century, but when it is used in this sense, the word is only applied to the members of Anglican state churches throughout the world, that is, The Church of England, The Church of Ireland, and so on (OED). Neither Erasmus nor More were churchman in this sense, both being Catholics, and anyone in possession of a decent dictionary could have found that out.

This strategy has been used to argue for merely limited reform in the use of animals. This strategy was initially employed as a way of  sympathetically  responding to the abolitionist claims of anti-vivisectionists, who objected to the use of animals in research. It was subsequently used by farm animal scientists. The primarily reformist (as opposed to abolitionist) goals of this community make the false assumption that there are conditions under which animals may be raised and slaughtered for food or used as models in scientific research that are ethically acceptable. The tendency of the animal welfare science community is to accept this assumption as their framework of inquiry, and thus to discount certain practices as harmful to the interests of the animals that they affect. For example, animal welfare is conceptualized is such a way that death does not count as harmful to the interests of animal, nor prolonged life a benefit.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=n6MD2f5HaS0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ballistics of the future,: With special reference to the dynamical and physical theory of the rocket weapons","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9e32SAAACAAJ&dq=Ballistics+of+the+future,:+With+special+reference+to+the+dynamical+and+physical+theory+of+the+rocket+weapons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The source of light","description":"Price follows the immense success of The Surface of Earth with this vividly evocative and stylistically impressive stand-alone sequel. \\"A novel of real emotion, real connection, real life\\".--The Boston Globe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HZCAOpTLU3QC&dq=The+source+of+light&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","description":"From the bestselling author of Einstein s Dreams comes this harrowing tale of one man's struggle to cope in a wired world, even as his own biological wiring short-circuits.

Without attempting a full-scale history of American higher education, it outlines a theory about its development and present status. It is illustrated with firsthand observations of a wide variety of colleges and universities the country over-colleges for the rich and colleges for the upwardly mobile; colleges for vocationally oriented men and colleges for intellectually and socially oriented women; colleges for Catholics and colleges for Protestants; colleges for blacks and colleges for rebellious whites. The authors also look at some of the revolution's consequences. They see it as intensifying conflict between young and old, and provoking young people raised in permissive, middle-class homes to attacks on the legitimacy of adult authority. In the process, the revolution subtly transformed the kinds of work to which talented young people aspire, contributing to the decline of entrepreneurship and the rise of professionalism. They conclude that mass higher education, for all its advantages, has had no measurable effect on the rate of social mobility or the degree of equality in American society. Jencks and Riesman are not nostalgic; their description of the nineteenth-century liberal arts colleges is corrosively critical. They maintain that American students know more than ever before, that their teachers are more competent and stimulating than in earlier times, and that the American system of higher education has brought the American people to an unprecedented level of academic competence. But while they regard the academic revolution as having been an historically necessary and progressive step, they argue that, like all revolutions, it can devour its children. For Jencks and Riesman, academic professionalism is an advance over amateur gentility, but they warn of its dangers and limitations: the elitism and arrogance implicit in meritocracy, the myopia that derives from a strictly academic view of human experience and understanding, the complacency that comes from making technical competence an end rather than a means. Christopher Jencks is Malcolm Wiener Professor of Social Policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He is the author of Rethinking Social Policy: Race, Poverty and the Underclass, The Homeless, and co-editor of The Black-White Text Score Gap.

Think of her overall themes: Mennonites and sex, a novel connection. Yet Eve's Striptease uses these two lenses to focus on the world. However, viewing the book only in terms of ethnicity and biology trivializes what is a significant work by a brilliant young poet. . . . It is a book about coming to terms with one's sexuality and how that affects one's place in the world.\\" --Pittsburgh Quarterly \\"Most readers will be grateful for the gift outright of Kasdorf's achingly beautiful language of desire and of a \\"full store\\" of unavoidable passings from discovery to dark discovery and from expectations and surprises of childhood to retrospections and surprises of adulthood.\\" --Mennonite Quarterly Review \\"Crosshatched by body, spirit, and the relation between them; animated by bright instinctive exchanges between carnal and religious zones of experience; driven by an honest, explicitly female consciousness of what 'animal' and 'soul' might mean, the poems in Eve's Striptease keep pace with a considered life in its search for some consoling 'homeliness' in the world.\\" --Eamon Grennan Julia Kasdorf grew up in Western Pennsylvania.

This new edition of Colin Bennett's modern classic posits, in the author's uniquely engaging style, Adamski as a kind of unwitting performance artist who \\"structured one of the most blatant acts of visionary cheek of the twentieth century,\\" introducing the jittery postwar Western world to the image of the UFO, which confounded and tweaked authority while also fully embodying Cold War neuroses. Whether Adamski was telling the truth or not is almost irrelevant-though Bennett has his own ideas about Adamski's veracity. What remains compelling about Adamski's bizarre and compelling tale of alien visitations is the transformative power of stories, even if they're false, to warp our culture on a grand scale. In the course of a delightfully misspent youth, COLIN BENNETT was employed as both a musician and as a mercenary soldier. He was far better at the second than at the first. Educated at Balliol College, Oxford, he is the author of the novels Infantryman and The Entertainment Bomb, and paranormal nonfiction including Politics of the Imagination, a biography of Charles Fort; and An American Demonology, about the head of the 1950s UFO-hunting agency Project Blue Book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xhq_QrcWnF8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rise of the Dutch Republic - Volume 1","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XhHUzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Rise+of+the+Dutch+Republic+-+Volume+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Business France: A Practical Guide to Understanding French Business Culture","description":"This study outlines and defines key terms and concepts behind negotiation tactics that have been effective throughout history.

Is it drifting without purpose or resolve? Put an end to that by using Lyle E. Schaller's potent prescription for passive churches. Written for both lay and ordained congregational leaders, this timely book diagnoses the causes of church passivity, and formulates a method for combatting the problem. Dr. Schaller classifies churches according to their internal dynamics (rather than denomination or geographical location), and demonstrates how many have overcome the \\"twenty-year syndrome\\" - that awkward time when relatively new churches tend to lose their sense of direction. He also shows how churches can make a smooth transition from one pastor to another, and how new members can be used in establishing an effective church program. The cumulative result of twenty years of experience in parish trouble-shooting, Dr. Schaller's new book will be welcomed by church leaders everywhere who face the dreaded spectre of church passivity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1KlZOo9L3C0C&dq=Activating+the+Passive+Church+Diagnosis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Veeck-- as in wreck: The autobiography of Bill Veeck (Sports library)","description":"Bill Veeck was an inspired team builder, a consummate showman, and one of the greatest baseball men ever involved in the game.

Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her. Through their parallel experience of love - and its threatened loss - the sisters learn that sense must mix with sensibility if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money govern the rules of love.

But nowhere is too far for painful memories to find her when her ex-husband, who left her single in her sixties, arrives with his new lady love to attend a family affair. Catherine can't avoid him at the awards ceremony honoring their son-in-law, Peter, who is a shoo-in for a prestigious appointment at Oxford's Mercy College. But the shock of Peter not being chosen is matched only by who is: pompous, womanizing scholar Edgar Stone. And when Stone is found murdered, Peter's guilt seems hardly academic.... Patricia Harwin, who introduced a \\"charming, compassionate\\" (The New Mystery Reader) heroine in Arson and Old Lace, shows once again why an American woman in an English town can unearth a whole lot of trouble.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y7J4C9wtJBIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Warrior's Camera","description":"The Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa, who died at the age of 88, has been internationally acclaimed as a giant of world cinema. Rashomon, which won both the Venice Film Festival's grand prize and an Academy Award for best foreign-language film, helped ignite Western interest in the Japanese cinema. Seven Samurai and Yojimbo remain enormously popular both in Japan and abroad. In this newly revised and expanded edition of his study of Kurosawa's films, Stephen Prince provides two new chapters that examine Kurosawa's remaining films, placing him in the context of cinema history. Prince also discusses how Kurosawa furnished a template for some well-known Hollywood directors, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and George Lucas. Providing a new and comprehensive look at this master filmmaker, The Warrior's Camera probes the complex visual structure of Kurosawa's work. The book shows how Kurosawa attempted to symbolize on film a course of national development for post-war Japan, and it traces the ways that he tied his social visions to a dynamic system of visual and narrative forms. The author analyzes Kurosawa's entire career and places the films in context by drawing on the director's autobiography--a fascinating work that presents Kurosawa as a Kurosawa character and the story of his life as the kind of spiritual odyssey witnessed so often in his films. After examining the development of Kurosawa's visual style in his early work, The Warrior's Camera explains how he used this style in subsequent films to forge a politically committed model of filmmaking. It then demonstrates how the collapse of Kurosawa's efforts to participate as a filmmaker in the tasks of social reconstruction led to the very different cinematic style evident in his most recent films, works of pessimism that view the world as resistant to change.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qG3dDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Free Enterprise: A Novel","description":"In 1858, two black women meet at a restaurant named Free Enterprise to plot a revolution.

So, when a beautiful young woman turns up at the door, imploring London's foremost private detective to solve the mystery of her father's murder, Grice can barely disguise his glee.

And in the rugged Utah town of Adenville in the early years of this century, there were many who needed her compassion and generosity. So when Papa died and her own children were grown, it was natural for Mamma to open her home to others. Among her boarders were Sarah Martin, angular and tight-lipped, a schoolteacher who took to smoking cigars to win the man she loved...Alonzo Strang, a retired sea captain whose last heroic voyage was in a rowboat...the fastidious faro dealer, Floyd Thompson, who started going to church again so that he could stay at Mamma s dining table...Mr. Hackett, Papa s successor as editor of the Advocate, a bachelor so solitary he had almost forgotten how to live with others...and Judge Gibson, competing against the memory of a dead man for Mamma s love. Continuing his family reminiscences from the best-selling Papa Married a Mormon, John D. Fitzgerald presents a spirited picture of a frontier community. Adenville was a town where a gunfighter shot out his last battle strapped to a lamppost...where the townspeople singing Rock of Ages saved a man from being lynched...where a red-headed artist won his sweetheart in a mad chase across the Utah desert...and where honest conniving staved off an Indian raid. There are moments of suspense as the townspeople rescue a child from his deranged grandfather...moments of hilarity as a pig named Beatrice the Beautiful plays the part of Cupid...moments of terror as a vicious bully menaces the entire town...and many scenes of warm and affectionate family life in Mamma s boarding house. A poignant, humorous and exciting saga, illuminated by Mamma s radiant generosity and tolerance, Mamma s Boarding House is a worthy successor to the highly-praised Papa Married a Mormon.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K8ZQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"2001 Poet's Market (Poet's Market, 2001)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eEYMpNDfQ9sC&dq=2001+Poet%27s+Market+(Poet%27s+Market,+2001)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Culture and Consumption II: Markets, Meaning, and Brand Management (v. 2)","description":"\\"This book compiles and integrates highly innovative work aimed at bridging the fields of anthropology and consumer behavior.\\"  Journal of Consumer Affairs \\"... fascinating... ambitious and interesting... \\"  Canadian Advertising Foundation Newsletter \\"... an anthropological dig into consumerism brimming with original thought... \\"  The Globe and Mail \\"Grant McCracken has written a provocative book that puts consumerism in its place in Western society at the centre.\\"  Report on Business Magazine \\"... a stimulating addition to knowledge and theory about the interrelationship of culture and consumption.\\"  Choice \\"[McCracken's] synthesis of anthropological and consumer studies material will give historians new ideas and methods to integrate into their thinking.\\"  Maryland Historian \\"The book offers a fresh and much needed cultural interpretation of consumption.\\"  Journal of Consumer Policy \\"The volume will help balance the prevailing cognitive and social psychological cast of consumer research and should stimulate more comprehensive investigation into consumer behavior.\\"  Journal of Marketing Research \\"... broad scope, enthusiasm and imagination... a significant contribution to the literature on consumption history, consumer behavior, and American material culture.\\"  Winterhur Portfolio \\"For this is a superb book, a definitive exploration of its subject that makes use of the full range of available literature.\\"  American Journal of Sociology \\"McCracken's book is a fine synthesis of a new current of thought that strives to create an interdisciplinary social science of consumption behaviors, a current to which folklorists have much to contribute.\\"  Journal of American Folklore This provocative book takes a refreshing new view of the culture of consumption.

Warrior monks in their armed citadels block the road to the capital; castles are destroyed, villages plundered, fields put to the torch. Amid this devastation, three men dream of uniting the nation. At one extreme is the charismatic but brutal Nobunaga, whose ruthless ambition crushes all before him. At the opposite pole is the cold, deliberate Ieyasu, wise in counsel, brave in battle, mature beyond his years. But the keystone of this triumvirate is the most memorable of all, Hideyoshi, who rises from the menial post of sandal bearer to become Taiko--absolute ruler of Japan in the Emperor's name. When Nobunaga emerges from obscurity by destroying an army ten times the size of his own, he allies himself with Ieyasu, whose province is weak, but whose canniness and loyalty make him invaluable. Yet it is the scrawny, monkey-faced Hideyoshi--brash, impulsive, and utterly fearless--who becomes the unlikely savior of this ravaged land. Born the son of a farmer, he takes on the world with nothing but his bare hands and his wits, turning doubters into loyal servants, rivals into faithful friends, and enemies into allies. In all this he uses a piercing insight into human nature that unlocks castle gates, opens men's minds, and captures women's hearts. For Hideyoshi's passions are not limited to war and intrigue-his faithful wife, Nene, holds his love dear, even when she must share it; the chaste Oyu, sister of Hideyoshi's chief strategist, falls prey to his desires; and the seductive Chacha, whom he rescues from the fiery destruction of her father's castle, tempts his weakness. As recounted by Eiji Yoshikawa, author of the international best-seller Musashi, Taiko tells many stories: of the fury of Nobunaga and the fatal arrogance of the black-toothed Yoshimoto; of the pathetic downfall of the House of Takeda; how the scorned Mitsuhide betrayed his master; how once impregnable ramparts fell as their defenders died gloriously. Most of all, though, Taiko is the story of how one man transformed a nation through the force of his will and the depth of his humanity. Filled with scenes of pageantry and violence, acts of treachery and self-sacrifice, tenderness and savagery, Taiko combines the panoramic spectacle of a Kurosawa epic with a vivid evocation of feudal Japan.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kF4qDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Army Life in a Black Regiment","description":"This book - originally a series of essays - was written by a Union colonel from New England, in charge of black troops training off the coast of the Carolinas.

Her palace shimmered with onyx, garnets, and gold, but was richer still in political and sexual intrigue. Above all else, Cleopatra was a shrewd strategist and an ingenious negotiator. Though her life spanned fewer than forty years, it reshaped the contours of the ancient world. She was married twice, each time to a brother. She waged a brutal civil war against the first when both were teenagers. She poisoned the second. Ultimately she dispensed with an ambitious sister as well; incest and assassination were family specialties. Cleopatra appears to have had sex with only two men. They happen, however, to have been Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, among the most prominent Romans of the day. Both were married to other women. Cleopatra had a child with Caesar and--after his murder--three more with his prot g . Already she was the wealthiest ruler in the Mediterranean; the relationship with Antony confirmed her status as the most influential woman of the age. The two would together attempt to forge a new empire, in an alliance that spelled their ends. Cleopatra has lodged herself in our imaginations ever since. Famous long before she was notorious, Cleopatra has gone down in history for all the wrong reasons. Shakespeare and Shaw put words in her mouth. Michelangelo, Tiepolo, and Elizabeth Taylor put a face to her name. Along the way, Cleopatra's supple personality and the drama of her circumstances have been lost. In a masterly return to the classical sources, Stacy Schiff here boldly separates fact from fiction to rescue the magnetic queen whose death ushered in a new world order. Rich in detail, epic in scope, Schiff 's is a luminous, deeply original reconstruction of a dazzling life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dKIo6D9yh3cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Heart of a Dog","description":"Heart of a Dog (Sobachye serdtse) is a novella by Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov.

It was almost immediately turned into a TV movie, which was aired in late 1988 on First Programme (First Channel) of Soviet Television, gained almost universal acclaim and attracted many readers to the original Bulgakov text. Since then, the novella has become a cultural phenomenon in Russia, known and discussed by people \\"from schoolchildren to politicians.\\" It has become a subject of critical argument, was filmed in Russian and Italian-language versions, and was adapted in English as a play and an opera.

He had been one of George Armstrong Custer's senior officers when Custer and over 200 men in his command were annihilated by Sioux and Cheyenne warriors above the Little Big Horn River in Montana Territory. While declared by his superiors innocent of wrong-doing in the terrible battle, Marcus Reno's honor -the most precious word in his vocabulary - was blackened in the press and by his fellow officers and other Custer idolators. For thirteen years Reno has lived with this stain on his reputation. Now, with time running out, suffering from painful cancer, Reno wants his honor restored. He arranges to give a final newspaper interview to New York Herald correspondent Joseph Richler. Richler, captivated by this officer and gentleman, promises the dying Major that he will write the whole story of Reno's conduct in battle and its aftermath. Richler learns that Reno was tortured by the death of his beloved wife, hell-bent toward self-destruction by alcohol, and plagued by a peculiar dual personality -- decisive and in control on the battlefield, yet unable to win the respect of his fellow officers. In An Obituary for Major Reno, Richard S. Wheeler, a master of the biographical novel, provides a brilliant reconstruction of the Custer battle and Marcus Reno's subsequent courts martial for \\"conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman,\\" and brings to life a beleaguered man and his search to restore his lost honor.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1-3iR66NEvwC&dq=An+Obituary+for+Major+Reno&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bad Back Book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L8pRPgAACAAJ&dq=The+Bad+Back+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Empowerment In Social Work Practice: A Sourcebook","description":"As a philosophy and method of practice, empowerment provides a way to rethink one's approach to social work practice.

As Thielicke meditates on Christmas, the reader will understand anew how light shines in the darkness of this world. As he preaches about Christ's suffering on the cross, humanity's suffering is given meaning; and, in talking of death, he gives us encouragement to live in hope. Christ and the Meaning of Life explores subjects as far apart from each other - and as close together - as rehabilitation and retribution, beauty and terror, and love and brutality. Here Thielicke faces the fearsome questions that plague humanity and brings the Christian Gospel to bear on each of them with a clarity and persuasiveness that echoes in these troubled times.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wtTYDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Receiving the Day: Christian Practices for Opening the Gift of Time (The Practices of Faith Series)","description":"In this spirituality of time, Dorothy Bass invites readers into a way of living in time that is alert to both contemporary pressures and rooted ancient wisdom.

Bass encourages us to reevaluate our understanding of the temporal and thereby to participate fully in the Christian practice of knowing time as God's gift.

In it, one of France's most prominent intellectuals explores the foundations, limits, and possibilities of humanist thinking. Through his critical but sympathetic excavation of humanism, Tzvetan Todorov seeks an answer to modernity's fundamental challenge: how to maintain our hard-won liberty without paying too dearly in social ties, common values, and a coherent and responsible sense of self. Todorov reads afresh the works of major humanists--primarily Montaigne, Rousseau, and Constant, but also Descartes, Montesquieu, and Toqueville. Each chapter considers humanism's approach to one major theme of human existence: liberty, social life, love, self, morality, and expression. Discussing humanism in dialogue with other systems, Todorov finds a response to the predicament of modernity that is far more instructive than any offered by conservatism, scientific determinism, existential individualism, or humanism's other contemporary competitors. Humanism suggests that we are members of an intelligent and sociable species who can act according to our will while connecting the well-being of other members with our own. It is through this understanding of free will, Todorov argues, that we can use humanism to rescue universality and reconcile human liberty with solidarity and personal integrity. Placing the history of ideas at the service of a quest for moral and political wisdom, Todorov's compelling and no doubt controversial rethinking of humanist ideas testifies to the enduring capacity of those ideas to meditate on--and, if we are fortunate, cultivate--the imperfect garden in which we live.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_SQb65sbLIEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paper Piece a Flower Garden: Blocks and Projects to Mix and Match","description":"Mix and match patchwork quilting.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=63YCAAAACAAJ&dq=Paper+Piece+a+Flower+Garden:+Blocks+and+Projects+to+Mix+and+Match&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mandalas of the Hidden Wisdom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YUt4AAAACAAJ&dq=Mandalas+of+the+Hidden+Wisdom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bedouin doctor","description":"Adventures of a German Army doctor who escaped from a British Prisoner of War Camp and adopted an Arab way of life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8V8-AAAAIAAJ&dq=Bedouin+doctor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More Quizzles: Logic Problem Puzzles","description":"The brain is a wonderful thing to tease.

The book is often regarded as a roman   clef because the protagonist's descent into mental illness parallels Plath's own experiences with what may have been clinical depression or bipolar II disorder. Plath died by suicide a month after its first UK publication. The novel was published under Plath's name for the first time in 1967 and was not published in the United States until 1971, in accordance with the wishes of both Plath's husband, Ted Hughes, and her mother.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=INCSDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Bell+Jar+:+A+Novel+(Perennial+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The space ship under the apple tree","description":"When Eddie Blow investigated what he thought was a falling star, he found Marty, a little man from Martinea and his space ship.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YFXhAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+space+ship+under+the+apple+tree&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bma New Guide to Medicines & Drugs Hb (Bma Family Doctor)","description":"The essential quick reference to more than 2,500 medicines and drugs.

Liebmann discusses the work of six largely forgotten figures: Octavia Hill, William Glyn-Jones, Mary Richmond, George William Brown, Mary Parker Follet, and Bryan Keith-Lucas. Three are British; three American. Some came from affluent backgrounds; some grew up poor. One was barely educated; another spent eleven years at some of the world's more prestigious institutions of higher learning. What united them all was a shared conviction that citizenship involved more than voting, that society consists of more than the marketplace or political institutions, and that professional values are important for shaping a civil discourse. With a sympathetic eye toward the fulfillment of these common aspirations, Liebmann looks at the national health, social work, housing management, and educational initiatives spearheaded by these powerful figures over the past two centuries. This study is a fascinating retort to our cynical age of political disillusionment and an innovative contribution to social and political history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kC_ZqNLUOtEC&dq=Six+Lost+Leaders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stairs of Sand (Gunsmoke Western)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0S3eAAAACAAJ&dq=Stairs+of+Sand+(Gunsmoke+Western)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Selected Poems","description":"Yves Bonnefoy, celebrated translator and critic, is widely considered the most important and influential French poet since World War II. Named to the College de France in 1981 to fill the chair left vacant by the death of Roland Barthes, Bonnefoy was the first poet honored in this way since Paul Valery. Winner of many awards, including the Prix Goncourt in 1987 and the Hudson Review's Bennett Award in 1988, he is the author of six critically acclaimed books of poetry. Spanning four decades and drawing on all of Bonnefoy's major collections, this selection provides a comprehensive overview of and an ideal introduction to his work. The elegant translations, many of them new, are presented in this dual-language edition alongside the original French. Several significant works appear here in English for the first time, among them, in its entirety, Bonnefoy's 1991 book of verse, The Beginning and the End of the Snow, the 1988 prose poem Where the Arrow Falls, and an important long poem from 1993, \\"Wind and Smoke.\\" Together with poems from such classic volumes as \\"In the Lure of the Threshold\\", these new works shed light on the growth as well as the continuity of Bonnefoy's work. John Naughton's detailed introduction looks at the evolution of Bonnefoy's poetry from the 1953 publication of \\"On the Motion and Immobility of Douve\\", which immediately established his reputation as one of France's leading poets, through the 1993 publication of The Wandering Life and its centerpiece \\"Wind and Smoke.\\" \\"This is a comprehensive selection that contains examples of work spanning [Bonnefoy's] full career of forty years, from the ground-breaking \\"Du Mouvement et de l'Immobilit  de Douve\\" through the celebratory \\"Pierre Ecrite\\" to the magical winter landscapes of America's East Coast and an unsettling reworking of myth in the recent \\"La Vie Errante\\" . . . The translations, which are the work of a variety of hands, including Galway Kinnell, Emily Grosholz and Anthony Rudolf, nevertheless fit well together and all are sensitive to the register and subtleties of both languages, while the introductory essay by John Naughton expertly explains Bonnefoy's importance as a poet and the influences which have shaped him. This is definitely a volume worth having, for layman and French specialist alike.\\" Hilary Davies, Times Literary Supplement \\"Anyone not familiar with Bonnefoy's work will benefit from the background information and explanations given by John Naughton in his excellent introduction . . . . The book as a whole provides an excellent introduction to Bonnefoy's poetry and to his concerns of a lifetime.\\" Don Rodgers, Poetry Wales","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6upByYD8O2sC&dq=New+Selected+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"With fire and sword: An historical novel of Poland and Russia","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6OkhAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emma and Meesha My Boy: A Two Mom Story","description":"Emma lives with her two moms and a chubby housecat.

Probably they found the local cuisine strange at first, but soon they were sending American plants and animals around the world, eventually enriching the cuisine of many cultures. Drawing on original accounts by Europeans and native Americans, this pioneering work offers the first detailed description of the cuisines of the Aztecs, the Maya, and the Inca. Sophie Coe begins with the basic foodstuffs, including maize, potatoes, beans, peanuts, squash, avocados, tomatoes, chocolate, and chiles, and explores their early history and domestication. She then describes how these foods were prepared, served, and preserved, giving many insights into the cultural and ritual practices that surrounded eating in these cultures. Coe also points out the similarities and differences among the three cuisines and compares them to Spanish cooking of the period, which, as she usefully reminds us, would seem as foreign to our tastes as the American foods seemed to theirs. Written in easily digested prose, America's First Cuisines will appeal to food enthusiasts as well as scholars.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hKVbCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pennsylvania's Heritage","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eF8dtwAACAAJ&dq=Pennsylvania%27s+Heritage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building Domestic Liberty: Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Architectural Feminism","description":"Offers a brief profile of Gilman, discusses her case against prevailing household design, and looks at her philosophy of world improvement","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DddlAAAAMAAJ&dq=Building+Domestic+Liberty:+Charlotte+Perkins+Gilman%27s+Architectural+Feminism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Double Drink Story : My Life with Dylan Thomas","description":"From the moment they met at a pub in London, drink was the most conspicuous part of the lives of Caitlin and her 'genius poet', Dylan Thomas.

A seminal text in the burgeoning field of David Foster Wallace studies, the original edition of Understanding David Foster Wallace was nevertheless incomplete as it addressed only his first four works of fiction namely the novels The Broom of the System and Infinite Jest and the story collections Girl with Curious Hair and Brief Interviews with Hideous Men. This revised edition adds two new chapters covering his final story collection, Oblivion, and his posthumous novel, The Pale King. Tracing Wallace's relationship to modernism and postmodernism, this volume provides close readings of all his major works of fiction. Although critics sometimes label Wallace a postmodern writer, Boswell argues that he should be regarded as the nervous leader of some still-unnamed (and perhaps unnamable) third wave of modernism. In charting a new direction for literary practice, Wallace does not seek to overturn postmodernism, nor does he call for a return to modernism. Rather his work moves resolutely forward while hoisting the baggage of modernism and postmodernism heavily, but respectfully, on its back. Like the books that serve as its primary subject, Boswell's study directly confronts such arcane issues as postmodernism, information theory, semiotics, the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, and poststructuralism, yet it does so in a way that is comprehensible to a wide and general readership the very same readership that has enthusiastically embraced Wallace's challenging yet entertaining and redemptive fiction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fGn6DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tiempo De Cerezas/Time of the Reds (Fiction, Poetry & Drama) (Spanish Edition)","description":"A NEW YORK TIMES, TIME, GQ, Vulture, and WASHINGTON POST TOP 10 BOOK of the YEAR ONE OF BARACK OBAMA'S FAVOURITE BOOKS OF THE YEAR Finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, and the National Book Critics Circle Award Shortlisted for the Rathbones Folio Prize Winner of the Hefner Heitz Kansas Book Award From the award-winning author of 10:04 and Leaving the Atocha Station, a tender and expansive family drama set in the American Midwest at the turn of the century, hailed by Maggie Nelson as Ben Lerner's \\"most discerning, ambitious, innovative, and timely novel to date.\\" Adam Gordon is a senior at Topeka High School, class of '97. His mother, Jane, is a famous feminist author; his father, Jonathan, is an expert at getting \\"lost boys\\" to open up. They both work at a psychiatric clinic that has attracted staff and patients from around the world. Adam is a renowned debater, expected to win a national championship before he heads to college. He is one of the cool kids, ready to fight or, better, freestyle about fighting if it keeps his peers from thinking of him as weak. Adam is also one of the seniors who bring the loner Darren Eberheart--who is, unbeknownst to Adam, his father's patient--into the social scene, to disastrous effect. Deftly shifting perspectives and time periods, The Topeka School is the story of a family, its struggles and its strengths: Jane's reckoning with the legacy of an abusive father, Jonathan's marital transgressions, the challenge of raising a good son in a culture of toxic masculinity. It is also a riveting prehistory of the present: the collapse of public speech, the trolls and tyrants of the New Right, and the ongoing crisis of identity among white men.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-7SPDwAAQBAJ&dq=Tiempo+De+Cerezas/Time+of+the+Reds+(Fiction,+Poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Too Beautiful and Other Stories 2 Ed","description":"Feel the swing and sway of the Jazz Age in this collection of stories by F.

The day-to-day dangers we firefighters endured together produced the highest degree of bonding that one can imagine. As \\"family,\\" we shared the love, and laughter, as well as the tears of each other's personal tragedies. This book also tells how we, as firefighters, shared in the anguish felt by the innocent victims and their families. Fighting accidental fires was a tough enough job, but the embattled firefighters of our city's ghettos had to put up with the politically motivated burnings of buildings on the campuses of some of New York City's most prestigious colleges and universities in the name of civil disobedience. Add to that the rapid expansion of the drug culture, the sexual revolution, the Vietnam War protests, and race riots, and you have a pretty good idea of what the New York City Fire Department was up against. \\"All I can say is Wow! I love reading and I usually go in for the lighter reads, but a friend recommended this book. It held my attention from beginning to end. I will not spoil it for others, you have to read this.

From that smoke-filled room came the first designs of three White Star superliners. Olympic and Titanic were to be built at Harland & Wolff's yard in Belfast, while the third ship was to follow after construction had been completed on the first pair of sisters. The only ship to make a return passenger voyage was Olympic and she was always overshadowed by her younger sisters. This is the definitive story of Titanic's sister RMS Olympic. First published in 2004 to critical acclaim, this new edition presents a revised expanded work from one the most successful maritime authors at work in Britain today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aG4TDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Dragon","description":"Black Dragon recounts the experience of a single Marine rifle company--2-F-23, or \\"Fox\\" Company--and its drive through the central Pacific in World War II. Author Steven D. McCloud, through painstaking research of battlefield reports and extensive interviews with surviving members of Fox Company, has reanimated the grueling, day-by-day slog through the Pacific theater through the eyes of the US Marines who endured it. This is the story of American teenagers who left home, many for the first time, trained together, and formed a team that held strong until, at last, those who survived tried to leave it all behind as they dispersed, returned home, and sought to build their lives. Decades later, Fox Company re-formed through correspondence and reunions and also welcomed McCloud into their midst by telling him their stories. McCloud took notes, chased down company reports and other documents to fill in the gaps, and carefully reconstructed their journey. As one member of Fox Company recalled after returning to Iwo Jima half a century later, \\"I think the pilgrimage to Iwo has helped me conquer my black dragons--those bloody and stinking nightmares that made nightly uninvited visits for fifty-six years. My dreams were in color, predominantly bloody red. Those remaining are in black and white and shades of gray, not so violent and stinking. These I can live with.\\" Readers who reveled in Stephen Ambrose's masterful oral history of E Company in the European theater will find similar heroism and heartbreak in the pages of Black Dragon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D96kzgEACAAJ&dq=Black+Dragon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","description":"Using many never-reported facts, award-winning writer Anne Hagedorn Auerbach chronicles the compelling and tragic story behind the downfall of Thoroughbred racing's crown jewel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ni3y6GDLL3YC&dq=Wild+ride:+The+rise+and+tragic+fall+of+Calumet+Farm,+Inc.,+America%27s+premier+racing+dynasty&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Darkness Moves: An Henri Michaux Anthology, 1927-1984","description":"Henri Michaux defies common critical definition.

During just nine days in the early summer of 1940, nearly eight hundred 'little ships', from lifeboats and passenger steamers to small private yachts and dinghies, set off across the English Channel to rescue almost half a million men trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk. Among them were three very different craft - a London fireboat from the docklands of the East End, manned by skipper Olly Mears and his crew; a small pleasure steamer from the River Dart in Devon, commanded by twenty-one-year-old Robby Endacott, an Able Seaman in the Royal Navy who grew up on the banks of the Dart; and a small motor yacht owned by Portsmouth solicitor Hubert Stainbank and crewed by his sons, Charles and Toby. As each boat ferries exhausted men from the beaches to the waiting ships, under incessant fire from enemy aircraft and in a sea awash with debris and bodies, the men are unknowingly united by a powerful driving force - the urgent need to find one man, brother or son, who matters more to them than anyone else. Each of these missing men has a family, a wife or a sweetheart at home who is anxiously waiting for news...One sweetheart in particular is determined to play her own part in the rescue.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pcGhGwAACAAJ&dq=Three+Little+Ships&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Central Problems in Social Theory: Action, Structure, and Contradiction in Social Analysis","description":"\\"One of the most creative among the younger generation of critical social theorists, Giddens stands alone in his concern for the classical tradition on sociology; but he also makes brilliant use of the latest philosophical and theoretical work of several contemporary schools and disciplines.

The book describes the fundamental operation and construction of the animation stand where the film camera is mounted. The text explains in detail how the animation stand holds the camera, which points vertically straight down on the table containing the artwork. The selection describes the zoom movement, the light box, and the cell punch. Then the book discusses the three kinds of methods of animation, namely, modification, substitution, and mechanical movement.

The book also notes the settings that can be achieved on a modern animation stand, including the counters and calibration of gears and wheels. For example, a movement can be as precise as a hundredth of an inch, while a rotation can be made in a tenth of a degree. The book also provides a fairing table, different exposures for different films, and a method to approximate the amount of film stock left in a magazine.

The main pro totypes for biological information systems have been the neural systems and the brain. However, the immune system is not only an interesting informa tion system but it may provide a design paradigm for artificial information systems. With such a consideration, I initiated a project titled \\"autonomous decentralized recognition mechanism of the immune network and its applica tion to distributed information processing\\" in 1990 under a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on a Priority Area (\\"Autonomous Distributed Systems\\") supported by the Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture. During the project, I promoted the idea that the immune system could be a prototype of autonomous distributed systems. After the project, we organized an international workshop on immunity based systems in 1996 in conjunction with the International Conference on Multi-Agent Systems held in Kyoto, Japan. Recently, there have been several international conferences related to topics inspired by the immune system and an increasing number of research papers related to the topic. In writing this book, a decade after the project, I still believe that the immune system can be a prototype, a compact but sophisticated system that nature has shown us for building artificial information systems in this network age of the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OAVJCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Determination (Buddhism For You series)","description":"Based on the tenets of the Japanese monk Nichiren, these guides provide insight and advice on injecting Buddhist philosophies into one s relationships and spirituality.

Societies that had had a head start in food production advanced beyond the hunter-gatherer stage, and then developed religion --as well as nasty germs and potent weapons of war --and adventured on sea and land to conquer and decimate preliterate cultures. A major advance in our understanding of human societies, Guns, Germs, and Steel chronicles the way that the modern world came to be and stunningly dismantles racially based theories of human history.

Brian Friel is the most profound and poetic of contemporary Irish dramatists.' Observer Throughout the remote and forgotten corners of the British Isles, Frank Hardy offers the promise of redemption to the sick and the suffering. But his is an unreliable gift, a dangerous calling which brings him into conflict with his wife Grace and his manager Teddy. Their competing accounts of past events reveal the fragility of memory and the necessity of stories as a means of survival. Brian Friel's Faith Healer was first produced at the Longacre Theatre, New York, in April 1979 and was revived at the Donmar Warehouse, London, in June 2016. 'The night of Faith Healer is one that still blazes in recollection for me, as religious experiences of art do.

It takes us back to the humble beginnings of a young and resilient Buddhist monastic in mainland China, who fortified his faith and strengthened his resolve to spread the Dharma under the most trying circumstances. In doing so, it sheds light on the indomitable spirit that distinguished Master Hsing Yun even at a young age.It is this same spirit that compelled the young charismatic monastic to cross the strait in 1949, bearing the light of Buddhism to Taiwan. Handing Down the Light not only offers an inspirational account of how Master Hsing Yun was able to overcome one adversity after another, but also illuminates the causes and conditions that allowed Buddhism to gain a firm foothold in Taiwan after decades of his efforts to propagate the Dharma and establish centers of education. This same vision and commitment led Master Hsing Yun to extend Humanistic Buddhism first to North America and then to all corners of the world. In essence, Handing Down the Light can be read as a comprehensive account of the building of a global Buddhist community.Full of lively anecdotes, penetrating insights and rich visual documentation that celebrate the lifetime vision and accomplishments of Master Hsing Yun, Handing Down the Light is a biography that itself transmits the ? light?  of an exemplary spiritual leader for the 21st century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qxssBie6BroC&dq=Handing+Down+the+Light:+The+Biography+of+Venerable+Master+Hsing+Yun&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two of a Kind: The Hillside Stranglers","description":"The riveting true crime account of the Hillside Stranglers and the horrific serial killings they unleashed on 1970s Los Angeles. For weeks that fall, the body count of sexually violated, brutally murdered young women escalated. With increasing alarm, Los Angeles newspapers headlined the deeds of a serial killer they named the Hillside Strangler. The city was held hostage by fear. But not until January 1979, more than a year later, would the mysterious disappearance of two university students near Seattle lead police to the arrest of a security guard the handsome, charming, fast-talking Kenny Bianchi and the discovery that the strangler was not one man but two. Compellingly, O Brien explores the symbiotic relationship between Bianchi and his cousin Angelo Buono, their lust for women as insatiable as their hate, before examining the crimes they remorselessly perpetrated and the lives of the unsuspecting victims they claimed. Equally riveting is O Brien s account of the trial one of the longest and most controversial criminal court cases in American history with the defense team parading, one after another, expert witnesses who had been effectively duped by Bianchi s impersonation of a man suffering multiple personality disorder. It s one way a man might contrive to get away with murder. Like Truman Capote in In Cold Blood and Norman Mailer in The Executioner s Song, Darcy O Brien weds the narrative skill of an award-winning novelist with the detailed observations of an experienced investigator to unravel this chilling true-crime story.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gJS4AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exit the king (An Evergreen book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tIZ2AAAAIAAJ&dq=Exit+the+king+(An+Evergreen+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Business China (International Business Culture)","description":"Investigates the impact of culture on Chinese and foreign corporations operating in China.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jS0mTKa-w9gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Parnassus on wheels;","description":"\\"Parnassus on Wheels\\" (1917) was Christopher Morley s first published novel. It tells the story of Roger Mifflin, who sells his travelling book business to 39-year-old Helen McGill.

Returning to Greece after German exile, following his part in the abortive uprising against the occupying Turks (1770), and his failure as both a lover and a revolutionary, Hyperion assumes a hermitic existence, during which he writes his letters. Confronting and commenting on his own past, with all its joy and grief, the narrator undergoes a transformation that culminates in the realisation of his true vocation. Though H?lderlin is now established as a great lyric poet, recognition of his novel as a supreme achievement of European Romanticism has been belated in the Anglophone world. Incorporating the aesthetic evangelism that is a characteristic feature of the age, Hyperion preaches a message of redemption through beauty. The resolution of the contradictions and antinomies raised in the novel is found in the act of articulation itself. To a degree remarkable in a prose work of any length, what it means is inseparable from how it means. In this skilful translation, Gaskill conveys the beautiful music and rhythms of H?lderlin's language to an English-speaking reader.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hPKTwgEACAAJ&dq=Hyperion+(World+Classic+Literature+Series)+:+German+language+version&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"String Music","description":"The study of string instruments should include ensemble playing at the earliest possible stage.

This type of training is excellent preparation for participation in large groups. These four volumes of duets for two violins will help fill the need for early ensemble experience in the public schools. They should be used in string classes as a supplement to any of the standard string methods. They will also encourage music making outside of the school, with parents or with other students.

Mary Ball Washington was an unlikely candidate to be the mother of history s most famous revolutionary. In fact, George Washington s first fight for independence was from his controlling, singular mother. Stubborn, aristocratic Mary Ball Washington was entrenched in the Old World ways of her ancestors, dismissing the American experiment even as her son led the successful rebellion against the crown. During his youth, ambitious George dove into the hard-scrabble work of a surveyor and rose through the ranks of the fledgling colonial army, even as his overprotective mother tried to discourage these efforts. Mary s influence on George was twofold. Though she raised her eldest son to become one of the world s greatest leaders, Mary also tried many times to hold him back. While she passed down her strength and individuality to George, she also sought to protect him from the risks he needed to take to become a daring general and president. But it was this resistance itself which fanned the spark of George s independence into a flame. The constant tug of war between the two throughout the early years helped define George s character. In Mary Ball Washington, New York Times bestselling author Craig Shirley uncovers startling details about the inner workings of the Washington family. He vividly brings to life a resilient widow who singlehandedly raised six children and ran a large farm at a time when most women s duties were relegated to household matters. Throughout, Shirley compares and contrasts mother and son, illuminating the qualities they shared and the differences that divided them. A significant contribution to American history, Mary Ball Washington is the definitive take on the relationship between George and Mary Washington, offering fresh insight into this extraordinary figure who would shape our nation and the woman who shaped him.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yliBDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life, Death and Sex in Prison","description":"What is life, death and sex all about behind prison walls?

Consequently, the human emotional landscape is littered today with angry, bitter, and vengeful thoughts, emotions, and actions. Even our modern justice systems are preoccupied only with finding and proving guilt and dealing out retribution, doing little to remedy the tragic situation. Nevertheless, many individuals and groups have always sought ways to break this vicious cycle of recrimination. When faced with the question of what we can do to change the world for the better, one of the most radical and challenging answers is to begin forgiving others for what they have done. In this powerful and moving book, Prokofieff shows how the forces that lead to forgiveness can be developed consciously and freely. Without preaching the morality of forgiveness, he presents spiritual facts that speak for themselves. From Tsarist Russia and the concentration camps of Nazi Germany to the infighting during the early years of the Anthroposophical Society, the author offers striking examples of those who have been able to forgive frequently terrible crimes. He provides multilayered analyses and shows the beneficial consequences of each act of forgiveness. As he develops his theme, the importance of forgiving not simply for personal salvation but for the advancement of human evolution is revealed in all its healing truth. Now available in paperback, The Occult Significance of Forgiveness has been read and loved by thousands of readers for years. It is perhaps the most valuable, accessible, and succinct of Prokofieff s works on inner development.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yhhh5xL1778C&dq=Draughts+of+Remembrance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mothman and Other Curious Encounters","description":"A new Hollywood blockbuster, an amazing documentary, and thousands of web pages in its honor.

Identified just a few years ago, AIDS and the human inunlmodeficiency virus (IDV) responsible for it affect millions of persons worldwide. AIDS has already become the leading cause of death among persons under 40 in some large American cities. From the beginning. it has been evident that AIDS carries unique psychological and social ramifications. In spite of its lethality, new cases of HIV infection are preventable if individuals can be assisted to make behavior changes to lessen or eliminate viral transmission. To the extent that we can develop effective primary prevention interventions, it will be possible to keep larger numbers of people from becoming infected with the mv virus. Psychological and social risk behavior change interventions, whether at the level of individual clients, groups, or entire communities, can playa key role-in fact, the only available role-in disease prevention. Patients with any life-threatening illness have psychological, social, and support needs. However, these needs are more pronounced and, often, less easily addressed for persons affected by AIDS. People in good clinical health but with HIV infection face years of worry concerning whether they will develop AIDS. Nearly 2 million Americans are currently in this precarious position; by 1991, 50 to 100 million persons worldwide are expected to share the same uncertainty.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lGQECAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Granny Stark's Search for the Perfect Fruit Pie","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MJbBtgAACAAJ&dq=Granny+Stark%27s+Search+for+the+Perfect+Fruit+Pie&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El ano de la muerte de Ricardo Reis (Alfaguara) (Spanish Edition)","description":"A fines de 1935, cuando acaba de fallecer Fernando Pessoa, llega al puerto de Lisboa un barco ingl s, Highland Brigade, en el que ha viajado, desde Brasil, Ricardo Reis, uno de los heter nimos del gran poeta portugu s.

Eva Hesse's distinctive process-based art exerted a powerful influence on minimalist artists of the 1960s and continues to inspire artists today. Using industrial materials such as latex and fiberglass, she exploited their flexibility to produce works with an unsettling psychic and corporeal resonance. Hesse, who was born in Germany in 1936 and raised in New York City, died of cancer in New York in 1970. Eva Hesse focuses on the body of criticism that has developed since the last major retrospective of Hesse's work, at the Yale University Art Gallery in 1992. The book's publication coincides with a major exhibition organized jointly by the San Francisco Museum of Art and the Wiesbaden Museum. Eva Hesse contains a 1970 interview by Cindy Nemser, a discussion between Mel Bochner and Joan Simon, and essays by Briony Fer, Rosalind Krauss, Mignon Nixon, and Anne M.

It was the first time that an enemy ship of war had been captured on the high seas by U.S. Navy sailors since 1815, when the USS Peacock seized HMS Nautilus as part of the War of 1812. The extraordinary feat is described in gripping narrative by Gallery himself, who chronicles the long and arduous battle against the German U-boat under the most hazardous conditions. Once they succeeded in capturing and towing their prize seventeen-hundred miles across the Atlantic Ocean, U-505 proved to be of inestimable value, yielding secrets to radio codes among other things.

But in these new homes they found unemployment and discrimination, and they were no better off. Sin Aikst Indian Bernie Whitebear was an urban activist in the Pacific Northwest during the last decades of the twentieth century, a man dedicated to improving the lives of Indians and other ethnic groups by working for change and justice. He unified Northwest tribes to fight for the return of their land and was the first to accomplish this in the United States. But far from a fearsome agitator, Bernie was a persuasive figure who won the praise and admiration of an entire community. Bernie began organizing powwows in the 1960s with an eye toward greater authenticity; and by making a name in the Seattle area as an entertainment promoter, he soon became a successful networker and master of diplomacy, enabling him to win over those who had long ignored the problems of urban Indians. Soft-spoken but outspoken, Bernie successfully negotiated with officials at all levels of government on behalf of Indians and other minorities, crossing into political territory normally off-limits to his people. Bernie Whitebear?s story takes readers from an impoverished youth?including a rare account of life on the Colville Reservation during the 1930s?to the  Red Power  movement as it traces Bernie?s emergence as an activist influenced by contemporaries such as Bob Satiacum, Vine DeLoria, and Joe Delacruz. By choosing this course, Bernie was clearly making a break with his past, but with an eye toward a better future, whether staging the successful protest at Fort Lawton or acting on behalf of Native fishing rights in Puget Sound. When he died in July 2000, Bernie Whitebear had left an inestimable legacy, accomplishing things that no other Indian seemed able to do. His biography is an inspiring story for readers at many levels, an account of how one American Indian overcame hardships and obstacles to make a difference in the lives of his people?and an entire community.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ce6VtFKiWGsC&dq=Bernie+Whitebear:+An+Urban+Indian%27s+Quest+for+Justice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Young Astronauts","description":"Athletic Nathan, whose motley crew of boys and girls has reached the semifinals in the United Nations' Mars program, struggles to help them learn the skills they will need to win the coveted roles as young colonizers of the Red Planet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=We8GyYTSFpUC&dq=The+Young+Astronauts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making It (Great American First Novels)","description":"The Great American Burger Book is the first book to showcase a wide range of regional hamburger styles and cooking methods.

The June Days of 1848 - the worst urban insurrection in history until that time - finally brought this period to a close.

The lives of 'ordinary men' are captured in their own words as Harsin illuminates the political aspirations of the working class.

William Wesley Van Orsdel (1848-1919), known as  Brother Van , a Methodist circuit rider in Montana who made a significant contribution to the spread of Methodism in Montana and the early development of the state s public institutions. Throughout his career, Brother Van founded churches, universities, and hospitals; he converted and ministered to homesteaders, miners, and Native Americans; he worked with the elites and the poor, the famous and the forgotten in a career that spanned nearly 50 years.  To paint a word picture of the pioneer preacher and the pioneer territory which captures the real feeling which Brother Van had for Montana and which Montana had for Brother Van is almost impossible. But Bob Lind, a part of the Church which Brother Van helped to establish, has come closer than any writer to date.  Lind s picture of Brother Van and his times is reliably accurate, though it was no easy task to detach fact from fiction in giving account of a man about whom stories grew like grass on the Montana prairie. He found in Brother Van s life so much adventure and color that he only needed to tell the story as it was.  When you finish reading this book you will have met the best of the early frontier in the Rocky Mountain west.

The Hamlet, the first book of the series chronicling the advent and rise of the grasping Snopes family in mythical Yoknapatawpha County, is a work that Cleanth Brooks called  one of the richest novels in the Faulkner canon.  It recounts how the wily, cunning Flem Snopes dominates the rural community of Frenchman s Bend and claims the voluptuous Eula Varner as his bride. The Town, the central novel, records Flem s ruthless struggle to take over the county seat of Jefferson, Mississippi. Finally, The Mansion tells of Mink Snopes, whose archaic sense of honor brings about the downfall of his cousin Flem.  For all his concerns with the South, Faulkner was actually seeking out the nature of man,  noted Ralph Ellison.  Thus we must turn to him for that continuity of moral purpose which made for the greatness of our classics.

In contrast to conventional belief that life is passive in the face of threats to its existence, the book explores the hypothesis that the Earth's living matter influences air, ocean, and rock to form a complex, self-regulating system that has the capacity to keep the Earth a fit place for life. Since Gaia was first published, Jim Lovelock's hypothesis has become a hotly debated topic in scientific circles. In a new Preface to this edition, he outlines his view of the present state of the debate.

Arthur signed an executive order that created a joint-occupation reservation for both Hopis and western Navajos in present-day Arizona. This policy was the start of a century-long land dispute between the two tribes. The Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute recounts the origins and history of the legal battle between the two peoples for control of the 1882 reservation, focusing on the federal court case, Healing v. Jones, in which the author served as a consultant for the Navajo Nation. Although the federal government wanted to relocate impoverished Navajos from the disputed land, Brugge firmly believed that a fair court hearing would reinforce the Navajo claim. His account of Healing vs. Jones - events leading to the case, the court case itself, and the aftermath of the judge's decision - tries to balance the extreme positions staked out by advocates for the Hopis and the Navajos. Brugge argues that, to this day, the Navajos suffer stereotyping and prejudice, both of which were decisive in the tragic outcome of the legal battle. Lawyers for the Hopis, he contends, exploited ethnic hatred to the benefit of their client tribe and to the detriment of the Navajos.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YYN1AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Navajo-Hopi+Land+Dispute:+An+American+Tragedy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terra nova: A play","description":"THE STORY: Drawn from the journals and letters found on the frozen body of Captain Scott, the action of the play blends scenes of the explorer and his men at various stages of their ordeal, with flashbacks of Scott and his young wife and with fatef","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_JpZrM94YR4C&dq=Terra+nova:+A+play&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bells of Burracombe","description":"The beginning of the beloved village series from Sunday Times bestselling author Lilian Harry.

It describes some important areas of American aviation weapons maturation under the pressure of war with emphasis on advanced technology and experimental aircraft configurations. The great value of the work is illumination of little known or minimally documented projects that significantly advanced the science of aeronautics, propulsion, aircraft systems, and ordnance, but did not go into production. Each chapter introduces another topic by examining the state-of-the-art at the beginning of the war, advantages pursued, and results achieved during the conflict. This last is the vehicle to examine the secret modifications or experiments that are little known. Consequently, this is an important single-source for a fascinating and diverse collection of wartime efforts never before brought together under a single cover. The \\"war stories\\" are those of military staffs, engineering teams, and test pilots struggling against short schedules and tight resource constraints to push the bounds of technology. These epic and sometimes life-threatening endeavors were as vital as actual combat operations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QtygDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clinical Handbook for Maternal Newborn Nursing & Women's Health Care (7th Edition)","description":"This is a student supplement associated with: Olds' Maternal-Newborn Nursing & Women's Health Across the Lifespan, 9/e Michele R.

Discussing both use and techniques, the book similarly unfolds the evolution of aquatic methodology, emphasizing the strong interconnection between the two with the inception of riverine combat. Fundamentally based upon an examination of the Chinese military writings, Sawyer examines and recounts the most important clashes and epochal conflicts in which these dramatic tactics were employed over the centuries. Although not a naval history, Sawyer does examine the extensive employment of incendiary attacks in naval conflict and explores the means for overcoming riverine obstacles, such as floating bridges.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_vLJwAEACAAJ&dq=Fire+And+Water:+The+Art+Of+Incendiary+And+Aquatic+Warfare+In+China&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wolverine (Wilderness #49)","description":"Wolverine: In the harsh wilderness of the Rocky Mountains, every day presents a new challenge.

The death of Main Street, the blight of the inner city, the sterility of so much contemporary development--these are effects of a major disconnection between the human community and the built environment. At no time in the history of our society has there been a more urgent need to take a hard look at how we create physical environments.

The planned destruction of homes affects millions of people globally; places destroyed range in scale from single dwellings to entire homelands. Domicide tells how and why the powerful destroy homes that happen to be in the way of corporate, political, and bureaucratic projects. Too frequently, this destruction is justified as being in the public interest. Douglas Porteous and Sandra Smith begin their analysis by examining just how important home is to human life and community. Using a multitude of case studies of displacement, they derive a theoretical framework that addresses the motives for, methods, and effects of domicide. Two case studies of resettlement resulting from hydro-electric power development in British Columbia are used to test this framework. Porteous and Smith assess the implications of loss of home, evaluate current efforts at mitigation, suggest better policies to alleviate the suffering of the dispossessed, and  as a last resort  urge resistance against unacceptable projects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6t_KSirfEnsC&dq=Domicide:+The+Global+Destruction+of+Home&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Texas and global warming: Water supply and demand in four hydrological regions : final report","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iiZQGwAACAAJ&dq=Texas+and+global+warming:+Water+supply+and+demand+in+four+hydrological+regions+:+final+report&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Far from the Madding Crowd Hb (New Windmill)","description":"Vols. for 1853- include the transactions of the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zxk_AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Poems of Catullus, Bilingual edition","description":"\\"Peter Green is an outstanding translator.

What marked the evolutionary transition from organisms that lacked consciousness to those with consciousness to minimal subjective experiencing, or, as Aristotle described it,  the sensitive soul ? In this book, Simona Ginsburg and Eva Jablonka propose a new theory about the origin of consciousness that finds learning to be the driving force in the transition to basic consciousness. Using a methodology similar to that used by scientists when they identified the transition from non-life to life, Ginsburg and Jablonka suggest a set of criteria, identify a marker for the transition to minimal consciousness, and explore the far-reaching biological, psychological, and philosophical implications. After presenting the historical, neurobiological, and philosophical foundations of their analysis, Ginsburg and Jablonka propose that the evolutionary marker of basic or minimal consciousness is a complex form of associative learning, which they term unlimited associative learning (UAL). UAL enables an organism to ascribe motivational value to a novel, compound, non-reflex-inducing stimulus or action, and use it as the basis for future learning. Associative learning, Ginsburg and Jablonka argue, drove the Cambrian explosion and its massive diversification of organisms. Finally, Ginsburg and Jablonka propose symbolic language as a similar type of marker for the evolutionary transition to human rationality to Aristotle's  rational soul.

These proletarian heroes, with names like Lonnie, Loo, Sweet Pea, and Packy, work the furnaces, forges, slag heaps, assembly lines, and loading docks at places with unglamorous names like Brass Craft or Feinberg and Breslin s First-Rate Plumbing and Plating. Only Studs Terkel s Working approaches the pathos and beauty of this book. But Levine s characters are also significant for their inner lives, not merely their jobs. They are unusually artistic, living  at the borders of dreams.  One reads The Tempest  slowly to himself ; another ponders a diagonal chalk line drawn by his teacher to suggest a triangle, the roof of a barn, or the mysterious separation of  the dark from the dark.

This remarkable population preserved its Jewish identity and developed a culture of its own in a region inhabited by a host of different peoples and plagued by ethnic tensions. The term \\"Mountain Jews\\" (they call themselves \\"Juhur\\") dates back to Imperial Russia's occupation of the Caucasus in the early nineteenth century, when the tsar's visiting representative referred to \\"Mountain Jews\\" living mainly in the east and north of the Caucasus range, in what is today the largely Muslim areas of Dagestan and Azerbaijan. After their emigration to Israel, Caucasian Jews continued to resist integration, sharing in Israel's upbuilding without losing touch with their roots in and ties to the Caucasus. Along with her fellow essayists Mordechai Altshuler, Moshe Yosifov, Michael Zand, Ariella Amar, Boris Khaimovich, Anatoly Binyaminov, and Tyilo Khizghilov, author Liya Mikdash-Shamailov, a Jew of Caucasian origin, successfully blends her scientific interest in the community with her own special affinity with its culture.

Riley looks forward to the online chats more than he is willing to admit but has never considered asking what she looks like. She's just an online friend. Yeah, they have a connection, but certainly not enough to even consider that a face-to-face meeting will spark anything other than a solidification of their friendship.

The result is The Analemma Waltz, a celebration of the sun s slow-motion dance through his house, facilitated, in part, by its surfeit of windows, but much more so by the analemma the narrow figure-eight pattern the sun describes in the sky in the course of a year in the Earth s orbital journey. Vincent s habit of noting and minuting the changing positions of sunlight, day by day and week by week, was the catalyst for meditations on matters of universal concern, as suggested by the times and the seasons of the year and approached, not from the perspective of a scholar or academic, but from that of an interested layperson. Such matters, addressed in the monthly chapters, include the study of history, the virtue of tolerance, the conflict between science and religion and the morality of war. Despite the varied nature of the essay topics in The Analemma Waltz, certain themes appear and reappear throughout the book, namely the author s convictions that existential particularity is the occasion of both joy and sadness; that the world s people, though the beneficiaries of seemingly endless breakthroughs in technology, are, and will remain, metaphysically vulnerable; and that appreciation prompting gratitude is the highest vocation of the human person.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lQcOEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Air Disasters","description":"An incredible 30,000 flights ? at least ? arrive safely at their destinations every day.

Dazed but polite, he remained a passive observer of the sale which followed and which apparently realized sufficient to satisfy every creditor, but not enough for an income to continue a harmlessly idle career which he had supposed was to continue indefinitely. He had never earned a penny; he had not the vaguest idea of how people made money. To do something, however, was absolutely necessary. He wasted some time in finding out just how much aid he might expect from his late father's friends, but when he understood the attitude of society toward a knocked-out gentleman he wisely ceased to annoy society, and turned to the business world. Here he wasted some more time. Perhaps the time was not absolutely wasted, for during that period he learned that he could use nobody who could not use him; and as he appeared to be perfectly useless, except for ornament, and as a business house is not a kindergarten, and furthermore, as he had neither time nor money to attend any school where anybody could teach him anything, it occurred to him to take a day off for minute and thorough self-examination concerning his qualifications and even his right to occupy a few feet of space upon the earth's surface. Four years at Harvard, two more in postgraduate courses, two more in Europe to perfect himself in electrical engineering, and a year at home attempting to invent a wireless apparatus for intercepting and transmitting psychical waves had left him pitifully unfit for wage earning. There remained his accomplishments; but the market was overstocked with assorted time-killers. His last asset was a trivial though unusual talent--a natural manual dexterity cultivated since childhood to amuse himself--something he never took seriously. This, and a curious control over animals, had, as the pleasant years flowed by, become an astonishing skill which was much more than sleight of hand; and he, always as good-humored as well-bred, had never refused to amuse the frivolous, of which he was also one, by picking silver dollars out of space and causing the proper card to fall fluttering from the ceiling. Day by day, as the little money left him melted away, he continued his vigorous mental examination, until the alarming shrinkage in his funds left him staring fixedly at his last asset. Could he use it? Was it an asset, after all? How clever was he? Could he face an audience and perform the usual magician tricks without bungling? A slip by a careless, laughing, fashionable young amateur amusing his social equals at a house party is excusable; a bungle by a hired professional meant an end to hope in that direction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yTCRDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sam's Little Sister","description":"Evan loves being big brother to Sam and Finn.

Spices came from lands unseen, possibly uninhabitable, and almost by definition unattainable; that was what made them so desirable. Yet more livelihoods depended on this pungent traffic, more nations participated in it, more wars were fought over it, and more discoveries resulted from it than from any other global exchange. In a bid to discover and exploit the spice route, mankind first passed beyond his known horizons to probe the limits of our planet.

Today Asian airlines are high in the world ranking & many have outstanding reputations for efficiency & service. They also have some of the youngest aircraft fleets. The enormous development that has taken place from pioneering routes with single-engined open cockpit biplanes up to the present with large fleets of the latest jetliner is described in enormous detail in Airlines of Asia since 1920. The Asian countries, & consequently their airlines, have suffered much during these years. First, many of them had to fight for their freedom from colonial powers; then there was the devasting Second World War followed by numerous other wars & revolutions. Somehow the airlines survived or came into existence when conditions stabilised. The fact that so many are now among the world's leaders is due to the calibre of the men responsible. In narrating the history the author pays tribute to these men & in remarkable detail takes the reader through all the financial & political trials that they have overcome. Of particular interest is the chapter on the airlines of the New China. The single state airline has been replaced by numerous new airlines with the latest European & United States equipment & traffic growth has been enormous. A large number of maps, tables & photographs help to make Airlines of Asia since 1920 a work of outstanding value. R E G Davies has done more than anyone else to record for all time the history of the world's airlines from the first scheduled air services in 1914. He has spent his working life involved with commercial air transport, with airlines & manufacturers of transport aircraft & since 1983 has been Air Transport Curator at the National Air & Space Museum in Washington, DC.

At a time when the faux-casualness of snapshot aesthetics has become the hallmark of authenticity, Vorpsi draws on her knowledge of painting and performance art to create intense tableaux -- erotic, existential, and pure. Vorpsi uses great skill to lay bare emotional abysses and intensities that few have the courage to face. Lush colors and harsh blacks and whites, the body's physicality and the inquiring mind's restlessness: Vorpsi seamlessly incorporates these apparent contradictions in her work, leading the viewer into a labyrinth of torments and desires. Vorpsi's use of photography and new media is not guided by the will to create yet just another cheap thrill. Her truly new and unique images, firmly grounded in her familiarity with art history, force us to face up to the erotic and spiritual crises of today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-KaPQgAACAAJ&dq=Ornela+Vorpsi:+Nothing+Obvious&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Worlds Fighting Shotguns","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HUwrSwAACAAJ&dq=The+Worlds+Fighting+Shotguns&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BCP White Gift Edition Book of Common Prayer White imitation leather 601W (Prayer Book)","description":"The 1662 Book of Common Prayer is the old and well-loved prayer book of the Church of England, in use since the 16th century in homes and churches throughout the land.

Spiritually, their journey began on a Kansas trail where the author s grandmother was born in a covered wagon in 1889. Between the Missouri River and the Golden Gate, they retraced the entire route of the first transcontinental railroad and large stretches of the Oregon and California trails, and the equally colorful old Lincoln Highway. Following vanished iron rails and wagon wheel ruts, bumping down backroads and main streets, they discovered the deep, restless, uniquely American spirit of adventure that connects our past to our present. A superb writer and an exacting researcher, Bain conjures up a marvelous sense of coming unstuck in time as he lingers in the ghost towns and battlegrounds, prairies and river ports, trainyards, museums, deserts, and diners that line his cruise west to California. Bain encounters a fascinating cast of characters, both historic and contemporary, as well as memories of his grandparents and the journeys that shaped his own heritage. Writing in the tradition of William Least Heat-Moon and Ian Frazier, and with an engaging warmth and a deep grasp of history all his own, Bain has fashioned a quintessentially American journey.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tSZ-EAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Old+Iron+Road+:+An+Epic+of+Rails,+Roads,+and+the+Urge+to+Go+West&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winter's Promise","description":"Amazon Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy Book of 2018 One of Entertainment Weekly's 10 Best YA Books of 2018 One of Publishers Weekly's Best YA Book of the Year A National Indie Bestseller Longlisted for Irish YA prize Great Reads Award Lose yourself in the fantastic world of the arks and in the company of unforgettable characters in this French runaway hit, Christelle Dabos' The Mirror Visitor quartet.

The Unheard Voices is a compilation of poetry and prose about various facets of everyday emotions. The book transitions between two distinct phases of life, elucidating emotions such as hopelessness, despair, conflict, insecurity to a catharsis of happiness, hope, and confidence. It uncovers emotions that are difficult to weave around words. The book takes readers on a thought-provoking journey on understanding these emotions; it also offers them a sense of solace and hope in understanding life and its intricacies. The author deciphers a myriad of emotions faced by people and expresses how happiness and healing are products of overcoming hopelessness and sorrow.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_TZfzgEACAAJ&dq=Unheard+Voices&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Croutons for Breakfast (Brio Girls)","description":"Hannah and Jacie both undergo personal transformations as God reveals Himself to them in new ways on a Brio missions trip to Venezuela.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JFxWjyQ9szEC&dq=Croutons+for+Breakfast+(Brio+Girls)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Minnie's pet parrot","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-IpNDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cpt 2004 Current Procedural Terminology: Standard Edition (Cpt / Current Procedural Terminology (Standard Edition))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zF9NswEACAAJ&dq=Cpt+2004+Current+Procedural+Terminology:+Standard+Edition+(Cpt+/+Current+Procedural+Terminology+(Standard+Edition))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Diva Diaries (Harlequin Blaze, No 74)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Collins Jackie: 0330297228 Hollywood Husbands","description":"A B-format reissue of Jackie Collins' trashy flashy classic bonkbuster!!!

The Roman law of delict is unusually interesting, since many basic Roman principles of delict are still prominent in modern legal systems, while other Roman principles offer sharp and important contrasts with modern ideas. The influence of Roman law has been especially strong in the Civil Law systems of Continental Europe and its former dependencies, since these systems derive many basic principles from Roman law; but Roman influence on Anglo-American law has also been appreciable in some areas, although not usually in tort. A casebook relies on direct use of primary sources in order to convey a clear understanding of what legal sources are like and how lawyers work. For Roman law, the primary sources are above all the writings of the early imperial Roman jurists. Almost all their writings date to the classical period of Roman law, approximately 30 B.C. to A.D. 235 The 171 Cases in this book all derive from the writings of pre-classical and classical jurists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lSorAQAAMAAJ&dq=A+Casebook+on+the+Roman+Law+of+Delict+(Classical+Resources+Series+/+American+Philological+Associati)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","description":"Political journalist Eric Alterman examines the unique phenomenon that is The Boss and how he has come to reflect and interpret a turbulent quarter century of American history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t5KWsFQo7s8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"EARTHBLOOD","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tewS6JK3aU8C&dq=EARTHBLOOD&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lenin and the Russian revolution (Men and their times)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sQpaAAAAYAAJ&dq=Lenin+and+the+Russian+revolution+(Men+and+their+times)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Woman's Book of Soul","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z3HszqHxW3EC&dq=Woman%27s+Book+of+Soul&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Open Adoption Book: A Guide to Adoption Without Tears","description":"A complete handbook for couples considering adoption addresses a wide range of concerns and issues raised by open adoption and offers helpful advice on all phases of the adoption process.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R40bAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Open+Adoption+Book:+A+Guide+to+Adoption+Without+Tears&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Polarized Light: Fundamentals and Applications (Optical Engineering, Vol 36)","description":"This self-study guide explores polarization using the Stokes vector, the Stokes parameters and the Mueller matrices - lending a modern perspective to the topic.

The classical historical approach of this book provides a convincing and compelling analysis of the different phases of American imperialism, which have now led to America becoming a global hegemon without any serious rivals. Victor Kiernan, one of the world's most respected historians, has used his nuanced knowledge of history, literature and politics to trace the evolution of the American Empire: he includes accounts of relations between Indians and white settlers, readings of the work of Melville and Whitman, and an analysis of the way that money and politics became so closely intertwined. Eric Hobsbawm's preface provides an insight into his own thoughts on American imperialism, and a valuable introduction to Victor Kiernan's work. Together, they shed useful light on today's urgent debates about the uses and misuses of seemingly unlimited military power, a lack of respect for international agreements, and the right to 'pre-emptive defense'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UjmO-h63uzQC&dq=America:+The+New+Imperialism:+From+White+Settlement+to+World+Hegemony,+New+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fall of 67...","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6_4LAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Electronic Signals and Systems","description":"The Book is intended for a course on signals and systems at the senior undergraduate level.

Compromising photos have been taken. Their security officer is dead under suspicious circumstances. Information about its members is being traded in shadowy places by shadowy figures. This wouldn't normally be a job for America's most deniable covert agency, but the Forum has recently devised what they call a \\"simple little plan to conquer the world.\\" That makes it a national security matter of the greatest delicacy, which makes it a job for Remo Williams. ABOUT THE SERIES: Sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit, ex-cop Remo Williams is rescued from the electric chair and recruited by a secret government organization as an assassin, targeting criminals who are beyond the law. Remo's trainer is a curmudgeonly old Korean named Chiun, whose mastery of the terrifyingly powerful martial art of Sinanju makes him the deadliest man alive.

West, a black feminist Christian ethicist, situates spiritual matters within a discussion of the psycho-social impact of intimate assault against African American women. Distinctive for its treatment of the role of the church in response to violence against African American women, the book identifies specific social mechanisms which contribute to the reproduction of intimate violence. West insists that cultural beliefs as well as institutional practices must be altered if we are to combat the reproduction of violence, and suggests methods of resistance which can be utilized by victim-survivors, those in the helping professions, and the church. Interrogating the dynamics of black women's experiences of emotional and spiritual trauma through the diverse disciplines of psychology, sociology, and theology, this important work will be of interest and practical use to those in women's studies, African American studies, Christian ethics, feminist and womanist theology, women's health, family counseling, and pastoral care.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=33MTCgAAQBAJ&dq=Wounds+of+the+Spirit:+Black+Women,+Violence,+and+Resistance+Ethics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gb Puff Daddy","description":"In its 114th year, Billboard remains the world's premier weekly music publication and a diverse digital, events, brand, content and data licensing platform.

No other legend has captured the imagination of readers as completely as that of Lancelot, Guinevere and King Arthur. Now, enter a realm at once familiar and completely new. Britain in the late 400s was a land in transition. With the Romans gone and the traditional pagan ways slowly being replaced by Christianity, a clan leader arose to unite the warring factions against the Saxon threat. This is Arthur's world. And in this world, Lancelot, raised by the Lady of the Lake, is not one of Arthur's chosen knights but the consummate outsider: Pagan in a Christian court, the Queen's champion sworn to protect her against all harm. When harm does come -- it's in the form of a betrayal so insidious it shakes the foundation of the kingdom and threatens to expose a secret that Lancelot must hide at all costs. Drawing on the little-known legends of the false Guinevere and Lancelot's trials at arms, Queen's Champion, the second book in Windstorm's Classic Tales Retold series, is a vibrant new look at the Arthurian tales, a work alive with passion, promise and a love that transcends time.

Chronicling an unbroken sequence of Nazi infamies, Lamb reveals how German troops massacred thousands of surrendering Italians in the Aegean islands, deported Italian Jews to Auschwitz, and slaughtered Italian hostages and POWs. Had it not been for Mussolini's frenzied attempts to protect his countrymen, Italy would have been treated even worse than Poland.Lamb answers important and controversial questions, such as why the Allies did not land unopposed in Italy before the Germans poured over the Brenner Pass, and why Pope Pius XII did not take a stronger stand on behalf of Jews and the victims of the Ardeatine massacre. He details Anthony Eden's opposition to an aid for Italian partisans, and the disastrous order form the War Office that British POWs should stay in their camps. He unfolds the extraordinary stories of the Cossack settlement in the Fruili, the attempted annexation of northern Italy by de Gaulle and Tito, the contributions of the Royalist Army to the Allied cause, the Italian civilians who helped Allied POWs escape, and the German generals who failed to obey Hitler's order to \\"scorch\\" all of Northern Italy.War in Italy will long remain the most complete account ever published of one of the most terrible dramas of World War II.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fzHktAEACAAJ&dq=War+In+Italy,+1943-1945:+A+Brutal+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fields Of Athenry: A Journey Through Ireland","description":"In The Fields of Athenry, James Charles Roy leads us through the Irish past and present by way of his own personal struggles and misadventures in renovating Moyode Castle, an old tower house that he purchased more than thirty years ago.

The year is 1851. It's a time of radical change in Britain, when industrial miracles and artistic innovations rub shoulders with political unrest, poverty, and disease. It is also a turbulent year in the private life of Charles Dickens, as he copes with a double bereavement and early signs that his marriage is falling apart. But this formative year will become perhaps the greatest turning point in Dickens's career, as he embraces his calling as a chronicler of ordinary people's lives and develops a new form of writing that will reveal just how interconnected the world is becoming. The Turning Point transports us into the foggy streets of Dickens's London, closely following the twists and turns of a year that would come to define him and forever alter Britain's relationship with the world. Fully illustrated, and brimming with fascinating details about the larger-than-life man who wrote Bleak House, this is the closest look yet at one of the greatest literary personalities ever to have lived.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FRIxEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Smyslov's 125 Selected Games","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S7XdHAAACAAJ&dq=Smyslov%27s+125+Selected+Games&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ponies' Plot","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P_SMswEACAAJ&dq=Ponies%27+Plot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","description":"This series provides unabridged versions of pre-20th-century novels, complete with an introduction, glossary, extended writing questions and activities.

Archaeology proved to him that the Bible is our history. From this beginning the study of the Bible took on a personal meaning. Teaching Bible study was a learning experience for him. \\"What Christmas Means To Me\\" looks at how people today see Christmas in different ways. The poem, \\"What Christmas Means To Me\\" was written in 1975 for a lesson in an adult Sunday school class in Champaign, Illinois. The author moved to Mooresville, North Carolina recently and met Dr. Terry Moore the pastor of the Williamson's Chapel United Methodist Church. The pastor read the poem and his comments inspired the author to share its message with others. The illustrations were created by the author to add his vision to the poem. George Mullins was born in 1925 in Champaign, Illinois and moved with his family to Northern Minnesota. He graduated from High School in 1943 and immediatly after graduation he joined the Navy in WWII. He was an Eagle Scout and Minnesota State swimming champion in High School and served in WWII as Ensign USNR.

With his inimitable combination of wit and wisdom, John Gierach once again celebrates the fly-fishing life in Standing in a River Waving a Stick and notes its benefits as a sport, philosophical pursuit, even therapy:  The solution to any problem work, love, money, whatever is to go fishing, and the worse the problem, the longer the trip should be.  After all, fly-fishing does teach important life lessons, says Gierach about solitude, patience, perspective, humor, and the sublime coffee break. Recounting both memorable fishing spots and memorable fish, Gierach discusses what makes a good fly pattern, the ethics of writing about undiscovered trout waters, the dread of getting skunked, and the camaraderie of fellow fishermen who can end almost any conversation with  Well, it s sort of like fishing, isn t it?  Reflecting on a lifetime of lessons learned at the end of a fly rod, Gierach concludes,  The one inscription you don t want carved on your tombstone is  The Poor Son of a Bitch Didn t Fish Enough.

Through questions, examples, and anecdotes from his own experiences, Dr. Peck provides an original, fascinating, and enriching reading experience, creating, in truth, An Anthology of Wisdom.

Dr. Peck has written a lengthy introduction and a commentary for each of the 12 parts. Below is an excerpt from his commentary on Happiness:\\"Happiness as an unmodified goal will likely be self-defeating. . . . Seek to be loved and you probably won't be; seek to love, on the other hand, and you probably will be. Look solely for happiness, and I doubt you'll find it.

Operating along the Natchez Trace, an overland trading and postal-rider route that in places was barely a trail, the outlaws preyed upon the traffic along this line. Their plans were laid in the dives under the bluffs of the river towns--Natchez and Vicksburg and as far south as New Orleans. By far the bloodiest were the Harpes, who were capable of spectacular murders solely to amuse their comrades. Another gang of outlaws under John Murrell even threatened national stability for a time in his plot to steal slaves and organize insurrection in order to disorganize the government and establish his own state. This conspiracy was discovered and defeated by a store clerk who joined the outlaws and lived several perilous months among them. He was almost hung by Murrell's secret partisans among the \\"respectable\\" elements. After the overthrow of the \\"outlaw empire\\" in 1885, the scene shifted: the frontier advanced; outlaw violence changed its forms, but it never again reached the terrible and magnificent range of the \\"outlaw years.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tNYRIxzNJCIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sun And Earth","description":"Every organism on Earth responds to four major cycles: the solar and lunar day, the synodic month and the year.

Bandine is left with two children and swears that no matter what he has to do, he won t let them grow up to face the same poverty. But how can he fight the Union occupation forces and at the same time protect his children?Outlaws of the Brasada is accompanied by one of Savage s finest short stories, ?Gunstorm Ghost,  a chilling tale of a gunfighter with his back against the wall. Due to his preference for historical accuracy, Savage often ran into problems with book editors in the 1950s who were concerned about marriages between his protagonists and women of different races?a commonplace on the real frontier but not in much Western fiction of that decade.

Carrying razor blades in their mouths and guns in their jackets for defense, they initiate drive-by shootings, carry out car jackings, stomp outsiders who stumble onto or dare to enter the neighborhood, viciously retaliate against other gangs and ferociously guard their home turf. But Sikes also captures the differences that distinguish girl gangs-abortion, teen pregnancy and teen motherhood, endless beatings and the humiliation of being forced to have sex with a lineup of male gangbangers during initiation, haphazardly raising kids in a household of drugs and guns with a part-time boyfriend off gangbanging himself. Veteran journalist Gini Sikes spends a year in the ghettos following the lives of several key gang members in South Central Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Milwaukee. In 8 Ball Chicks, we discover the fear and desperate desire for respect and status that drive girls into gangs in the first place--and the dreams and ambitions that occasionally help them to escape the catch-22 of their existence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WMRPYdMHd2kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gustav Mahler, Memories And Letters","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3AGj281NcV8C&dq=Gustav+Mahler,+Memories+And+Letters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Business Korea: A Practical Guide to Understanding South Korean Business Culture (International Business Culture)","description":"'Business Korea' offers a smooth and problem-free transition between the American and South Korean business cultures.

The sequel, The Unicorn Project, is coming Nov 26***  Every person involved in a failed IT project should be forced to read this book.  TIM O REILLY, Founder & CEO of O Reilly Media  The Phoenix Project is a must read for business and IT executives who are struggling with the growing complexity of IT.  JIM WHITEHURST, President and CEO, Red Hat, Inc. Five years after this sleeper hit took on the world of IT and flipped it on it's head, the 5th Anniversary Edition of The Phoenix Project continues to guide IT in the DevOps revolution. In this newly updated and expanded edition of the bestselling The Phoenix Project, co-author Gene Kim includes a new afterword and a deeper delve into the Three Ways as described in The DevOps Handbook. Bill, an IT manager at Parts Unlimited, has been tasked with taking on a project critical to the future of the business, code named Phoenix Project. But the project is massively over budget and behind schedule. The CEO demands Bill must fix the mess in ninety days or else Bill's entire department will be outsourced. With the help of a prospective board member and his mysterious philosophy of The Three Ways, Bill starts to see that IT work has more in common with a manufacturing plant work than he ever imagined. With the clock ticking, Bill must organize work flow streamline interdepartmental communications, and effectively serve the other business functions at Parts Unlimited. In a fast-paced and entertaining style, three luminaries of the DevOps movement deliver a story that anyone who works in IT will recognize. Readers will not only learn how to improve their own IT organizations, they'll never view IT the same way again.  This book is a gripping read that captures brilliantly the dilemmas that face companies which depend on IT, and offers real-world solutions.  JEZ HUMBLE, Co-author of Continuous Delivery, Lean Enterprise, Accelerate, and The DevOps Handbook       I m delighted at how The Phoenix Project has reshaped so many conversations in technology. My goal in writing The Unicorn Project was to explore and reveal the necessary but invisible structures required to make developers (and all engineers) productive, and reveal the devastating effects of technical debt and complexity. I hope this book can create common ground for technology and business leaders to leave the past behind, and co-create a better future together.

No one is better qualified to tell the story of Flat Track Derby's astronomic rise than Melissa \\"Melicious\\" Joulwan.

But few of us ever experience the intense and perverse hatred that inspires acts of malignant violence such as suicide bombings or ethnic massacres. In Hatred, Dr. Willard Gaylin, one of America's most respected psychiatrists, describes how raw personal passions are transformed into acts of violence and cultures of hatred. Such hatred goes beyond mere emotion. Hatred, Gaylin explains, is a psychological disorder -- a form of quasi-delusional thinking. It requires forming \\"a passionate attachment,\\" an obsessive involvement with the scapegoat population. It is designed to allow the angry and frustrated individual to disavow responsibility for his own failures and misery by directing it towards a convenient victim. Gaylin dissects the mechanisms by which cynical political and religious leaders manipulate frustrated and deprived people, leading to the acts of mass terror that threaten us all. Step-by-step, he leads us into an understanding of the psychological pathway to acts of terrorism -- an understanding that is an essential to survival in a world of hatred. Hatred is a masterwork in Willard Gaylin's life-long study of human emotions. Writing for the educated lay audience in the eloquent, accessible language of his bestsellers Feelings and Rediscovering Love, he takes us to the very roots of hatred.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VdppmgEZZeAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Breakfasts & Brunches","description":"\\"Lose up to 16 lbs. in 14 days!\\"--Cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Oo_bDgAAQBAJ&dq=Breakfasts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The memoirs of Aga Khan: World enough and time","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_78rAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+memoirs+of+Aga+Khan:+World+enough+and+time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quick & Easy Sushi Cook Book","description":"NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY SLATE ?

Many had been removed from that traditional culture as many of these warrior traditions had been removed from these new societies and the old traditions had been replaced by Christian practices of various types. The sacred preparations were no longer practiced and the warriors left vulnerable and lacking pertinent knowledge. They were also lacking the homecoming ceremonies. These ceremonies would take place after the warrior was kept from the main camp for four days. In those four days they would fast and purify themselves. Once they returned to the village the warrior was given the opportunity to tell his story in a healing ceremony. His immediate family would be near, or surrounding him. Around them would be the next level of family. Around them would be the remainder of the tribe. Everyone would listen, and remember. That was their duty to him, to listen, and to remember. Each warrior was given this opportunity.After this ceremony it was understood that this person was now different and would be treated so from then on. This  different  person was now accepted as having been permanently changed. What had happened to him would never go away. His people knew this and they would never go away either. The relationship was understood and bound.The Vietnam  warriors  were afforded none of these opportunities. They were essentially on their own. For example, when I returned, my unit landed at McChord Air Force Base near Tacoma, Washington at midnight in the winter of 1972, and released for leave; Sprung upon The World. My sister picked me up at the base and we went to downtown Tacoma and had a pizza and a several beers before going to her home. A cousin-by-marriage, whom I had met and served with In-country, was with us. We stayed with my sister for a few days and eventually I went home to Sitka to complete my 45 days leave. My cousin left for his home in Canada at the same time.This story is repeated over and over again by most everyone that I had a chance to talk, or listen to. In many of these cases, the Vietnam Vet was released and sent home to resentment and hostility. He was not listened to and what ever was expressed was not heard. Many went home on drinking binges that started on the plane or as soon as they were off the plane. No comfort given, not a friendly ear was to be found. At most American Legion Posts beer was free for a while, but after it was determined  these new guys  were really different, the free drinks stopped. What little comfort was given was soon withdrawn.Soon, the prisons began to fill up with the  new guys . Violence had become the major expression of this generation of warriors. So many of these new guys were dead, or in prison, not long after their arrival  home . It was, and still is, a national tragedy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_1kdvgAACAAJ&dq=Red+Earth:+A+Vietnam+Warrior%27s+Journey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yoga For Men Workout For Body Mind Spirit","description":"From the moment the alarm clock sounds to the time his head hits the pillow again, the typical man experiences dozens of stressful events every day.

Nothing less than a manifesto for a new social and psychological revolution to save our threatened planet, this book is a summary of the penetrating thought of Eric Fromm. His thesis is that two modes of existence struggle for the spirit of humankind: the having mode, which concentrates on material possessions, power, and aggression, and is the basis of the universal evils of greed, envy, and violence; and the being mode, which is based on love, the pleasure of sharing, and in productive activity.

This is Ballou's story. At the age of thirty-four, less than ten years after meeting the love of his life, Sarah Shumway, Ballou left his law practice and budding political career, his wife and two young sons, to take a commission as a major in the Union Army. He served in the army for almost two months but was struck down at the First Battle of Manassas-Bull Run.

Every year something violent seems to happen to him. His psychologist is baffled, and his mother lives in constant panic. He has always managed to survive-to land on his feet, like a cat. But cats have only nine lives, and Louis has used up eight, one for every year.. When he falls off a cliff during a picnic, the accident seems almost predestined.

In a renowned coma clinic, a specialist tries to coax Louis back to consciousness.

The judge, W.H. Auden, wrote the introduction to her first book of poems. Thus Rich's career was launched by one of the most distinguished poets of the twentieth century, someone Rich herself admired and emulated. Adrienne Rich's early mentors were men, and her early poetry consequently adopted a strong male persona. In her development as artist, woman, and activist, however, Rich emerged as a leading voice of modern feminism--a voice which rejects a male-dominated world, forcing new definitions of power, new possibilities for women, and profound repercussions for society. In The Aesthetics of Power, Claire Keyes examines the shape and scope of Rich's poetry as it applies to Rich's female aesthetic. Keyes uncovers the process by which Rich embraces, then rejects, accepted uses of power, achieving a vision of beneficent female power. In her early poems, Adrienne Rich accepts certain traditions associated with the divisions of power according to sex. Later, Rich continually defines and redefines power until she can reject power-as-force (patriarchal power) for the power-to-transform, which, for her, is the truly significant and essential power. Surveying Rich's poetry and prose from 1951 to the present, this book traces the development of Adrienne Rich's new understanding of the power of the poet and the power of woman. Sharing Rich's feminist sensibilities, yet at times critical of her more radical positions, Claire Keyes draws a portrait of an artist who was molded by the complex political and social climate of post-World War II America. It is a portrait that reveals the creative growth of an artist, and the personal growth of a powerful and controversial woman.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TJZi36MBs6UC&dq=Where+Such+Unmaking+Reigns&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Kids Really Want that Money Can't Buy","description":"An award-winning guide counsels parents on how to instill love for life's simpler pleasures in their children, covering such topics as understanding the difference between friendships and popularity, building family rituals, media literacy, financial skills, and avoiding materialism.

There will be a revised introduction by Goldin, and for the first time the voices of those whose stories are represented. Now being released at a time when the discourse around gender and sexual orientation is evolving, The Other Side traces some of the history that informs this new visibility. The first photographs in the book are from the 1970s, when Goldin lived in Boston with a group of drag queens and documented their glamour and vulnerability. In the early eighties, Goldin chronicled the lives of transgender friends in New York when AIDS began to decimate her community. In the nineties, she recorded the explosion of drag as a social phenomenon in New York, Berlin and Bangkok, photographing their public personas while showing their real lives backstage. Goldin's newest photographs are intimate portraits, imbued with tenderness, of some of her most beloved friends. The Other Side is her homage to the queens she's loved, many of whom she's lost, over the last four decades.The pictures in this book are not of people suffering gender dysphoria but rather expressing gender euphoria... - Nan Goldin","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MnnZwwEACAAJ&dq=Nan+Goldin:+The+Other+Side+1972-1992&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microsoft Office 2000 - Illustrated Introductory","description":"Part of the Illustrated Series, this text offers a quick, visual, step-by-step approach for learning the basics of the Microsoft Office 2000 Professional package.

They have been seen variously as sacrifices to the gods or, at funerals, to the souls of the deceased; as a mechanism for introducing young Romans to the horrors of fighting; and as a direct substitute for warfare after the imposition of peace. In this original and authoritative study, Thomas Wiedemann argues that gladiators were part of the mythical struggle of order and civilisation against the forces of nature, barbarism and law breaking, representing the possibility of a return to new life from the point of death; that Christian Romans rejected gladiatorial games not on humanitarian grounds, but because they were a rival representation of a possible resurrection.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pr2JAgAAQBAJ&dq=Emperors+and+Gladiators&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Season of Grief (Southern Tier Editions)","description":"This unique book celebrates a long-term, interracial relationship and details the everyday struggles of a surviving partner trying to carry on in a radically changed world. A Season of Grief chronicles the author's emotional descent after the violent death of his partner of 21 years. Bill Valentine's journal of fear, anger, denial, and loneliness captures the glimmers of hope, moments of serendipity, and mysterious coincidences that emerged from his full-time devotion to grief following the death of Joe Lopes. Lopes died along with 264 others when American Airlines Flight 587 crashed in November 2001 in route to the Dominican Republic. It was the second deadliest accident in U.S. aviation history. He is a word always on my lips as I try to work him into a conversation. He is a memory that I strive to keep alive. So yes, in this sense, he is not gone. But in reality, he is. He is gone as my lover. He is gone as my life partner. He is gone as my soul mate, the only person to whom I periodically bared my soul. He is gone as my best friend, the only person to whom I ever attached that label. So pardon me while I still hang on to the notion that he is not here with me. Pardon me while I cling stubbornly to the insistence that he is gone. Valentine's candid and thoughtful account of his heartbreaking efforts to make sense of his partner's death and survive in a world without him is by turns, funny, frightening, sobering, and surprising. In the nine months following the tragedy of Flight 587, Valentine finds every waking moment of his life affected by his partner's absence from mundane household chores to major life decisions. A Season of Grief is a story told in darkness and light, of hurt and healing, love and loneliness, but mostly, of a man who learns to live with his partner's absence through the persistent, surprising evidence of his presence. Our job on earth is to live with uncertainty, ambiguity, and hope. We are given a limited tool set but one, in my opinion, that's sufficient for the job. Sufficient to allow us to be engaged in life-to love, grieve, work, play, celebrate, and despair. We have a remarkable ability to rebound and grow. We have been granted the capacity for wonder and laughter especially at ourselves. These last two gifts were bestowed generously on Joe and he, in turn, taught me how vital they are. Making a strong case for gay marriage, A Season of Grief chronicles Valentine's struggles to be recognized as a surviving spouse, including a historic lawsuit with Lambda Legal Defense and Education fund against the New York State Workers Compensation Board. Valentine and Lopes took every conceivable step to formalize their relationship, including New York City Domestic Partnership, but the Workers Compensation Board and a New York State appeals court refused to recognize Valentine as a legal surviving spouse. Grief doesn't come with a set of instructions. But A Season of Grief can help guide you through the lonely journey that follows the death of a loved one. Valentine's memoir is a testament to the healing power of reality and the enduring nature of love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3vusAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fourier Analysis and Boundary Value Problems","description":"Fourier Analysis and Boundary Value Problems provides a thorough examination of both the theory and applications of partial differential equations and the Fourier and Laplace methods for their solutions.

Kathryn Zabelle Derounian-Stodola examines the complex 1862 Dakota Conflict (also called the Dakota War) by focusing on twenty-four of the dozens of narratives that European Americans and Native Americans wrote about it. This six-week war was the deadliest confrontation between whites and Dakotas in Minnesota?s history. Conducted at the same time as the Civil War, it is sometimes called Minnesota?s Civil War because it?was?and continues to be?so divisive. ? The Dakota Conflict aroused impassioned prose from participants and commentators as they disputed causes, events, identity, ethnicity, memory, and the all-important matter of the war?s legacy. Though the study targets one region, its ramifications reach far beyond Minnesota in its attention to war and memory. An ethnography of representative Dakota Conflict narratives and an analysis of the war?s historiography, The War in Words includes new archival information, historical data, and textual criticism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ER95VImzctsC&dq=Daughters+of+Dakota:+Stories+of+Friendship+Between+Settlers+and+the+Dakota+Indians+(Daughters+of+Dakota,+Volume+3)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rete!

The time was three...\\" As the announcer spoke those fateful words, the crowd roared, and the century-long quest to run 'the world's greatest race' was finally at an end. For decades, amateur athletes like the American Lon Myers, a stick-thin hypochondriac who was sick before and after every race, yet still held every US record from 50 yards to the mile, and Joe Binks, an English journalist who only trained once per week, dominated the field. Paavo Nurmi, the 'Phantom Finn', won nine Olympic gold medals and set so many world records that statisticians still argue over the total, but even he couldn't breach the magic four-minute mark. As competition intensified, the Swede Gunder 'the Wonder' Haegg ran the mile in 4:01.4 - but it took the legendary Roger Bannister and his two co-runners to finally accomplish 'the most significant sporting achievement of the twentieth century'. It took a wholesale reimagining of running itself, as each generation built on the discoveries and secrets of the last, until the fateful day finally arrived, and an impossible dream became reality: 6 May 1954.

A tug of Harley's leathery reins could instantly eradicate mounting bills, unfinished work, and the reality of a troubled marriage from her mind. But one day, as she was leading Harley across a stream in a picturesque California canyon, he panicked, knocked her to the ground, and trampled her nearly severing her leg in the process. Dunn had always been  accident prone  but in the aftermath of this incident, she began to analyze the details of her life and her propensity for accidents. Was she really just a klutz? Or could there be some underlying emotional reason she was always putting her life in danger? A blend of personal narrative and of research about what drives some people to have more accidents than others, Not by Accident is an insightful, incisive memoir that helps bridge the gap in understanding that exists on the concept of accident proneness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QvZ6DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plantation","description":"Rich survey ranges from pioneer cabins to French Provincial and Neoclassic revivals.

He remembers vividly the transformation of that primitive land, with dirt roads and tire tracks where Interstate Highways stand today. Bob grew up listening to tales of his neighbors--old prospectors and miners. Inspired by them, he became a mining engineer and an intrinsic part of the process by which copper, gold, and other metals were extracted from Arizona rock. In his 90 years of residence in Arizona, he has witnessed many changes, and, in fact, he mapped a lot of them! In this first of two volumes, he describes how his family came from their ancestral home in Scotland to Pennsylvania, Iowa, Nebraska, and finally Arizona. Then, in detail, he recalls the Yuma he knew as a boy--a town of a few thousand souls with many stories to tell. Now he is ready to tell his own.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AJ5EQJ2tYfUC&dq=It+Seems+Like+Only+Yesterday:+Mining+and+Mapping+in+Arizona%27s+First+Century+Vol+1:+The+Yuma+Years&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Balloon Fun for the Whole Family","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pam8AQAACAAJ&dq=Great+Balloon+Fun+for+the+Whole+Family&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The stricken land;: The story of Puerto Rico","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fJkqAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+stricken+land%3B:+The+story+of+Puerto+Rico&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Return Grand Theory Hn Se","description":"This is a volume of new essays introducing the most influential developments in social and political theory over the last thirty years.

The authors show that, since the sixties, the Left has had little to do with setting the country's agenda and that conservative think tanks and foundations have been systematically abetting a conservative revolution by funding a variety of issue-oriented studies and programs. The authors focus on seven areas in which this battle has been waged and won by the powerful conservative coalition: English Only; Proposition 187 and immigration reform; IQ, race, and eugenics; affirmative action; welfare; tort reform; and campus multi-culturalism. How has the Right managed to gain the advantage in these traditionally liberal campaigns? How can this be stopped? During this research, the authors found themselves in partial admiration of the dedication, economy of effort, and sheer ingenuity of the conservative forces. But Stefancic and Delgado seek to inform the American public about how the juggernaut operates - not to celebrate but to combat it. They challenge the Left to adopt the same sort of strategic focus and issue orientation as the Right to bring this country back to the center - before it's too late.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZYZiQgAACAAJ&dq=No+Mercy:+How+Conservative+Think+Tanks+and+Foundations+Changed+America%27s+Social+Agenda&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BAGATORIALS: A Book Full of Bags","description":"A collection of libertarian writings, graphs, charts, illustrations, and cartoons found on the paper bags of the Cheaper! discount grocery stores found in northern California","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sHoHPQAACAAJ&dq=BAGATORIALS:+A+Book+Full+of+Bags&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maimonides,: A biography","description":"Heschel's classic work on Maimonides, originally published in Berlin during the thirties, in one of the few scholarly biographies available of the great medieval philosopher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ki6a7WsZYwMC&dq=Maimonides,:+A+biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Study Guide to Microbiology: An Introduction","description":"Students can master key concepts and earn a better grade with the help of the clear, concise writing and creative, thought-provoking exercises found in this Study Guide, written by Berdell Funke, one of the textbook authors.

Medical education is influenced to a great extent by pharmaceutical companies and focuses our attention dangerously onto drug therapies. Conventional medicine practice has been failing miserably to control or treat the chronic disease entities afflicting our population in the modern era. Integrative medicine concepts and practice offer people much safer and often more effective options for achieving and maintaining health, as well as combating most forms of chronic disease. The keys include understanding what it really takes to promote human health in a broad sense and what the underlying causes of chronic disease truly are. Thinking Outside the Pill Box contains an explanation of how our medical system came to be so defective and ineffectual, a thorough look at the important factors influencing human health, and an in-depth discussion of many common underlying causes of chronic illness in the modern world.

Since it was first published almost a decade ago, Seth Godin's visionary book has helped tens of thousands of leaders turn a scattering of followers into a loyal tribe. If you need to rally fellow employees, customers, investors, believers, hobbyists, or readers around an idea, this book will demystify the process. It's human nature to seek out tribes, be they religious, ethnic, economic, political, or even musical (think of the Deadheads). Now the Internet has eliminated the barriers of geography, cost, and time. Social media gives anyone who wants to make a difference the tools to do so. With his signature wit and storytelling flair, Godin presents the three steps to building a tribe: the desire to change things, the ability to connect a tribe, and the willingness to lead. If you think leadership is for other people, think again leaders come in surprising packages. Consider Joel Spolsky and his international tribe of scary-smart software engineers. Or Gary Vaynerhuck, a wine expert with a devoted following of enthusiasts. Chris Sharma led a tribe of rock climbers up impossible cliff faces, while Mich Mathews, a VP at Microsoft, ran her internal tribe of marketers from her cube in Seattle. Tribes will make you think really think about the opportunities to mobilize an audience that are already at your fingertips. It's not easy, but it's easier than you think.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7f1DyktinKoC&dq=Tribes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Even As Your Soul Prospers: Realize Your Purpose, Release Your Blessings","description":"Weeks reveals the secrets to an abundant life through the understanding of soul prosperity and explains that the blessings of God are directly related to fulfilling one's purpose.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QEr4wAEACAAJ&dq=Even+As+Your+Soul+Prospers:+Realize+Your+Purpose,+Release+Your+Blessings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Princess Penelope's 365 Dresses","description":"Penelope gets a new dress every morning until the king decides this ridiculous routine must stop.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9dTXXwAACAAJ&dq=Princess+Penelope%27s+365+Dresses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inside Dreamweaver MX (Inside (New Riders))","description":"Annotation This title has a solid mix of in-depth explanation of Dreamweaver X features and real-world tips and tricks to make Dreamweaver work.

Independent labels are springing up to release their music. But this isn't the story of punk. Forget punk. Punk was a flash in the pan compared to this. This is the story of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, a musical movement that changed the world. From this movement - given the unwieldy acronym NWOBHM - sprang streams that would flow through metal's subsequent development. Without NWOBHM there is no thrash metal, no death metal, no black metal. Without the rise of Iron Maiden, NWOBHM's standard bearers, leading the charge to South America and to South Asia, metal's global spread is slower. Without the NWOBHM bands - who included Def Leppard, Motorhead, Judas Priest, Diamond Head and many others - the international uniform of heavy metal - the 'battle jacket' of a denim jacket with sleeves ripped off, and covered with patches (usually sewn on by the wearer's mum), worn over a leather biker jacket - does not exist: 'Denim and leather brought us all together,' as Saxon put it. No book has ever gathered together all the principals of British heavy rock's most fertile period: Jimmy Page, Rick Allen, Michael Schenker, Robert John 'Mutt' Lange, Ritchie Blackmore, Rick Savage, Phil Collen, David Coverdale, Cronos, Biff Byford, Joe Elliott, Rob Halford, Ian Gillan, Phil Mogg, Robert Plant, Tony Wilson, Lars Ulrich, Pete Waterman to name a few. In Denim and Leather, these stars tell their own stories - their brilliant, funny tales of hubris and disaster, of ambition and success - and chart how, over a handful of years from the late 1970s to the early 1980s, a group of unlikely looking blokes from the provinces wearing spandex trousers changed heavy music forever. This is the definitive story about the greatest days of British heavy rock.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nBIhEAAAQBAJ&dq=New+Wave+Of+British+Heavy+Metal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Restless (Blaze) (Harlequin Temptation, No 807)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VcbfAAAAMAAJ&dq=Restless+(Blaze)+(Harlequin+Temptation,+No+807)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What In Brief Is Buddhism?","description":"What in Brief is Buddhism is at once an erudite and accessible guide to the fundamental teachings of Buddhism, as well as to the major aspects of its practice.

In covering such a vast territory of history, doctrine, and practice, the book serves as a meaningful encounter with Buddhism. Writing with primarily a Western audience in mind, Ananda Guruge draws from his extensive knowledge of Buddhism as both a long-time scholar and practitioner. This rich exposition of Buddhism's historical development and regional expansion is further enhanced by the addition of an anthology of Buddhist writings, and by a useful dictionary of Buddhist terms.

When Jennifer Doudna was in sixth grade, she came home one day to find that her dad had left a paperback titled The Double Helix on her bed. She put it aside, thinking it was one of those detective tales she loved. When she read it on a rainy Saturday, she discovered she was right, in a way. As she sped through the pages, she became enthralled by the intense drama behind the competition to discover the code of life. Even though her high school counselor told her girls didn t become scientists, she decided she would. Driven by a passion to understand how nature works and to turn discoveries into inventions, she would help to make what the book s author, James Watson, told her was the most important biological advance since his codiscovery of the structure of DNA. She and her collaborators turned a curiosity of nature into an invention that will transform the human race: an easy-to-use tool that can edit DNA. Known as CRISPR, it opened a brave new world of medical miracles and moral questions. The development of CRISPR and the race to create vaccines for coronavirus will hasten our transition to the next great innovation revolution. The past half-century has been a digital age, based on the microchip, computer, and internet. Now we are entering a life-science revolution. Children who study digital coding will be joined by those who study genetic code. Should we use our new evolution-hacking powers to make us less susceptible to viruses? What a wonderful boon that would be! And what about preventing depression? Hmmm Should we allow parents, if they can afford it, to enhance the height or muscles or IQ of their kids? After helping to discover CRISPR, Doudna became a leader in wrestling with these moral issues and, with her collaborator Emmanuelle Charpentier, won the Nobel Prize in 2020. Her story is an  enthralling detective story  (Oprah Daily) that involves the most profound wonders of nature, from the origins of life to the future of our species.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f_D3DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Depeche Mode Anthology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vv97PgAACAAJ&dq=Depeche+Mode+Anthology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Focke-Wulf Fw 190D - Walk Around No. 10","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hslVLwEACAAJ&dq=Focke-Wulf+Fw+190D+-+Walk+Around+No.+10&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Do It!

For twenty-two years, twenty thousand men laboured day and night to fulfil the emperors obsession. The result was the Taj Mahal, a marble mausoleum lined with gold, silver and precious jewels. This powerful novel narrates the story of the Taj on two parallel levels. The first one tells the passionate love story of Shah Jahan and Arjumand till her death through the voices of three main characters - Arjumand, Shah Jahan and Isa, Arjumands favourite eunuch. The second recounts the later years of Shah Jahans reign, the building of the Taj Mahal and the bloody pursuit of the fabled Peacock Throne by his sons. Intertwined with the narrative about the building of the Taj is the story of Murthi, the Hindu craftsman sent as a gift to the emperor to carve the famous marble jali around Arjumands sarcophagus. In this complex and fascinating book, Murari has written much more than a historical romance. He has skillfully recreated the period against which the story is set: the opulence of the palace and the grinding poverty of seventeenth-century India, the vicissitudes of Shah Jahans reign and the often bitter conflict between men of different faiths","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ut0vzQEACAAJ&dq=Taj&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Textbook of Music","description":"The main purpose of the book is to explore basic music theory so thoroughly that the interested student will then be able to easily pick up whatever further theory is wanted.

They dared to risk it all in a skiff of reeds or leather, on a ship of wood or steel, knowing the only thing between them and certain death was their ship. To explore, to seek out what lay beyond the close and comfortable, every explorer had to embrace danger. And as they did so, what arose was a mystical bond, a passion for the ships that carried them. From the very first time humans dared to warp the fabric of space, escaping from the ashes of the third World War, they also created ships. These vessels have become the icons of mankind's desire to rise above the everyday, to seek out and make the unknown known. And these ships that travel the stellar seas have stirred the same passions as the ones that floated in the oceans. While every captain has wished that their starship could be outfitted in the same manner as the sailing ship H.M.S. Beagle without weapons that proved untenable. From the start, Starfleet realized that each vessel, due to the limited range of the early warp engines, must be able to stand alone against any attack. Thus arose the idea, taken from the days of wooden sailing ships, that every Starfleet vessel must stand as a ship of the line. Through the actions of their captains and crews, countless starships have taken on that role. Here we remember some of those ships and their heroic crews. In celebration of one of science fiction's most beloved franchises, this updated edition of the acclaimed Ships of the Line hardcover collection now includes dozens of additional images brought together for the first time in book format spectacular renderings featured in the highly successful Star Trek: Ships of the Line calendar series. With text by Star Trek's own Michael Okuda, the story of each of these valiant starships now comes to life. ?, ?, & ? 2014 CBS Studios, Inc.

As the inventor and public entrepreneur who launched the Manhattan Project, helped to create the military-industrial complex, conceived a permanent system of government support for science and engineering, and anticipated both the personal computer and the Internet, Vannevar Bush is the twentieth century s Ben Franklin. In this engaging look at one of America s most awe-inspiring polymaths, writer G. Pascal Zachary brings to life an American original a man of his time, ours, and beyond. Zachary details how Bush cofounded Raytheon and helped build one of the most powerful early computers in the world at MIT. During World War II, he served as Roosevelt s adviser and chief contact on all matters of military technology, including the atomic bomb. He launched the Manhattan Project and oversaw a collection of 6,000 civilian scientists who designed scores of new weapons. After the war, his attention turned to the future. He wrote essays that anticipated the rise of the Internet and boldly equated national security with research strength, outlining a system of permanent federal funding for university research that endures to this day. However, Bush s hopeful vision of science and technology was leavened by an understanding of the darker possibilities. While cheering after witnessing the Trinity atomic test, he warned against the perils of a nuclear arms race. He led a secret appeal to convince President Truman not to test the Hydrogen Bomb and campaigned against the Red Scare.

Constraint programming is currently applied with success to many domains, such as scheduling, planning, vehicle routing, configuration, networks, and bioinformatics. The aim of this handbook is to capture the full breadth and depth of the constraint programming field and to be encyclopedic in its scope and coverage. While there are several excellent books on constraint programming, such books necessarily focus on the main notions and techniques and cannot cover also extensions, applications, and languages. The handbook gives a reasonably complete coverage of all these lines of work, based on constraint programming, so that a reader can have a rather precise idea of the whole field and its potential. Of course each line of work is dealt with in a survey-like style, where some details may be neglected in favor of coverage. However, the extensive bibliography of each chapter will help the interested readers to find suitable sources for the missing details. Each chapter of the handbook is intended to be a self-contained survey of a topic, and is written by one or more authors who are leading researchers in the area. The intended audience of the handbook is researchers, graduate students, higher-year undergraduates and practitioners who wish to learn about the state-of-the-art in constraint programming. No prior knowledge about the field is necessary to be able to read the chapters and gather useful knowledge. Researchers from other fields should find in this handbook an effective way to learn about constraint programming and to possibly use some of the constraint programming concepts and techniques in their work, thus providing a means for a fruitful cross-fertilization among different research areas. The handbook is organized in two parts. The first part covers the basic foundations of constraint programming, including the history, the notion of constraint propagation, basic search methods, global constraints, tractability and computational complexity, and important issues in modeling a problem as a constraint problem. The second part covers constraint languages and solver, several useful extensions to the basic framework (such as interval constraints, structured domains, and distributed CSPs), and successful application areas for constraint programming. - Covers the whole field of constraint programming - Survey-style chapters - Five chapters on applications","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kjap9ZWcKOoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Photography: Revised Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zWp2vwEACAAJ&dq=Photography:+Revised+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lost for the Cause: The Confederate Army in 1864","description":"Discusses the last year of the Civil War, including Linclon's reelection, and the final battles west of Richmond which ended the Confederate Army's hopes of victory and the surrender at Appomattox.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZsM_cpb1rB8C&dq=Lost+for+the+Cause:+The+Confederate+Army+in+1864&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frommer's Thailand","description":"Listen to a free podcast on Thailand and Cambodia!

The Well of Loneliness tells the story of tomboyish Stephen, who hunts, wears trousers and cuts her hair short - and who gradually comes to realise that she is attracted to women. Charting her romantic and professional adventures during the First World War and beyond, the novel provoked a furore on first publication in 1928 for its lesbian heroine and led to a notorious legal trial for obscenity. Hall herself, however, saw the book as a pioneer work and today it is recognised as a landmark work of gay fiction. This Penguin edition includes a new introduction by Maureen Duffy. 'The archetypal lesbian novel' - Times Literary Supplement 'One of the first and most influential contributions of gay and lesbian literature' - New Statesman Radclyffe Hall was born in 1880. After an unhappy childhood, she inherited her father's estate and from then on was free to travel and live as she chose. She fell in love and lived with an older woman before settling down with Una Troubridge, a married sculptor. Hall wrote many books but is best known for The Well of Loneliness, first published in 1928. She died in 1943 and is buried in Highgate Cemetery in London. Maureen Duffy was born in 1933 and educated at Kings College London. She became a full-time writer in the 1960s, and has since written numerous screenplays, poetry and novels. A lifelong campaigner for gay rights and animal rights, Duffy is also president of the Authors' Licensing and Collecting Society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4Mg6BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Decorating Your Garden: Inspired Ways to Use Ornamental Objects and Furnishings Outdoors","description":"Shows how to use sculpture, birdbaths, fountains, pools, sundials, planters, benches, trellises, birdhouses, and fences in a landscape design","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=goTScYnXXn8C&dq=Decorating+Your+Garden:+Inspired+Ways+to+Use+Ornamental+Objects+and+Furnishings+Outdoors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Digimon World: Prima's Official Strategy Guide","description":"Explains the ins and outs of the game, covering the Digimon data chart, maps, characters, battle strategies, and training tips.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O4upNwAACAAJ&dq=Digimon+World:+Prima%27s+Official+Strategy+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","description":"Astride her white palfrey, surrounded by a nimbus of silver-blond hair, Jasmine was a vision to strike a man mute with desire.

Who built them, how, and for what purpose, are endlessly debated. David Furlong's 25 years of research form an important breakthrough in our understanding, provide amazing new concepts and information, and reveal an astonishing picture of our past. The Keys to the Temple presents startling new evidence about the history of mankind. After years of research David Furlong has discovered extraordinary patterns of alignments in the British landscape which link ancient sites and -- incredibly -- give a blueprint of the same geometric patterning found in the Great Pyramid in Egypt. These detailed calculations prove beyond doubt that a society with highly sophisticated astronomical, mathematical, and surveying knowledge was living in Britain and Northern Europe, 3000 years before Christ and creating highly complex \\"temples in the landscape\\". These events correspond exactly with the start of dynastic Egypt, the building of the pyramids, and the beginning of the famed Mayan Calendar. Who were these masterbuilders? Where did they come from? What roots did they share with the masterbuilders of Egypt and South America. What message did they hope to conceal in the landscape?

It is a despoblado where desperate people defend secret places. But it is also known as El Gran Desierto a place where stately saguaros stand near aromatic elephant trees, where sand dunes caress the edges of jagged granite mountains, where one can watch bighorn sheep in the morning and whales in the afternoon. Over the years, desert rat Bill Broyles has ventured repeatedly into this sunshot landscape, slogged across its salt flats and sand dunes, and defied its deadly heat. This book chronicles his years of exploration, a vivid and personal introduction to a thorny but ultimately enchanting place that manages to endear itself over time, if it doesn t kill you first. Michael Berman s stark black-and-white photographs capture the desolate beauty of the desert while conveying a sense of Broyles  adventures. Gleaned from more than 4,000 images shot with a large-format camera, these exquisite photographs translate the desert s formidable monotone into finely tuned studies of light and represent some of the best photos ever taken of this mysterious region. El Gran Desierto is a grand desert indeed, with beauty, spirit, and mystery rivaling any place on Earth, and anyone captivated by the earlier explorations of Lumholtz, Ives, or Hornaday or by Edward Abbey s love of desert places will revel in these modern-day adventures. Sunshot defies the stereotype of a punishing wilderness to show how even the most perilous desert can be alluring if approached with knowledge and respect.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x95b3hiqr2MC&dq=Sunshot:+Peril+and+Wonder+in+the+Gran+Desierto+(Southwest+Center+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Glas 17: Sonechka and Other Stories (Glass Innactive Series)","description":"First published in Russia in 1992, The Time: Night is a darkly humorous depiction of the Soviet utopia's underbelly by one of the most brilliant stylists in contemporary Russian literature.

C. S. Lewis's classic An Experiment in Criticism springs from the conviction that literature exists for the joy of the reader and that books should be judged by the kind of reading they invite. He argues that 'good reading', like moral action or religious experience, involves surrender to the work in hand and a process of entering fully into the opinions of others: 'in reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself'. Crucial to his notion of judging literature is a commitment to laying aside expectations and values extraneous to the work, in order to approach it with an open mind.

This book is expected to be a valuable aid to anyone considering the application of Fuzzy Logic to the Semantic Web, because it contains a number of detailed accounts of these combined fields, written by leading authors in several countries. The Fuzzy Logic field has been maturing for forty years. These years have witnessed a tremendous growth in the number and variety of applications, with a real-world impact across a wide variety of domains with humanlike behavior and reasoning. And we believe that in the coming years, the Semantic Web will be major field of applications of Fuzzy Logic. This book, the first in the new series Capturing Intelligence, shows the positive role Fuzzy Logic, and more generally Soft Computing, can play in the development of the Semantic Web, filling a gap and facing a new challenge. It covers concepts, tools, techniques and applications exhibiting the usefulness, and the necessity, for using Fuzzy Logic in the Semantic Web. It finally opens the road to new systems with a high Web IQ. Most of today's Web content is suitable for human consumption. The Semantic Web is presented as an extension of the current web in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation. For example, within the Semantic Web, computers will understand the meaning of semantic data on a web page by following links to specified ontologies. But while the Semantic Web vision and research attracts attention, as long as it will be used two-valued-based logical methods no progress will be expected in handling ill-structured, uncertain or imprecise information encountered in real world knowledge. Fuzzy Logic and associated concepts and techniques (more generally, Soft Computing), has certainly a positive role to play in the development of the Semantic Web. Fuzzy Logic will not supposed to be the basis for the Semantic Web but its related concepts and techniques will certainly reinforce the systems classically developed within W3C. In fact, Fuzzy Logic cannot be ignored in order to bridge the gap between human-understandable soft logic and machine-readable hard logic. None of the usual logical requirements can be guaranteed: there is no centrally defined format for data, no guarantee of truth for assertions made, no guarantee of consistency. To support these arguments, this book shows how components of the Semantic Web (like XML, RDF, Description Logics, Conceptual Graphs, Ontologies) can be covered, with in each case a Fuzzy Logic focus.

This Adelphi Paper assesses the overall trajectory of Japan s security policy over the last decade, and the impact of a changing Japanese military posture on the stability of East Asia. The paper examines Japan s evolving security debate, set against the background of a shifting international environment and domestic policymaking system; the status of Japan s national military capabilities and constitutional prohibitions; post-Cold War developments in the US Japan alliance; and Japan s role in multilateral regional security dialogue, UN PKO, and US-led coalitions of the willing. It concludes that Japan is undoubtedly moving along the trajectory of becoming a more assertive military power, and that this trend has been accelerated post-9/11. Japan is unlikely, though, to channel its military power through greatly different frameworks than at present. Japan will opt for the enhanced, and probably inextricable, integration of its military capabilities into the US Japan alliance, rather than pursuing options for greater autonomy or multilateralism. Japan s strengthened role as the defensive shield for the offensive sword of US power projection will only serve to bolster US military hegemony in East Asia and globally.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WWH5AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who Built the Ark?: An African-American Spiritual","description":"In this book, African American literature is illuminated through a project-based curriculum that incorporates national curriculum standards.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lvHPrQcgShUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","description":"The Russian novelist and moral philosopher Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) ranks as one of the world s great writers, and his 'War and Peace' has been called the greatest novel ever written.

It is a commerce whose impact upon humanity rivals that of any other business--millions of lives have been saved by blood and its various derivatives, and tens of thousands of lives have been lost. Douglas Starr tells how this came to be, in a sweeping history that ranges through the centuries. With the dawn of science, blood came to be seen as a component of human anatomy, capable of being isolated, studied, used. Starr describes the first documented transfusion: In the seventeenth century, one of Louis XIV's court physicians transfers the blood of a calf into a madman to \\"cure\\" him. At the turn of the twentieth century a young researcher in Vienna identifies the basic blood groups, taking the first step toward successful transfusion. Then a New York doctor finds a way to stop blood from clotting, thereby making all transfusion possible. In the 1930s, a Russian physician, in grisly improvisation, successfully uses cadaver blood to help living patients--and realizes that blood can be stored. The first blood bank is soon operating in Chicago. During World War II, researchers, driven by battlefield needs, break down blood into usable components that are more easily stored and transported. This \\"fractionation\\" process--accomplished by a Harvard team--produces a host of pharmaceuticals, setting the stage for the global marketplace to come. Plasma, precisely because it can be made into long-lasting drugs, is shipped and traded for profit; today it is a $5 billion business. The author recounts the tragic spread of AIDS through the distribution of contaminated blood products, and describes why and how related scandals have erupted around the world. Finally, he looks at the latest attempts to make artificial blood. Douglas Starr has written a groundbreaking book that tackles a subject of universal and urgent importance and explores the perils and promises that lie ahead.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mj6-jY3H_O4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The ROAD LESS TRAVELED PART III RELIGION & GRACE CASSETTE : Religion & Grace","description":"'Life is difficult.

Everyday Pornography presents original work from scholars from a range of academic disciplines (Media Studies, Law, Sociology, Psychology, Women s Studies, Political Science), introducing new methodologies and approaches whilst reflecting on the ongoing value of older approaches.

But that region is in the grip of a cholera epidemic, travelers are being imprisoned behind barricades, and exposure to the disease is almost certain.

Not only have they been a driving force behind the spread of liberal politics; they have also been steadfastly loyal to a doctrine that promised them both safety and political acceptance. Recent evidence suggests that their commitment has not waned. But while Jews continue to stand up for other groups and \\"vote their conscience,\\" contends Ruth Wisse, the liberal commitment to the Jews is not nearly so strong. Whenever Jews have been attacked - from the trial of Captain Dreyfus to the sustained military and political war against Israel - liberals have been slow to defend Jewish rights and have preferred instead to hold the Jews responsible for the persistence of their enemies. The explanation for this liberal default, Wisse argues, is the survival and success of anti-Semitism. This irrational idea continues to flourish throughout the world, despite the destruction of the fascist and communist regimes that were its deadliest twentieth-century allies. Wisse points out that anti-Semitism's astonishing resilience has put liberals - including liberal Jews - in an impossible position. The only reasonable response to such a doctrine, Wisse insists, is not appeasement or avoidance, but steadfast confrontation and rejection. Yet such opposition is alien to liberal ideas of open-mindedness and strikes many as intolerant. Unwilling to suspend their optimistic view of man as a benevolent and rational being in order to combat a mortal enemy, most liberals - including many Jews - conclude that Jews themselves must be responsible for the continuing wars against them - thus implicitly condoning their sacrifice. Wisse's book, inspired by a friend's emigration to Israel, traces the Jewish romance with liberalism from its discovery by Jewish integrationists and Zionists to the acceptance today by many Jews of a moral equivalence between Zionism and the war against it. She also explores, among the many contradictions of modern Jewish politics, the ambiguous question of Jewish \\"chosenness,\\" and the Jewish longing for acceptance in a larger human family; the successful Arab war of ideas against Israel; and the dilemma of Jewish writers and intellectuals who wish to transcend their parochializing siege. Above all, she shows how and why anti-Semitism became the twentieth century's most successful ideology and reveals what people in liberal democracies would have to do to prevent it from once again achieving its goal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MHxEu9cthmIC&dq=If+I+Am+Not+For+Myself&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love is a Four Letter Word","description":"Sex.

She must be practically a virgin again by now, all sealed over like pierced ears if you don't wear earrings for too long. But the 'L' word? Uh-huh. No way. She never wanted to hear it again.
