My 3 yr old now loves to listen to the story too and can't wait to do it again. When asked to \\"Go get a book to read\\", it is always the first one they choose. It definitely is a favorite by far and I highly recommend it. This Christmas I purchased 5 copies through Amazon for gifts for my friends grandchildren.

This has been a favorite of my grandchildren, and I have bought it for others with favorable comments. A cute story and kids like moving the mouse from page to page along the dotted line in the book.

He loved it. When son number two came along, he destroyed the mouse. After a time we recovered the pieces and repaired it. There were many inquiries after that about whether he wanted to destroy the mouse or not. He tells me that he does not. Once he was old enough to enjoy books, the mouse became treasured and was not subject to further injury. Instead the second son looks after the mouse, and is frequently found reading the book to himself (\\"He gave Mrs. B a fright!\\"), passing the mouse through its pages. This is a great book, much loved by both my sons. I only wish there were more books like this, because even at 8, my older son fights with the 3 year old for the privilege of passing the mouse about the house."},{"Title":"There's a Mouse about the House","review":"ISBN 0881101540 - Childrens' books with fun gimmicks are the ones that will grab a child's attention and lure them into the world of reading. That's a great thing and this book fits the bill, although there is one rather large negative.A hungry mouse wanders through the house in search of food. The mouse moves from room to room, following a dotted line, while the reader slips the cute little rodent through slots on each page. From the pantry to the kitchen, upstairs and back down again, the mouse finally finds his dinner and is ready to start all over again!The negative? Well, the book comes with a mouse that is stuck to the front cover with double-sided tape. Once the mouse has been taken off that tape, it might as well be a wild mouse because it seems to get lost easily. New, this is a superb book; used, I wouldn't buy it unless I was buying it in person OR if the online seller specifies whether or not the mouse is present. To make up for this loss potential, there is a mouse drawn on the back cover with directions for making a replacement. That's great, but some of us aren't up for the effort.That aside, Richard Fowler's definitely got a hit here. The mouse is cute, the illustrations are nicely detailed and colorful and the liftable flaps, along with the slots for the mouse to slip through, are a wonderfully fun gimmick that will keep children coming back for another reading.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"There's a Mouse about the House","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book for our two-year old grandson.

They all LOVE this book. We actually picked it up at a garage sale and the mouse was missing but the back cover gives a template for making a new mouse which is really great! I decided to give this as Christmas gifts this year for those who have young children. The story is about a mouse trying to find food in the house and he slips through slits in the pages to get from one area to another. My 5yr old always wants to work the mous and usually is able to do it just fine on her own. Some of the slots are easier than others but all in all she really enjoys it. The content of the book is fine for someone who is concerned with that. Nothing that would make you cringe like other childrens books. Great buy, worth the price in my opinion. I have heard that this one is better then the squirell book.Good for ages 1-7Pros:-Very cute, kids will LOVE it.-Different from any other book we have-Gets the kids interacting with the story while moving the mouse around-Easy to make a new mouse when it gets lostCons:-Can&#8217;t think of any!

When she read to them, she had a way of bringing the book to life. She was so good at inflecting her voice, reading dialog with real emotion and giving each character their own unique voice...Sometimes you could see that the little one listening was so engrossed by the story itself and by her extra touches and enthusiasm .... She could also spend several minutes on one page with only a few words on it as she would point to the illustrations and talk about, ask questions, and spark their imaginations and creativity by doing things like pointing to an unidentified character in the illustration ... Maybe in crowd or classroom full of kids that was drawn ... And say, \\"let's give him a name..he looks like a George to me... What do you think?\\".Anyway, with her master story time skills and this book about there being a mouse about the house where kids can thread a separate \\"mouse\\" through each page... Well, it was so much fun that it was most always the number one request for grandma to read .... She sometimes made the experience almost too fun as once when I returned from an errand to pick up child she was babysitting, I found them literally rolling on the floor laughing uncontrollably with that book lying open by them on the floor...Apparently they were looking for real mouse in grandma's house ... Oh yea... Also it is good they put a way to replace that darn mouse on newer books because several kids became really attached to that thing. She would let them take home if they promisedto return him to his home in the book and they would remember ...How could they forget ? The book is great and can be a really fun favorite for families... But, be prepared to read it a lot because when it was at grandmas and she ask which book they'd like her to read to them.... With rare exception ... The response was a non-hesitant enthusiastic \\"The book about the mouse in the house....! Can I hold the mouse this time ?\\"."},{"Title":"There's a Mouse about the House","review":"We bought this book for my 4 year old daughter and it has been a huge hit.

It is quite tall so it does not fit on an average sized book shelf, but we love this one!"},{"Title":"There's a Mouse about the House","review":"This book comes with a cardboard mouse who slides through slots in the sturdy pages as he goes on his adventures. This is not a board book; the slots can tear if handled roughly but easily remedied with a little scotch tape. There is a template for a mouse, on the back cover of the book, so you can make another one if the original is lost. I made a spare for use while my daughter is younger and very rough with her books. The original started to peel a bit but that is easily fixed with a little glue. So although this is a fairly sturdy book it is not indestructible. My two year old loves this book."},{"Title":"There's a Mouse about the House","review":"My daughter could read this book over and over again.

I think it really helps with small motor skills. The only person who isn't fond of the book is my mother, who hates mice.

I'm surprised at how durable this book is. We've had it for several years, and despite all the use it's seen, it's still in great shape. The mouse is a separate piece that has its own clear holder on the front of the book. As you read the book, you slip the mouse through different slots as the mouse runs through the house looking for food and avoiding the cat. There is even a pattern on the back cover for making a new mouse in case the original mouse gets lost. The only suggestion I would make is to laminate the original mouse in some clear contact or something like that. I used some clear packing tape. Your kids will have a lot of fun with this book. It would also make a great gift for a preschool to reading-age child."},{"Title":"There's a Mouse about the House","review":"I'm told this book and its companion about the squirrel are very popular among Usborne Book buyers. I know my children, ages 3 and 1, love the book! They push the durable, laminated mouse with a yarn tail through the slot holes in each page, run it along the dotted trail, push it out the back cover, and return to the front for another go. My oldest quotes the words after only a few reads (though Mr. B. scares her--maybe the mouse running down his nightshirt is too intense for her). Want a plot summary? A mouse runs through the B. family house looking for some food. He avoids the cat, learns that other mice have already eaten certain items, is announced by the parrot, scares Mrs. B., narrowly avoids Mr. B and his broom, and finally escapes the cat again after a bite of cheese.

Our two children are now Seniors in college and HS...wonderful memories with this book."},{"Title":"Destroyers, Frigates and Corvettes (Expert Guide S.)","review":"This book is part of a series of compact reference books dedicated to weaponry, military uniforms, and ships and airplanes both military and civil, as well as motorcycles and (I think) cars. Most of the books have 300 entries, each of which features a colored drawing (for lack of a better term) of the object in question, a list of technical data, and an essay of about 160 words. Some of the descriptions of these books on Amazon call them the Amber Military Series, the Expert 300 Series, or the Little Expert Series, but the first of these appelations is misleading, and none of them appear on any of the books. Because the series has no name and a tangled publishing history, information about it is sparse and scattered. This is exasperated by the fact that none of the books make any mention (on one of the flaps, for instance) of the others. As someone who has several of the books, I want to bring together what information I have about them in what's ostensibly a review of one of them.Among the books in the series are \\"Aircraft of World War II\\" by Chris Chant; \\"Armored Fighting Vehicles\\" by Philip Trewhitt; \\"Battleships and Cruisers\\" by Steve Crawford; \\"Twentieth-Century Artillery\\" by Ian Hogg; \\"Attack and Interceptor Jets\\" and \\"Biplanes, Triplanes, and Seaplanes\\" by Michael Sharpe; \\"Military Vehicles,\\" \\"Twentieth-Century Small Arms,\\" and \\"20th Century Uniforms\\" by Chris McNab; and \\"Civil Aircraft,\\" \\"Destroyers, Frigates, and Corvettes,\\" \\"Liners, Tankers, and Merchant Ships,\\" and \\"Submarines of the World,\\" all by Robert Jackson. There's another book about motorcycles, and I seem to recall seeing one or two about cars. The provenience of the series is hard to decipher. Most or all of the books seem to have been created and first published by a British company called Amber, and all or most were later published by Barnes and Noble in the U.S.A. Some have also been published by companies called Friedman/Fairfax, Dempsey-Parr, and Grange, all of which are British, and Lewis International, which may or may not be American. The B&N; books are all hardbacks. Some of the others are trade paperbacks. I don't know if any were published in both forms. Besides these books there exist quite a few others of various shapes and sizes, by various publishers, that clearly draw on the same collection of entries. For instance, \\"The Encyclopedia of Ships,\\" published by B&N;, has twelve hundred entries with the same pictures as the series and shorter versions of the essays. It was published before the series, gives credit to several publishers, none of which are those mentioned above, and seems to have been derived from an encyclopedia of ships published in Italian. Two other companies have published encyclopedias of ships that use the same entries. There's also a book that combines \\"Military Vehicles\\" and \\"Armored Fighting Vehicles,\\" giving credit to the two writers, and another that seems to combine the two, but credits someone else as its author.The books in the series have many flaws. There are omissions, and some entries apear in books in which they don't belong. \\"Attack and Interceptor Jets,\\" for example, leaves out the Gloster Meteor while \\"Biplanes, Triplanes, and Seaplanes\\" includes the Fokker E.III, a land-based monoplane. These mistakes, I expect, are less the fault of the writers than of editors who didn't know or care about the subjects. More annoying are the copy editing errors. I blame these on the fact that at least some of the books were printed in Singapore and edited by people whose fluency in English is likely less than they imagine. The occassional sentence is missing its final words. Some of these are merged with a sentence missing its opening words to create one meaningless sentence. Now and then an entry ends in mid-sentence or without the final sentence that would have finished a thought.All this said, I more or less love these books. The pictures are simple but informative, and the essays pack quite a bit of information into very few words. I'll single out one book and mention that \\"Biplanes, Triplanes, and Seaplanes\\" has more information about warplanes in service between the world wars than I've ever come across before. The books are arranged alphabetically rather than chronologically or according to categories. For me, this means looking up entries without thumbing back and forth through the pages or continually referring to the index. The books are among my favorites for picking up when I go to bed but know I won't become sleepy for another ten or fifteen minutes. If a publisher does another printing of this series, I hope that it finds knowledgeable, interested editors who'll make the books as free of flaws as they should be.I've said my piece. I hope that other people add more information, reasonable guesses, and corrections of my errors to this page. \\"Destroyers, Frigates, and Corvettes,\\" by the way, is full of information. It's a good example of the series."},{"Title":"Destroyers, Frigates and Corvettes (Expert Guide S.)","review":"THE SMALL FORMAT AND TYPE SIZE MADE IT DIFFICULT TO READ.

As he lay dying, a hand reached up from within the ground and pulled Travis though the layers of the earth until he reached Hell. The devil using the name Navarro insists they must talk, but before they chat angels arrive freeing Travis.For the next half a century, Travis has been the SPIRIT OF INDEPENDENCE in God's Army. He serves as a modern day angel waiting to fight on the front lines when the Day of reckoning arrives. However his five decades of angelic living makes Travis question God's ruthlessness so he joins Navarro's minion as the cold war between Heaven and Hell has heated up to what seems like the final solution.Anyone who enjoys the \\"Left behind\\" novels will gain immense pleasure from SPIRIT OF INDEPENDENCE, the first tale of the \\"Spirit Chronicles\\" series. Kith Rommel visualizes images so that even an atheist will believe in Heaven and Hell. Travis is one heck of a lead protagonist, as he seems so human even in the afterlife that he is a sort of modern day doubting everyman. Keith Rommel displays his talent with this powerful inspirational fiction.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Spirit of Independence","review":"Good vs. Evil. Evil vs. Good. Sounds like the same thing, right? Well, not in Keith Rommel's impacting debut novel, Spirit of Independence. Rommel confidently keeps the tables turning in this fantasy-like thriller involving good spirits and bad spirits, but which is which is the persistent question throughout the story.The cast of characters is clever, the plot, intriguing. Travis Winter was a young soldier, murdered in 1944 during World II. Winter is now like an angel known as Spirit. While Navarro, who some might consider the root of all evil-the devil himself-calls on Spirit, pleading for Spirit to listen to his side of the story. And there is DemAngel, who was once a heavenly angel who preferred the demonic side of existence. And all of their paths cross when there is an attempted robbery. Spirit's daughter was the clerk. Spirit, using his power, steps in to save his daughter's life and chases after one of the fleeing thieves. When the theif vanishes through some type of mystical portal, Spirit follows and finds himself submerged in the conspiracy of an after-life time.Heaven and hell seem to always have been at opposite ends of the battlefield. Most have always assumed that Heaven was synonymous with righteousness. Is it possible that we have the story wrong? Backwards? Who has ever stopped to listen to what Navarro had to say on the matter?From beginning to end, Spirit of Independence held my interest. It is a well-written and fast-paced novel. It is written from many viewpoints, which was fascinating and unique. Imaginative scenes and creative settings are consistently woven into each of the chapters making for a fulfilling and satisfying read. I look forward to Rommel's next work in the series.--Phillip Tomasso III, author of Third Ring, Tenth House &amp; Mind Play"},{"Title":"Spirit of Independence","review":"The first and debut volume of the \\"Spirit Chronicles\\" series, Spirit Of Independence by Keith Rommel is a fascinating allegorical fantasy novel of Travis Winter, a man who falls in battle during World War II and then learns he has been chosen as a celestial knight in the ancient war between Heaven and Hell. Yet when the Devil himself makes a plea to Travis, begging only to be heard, Travis learns that there is much more to the ancient cosmic feud than what appears. Though he distrusts the Devil's plea, he must set out on a personal quest to learn more about what drives the afterlife into such violent conflict, and what can possibly be done about it, in this incredible, powerful story of questing for truth and redemption in worlds both within and beyond mortal reckoning. Spirit Of Independence is very highly recommended for fantasy buff reading lists and community library fantasy collections."},{"Title":"Spirit of Independence","review":"Travis Winter's human life ended abruptly, executed.

The world believe Navarro to be the Devil. Navarro showed Travis his side of the story. Thus began a Holy War. This time, Armageddon was real!**** I have never read a book like this one! Author Keith Rommel has shown a rare talent in his craft! There are several secondary characters and each get their turn. In a strange twist, the book is interactive with the reader! Travis, Navarro, and others actually speak to the reader. I admit that I found it to be a bit unsettling.A wonderfully unique type of book that will have readers looking over their shoulders and often losing themselves in thought! An extremely surprising ending that left me eager for the second book of the series!

I have worked with and counseled people who are not only grieving over the death of someone they love but some are grieving over losing a job or health. Ms Lipsy book covers everything about grief from a christian viewpoint. I can tell that she wrote it from her heart and that it must have been hard for her to do. I've never read a book that is so open and candid and so touching! Ms Lipsey said that A Journey Through Grief was her first book in the Christian Perspective series. I believe that so many people are going to find healing and comfort by reading her story. I can't wait until she comes out with another one."},{"Title":"A Christian's Perspective: Journey Through Grief","review":"A Christian's Perspective: A Journey Through Grief by Shelia E. Lipsey is a candid view and personal testimony of how devastating death can be. After losing her fianc? to a violent death, and then later experiencing the tragic terrorist act of 9/11 along with the rest of the nation, Ms. Lipsey was impelled to pen this inspirational and informative novella. Death can be frightening from many views-fear of not seeing loved ones again or perhaps dreading the journey of life without them. Ms. Lipsey's book is delicate but frank about the detrimental effects anxiety can cause to our well-being.Often there are times when death is sudden and unexpected. A Christian's Perspective: A Journey Through Grief encourages readers with topics such as Allow Yourself to Grieve, Cling to God, and Faith vs. Trust. Ms. Lipsey substantiates her analysis with scriptures which evoke readers' confidence in the ability to move on while journeying through grief.A Christian's Perspective: A Journey Through Grief reiterated some things I'd already learned, but had dismissed because of mourning. I was reminded that God had not left me, and that I'm not alone in my time of sorrow. Reading Ms. Lipsey's commanding story of her loss helped me to understand that I am not the only one who has experience the sudden death of a loved one. I felt alone-like I couldn't live without my beloved brother, and that it was unfair for him to die before me. A Christian's Perspective was affirmation that I could and should go on without feeling guilty.Congregations, schools, and even workplaces can benefit from A Christian's Perspective. I predict Oprah and bestsellers lists nationwide will soon get wind of this influential testimony.

Ann Sheramy, a very decent, well-meaning Southern belle, and Corrie May Upjohn, an intelligent young woman from the wrong side of the tracks, are thrown into war in Louisiana. Ann does not mean harm to anyone, however her entire way of life forces Corrie May to never be able to rise from her position in life. The author explains how the war changes this. Slavery forces those who think they are &quot;free&quot; to never be able to rise above the poverty level due to the fact that no one wants to pay for labor when the job can be done for free by a slave. Just like in Roman times, this means there is a large class of people with no work and no hope of anything better. They are expendable people. This means that instead of fighting for their own rights, these &quot;expendables&quot; fought for the rights of the plantation owners, and fought to keep themselves in a type of &quot;bondage&quot;. They had no &quot;rights&quot; to fight for. Read how the author explains this viewpoint. You will not be disappointed!

The author provides a very realistic portrayal of the upper class Larnes and Sheramys and the poor UpJohns, the latter having to struggle for work as the upper class had the slave labor to do most of the work for \\"free\\". Also, the turnaround of the cultures in the aftermath of the civil war, the Larnes and Sheramys having to struggle to survive and keep their plantations while Corrie May was able to catch a coattail of a carpet bagger and his money.I have to say that \\"A Reader\\" in September 2002 summed this book up better than I could. Well worth the time to find this out of print book, I was able to get a copy from my local library. Please note, that the comment by \\"A Reader\\" in 1999 who called it smutty must be thinking about another book. This was as chaste as a book could be, and would be a good choice for a younger reader."},{"Title":"The Handsome Road (Perma Books M-5067)","review":"Gwen Bristow is an amazing author.

It has a mining or petroleum economic emphasis, but the concepts are applicable to any field. It contains many examples and a lot of specific information about different types of analysis and when to use them. It focuses mainly on deterministic, individual project analysis, with little mention madeo fprobabilistic or portfolio analysis.It is a real practitioner's handbook."},{"Title":"Economic Evaluation and Investment Decision Methods (10th Edition)","review":"This book has been written and developed by a father/son team at the Colorado School of Mines, so there is definitely an emphasis on resources and the individual economics surrounding petroleum and mining. It has a solid foundation and draws from years of industry experience from the authors and a solid educational backing in mineral economics, engineering and business economics at the Colorado School of Mines. Even with the strong influence on resource economics, it is still useful for land development, real estate, property, tax expense and sheltering and for a better understanding of the economic system. As the book is already in its 10th edition, there are few textual errors and the book has been kept up to date. A great book for reality. Won't find much theory or added fluff. Practical."},{"Title":"Economic Evaluation and Investment Decision Methods (10th Edition)","review":"I was required to use the 13th edition for class in college. I bought the 10th edition.

Guide to Mixers, Signal Processors, Microphones, and More","review":"Whether you want to record in a studio or work with live sound, this book really delivers. It takes you from hooking up the equipment correctly, through a thorough discussion of mixing boards and microphones, to sound processing including compressors, gates, reverb, and delay (phaser/flanger/chorus). When I picked up the book, I'd been working with live sound for about a year and wanted to start using effects and make the mixing more effective. I really just wanted to know what tools were out there and how to use them. This book has that and so much more. Topics include acoustics, electronics (like high vs. low impedance and all of the different connectors out there), mixers, mics, and effects. The information is presented so that you can grab the basics of setting up or really dig in to how things work. The many tips and examples really drive the information home. I wish a few of the pros that I talked to had steered me to this book! DEFINITE 5 STARS!"},{"Title":"The S.M.A.R.T.

It explains the differeces of microphone types, explains how to set them up for the best recording, and even gives a list of microphones that have become renowned for quality and surability. It provides similar levles of information on mixing boards and various signal processors. An excellant reference book.Reading this book will take some effort since it is paxked with so much information. The included DVD provides a good sampling of sounds demonstrating small changes to setup and how it can effect your results.

I bought this as my first step towards considering adoption and after the first 10 pages or so, began scanning in attempt to find any information I would find useful.After wading through chapter upon chapter of misty-eyed recounting of the author's own experiences,(complete with a fully explained morality lesson on each...for those who didn't &quot;get it&quot; ) I finally located one solid page about what to expect from a home inspection and, further in, another about the pros and cons of international versus domestic adoption (with a thinly-veiled sales pitch for the services &quot;an agency like ours&quot; can provide) . That's it.If you are looking for material for a moral debate on adoption, this is your book; if you are looking for practical advice, go elsewhere!"},{"Title":"Adopting for Good: A Guide for People Considering Adoption","review":"For those who are interested in adoption as means of buiding a family, Jorie Kincaid has written a heartfelt and spiritually based guide to help decide if this path is right for you. I first read this book on the airplane in route of adopting our second child and even now after the adoption of our third find it a lovely reminder of how wonderful and transforming the choice of adoption can be. If the idea of adopting a child to parent and love is in your heart, &quot;Adopting for Good&quot; gives many examples of how and why this is a wonderful choice!"},{"Title":"Adopting for Good: A Guide for People Considering Adoption","review":"This easy-to-read book is a good first book for Christian couples considering adoption, especially if you don't quite know what direction to go. The stories are uplifting and humerous, and each chapter outlines a different aspect of adoption. Certainly not an end-all book, but an excellent place to start."},{"Title":"Adopting for Good: A Guide for People Considering Adoption","review":"I am an adoption attorney in Florida. This book is the single best resource for people considering adoption I have ever read. It gives good, common sense answers to nearly all of the questions people have when they first start to consider adopting. This book should be every adoptive parent's first stop for basic information. Ms. Kincaid has done a wonderful service for the adoption community."},{"Title":"Adopting for Good: A Guide for People Considering Adoption","review":"I think Jorie Kincaid did an outstanding job of letting you know just what was on her heart and just what kind of life these children have. Before I started reading this book, our desire to adopt was pure selfishness, we wanted a little girl. After I got done reading this book, our perspective changed. We wanted to help save a childs life. All of us in the U.S. have no idea what it is like to be without, but the children over in other countries do. We need to be a more thankful people because God has blessed us with so much. Next time you are contemplating over adopting, just think &quot;you are saving a childs life&quot;. God will surely bless you for your decision."},{"Title":"Adopting for Good: A Guide for People Considering Adoption","review":"If you are adopting domestically or internationally, you need to buy this book."},{"Title":"Adopting for Good: A Guide for People Considering Adoption","review":"I think that the author is very sincere and genuine, but unless you are a devout Christian, this book isn't for you.This book may be of interest to those wanting to hear about the biblical justifications and ramifications of adoption, but there was far too little practical advice for the subtitle to be &quot;A Guide for People Considering Adoption&quot;.What little advice there is is surrounded by scripture and &quot;lessons&quot; from the Bible. For example, the book advises you go to 2 Corintians 3:4-5 to learn about self-esteem in children: &quot;Such confidence is ours through Christ before God. Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God&quot;. What? Besides making very little sense, is this useful information about how to acquire or raise or child? Each chapter is preceded by a quote from the Bible.Overall, I would categorize this book as long on biblical rhetoric but short on logic. However, I did enjoy some of the anecdotes about the author's personal experiences with adoption."},{"Title":"Adopting for Good: A Guide for People Considering Adoption","review":"There are some tremendously good books on adoption out there. I have read maybe 15 of them in the course of my own adventure to adopt, and this one is not one I would recommend as anything substantive that would guide prospective parents to the joys and trials of adoptions or as a source of any practical how-to advice."},{"Title":"Adopting for Good: A Guide for People Considering Adoption","review":"I discovered a news article on a major Honduran newspaper, I think everybody should read...KIDNAPPERS CAME IN A BRIGADE FROM USAThe original Text in Spanish can be found in the Honduran newspaper La Prensa's website, just type the words LA PRENSA HONDURAS in Google or any other search engine, and then do a search in the newspaper's site, using the words ORPHANS OVERSEAS.

Some of the other books have you constantly flipping from back to front to find a value. The different types of antique handmade marbles are logically grouped for the most part and the machine made marbles are divided by manufacturer.There is even a section with examples from contemporary marble artists. My one complaint would be that there should be an index to make finding of the great many types of machine made marbles easier. Until something better comes along, I carry this with me to auctions, flea markets, antique shows or anywhere else I think there might be an opportunity to buy, sell or trade marbles."},{"Title":"Marbles: Identification and Price Guide","review":"I really have absolutely nothing against this wonderful work and in fact have nothing by praise. Of the many marble books out there, and there are many you will note, this one is at the top of the list for shear teaching power. It is also the one book (if you are silly enough to just carry one) that you should take with you to auctions and sales. I say this because of the ease of finding what you are looking for. At an auction or sale you simply do not have several hours to ponder and research...you need information and you need it fast. This work allows you to do that due to its wonderful organization.Now, if you are interested in marbles, old marbles, and who isn't, then this is what I would term as a keystone or base book. It gives you a wonderful starting point to further your research. All the various machine marbles are covered; or at least most of them and the author has given us a good start at understanding, identification and source of the old clay marbles. I will state at this time though, that if you are interested in specialty marbles, such as clay, then you probably will need supplemental books to go along with this work. No one book can cover ever aspect of this fascinating subject...it would be impossible.Also, let me warn you as to the pricing provided here. This is a good starting point and gives good information as to how to evaluate any given marble or category of marble, but DO NOT come under the impression that value is static. The cost or value of any given piece can vary greatly and change almost from day to day. Also geography has a lot to do with it. I know from personal experience that prices for any given item can swing tremendously from the East Coast to the Midwest. If you pay say one hundred dollars and think you are getting a bargain at the time, don't expect to triple your money in some other state or some other time. Like any antique or collectable, any given item is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it or is willing to part with it for.All in all though, this is one of the best and if you interests lie in this direction, then you certainly should have a copy of this one in your possession. I have been particularly impressed with the quality of photographs provided in this volume.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Marbles: Identification and Price Guide","review":"Great Marble book.

(Wonderful World of True Love)","review":"When I ordered this book I was looking for an answer to my six-year-old question &quot;where do babies come from?&quot; From the title I thought this book would help with the uncomfortable topic of sex at a six-year-old level. The only thing this book did was preach about morals and values which I mostly agree with but are not completely true to this day and age with combined families and single parent families being more common. Plus I know how to teach morals and values I wanted something to explain the new baby in my tummy to my daughter. This book did not do that at all."},{"Title":"Mommy, Daddy, Where Do Babies Come From? (Wonderful World of True Love)","review":"I recently purchased this book for my niece and was absolutely delighted by it. The main character, Jenny had parents who explained to her what must come before making babies: deep love and marital commitment.

It is a good stepping stone for talking to your child more in depth about sexuality. You must buy this book!"},{"Title":"Mommy, Daddy, Where Do Babies Come From?

I suggest buying his books if you want to learn about and/or enjoy cars."},{"Title":"Whisper My Name (Contemporary American Fiction)","review":"I read this book for a second time after Richard Russo's \\"Empire Falls\\" brought it to mind. Although it lacks the epic sweep of Russo's novel, \\"Whisper My Names\\" shares a similar setting (small town New England), eccentric and often comical characters, and a narrative informed by American realist traditions.Hebert perfectly conveys the small-town rivalries, petty grievances, and endearing foibles that afflict the fictional town of Darby, New Hampshire, where two of his previous novels were set. The source of the town's current problems is a proposed shopping mall that (to some) promises new jobs and revenue and (to others) threatens the area's rustic way of life. The novel's characters are motivated by greed, principles, politics, and pretensions--and some of them just don't care. All in all, Darby is a microcosm of American life.At the center of it all is Chance, a journalist covering the story while seeking the identity of his real father and pursuing Soapy, a young girl whose parentage is equally unclear. But the most memorable character is perhaps Ike Jordan, a churlish fraud and petty criminal from the wrong side of the tracks who has pretensions of becoming one of the town's leaders.It's a shame this book is out of print. I can only hope that the University Press of New England, which has reprinted Hebert's first two Darby novels, will see its way to adding this book to its list."},{"Title":"Analytical Dynamics","review":"This book differs from most graduate level texts on dynamics in that it clarifies concepts with plenty of methodically worked out examples. Also, this book is extremely useful for engineers as it balances advanced theories with applications. Author has put a lot of effort and thought in writing this book and deserves special thanks for contribution to education in the field of dynamics."},{"Title":"Analytical Dynamics","review":"This book is OK. For a graduate level text, I found that it lacked rigor and difficult solutions to example problems seemed \\"hand wavy\\". That is, I don't think that it is practical to memorize the general acceleration term for an object (rigid body or particle). Example problems (using Newton-Euler to derive equations of motion) are solved in the text by finding the translational acceleration, then the Coriolis acceleration, etc. and plugging them into the acceleration equation. In practice, if you can write the position vector of an object and you are careful about your inertial and non-inertial frames then calculus will give you the correct acceleration---every time.A strong point of the book is all the problems at the end of each chapter. If you can do them, you can do dynamics. But, Baruh's text before the problems might not prepare you to write the solutions."},{"Title":"Analytical Dynamics","review":"words really can not explain how to rank this book! ..but what I can say is...Haim Baruh; thank you sir for this gift to the world of dynamicsvery well: 1.

It was written in 1969, and gives a fairly accurate description of the marijuana high, and an honest discussion of the social mores about its use in the 60's, from a teenagers perspective. Robert Coles, the author, does not seem to have any political axes to grind; he merely presents the facts in a way that teenagers can understand. Coles was a psychiatrist, and seems to invite the reader to draw his or her own conclusions. If he is alive today, I wonder what he thinks of legalization and medical use."},{"Title":"Why Christians Get Sick","review":"Pastor George Malkmus is just as much of an activist for health and healing as Dr. Martin Luther King was for the causes of racial and social justice!This book is a GREAT read.

I can only imagine what it must be like for a kid to read it, or have it read to them. But the book helps with that. It really made me remember what it was like to be a child, and it elicited memories of how much I enjoyed other wonderful books, which were read to me when I was a youngster (and which I later read to myself). And not just vague memories; it brought back sights, and sounds, and smells, and sensations I might otherwise have never again recollected. Mmmmm... I would have loved this book then, and I love it today.One of the best things about this book is how it stimulates the imagination. The author, and the illustrator are obviously very imaginative, and through this book, they help readers to exercise their own mind\`s eye. The questions posed throughout the poem are ones which would seem absurd, and meaningless to an unimaginative person. Yet if you suspend disbelief, and allow your imagination to take you wherever it might, you will enjoy yourself greatly; I guarantee it. Even the most unimaginative \\"mature grownup\\" will remember what it was like to daydream in their youth, and to be wowed by things which they did not yet understand; to imaging what things are like, instead of knowing.This book is remarkable, and I highly recommend it for children of any age (including the grownups ;-)."},{"Title":"How Would It Feel?","review":"I bought a copy of this book to read to my daughter because of the beautiful poetry and wonderful illustrations and I just sent a copy to her cousin because it's a must have for every child's library."},{"Title":"How Would It Feel?","review":"HOW DOES IT FEEL by Mary Beth Goddard is an expression of wonder and delight intended for a lovingly anticipated child.

The power in playfully exercising their imagination is that it leads to connections to their own feelings, to other people's feelings and to discussion with the person sitting with them as they actively read together. What a joy to look in a child's eyes and see their mind at work, ticking away, one precious imaginative moment after another."},{"Title":"How Would It Feel?","review":"\\"How would it feelIf cold were a placeWhere ice had a voiceAnd snow had a face?\\" - From the bookHow Would It Feel? is a delightful story intended for children ages 4-6, although older children will likely derive great pleasure from this book. Author Mary Beth Goddard wrote this fantastical tale for her son, Alex, who has been challenged by ill health since his birth. Anna Mycek-Wodecki's whimsical watercolor illustrations-reminiscent of the art of Flavia Weedn-is a beautiful pairing for Goddard's gentle prose.Encouraging children to enter the realm of possibility, How Would It Feel? invites children to imagine the embrace of the moon and the kiss of the sun. What would it be like to swing from the arms of a shooting star, shake hands with lightning, or wake up inside of a flower? Goddard asks these playful questions while Mycek-Wodecki's breathtaking artwork accentuates a realm beyond limitationNot only is How Would It Feel? great for beginning readers and as a bedtime story, but also for young and old alike who are nourished by tales of wonder, nature, and whimsy."},{"Title":"How Would It Feel?","review":"Incredible illustrations and a poem that deliver inspiration to the imagination. Without boundaries, \\"How Would it Feel?\\" creates a place to wander, and always returns the reader home. Bravo to both author and illustrator."},{"Title":"How Would It Feel?","review":"I enjoyed this book and having a chance to talk with the artist at a book signing"},{"Title":"China","review":"Leach offers a tourist snapshot of \\"contemporary China\\". His impressions lack substance and originality, give very little pleasure to anyone familiar with the country, and are of little use to those who aren't.The title is most misleading, as this thin book mainly deals with Hong Kong and Taiwan rather than The People's Republic. Such a nave traveler might have failed to notice that Taiwan is a separate country and Hong Kong's national identity is the subject of a heated debate in the former British colony.Gutierrez & Portefaix have done a much better job, but a pocketbook can hardly do justice to their pictures.In my opinion, this is the literary equivalent of a Nissin Noodle Cup."},{"Title":"China","review":"Every so often a book comes along that is so bad, you wonder how it ever saw the light of day. How could serious people agree to publish this? (Especially in Hong Kong, where the publishers presumably know a bit about China.) Leach says he is giving a snapshot of contemporary China, arguing that brief, quick-fire observations can have their own quality. This may be so, but if you combine such observations with shoddy research and arbitrary references that have little to do with China, the result is a starry-eyed collection of short sentences that sound like they are written by a high school student who has decided he will be an artist.The book jars sharply with the experiences of those who have actually lived in China or have studied the country. Much of Leach's information is simply wrong; a couple of the observations he makes are almost interesting, but he doesn't develop them. From his writing, Leach sounds like someone who has a little bit of knowledge about a number of things, as well as a lot of energy -- I'm sure he would be more impressive in person than he is in print. In sum, the writing is extremely useful to see how one should not write.Some of the photos are okay, but are pretty typical of Western photography about China -- mostly construction scenes and some pictures of workers' faces."},{"Title":"China","review":"If you want to get in contact to one possible lived experience of China, try this book. It's worth reading. You'll realize there is no such a thing as \\"China\\". China is just a composed image - be it an exquisite and shiny - mosaic-like one. What the author has tried here is one possible not-full-of-commonplaces point of view on China. In fact, the book is about a fresh contact with several major cities, the avant-garde of the explosive development that characterizes China today. Under the keywords \\"fast forward\\", what you may experience are just snapshots - in words and pictures. Like if China was some kind of puzzle - which is actually bound to stay undone, because some dark pieces of its immensity will always be missing. I liked the book especially for that: it is \\"true\\", open and impressionistic, like it was declared to be. No more, no less."},{"Title":"China","review":"This fresh and unrehearsed little book on China is a collection of provocative vignettes: descriptive text juxtaposed with gritty images of contemporary China -- narrative, speculative and visual impressions that capture the aura of the place. It reads like the best kind of travel log or postcard collection where the reader gets both crisp, voyeuristic accounts and the author's unedited speculations about contemporary China. Beautiful passages in which, for instance, the author contrasts tearing down old walls of Beijing with less successful attempts to tear down persistent social structures, create a kind of corporeal theory based in the material world of China. A provocative question of whether the East has been a culture of conformity or variation arises from a narrative sketch of the Terra cotta Army. Speculations about the nature of the individual and the nature of the collective, posed through western impressions of rigid conformity are rethought, imploring the reader to reconsider such preconceptions. Leftover urban spaces, colonized temporarily then re-appropriated, suffuse the text like places from Calvino's Invisible Cities. A quick, breathless read full of whirling impressions whets the appetite and leaves the reader wanting more; it's like taking a tour from the shirt pocket of the author. One sees and feels the place, the people and the vast cultural divide. Not belabored, spoken from the gut, complimentary, open-minded and yet wielding an undeniable edge, each vignette captures a fleeting moment and reveals an ideological proposition by pulling aside the shroud of first impressions. A documentary in the true sense, this little book packs a powerful punch and asks the reader to join in speculating on China's future in the 21st century."},{"Title":"Tank Commander","review":"Ronald Welch may be categorised as a children's author, but don't underestimate him because of that. Tank Commander is a riveting read. It captures the utter horror of WWI, the horrendous casualties, and pig headed incompetence. At the same time it is exciting and moving. The title is a bit misleading, as the hero of the story spends of good deal of his time in the trenches as an infantry officer, and only latter recognises the importance of tanks, and transfers. I read and re-read this book as a child, (along with the author's other books) and every few years I still go back and read it, and enjoy it just as much... The new movie &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; trumpets itself as the first movie to really show the horrors of war, while still telling a great story - but this book beat it by a generation. Publishers - reprint any and all books by this author - PLEASE! Amazon.com - why haven't you listed all the books by Ronald Welch?"},{"Title":"Tank Commander","review":"This is one of the series of children's books written by Ronald Welch on the noble Carey family. They are all semi-historical fiction and based on historical events of British/English history. These books have been out of print and all very hard to find. As a whole, they are all very easy to read and wonderfully entertaining. They are each based on a war as they are historical military fiction, but even as children's books, Mr. Welch describes the terrible on conditions that the combatants faced and not just the heroics. Conditions such as poor food, poor hygiene, death, disease and the horror of war are all described. But to balance that are also heroism, friendship, gentleness and kindness. I only read one of them as a child, but through the wonders of the internet I was able to buy them all many years after they went out of print. My reviews on each book in the series is just a bare bones description on Amazon so that fans of the series are able to place them chronologically. I feel that all the books are uniformly excellent and I love them all so I won't gush how good they are each time.Tank Commander: John Carey. Despite the name of the book, John Carey is an infantry officer for 2/3 of the book from the innocent beginnings of WWI to the horror and death in the trenches until he gets involved in the formation of the tanks corps. He is then a tank commander with the novelty of exploring tank tactics. The last in chronology of the Careys. Illustrated by Victor Ambrus. My only used paperback and a rare personal copy (most are ex-libraries). Since I bought this book many hardbacks have come into the used market. The hardback is worth the price as the paperback is falling apart."},{"Title":"Tank Commander","review":"I agree with reviewer 1. I borrowed this book from Dhaka (Bangladesh) British Council when I was a high school student, and absolutely loved this book. It epitomizes the elegance of soldiering, hints at the humor of army-life, and depicts the mindlessness of war. I searched the book for a long time since, but could not find it.Finally, I found the book again when I relocated to Calgary some 12 years after reading it the first time. This time, the sense of adventure was less appealing and some of the heroics of LJ seemed downright ridiculous (taking up a whole company of Germans single-handedly with two guns blazing). But the details of early tamk-warfare was still interesting. Also, this being a later book of Welch, he somewhat muted his unreserved awe for the King and the Country, which made this book more palatable."},{"Title":"Parachutes and Kisses","review":"It is so rare to read follow-on novels that are in fact better than the original bestseller and continuing to improve. This one is perhaps even better - certainly more mature - than How to Save Your Life. I still think that for a hilarious and yet sad reflection of the pre-Aids 1970s and early 1980s, Jong is simply our best novelist. The psychology, the needs, the pain, and the ironies are so realistically and touchingly rendered that I found myself completely believing in the character. It is a first-rate effort and a pity that it is out of print.While this is yet another novel about divorce and the search for both perfect love and always-spectacular sex, the protagonist has grown into a kind of world weariness along with her concerns on how to bring up her daughter. While she is still willing to experiment with guacomole in the nether regions, it is about entering middle age, with the baggage that so many of us carry, and yet keeping one's idealism and hope alive. The passages on her ex-husband are divinely insightful and comic, from his inability to become independent of powerful parents (and how that hinders his own creative development); I still chuckle about her exmother-in-law - in her quip \\"at least she's s nice girl\\" - \\"demolishing\\" both her son's new girlfriend and his ex-wife in one sentence. (Isadora \\"marvelled\\" at her effiecincy.)Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Parachutes and Kisses","review":"\\"How to Save Your Own Life\\" closed with Isadora basking in the sunset of Malibu with her young prince happily ever after and on that note we open to the first sentence of Parachutes and Kisses only to discover paradise in Malibu has eluded our heroin. Isadora Wing has been through analysis, found writing success, a third marriage, and a child only to discover she married a child and then had one with him.Distraught and lost, Isadora journeys through another divorce, tax problems, single motherhood, and endless nannies looking for her demon lover. Parachutes and Kisses chronicles more exploration of self with regard to the love she feels for her third husband and the obvious pain of divorce, especially when there is a child involved.This is another great book from Erica Jong about finder yourself and the inner strength that knowing who you are and what you're capable of brings. If you read Erica Jongs' book: Seducing the Demon Writing for My Life, which is somewhat of a short memoir, you might recognize some of the characters in Parachutes and Kisses.A wonderful book!girldiver:)"},{"Title":"Parachutes and Kisses","review":"Nowadays they have treatment centers for people with this affliction, but way back when this book was published it was considered daring and exciting. The heroine never meets a man she doesn't want to trot off to bed with and describe the coupling in minute detail. After awhile, every time she met a man (no matter how unappetizing) I'd wince, thinking, \\"Oh here we go again\\" and brace myself. It seemed aimless and pointless and pathetic. At one point the heroine says (moaning yet again about some man who had done her wrong), that he had separated her from the two things that meant the most to her: her child and her writing. But in truth she doesn't seem to care much about either of them and treats them as peripherals in her life while she pursues her sweaty encounters with anyone with a Y chromosome.Join Charlie Sheen, Tiger Woods, and Rob Lowe...just don't write about it."},{"Title":"Parachutes and Kisses","review":"I loved Erica Jong and FOF, but was really disappointed with this book.She is still wondering why she hasn't found her \\"one true love.\\" Isadora has become sort of pathetic, really. She mistakes hedonism with happiness, like a 400-pound binge eater with heartburn hoping another bag of cookies will make them feel light and energetic again.But in this case she sleeps with anything in pants, drinks and uses drugs and wonders why her so-called \\"relationships\\" don't last. If she didn't seem to take herself so seriously I would think that was the lesson in the book."},{"Title":"Parachutes and Kisses","review":"This is Erica Jong at her best and worst. As I read it, I kept grabbing a pencil to fix obvious mistakes and editorial oversights, and in other places I despaired of ever fixing her klunky prose and clumsy expositions. For a poet, her prose is anything but lyrical.Yet Erica cannot be beat for her sense of felt life, for her honest reflection on and accurate depiction of the human condition. More pages in my copy of _Parachutes and Kisses_ are underlined and dogeared for future reference than in my copy of _To The Lighthouse_ - and I was reading Virginia Woolf for a literature class where analysis was expected! Erica shows parts of herself - and parts of myself - to me in ways that no one else comes close to, in spite of the fact that she is hiding behind her doppelganger, Isadora Wing.This subterfuge leads to some unavoidable confusion. Having read two books by Erica Jong about Isadora Wing (_Parachutes and Kisses_ and _Fear of Flying_) and one book ostensibly by Isadora Wing about a woman painter (_Any Woman's Blues_), it is hard to separate what Erica wrote from what Isadora is supposed to have written. At one point a character in _Parachutes_ accuses Isadora of having started \\"the whole thing\\" (the sexual revolution) with that chapter about the \\"Zipless ___.\\" But Erica wrote that chapter in a book about Isadora - only by stretching our interpretation of the paralelism of their lives and careers can we arrive at the inference that one of Isadora's early books contained the same chapter.Overall, this book met my litmus test for a good book. When it was finished and I put it on the shelf, carefully filed with the rest of my Erica Jong collection, I felt like I was saying \\"good bye\\" to a close friend: a friend with her own flaws and peccadilloes, but a friend I will treasure."},{"Title":"Parachutes and Kisses","review":"Love this book. Couldn't wait to turn the page to see what happens next. Weather real or imagined it is funny. Those where the good old days. Ms. Erica really knows how to put the pen to the paper to brighten up the that time in history. I have read all her the books and they get funnier as she matures."},{"Title":"Parachutes and Kisses","review":"this is the 3rd book in the series and i was a little dissapointed.

Show risk, opportunity, and support many arguments with mathematical models. Even though the authors have an outstanding academic record, the book is aktually fun reading (no boring academic book). References to other articles are extensive and the ALM Survival Toolkit in the Appendix is very well done.

Bravo!"},{"Title":"Insurance: From Underwriting to Derivatives: Asset Liability Management in Insurance Companies (Wiley Finance)","review":"This is probably the best book on insurance for explaining the poor state of some ALM techniques used in insurance today and why. The authors correctly identify many falacies that actuaries have relied on and how they differ from the more advanced finance that has developed in banking ALM and the capital markets generally.They do, however, get a bit distracted on a couple of topics, and bogged down in some formulas that I didn't think added much to the disccusion. In those moments, you know you're reading the work of university professors rather than practitioners.They could have gone further with their ALM thinking. They could have discussed how mergers between insurance and banking would in the future highlight the differences between the current approaches to ALM, and how financial conglomerates will eventually just relegate insurance to one of many liability businesses, apply option-adjusted transfer prices to insurance products, and take the interest rate risk into consolidated positions. It will not be any more complicated than that. They allude to banking ALM, but don't really drive home any of what I thought were the logical conclusions. They were focused on insurance as stand-alone companies and did not address insurance in the context of a financial conglomerate.Nonetheless, as stated, this is probably the best book on the market as an introduction to insurance ALM and helps dispell many myths and provides some useful history."},{"Title":"Cobweb castle","review":"Lord Stretherdale is an eccentric man, and he is also wealthy. Rather than make a will for his fortune, he allows his inheritance to go to his nephew, a shifty fellow with a bad reputation. When Stretherdale's solicitors try to present the new Lord with his title, they find him murdered in his uncle's castle. Now it is up to the police and the curious solicitors to piece together a tangled puzzle to solve not one, but two murders.The title of this book conjures thoughts of ghosts and family secrets in an old gothic castle, but this is simply a straight-forward crime mystery as is typical of Fletcher. He followed Arthur Conan Doyle's rules of mystery writing. The protagonist should never be the guilty party. Give enough clues to the reader so he can guess the solution with the characters. Never rely on the supernatural for a big finish.This is a good read that will maintain your interest throughout."},{"Title":"Literacy: An Introduction to the Ecology of Written Language","review":"The book Literacy: An introduction to the Ecology of written language was in the excellent conditions.

In fact, I think the reviews of the films of the past few years are generally excellent and inspired.

Now I always check this video guide before I settle in to my easy chair for 2 hours! The ratings seem to match with my personal ratings, so I trust this reviewer, but each person should check it for such a match if possible. One little complaint; this year it seems that, my copy at least, has faint printing and it is harder on the eyes than previous versions, and the font is not as easy to look at.

Let's face it. We often need quick and handy data (sort of like physicians and the P.D.R.), and no one manages to be faster and more to the point than Maltin. From there, if I choose, I can go to the Internet Movie Data Base or a review by Pauline Kael. Although I don't attach much importance to Maltin's star ratings, I'm surprised at how responsible they tend to be. He's as likely to heap deserved praise upon a neglected classic as to trash a latter-day pop phenomenon. But the ratings are not the reason to buy the book. Regard them as a bonus, frequently provoking disagreement with the author or a more careful look at one's own assumptions about a particular film."},{"Title":"Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie & Video Guide (Signet)","review":"If for some reason you don't want to easily access these reviews on IMDB and want the book version, be forewarned: Maltin's reviews are VERY guy-oriented.

On the contrary, &quot;Space Jam&quot; and &quot;Honey, I Blew Up the Kid&quot; got 3 stars each. This book is ludicrous!

Everytrhing rangin back from the classics such as &quot;The Wizard Of Oz&quot; (1939) through to the recent releases. This book is a good indicator of the quality of the movie. Bear in mind though, that just because LM rates a movie as a 2 1/2 or 3 star, doesn't necessarily mean the movie is not worth watching. Audit his rating with a movie that you are already familiar with, and then make your judgement.Another thing with technical reviews, just because the review isn't a four or five star rating, doesn't mean the movie doesn't have any additional entertainment value!A good buy - great indicator - a must have for anyone interested in movies, videos, DVD's, e.t.c....."},{"Title":"Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie & Video Guide (Signet)","review":"his ratings for Emir Kusturica's movies are completely out of the reality .."},{"Title":"Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie & Video Guide (Signet)","review":"Even though Maltin's convenient, comprehensive thumbnail reference work and guide should not be mistaken for critical analysis of the films it includes, the man's judgements frequently show unexpected integrity, refusing to be influenced by meaningless box figures or mindless consumer trends. Because he's aware of films made before 1980 and has a vision of what film can be in the hands of great artists, he understandably has little patience for the insulting product of the last 20 years. Maltin is an insightful and fastidious critic not because he hates film but because he's passionate about its potential for providing an authentic imitation and criticism of life.I had to &quot;teach&quot; Forrest Gump to a church study group. After choking on this new-age, baby-boomer, feel-good pop- culture pablum, I decided that Maltin's critiques weren't so useless after all. Moreover, the man passes one of the litmus tests separating genuine cinemaphiles from mere movie fans and video consumers--he understood the accomplishment and significance of Altman's &quot;Nashville.&quot;"},{"Title":"Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie & Video Guide (Signet)","review":"Leonard Maltin's movie guide is one heck of a book. I didn't think it was even imaginable that a book could be made on almost every movie ever made. I became sooooo interested in movies when my dad got this for Christmas. I looked at it, and I couldn't keep my hands off it! I saw all of my movies that I liked a whole lot that were all there. Heck, he even has the filmography for over 100 actors! Plus, he has a 100+ recommended films for families in the front! But unfourtnately...This book had its faults. For example, reviewing Roald Dahl's novels, \\"Willy Wonka And the Chocolate Factory\\" and \\"The Witches\\" get this... For the \\"Willy Wonka\\" review, they said[and I quote] \\"cruel edge taints film's enjoyment\\". For \\"Witches\\" they said \\"Roald Dahl's stories can be cruel, and this is no exception\\". But \\"Witches\\" got a better review than \\"Willy Wonka\\"! Also, not a single Godzilla film ever made got higher than a **1/2. Actually,for the 1998 \\"Godzilla\\" movie they said like 4 bad things about it but it got a **1/2 high for a Godzilla film! I couldn't believe it when they gave \\"Babe: Pig In The City\\" a **1/2! Also, for the review of \\"Showgirls\\" they said it had \\"howlingly hilarious dialogue\\". In a \\"Striptease\\" review, they said it had \\"a few unintended laughs\\". They're going against what they said before!But still, a wonderful and useful book."},{"Title":"Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie & Video Guide (Signet)","review":"Today's film critics get very confused with what it is they are really supposed to doing. Almost every critic has a fear of becoming hated by the media and the common reader because their oppinion may be considered &quot;incorrect&quot;. So in order to avoid this dilema, they will mark a movie the way everyone supposedly wants its so they don't become hated and considered &quot;unresoucrefull&quot;. Leonard Maltin, however, is a film critic who hasn't been corrupted by this biased system. He gives a short, simple and honest review, the way reviews should be done. He doesn't rate a movie on the basis of the public's oppinion...but his oppinion. He is one who isn't afraid to rate a movie differently to the general public, regardless of what critisim he may personally get. His sophisticated taste and knowledge in films is a gift that almost every other critic lacks, which makes him a reliable and informative source. Think what you want of his reviews. You will, of course, find some reviews that you may disagree with entirely. But before you go shouting your mouth off about how inadequate his reviews may be, just bear in mind that its simply someones oppinion. What makes yours so politically correct?

I wasn't happy, though, to see one of my favorites &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; recieve only 2, but fair is fair...another, and more important, minus is the fact that far too few foreign films (e.g. danish?) are listed. The Movie World isn't all american, Mr. Maltin! And how does he define the nationality? Take the film &quot;Reptilicus&quot;, shot in Denmark with a danish cast, speaking Danish. The only thing american about that movie is the director - and it's listed as 100% U.S.!Having said all this, the book does give you a solid introduction to the world of film-watching, and I'm sure the editors had good reasons for making the choices they did.

It is far from comprehensive, though --- woefully lacking in silents and foreign films. There are also a fair number of mistakes in it, and a few reviews that are downright imbecilic. That said, Maltin isn't a complete fool --- and once you get a feel for what he likes and dislikes, you can generally figure out from one of his reviews what you'll think of a film. Plus, there is some entertainment value to be had in some of the more ludicrous entries. I have a pretty exhaustive film library, but am happy to have this, simply as a matter of convenience. In this format, as far as I know, there simply isn't a better reference --- not to say that there couldn't be one sometime in the future.

I can still say that this book has been a substantial element in my development as a movie fan. And still, I think it does a good job at identifying the gems, both huge and obscure. But lately (say over the past five years), Maltin &amp; co. have begun to lose it; perhaps their plumb line is off. I dunno.I'm enough a fan of this book to know that I'm not merely being picky. It's not me that's changed; it's Maltin and his critics. I mean, Maltin has just got to know that THE FAMILY MAN (which gets a 3 1/2 star rating in the latest ed.--I nearly fainted) is not IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. In fact, it is an artistic disaster composed of cliches and rubbish, an interesting premise, and a (mostly) good cast. The wonderful CROUCHING TIGER gets 2 1/2 stars? Amazing! (I think he gives CHARLIE'S ANGELS the same rating, no?) REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is clearly a full star better than Maltin gives it; UNBREAKABLE is at least a 2 1/2 star movie; THE PATRIOT (another string of cliches) is overrated; SHREK is very close to a full four-star film (LM gives it three); and THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE is underrated too. EYS WIDE SHUT three stars? Zzzzz. Meanwhile, a fifty-year old ALL THE KING'S MEN, which is tremendously dated, unrealistic, and kind of boring, maintains a &quot;classic,&quot; 4-star rating. (Rethink, Leonard!) Oh man, I could go on. The guy is just starting to get them all wrong.Anyway, all in all, this book just sems to get a bit worse every year.

If you have any problems with any movie trust him, I do."},{"Title":"Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie & Video Guide (Signet)","review":"Maltin's approach and format are superior to any of the other movie guides I've encountered. His capsule reviews are a study in conciseness and they give you a very good idea whether you would want to see a particular film or not. Best of all, his reviews discuss the movies *without* running through the plot (whereas the overlong and rather poorly written reviews in Videohound's Guide almost inevitably revert to plot summarizing).Maltin's rating system (ranging from BOMB to four stars) manages somehow to surprise without being inconsistent. After a while you'll be able to determine in what ways your tastes diverge from the Maltin staff's and thereby know whether a two- or two-and-a-half star movie may be exactly what you're looking for. In general, the staff's taste is a tad mainstream & uninspired, but their ratings and evaluations are almost always well substantiated.(Incidentally, you will find yourself spending hour upon hour browsing through this book, looking up every movie you've ever seen in order to find out \\"how many stars Maltin gives it.\\" )Unfortunately, this 2001 paperback edition seems to have been rather hastily thrown together. The print on certain pages is so light & thin that it can really strain already overworked eyes. Also, the 2001 lacks an Index of Directors at the end (my 1999 had this right after the Index of Stars). Also, the list of \\"100+ Recommended Family Films\\" toward the front of the book is fairly unsurprising, unhelpful and uninteresting.So, for indexes of directors, actors, etc., your best bet by far is Videohound. (Videohound also has a list of suggested movies at the front that provides a good combination of the quirky and the classic.) For unbeatably useful and interesting reviews, however, get Maltin (preferably a slightly older edition if you're not overly concerned with movies made in the last couple years). On the other hand, get both Videohound *and* Maltin... and then you'll be set! The two sources complement each other remarkably well. It's a shame the merits of each can't be combined into a single volume."},{"Title":"Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie & Video Guide (Signet)","review":"Thanks to handy internet resources like the IMDB, Leonard Maltin's Movie Video Guide has become passe. IMDB and similar sites provide not only the cast credits for each film (AND the names of the characters they played), but also the names of the director, the screenwriter(s), the production crew... sometimes even the names of the stunt men involved! They also provide the film distributor's name, overseas running times, video availability info, and much more.What do you get in Maltin's book? Some of the actors (never all of them), no list of characters, the director's name but never the writer (unless it's someone famous like Neil Simon or David Mamet), no production credits to speak of, and outdated video info. (Example: Maltin lists &quot;Dirty Mary Crazy Larry&quot; as being on video. News alert, Leonard: &quot;Dirty Mary&quot; hasn't been on video for almost ten years and is so hard to find that most video stores don't even have it for rent anymore.)So what is Maltin's book good for? Well, if you're searching for a &quot;guide&quot; to which movies to rent, I humbly recommend you look elsewhere. Note that Maltin doesn't actually write all the reviews himself. Most are penned by his ghost writers (listed as &quot;contributing editors&quot;). As a result, the reviews are inconsistent and often ridiculous.I mean really... is there anyone out there besides Maltin's gang who thinks that &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; was better than &quot;The Matrix&quot;? Or that &quot;Ssssss&quot; was better than &quot;Alien&quot;? Similarly, Maltin's crew gives thumbs down (**1/2 rating or less) to &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, &quot;The Mask&quot;, and &quot;Liar Liar&quot; while heaping praise on such cinematic greats as &quot;Blacula&quot;, &quot;Quigley Down Under&quot;, &quot;A Man in Love&quot;, &quot;Count Yorga, Vampire&quot; and &quot;Back to the Future 3&quot;.Bottom line: Maltin's book is OK for referencing such topics as what year &quot;Old Yeller&quot; was released or who directed &quot;Muscle Beach Party&quot;. Aside from that, you're better off searching elsewhere."},{"Title":"Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie & Video Guide (Signet)","review":"Maltin seems to know what he's talking about most of the time, but misses the mark on many classics. First of all, look at his review on \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" - he gave it ** 1/2 and called it \\"hollow\\". Today, it ranks second on the IMDB movie list, right under \\"The Godfather\\". Thousands of movie goers can't be wrong. Then there's the length factor - he simply cannot stand to sit through any movie over two hours. And one thing that completely caught me off guard was his PERFECT (!) four star review for \\"The Cider House Rules\\". Yes, it's true. It was one of the longest, drawn out and boring films I've ever seen. I expected him to [put it down] , but he thinks it's brilliant. Another sign of him missing the mark. However, on the flipside, he does creit brilliance where it exists most of the time. Overall, give him some credit, but don't take his reviews as the ultimate word on the film. My advice? ROTTENTOMATOES.COM - it gives the averaged score for a film from some of the best critics."},{"Title":"Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie & Video Guide (Signet)","review":"With the burgeoning number of films now available for everyone's enjoyment, it's hard to know what's hot and what's not; what's good and what isn't; what's suitable for children, and what should remain &quot;adult only&quot; entertainment.That's why &quot;Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide 2001&quot; has become such an indispensable tool for me. I bought this book, along with several videos, late last year. I now have at my fingertips a concise, clearly written, judicious, and authoritative reference book that catalogs and provides essential information about films from every historical era.&quot;Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie and Video Guide&quot; is a wonderfully comprehensive reference book designed as much for occasional moviegoers as it is for hardened film addicts like myself. It's hard to believe that between the covers of this 3-inch thick paperback reside over 20,000 entries!!The book is very simply and effectively organized. All entries are listed in alphabetical order. Each of the book's entries contains the following information: the movie's title; the year it was released; whether it's black-and-white or color; the film's length (in minutes); the director and cast; a short, informative review of the film; the aspect ratio in which the film was shot (e.g., Widescreen, Panavision, CinemaScope; etc.); and the MPAA rating (G, PG-13, R, NC-17).What really makes this book an essential reference for movie lovers is the ratings and reviews included in each listing. Films are rated from BOMB to 4 stars, in half-star increments. Each review, usually only a few sentences long, shows excellent judgment in most cases. Each review is just enough of a &quot;teaser&quot; to give readers an idea of what they can expect from the movie from the standpoint of the film's plot, its quality, and its entertainment value.The ratings/reviews section form the core of &quot;Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie and Video Guide&quot; but there's a lot of additional useful information included in this volume. In it, you'll find: Maltin's list of &quot;100+ Recommended Family Films;&quot; a reasonably inclusive list of places from which you can rent or buy videos through the mail; a glossary of widescreen formats; and a cross-reference listing of every major star named in the book, along with the movies in which they appeared.&quot;Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie and Video Guide&quot; has consistently been a great help to me in selecting videos and DVDs to rent or buy. I suppose it's slightly less effective at assisting moviegoers in choosing which movie to see at the theater, mainly because modern-day theater &quot;runs&quot; are usually of such relatively short duration . Still, it's been much easier for me to select films on video and DVD according to my preferences. Using this book has helped me save a lot of money, because I now have a good idea of what I'm going to buy or rent long before I plunk my money down."},{"Title":"Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie & Video Guide (Signet)","review":"I've been buying each edition of this book since the 1979 edition and I never felt disappointed. I was surprised at the amount of bad reviews this book got, although some seemed to be written by some weird psychos who can't get over that Maltin's given their trashy horror film favorites a bad rating. Maltin says in his introduction that his rating is suppose to be taken as a guideline and not a gospel. Ofcourse it's all based on personal opinion of his crew but I've made the experience that I could mostly rely on that opinion. I also sometimes disagree with some ratings but what do you expect? Atleast I get all the information I need for a quick use. It doesn't tell me the name of the writer of each entry(like one reviewer complained), but if I really want to know the name of the &quot;Gopher&quot; of every production, I look in other resources because it would be impossible to cover everything in one paperback edition. It's not true that Maltin only gives the mainstream good ratings. It's the opposite, he also gives lesser known international films no one's ever heard of good ratings if they're good movies. A lot of people complain that he has given the usual clich&eacute; favorites like Bladerunner, Taxi Driver and so on bad ratings, but so what? Just because a lot of people liked it. I mean a lot of people had bad hair-cuts in the eighties... All in all, this book is a good resource for films and you can mostly rely on the information, a definate must for every film buff."},{"Title":"Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie & Video Guide (Signet)","review":"This is a book I would never purchase. If the editorial reviews by Maltin that are shown on this website are any indication of the book then I would say that Leonard Maltin is an over-rated windbag. It seems that any movie that is not &quot;Oscar material&quot; gets a proverbial thumbs down. Whatever happened to watching a fun movie for the sheer entertainment value. I pity him because it seems in the critic business that everyone is racing to put their seal of approval on the &quot;Oscar&quot; performances in order to prove their own legitimacy in the public eye. I think that he like other critics have become so involved with disecting a movie that they have forgotten how to just enjoy a movie for what it is. Yes, there are some stinker movies out there and Maltin should save his diatribe for them. Otherwise, Lighten up 'Francsis'!"},{"Title":"Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie & Video Guide (Signet)","review":"I have always relied on Leonard Maltin's Video Guide for older movies. It is REMARKABLY accurate and consistent in its ratings for films up through the '70s, both American and foreign. For newer films, he is dead-on most of the time. Actually, I find myself consulting both Maltin and Roger Ebert for more recent films. For example, I prefer Eyes Wide Shut and American Beauty (both new masterpieces) to The Cider House Rules.One suggestion: Amadeus is every classical musician's favorite film -- much better than Impromptu, Immortal Beloved, and all other preceding film-bios of classical composers. (The recent Topsy-Turvy is nearly as good.) It is profound and unforgettable, all the way up to Salieri's haunting closing line, and while taken from a stage play, does not resemble one in the least. The abundance of music is a PLUS, in my book, and the film captures time and place beautifully. To dismiss it as &quot;fatally overlong&quot; is ironic, and reminds me of the Emperor's admonishment to Mozart of &quot;too many notes -- just take out a few here and there,&quot; and Mozart's reply &quot;It is just as long as I require. Which few do you have in mind?&quot;Considering I have viewed this film over 10 times and never grow tired of it, I would suggest that Mr. Maltin kindly rethink his rating. Amadeus deserves 4 stars, but I would settle for 3 1/2. Also consider that every Kurosawa film ever made, however brilliant, is &quot;fatally overlong&quot; and slow as molasses besides. I have always found Throne of Blood and Seven Samurai overrated, yet greatly admire Stray Dog, Yojimbo, and Ran. I realize I'm in the minority concerning the former two, however, and am willing to learn more about them."},{"Title":"Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie & Video Guide (Signet)","review":"Of interest if you cannot find a movie description in your local TV or video guide.Some reviews are elucidating, but Maltin's apparent ghost writers are uneven and populist: f'r instance, of a maximum of 4 stars, 'Being There' nets a criminal 2 1/2, while trendy trash such as 'Pulp Fiction' gets 3 1/2. [I find Martin &amp; Porter's 'Video Movie Guide' more reliable, and has an exhaustive cast listing, although not in the review itself.] In books such as these, reviews actually written by the 'author' should be marked as such.4 stars out of 5 for usefulness, down one for annoyance factor: 3 / 5 for this book so far, but the paper and printing are shockingly cheap so down to 2 stars: I tried complaining to Signet books, but was unable to track their website.

One thing bad about it is that he detests an amazing amount of movies, and I can't think of too many movies that he actually likes. Also, compared to other critics, he has vague knowledge of the film rating system enforced by the MPAA. At the beginning of the book, where you see the key of the MPAA and star ratings, he thinks that films that are rated NC-17 mean that viewers under 17 should not view the film under any circumstances. Well, Maltin's wrong, the NC-17 rating means, \\"no one 17 and under admitted.\\" In other words, it is an \\"adults only\\" film. If you don't believe me, check a rating poster at your local theater...Leonard Maltin's only goal is to have the longest movie guide of any critic. I respect his opinions, but he just dislikes too many films.

The author presents one scenario after another of children in adult &quot;dress up&quot; trying on the roles of appropriate adult interaction in a surreal world of bad guys, bears, and top-hatted talking alligators, made even more interesting by the eccentric behaviors of the &quot;adults&quot; (walking backwards downtown, landing airplanes in parlors, and so forth).

As some of the other posts note, our little hero is threatened at gunpoint by Black Bart, but since the hero also buys a baby elephant on a street corner and hobnobs with royalty, children are able to recognize this as fiction--they only take with them the laughter and good instruction in proper manners.

My kids, ages 3 and 4, enjoy the book and request that it be read regularly. This book gives several scenarios and then asks what the polite response is in those situations. You turn the page, and it gives the answer: \\"May I be excused?\\", \\"I beg your pardon\\", etc.The scenarios are really silly, which is probably what my kids like. However, I have not seen them applying the responses to real life situations without my direction, and I think it is because the situations in the book are so humorously outrageous. I know, humor is great for kids and it does make the book enjoyable. It just makes the book hard to apply for the kids I think.It is a little more verbally graphic than what I care for, too, i.e. If someone asks you 'do you want me to shoot a hole in your head' what do you say?So, in summary, it's cute, but not great."},{"Title":"What Do You Say, Dear?","review":"This book as well as The Blueberry Pie Elf were the two books I remember from my first grade experience.

My sister-in-law was tickled pink as she, too, remembered this as a child. And, yes, those of you who cringe at anything approaching \\"violence\\" even in a comedic situation will not find this book acceptable, especially with the question about what to do if a cowboy asks you if you want to get shot in the head, but remember it was a different era when this was written. And since most of us do not have cowboys riding horses wildly down the street while swinging guns around, I think most children will take this in the light it was written. Besides, I didn't even remember this passage until I re-read the book. The one I remember most from my childhood is the one referring to somebody asking you over for a spaghetti dinner and what to say after every course has been spaghetti, and then they bring out spaghetti for dessert.

But that's not why I bought it! I actually purchased it for an 11th grade class I teach! It was just a fun way to introuduce a unit on answering questions.

The book's format is that on each page there's a humorously farfetched situation (like accidentally walking backward into a crocodile while walking down the street) and asks the reader what the proper etiquette would be in such a situation. The next page holds the answer. My kids (ages 6 and 4) laughed at the silly situations and the hysterical illustrations, but most of all they loved guessing the various answers to the central question, \\"What do you say, dear?\\""},{"Title":"What Do You Say, Dear?","review":"This book tries to teach manners (no idea if it's successful), and avoids being totally condescending and didactic by putting them all in the case of bizarre, childish make-believe scenarios. What do you say when you're walking backwards to town (because you like to do that) and bump into an alligator? What do you say when you're flying your plane and remember the Duchess asked you to drop in, so you do and break her roof?It's silliness incarnate, and you have to love it!There are three scenarios in particular that reviewers have commented on, so let's tackle those.The first is the \\"decapitation\\". In this case you're asked what you say when you're out picking flowers in front of your castle, a dragon appears and breathes smoke at you, and then a knight saves you by chopping off its head. (You say thank you.)There's no blood or anything gory shown, and as far as I'm concerned the princess being saved from the dragon by the knight is a common fairy tale set-up. I don't have a problem with this. There are more violent scenes in both classic and recent Disney animated films, nobody is claiming the dragon was talking and friendly and just violently attacked - I have no problem with this scene for this age group. Let's move on.The next one is where you are a cowboy. Suddenly the bad guy shows up and holds a gun to your head and asks \\"Would you like me to shoot a hole in your head?\\" (You say \\"no thank you\\", which strikes me as perfectly sensible.)This one is a bit trickier. I'll be honest and skip ahead a bit by saying I, personally have no problem with ANY of this book - but in this case I can really see why some people do. The scene is a bit explicit, and the Western is no longer a popular form of drama anyway so it's not like this situation is likely to have come up in your child's play.However, as nobody actually gets hurt, I'd say most kids won't even notice to be upset. There's more violent scenes on cartoons in the morning.And the last one that people have complained about is the one where you're a pirate and have captured a lady and tied her up. Every morning when you untie her to eat breakfast she says \\"Good morning, how are you?\\" and you are supposed to say the same.As far as this goes... meh. Clearly nobody is being particularly ill-treated.Now, overall, I don't mind any of these scenes because I know quite a few children. This sort of thing and more is exactly what they come up with when they're playing pretend. If you think children do not play-act violence you are very much mistaken. They do. They do it because it's exciting. They do it because it's fun to practice being really bad in a safe way that doesn't actually harm anyone, when in real life they work so hard to be GOOD. They do it because these things scare them and playing them makes them less scary. They do because the stories they are exposed to have violence there, explicit or implied, and they want to understand that. They do because you can't have a good story without a villain.And children have been doing this for as long as there have been children to play pretend at all. I do not believe that this is in any way linked to actual violence when these children grow up.Obviously if your child is bothered by this sort of pretend violence, don't read them this book. Or if you are. However, truthfully, I don't think it's that big a deal in this context."},{"Title":"What Do You Say, Dear?","review":"It's the art of understatement that a child learns from this book.

What have I done,\\" but \\"I'm sorry.\\" It's wonderful to see such self-assured young ladies and gentlemen, able to handle any situation with a polite phrase. They're civilized, courteous, confident, well dressed, poised, articulate, serious (but not too) and able to rise to any occasion. No wonder children love them. In fact, if a dinosaur were to begin nibbling at a tree in my front yard, I should hope to say not \\"Scat!

In each situation, the question comes up: &quot;What do you say, dear?&quot; By the answers that the little boy and girl give, they show that they know proper etiquette and good manners. In this interesting picture book with wonderful illustrations, each page shows the children in a different situation and different historical times. In the first question and answer set, the setting seems to be placed back in the early 1900's. The boy is wearing knickers and a long back overcoat. The car on the second page dates back to the 1920's with the long steering wheel and big thin tires. The next question-and-answer set makes a dramatic change because the boy and girl are now in the Medieval period of history when knights rode horses. In the third and fourth picture, the reader can see the girl as the typical damsel in distress and the little boy is dressed as a knight. He slays the evil dragon and saves the little girl. These are just two examples of how Foslin changes historical periods. I think that Foslin is trying to get the reader to think about, with the use of many different cultural and historical eras, is how good manners withstand time. He suggests that one should always be polite to others even if they are not polite to him/her. Good manners apply to every situation. In &quot;Children's Classic in the Electronic Medium,&quot; it talks about how books are now being read on electronic books. Electronic books bring advantages to children by allowing them to get more out of the readings from elaborate animation and special activities. Problems also arise from the &quot;difficulties of accessing the equipment required to read the book at home&quot; (193). This topic brings up a really important question: Would an electronic version make this book less valuable to children or more pleasurable to read? In the new generation of children, their whole lives are accommodated around films, television, and videos. This can cause a real problem with children reading the classic books in the original print. Many children find the readings long and difficult to understand. With the use of electronic books, children will be able to get more out of the book if there are pictures with animations, sounds, and activities in the readings. Many people hope the electronic books will do is to &quot;bridge the gap between print and other media, and thereby encourage reading in children who are reluctant&quot; (185). I see a great potential for using an electronic version for this classic 1958 picture book. I think that it would be able to enhance the story by using animation that would allow the child to interact in the book. The use of sound and visuals would bring a real excitement to the book and make it come alive. Special activities could also improve the child's understanding and give a big advantage over the original text. What Do You Say, Dear? still has a role for new generations of children. This book can show them good manners that are still vital in today's society."},{"Title":"What Do You Say, Dear?","review":"If you love children, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.

Otto Penzler is a collector of detective fiction and proprietor of a mystery bookshop. This book covers over 500 writers of detective and mystery fiction, the most complete reference work of its kind. There are alphabetical entries for writers and their more famous characters. Their novels, stories, and films are listed. Many of the authors were alive in 1976 so their listings were incomplete. [Many have heard of \\"Charlie Chan\\" but few of Earl Derr Biggers.]Mystery stories are similar to morality plays that show how justice triumphs over evil. Some might call them \\"escape novels\\" since the real world doesn't always work that way. Whether they sharpen the thinking process (\`Preface') they certainly tell about events you don't find in everyday life (\\"outside the conventions and humdrum routines of everyday life\\"). Their rise in the mid 19th century follows the rise of big cities, where the solution of crimes needed specialists. There is a wide range of settings as well as detectives. The \`Introduction' says their definition of mystery fiction is very broad. The authors admit their selection and length of articles is subjective, but follow practical considerations. Some of their entries are borderline, and so are their omissions. The \`Selective Bibliography' lists the books they consulted.Browsing this book you will find \\"The Crime Doctor\\", a series of films from the 1940s that are long forgotten (one of the earliest films that I remember seeing). Many of the films were never shown on TV in the 1950s and 1960s, or now. The author of the first mystery novel I ever read is here (Thomas W. Hanshew). Some of these books tell about people and places you will never meet (the oil millionaires of Raymond Chandler). Others provide more practical experience (\\"Perry Mason and the Case of the Singing Skirt\\"). Most murders in the real world involve sex or lust, money or greed, and occur at home. They rarely involve obscure poisons or clever methods of murder. Raymond Chandler explained this in his essay \\"The Simple Art of Murder\\".The detective murder mystery seems to have died out in the 1950s with the rise of government agent mysteries (James Bond and others). Popular tastes or corporate choice? Sergeant Joe Friday is not Philip Marlowe. There is a listing for Professor James Moriarity, the \\"Napoleon of Crime\\". Gerald Sparrow's \\"Vintage Victorian Murders\\" mentions the barrister Sayers who ran London crime for twenty years. Most fiction has to be based on reality to be believable, that is why \\"truth is stranger than fiction\\"."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Mystery and Detection","review":"Having read every other reference book on the subject, THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MYSTERY AND DETECTION, although first published over 35 years ago, remains the most useful and entertaining book about crime and mystery fiction. The pictures are good too."},{"Title":"Good Bugs for Your Garden","review":"if you enjoyed that film \\"microcosmos\\" that did for bugs what that new film about penguins did for those brave, hardy souls--and hey, why are both films made by french documentarians? do we lack the patience as americans to study nature in the raw for a solid year?--then this handy little tome will delight you. marvelously drawn creepy crawlers won't creep you out. the perfect mother's day gift for any \\"damsel\\" in distress who loves gardening."},{"Title":"Good Bugs for Your Garden","review":"Great intro to bugs, especially those that are great for the garden. It's amazing once you start looking at bugs and watching their behavior. This book gives a good place to start looking."},{"Title":"Good Bugs for Your Garden","review":"Though limited in scope, I found this book very informative: Just flipping through it answered a number of niggling questions I've had for years, such as &quot;what is a damsel-fly, anyhow?&quot; and &quot;what WAS that hideous THING???&quot;Just pulling it off the shelf, you might be tempted to dismiss this book as lightweight: The text scrawls across the page in a handwriting-like typeface, and doodle-sketches of bugs and flowers and scenery run scattershot throughout. The information seems solid, however, and there's a great deal of it.The bugs covered in this book range from prominent garden bugs, such as ladybugs and bumble bees, to almost undetectable critters, like the trichograma wasp. Overall, they have exactly two things in common: They are somehow beneficial to your yard, and they are prevalent enough that you _might_ have actually seen one!Entries include a common name, family, and order at the top of the page, a brief introductory comment on the bug or bug family, a color sketch of said bug --frequently with hapless victim-- preferred prey/means by which they do their thing, preferred habitat, and information about how to get said bug to take up permanent residence in your yard. The author often includes personal comments about the bug (why she likes it, curious behaviors, that sort of thing). Additional pictures range from &quot;actual size&quot; sketches to unabashed border doodles.For me, the most interesting thing about this book was the coverage it gave to (1) larval bugs (yech!) and (2) tips on attracting/maintaining a native population for your yard. I'm not into grubs, but it IS helpful to know which ones I shouldn't be killing. Also, I liked the fact that she did not limit herself to &quot;bugs:&quot; There's things like earthworms and spiders in here too.The book does have some shortcomings worth mentioning. First, the layout: You'll either love it or hate it. Think highschool biology notes by someone with artistic talent.Second, the index is, uh, considerably less than comprehensive. Prettymuch limited to common names. If you don't know the particular common name she's using, tough. So don't look for &quot;ladybug,&quot; 'cause it's only listed under &quot;ladybird beetle.&quot; Last, she generally doesn't mention anything about geographic distribution or preferred climate. (I guess you have to draw the line somewhere.)Bottom line: I think this is a GREAT introductory book on bugs! It's warm, enthusiastic and friendly, and it doesn't get bogged down trying to show you every little variety of bugs out there. It sticks to bugs you'll probably actually see, which makes it a great book for families with kids. (or unenthusiastic spouses: &quot;Look honey! I know it's got six legs and four eyes, but it eats SLUGS!&quot;) ...and personally, I thought the pictures were _great_ --they're half the reason I bought it."},{"Title":"Good Bugs for Your Garden","review":"As a beginning gardener, I found this book to be very concise and informative.

Being a Filipina-American myself, I could better understand where my parents came from in their way of thinking and understanding the world. My parents were born and raised in the Philippines and I was born and raised in the USA. We often clashed in our ways of thinking and beliefs because of the different environments we grew up in, and this book definitely helped me to understand why.The title itself, \\"The Philippines: A Singular and Plural Place\\"definitely describes how such diversity- the mountain people, the farm people, the city people, the elite, and the poor, the 1000+ dialects are actually one in the Philippines. The fact that there are 1000+ separate islands yet are all part of the Philppines physically brings together this same idea of many being one.This is a definite must read for anyone trying to understand the culture, people and politics of the Philippines."},{"Title":"The Philippines: A Singular And A Plural Place, Third Edition (Nations of the Modern World : Asia)","review":"This book is definitely a scholarly level book that is aimed toward those taking a somewhat intellectual look at the &quot;plight of the Filipino.&quot; The book is written very well, and seems to be fairly neutral when analysing the historical elements of how the Philippine Islands have progressed in the last couple centuries.The book is quite good and offers a lot of information to provide a fairly well-balanced view of the PI. Many would say it is too high-level, meaning, too general, but, for those that are wanting a peak into the political climate, as well as how the filipino has struggled to &quot;become,&quot; then this book is definitely for you.If you are looking for light reading, this book isn't for you. Anyone intersted in Filipino, Filipino tradition, marrying a Filipina/Filipino, this book will give you a much needed advantage to understanding the culture, by understanding its historical context and the struggle of becoming a unified nation.I highly recommend it.."},{"Title":"Infield hit","review":"This is an inspiring, action pack book. I loved it. I recommend this book to people who like base or to people who are thinking about trying out for baseball.This book is about a boy named Hal Stevens, the son of the famous third baseman, Ralph Stevens. His mom and father have broken up and Hal now lives with his mom. It all starts when Hal and his mom move. Hal is in a whole different place with a new home, and school. He has to make friends all over again. He makes some nice friends but meets some mean people, Blaine, Freddie, and Warner. While he is at school he introduces himself to his classroom, but doesn't say that he is the son of Ralph Stevens. It is springtime and baseball tryouts finally start. Hal walked into the locker room and saw his coach, Don Mavis, one of his dad's best friends. During practice, Hal was playing third base and so was Blaine. Blaine was much better than Hal because he had a better throwing arm to first base. He could send it like a rocket. But Hal couldn't. So coach decided to move Hal to second base because of his speed and it's a shorter throw to first base. However, the thing is, is that Warner plays second base and now he has to play right field. But Warner is still a very good power hitter. He's the best hitter on the team. And when Hal is up on base, he uses a big bat. He can barely swing with it. So coach gives him a smaller bat and shows him how to hit singles and bunts. Warner is so mad and calls Hal coach's pet, but Warner still plays on the team. The first game starts and their team wins 3-0. They keep winning a few more games until they come up against another undefeated team with five great power hitters. When they were getting ready to go on the bus to the baseball game, they find out that Warner wasn't there. That means that they have to play without him. During they game they were doing ok until they other team started hitting. When they game was over, they lost 5-2. They would have played better if Warner was there. That night, when Hal got home, Blaine and Freddie called him up. They told him they would pick him up in 15 minutes. When they picked up Hal, they decided to go out and eat pizza. When they got inside of the restaurant, they told Hal that Warner quit the team, and they need Hal to convince him to come back. Blaine and Freddie said they tried but it didn't work. Hal said he would think about it and tell them tomorrow. Blaine and Freddie agreed.Why did Warner quit the team. Does he know about Hal's famous dad ? Read the book to find out what happens next."},{"Title":"Infield hit","review":"This book is about a young boy named Hal Stevens. Hal tries to live up to his dad. Hal's dad is a superstar third baseman in the major leagues. His dads name is Ralph Stevens. Hal isnt as good as a player as his dad is but he still tries and tries to live up to his expectations. But Hal doesnt have his dads strength, build, and the powerhouse hit like his dad. Hal wanted to play third base like his dad but the coach wanted him at second base because he was to small to play third. I think Thomas J. Dygard does a great job describing the characters, describing the setting, and he also uses his wording great. I also think Dygard wrote this book as good as anyone could. I really liked this book. I think this book would help people because it helps them think that they dont need to do what other people expect them to do. I thought this was one of the best baseball books i have read so far and I think you should read this book and find out what happens to Hal in the story."},{"Title":"Infield hit","review":"Infield Hit is a great baseball book, a fiction story of a high school baseball player. Hal has had to move from school to school a lot. When he arrives at Cannon City High, he finds out that the coach played Major League Baseball with his father. Hal knows there is no way he can beat out Blaine at third base.I really enjoyed this book because it could be true with any famous baseball player's kids. I also like the way they work through their team's conflict. If you are in high school and love the sport of baseball, then this book is for you. This really is a magnificent book that I recommend to everyone."},{"Title":"Infield hit","review":"Infield Hit, by Thomas J. Dygard is a grand slam! Hal Stevens has always been in the shadow of his all-star third baseman father Ralph Stevens. Hal has always been a third baseman, but when he moves to a new town his new coach moves him second base because he lacks his father's strong throwing arm. When he discovers his new abilities at second base he finally feels that he has overcome his fathers shadow. This is a great story and I would recommend it to everyone who loves sports. The author Thomas J. Dygard did an excellent job with the play-by-play descriptions of the games."},{"Title":"Infield hit","review":"Infield Hit is a great book for any baseball lover. Hal Stevenson is always compared to his father and doesn't like it. His father is a famous All-American 3rd baseman, who's well built and can kill the ball. Hal is built like his mom, very skinny and not very muscular. Hal has always tried to fill his father's shoes but cant. His arm isn't as strong as his dads but he is still put at 3rd base and since his dad was a hard hitter he swings a heavy bat. He can't throw the ball like his dad and is lucky to hit the ball with his heavy bat. Everything changes when he goes to a new school. A former all-star short stop also friends with Hal's dad is the coach and has a new plan for Hal. After watching him swing and miss many times he gives Hal a lighter bat. Hal is very quick and starts as a lead off hitter. The coach then moves him to second base and Hal does excellent because of his great handwork and since the throw is shorter he can get the ball to first for an out. When everything seems to go well something goes wrong. The best hitter on the team got moved from second to right field and decides to quit because he's played second for two years straight. Hal is the only one that can get him back. Read this amazing book to find out what happens and find out some other important details."},{"Title":"Infield hit","review":"Recommendation- I would recommend the book Infield Hit because it proves to kids that in order to be successful, you don't have to follow your father's footsteps. \\"See it's not easy being Ralph Stevens's son.

It was a dumb way to begin.

I liked the way this book was written, it was very easy to read and it read fast. No one likes to read a book that seems like it takes forever to read because most people don't have the patience. This book was a very good book to read if you play baseball because it taught me some of the problems that might occur in a real life situation. Another reason to drop what you are doing and read this book is that it is a very understanding book, you can read at your pace and understand what you are reading, when you can understand a book it makes it more fun to read."},{"Title":"Dangerous Sanctuaries: Refugee Camps, Civil War, and the Dilemmas of Humanitarian Aid (Cornell Studies in Security Affairs)","review":"This book is amazing.

This is a fact of history, but it is not always a fact. In the case of the Palestinians, the Hutus in Congo and the Bosnians, the refugees were either already terrorists when they fled or became them once in the camps. Violence was the national anthem of the camps in the COngo, which were made up of people who just got done murdering 800,000 Tutsis, for the Palestiniasn refugeedom and the politics of that led to 50 years of terror that hasn't ended, with Afghans the same led to the Taliban and in Bosnia were it not for soem efforts to disarm them, the same would have happaned.The truth is refugee policy by the UN and the 'international community' has not only failed the refugees, but has also caused untold violence and perhaps contributed to racism, hatred, genocide and fascism and worse. But there have been refugee crises that were solved, peacefully. The German refugees in 1945 fleeing East Prussia didnt become terrorists despite the Nazi background of them, and the Sikh and Hindu refugees from Pakistan in 1948 didnt all become terrorists. Why? Because, as shown here, in some places there were succesful policies to disarm, prevent violence and obsorb refugees. This book dares to show that it is not poverty that makes refugees violent but political and organizational factors. This is true and it has been shown to be true.An important study.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"How Like a God","review":"I was filing a batch of Rex Stout books at the used bookstore where I work when I came across this one and decided to take it home. The book is really kind of an oddity. The characters, settings, and plot are basically forgettable--but the writing is marvelous. This book will never be important for its depiction of a historical period, or for its exploration of any human question. Yet at the same time, it rings true and there is not a single rushed, cliched, or poorly rendered sentence in the entire book.Perhaps the first thing anyone should know about it is that it's written in the second person (except for the italicized fragments inbetween chapters, which are in the third person.) The \\"you\\", however, is not \\"you\\" the reader, but the main character Bill Sydney's inner voice speaking to him. The novel takes place as a tortured, self-examinitory reminiscence of Bill's life as he mounts the stairs with a pistol to murder one of the people he is reminiscing about. As the blurb on my copy states, Bill is 41 and has been dominated by women his entire life. His existential dilemma is to overcome his subservience, his lack of substance as a man, and to learn to act. As can be expected, when he does finally stand up for himself the result is extremely violent.Thus, the narrative is stream-of-conscience, not chronological, almost Faulknerian, and hovers and shifts around four equal points of interest, i.e. the four most important women in Bill's life: his sister Jane, his unfaithful but beautiful wife Erma, the fish that got away Lucy, and the street person who becomes his obsession Millicent. Also, Bill becomes sexually entangled with his Sunday-school teacher early on at the age of 16 or 17 (don't remember), but Mrs. Davis only comes up once in the rest of the book.All four of these women are rendered surprisingly well given how internal the narrative is. Millicent probably stands out slightly more than the others. One of the problems, however, is that the women are not connected to each other. The plot develops as four separate blocks of Bill's experience that are never quite fused. There is also a tendency towards overt symbolism and infinite nuance. To give an example of the former, at one point in the novel Bill has a marble bust made of him, which is really just a slightly more original way of having a character look into a mirror. There are perhaps other things one could say about this book, but one gets the sense that Stout achieved what he wanted to achieve, and that any criticism amounts to asking a talented writer to make himself comprehensible to the average reader (which is the path Stout chose anyway)."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Bartending","review":"I was expecting this to cover the basics, and it did... condescendingly.

I was hoping to find some apostolic missions strategy in it, but disappointingly, the book is about establishing 21st century church government which would be led by newly instituted offices of modern day apostles and prophets. Rather than discussing apostolic missionaries, the book primarily deals with church politics. Aside from naming himself as an example of a modern apostle, his book makes you think about his proposition that the new apostles and prophets are the double-edged sword of the 21st century church hierarchy."},{"Title":"Apostles and Prophets: The Foundation of the Church","review":"Peter Wagner's \\"Apostles and Prophets: The Foundation of the Church\\" is 144 pages long and is divided into 8 chapters. Its main focus is on attempting to understand the proper role of those within the modern day church who function as apostles and prophets.There are several strengths. First, Dr. Wagner has been a keen observer, commentator, and participant in various shifts and streams in the church for over 50 years and, as such, is bringing to our attention the re-emergence of apostles and prophets in the church today. Second, it is written in a conversational easy-to-read style that will make it accessible to a wider audience. Third, he deals with a number of issues that are important to the topic, such as apostles and prophets in real life, the relationship between apostles and prophets, the needs of apostles, the role of apostles, the history of the re-emergence of this role, scriptural foundations, etc.A major drawback should be pointed out. There is still an institutional mindset in Wagner's understanding of the role of modern apostles. There is no discussion, as far as I can tell, of the need for a reformation of overall church structure back to a more biblical ecclesiology (i.e. the \\"house church network\\" model, Acts 2:41-47, 20:20, Rom 16:3-5, 1 Cor 16:19), so that the role of apostles and prophets can function properly in a healthy and biblical way. In other words, biblical apostles need a biblical church to function within. But, it appears that Wagner's idea is that the new apostles and prophets should just be grafted onto current institutional church systems. If that is done, it becomes easy then for otherwise genuine apostles simply to place themselves overtop of the modern day hierarchical pyramid structures of today's denominations and mission organizations. This can easily result in the abuse of power, unhealthy ambition, and rivalry.Overall, this is a useful read for anyone interested in the shifts that are taking place within the church, for better or for worse.RAD ZDERO, author of LETTERS TO THE HOUSE CHURCH MOVEMENT and THE GLOBAL HOUSE CHURCH MOVEMENT"},{"Title":"Apostles and Prophets: The Foundation of the Church","review":"This is a wonderful resource for anyone interested understanding the role of Apostle and Prophet. These special offices of the church have been ignored, abused and mostly mis-understood. This is a great book to start a thorough biblical and contemporary study on the topic. C. Peter Wagner's understanding of scripture, expert opinion of Church Growth and personal experience are great resources on this vital topic. It should not be viewed as exhaustive but as the thoughts and understanding of one of the best thinkers in the evangelical church world today"},{"Title":"Apostles and Prophets: The Foundation of the Church","review":"I read this book in one sitting. It is an easy read, well-written in general, but not completely convincing.The author is writing about the return of prophets and apostles to Christianity (in particular, Evangelical groups) and how the two should work together. He laces the book with examples from his own life, including how he personally made a bunch of money in the stockmarket by listening to a prophecy. This does not seem like a very spiritual use to put a God-given prophecy. This is much more like using a seer, which I thought the Bible frowned upon. This money wasn't even put to build a church or to help out a charity.He dances around the issues of how prophets, and even more so the new apostles, could use and abuse their authority in his New Apostolic Reformation. He somehow seems to think that it will eventually all work out. Clearly, he has not considered that this didn't work so well in the Catholic Church in regards to the abuses of various priests going back many years. He does speak to the creation of some loose means of checks and balances, but its not very clear how it would really work, or if it would really work at all.Its a good thing that Christianity is getting into a stronger connection to what some might call the \\"supernatural\\" and are becoming more accepting of those who can get messages directly from the Divine. I'm sure that the early Church had a lot more of this going for it. Yet, there are other aspects in this book that appear backward-looking in less than a good light. For one thing, the author states that being gay is sinful, that women should be obedient to their husbands (he believes that no longer having \\"obey\\" in marriage vows is a big part of why there is so much divorce today), and...well, that everyone in the world should end up Christian (the implication is, \\"or else\\"). Which is why they have been praying over different parts of the world for years now.Its rather like harnessing a beautiful horse to take an old cart for a spin around the block. Jesus was about LOVE. This author seems to be promoting the use of God-given powers and revelations in order to take over the world in the name of one faith...in a very UN-loving light. Jesus was not about power or money. The rise of prophets and apostles in His name could go very well or very badly, but it can only go badly if the people involved do not act out of respect and love for all. Not just a chosen few."},{"Title":"Apostles and Prophets: The Foundation of the Church","review":"I highly recommend this book as a primer for the next move of God.

I earned my degree in National Security Affairs. This is a cornerstone book - as it delves into many essential concepts in international relations theory. If you really want to understand key root theories in IR, read this book. Keohane does a great job introducing other influential theorists, as well. Other highly recommended authors/scholars/writers on the subject include Walt, Waltz, Krasner, Nye, Morgenthau, and Gilpin. I also, personally recommend papers and books by G. John Ikenberry."},{"Title":"Neorealism and Its Critics","review":"This book, which is a collaboration of many of the most prominent thinkers in IR theory, sets out the debate between proponents of Neo-Realism led by Kenneth Waltz, and its critics. It starts by setting out Waltz's reworking of classical realist thought and then proceeds through a number of arguments for and against his work and culminates in a review by Waltz. Most the chapters are drawn from other sources, such books and major political journals, however Waltz's rebuttal is new and adds a new defence against critics of neo-realism.As other reviewers of this book have alluded to, this is a difficult book to read for those without an understanding or background in the theories of IR and should in no way be considered an elementary reading. However, for more senior students and academics, this book presents a wonderful review of the arguments."},{"Title":"Neorealism and Its Critics","review":"This book is a compilation of articles written by six international relations theorists debating various aspects of Kenneth Waltz's neorealism. These authors, including two of neorealism's harshest critics, analyze the theory and Waltz responds with analysis reprinted from his prior work or written specifically for this book. I found this debate format to be effective and engaging. Many of the articles also provide valuable historical context essential to understanding neorealism's relevance in international relations theory. So, for example Robert Keohane explains neorealism's place in international relations theory by providing an historical account of realist approaches over the centuries while Robert Cox presents a very different explanation by providing a Marxist historical account. The thoughtful arguments from so many different respected academics combined with responses from the father of the theory, makes for a high quality discussion. Lastly, I only wrote a review because I thought it was a travesty that half the reviewers here are talking about how this is a boring read. Recognizing that political theory is usually more challenging than reading the funnies or waiting mindlessly for the Daily Show punchline, the writing quality here is generally high with unusual clarity on the key points that separate theorists. If you are looking to understand the fundamentals of current international relations theory and the debate that surrounds its future direction, this is a unique and invaluable book."},{"Title":"Neorealism and Its Critics","review":"I realize this is a text book analyzing authors of international relations theory, but I was nonetheless surprised at the level of snoozing and brow-furrowing it induced.

Lots of info about how they dressed and personal hygiene and some housework information. It is an easy read. The book is over 200 pages, but the margins are huge. I'm an old house fanatic and a history buff and this book didn't quite hit the spot for me, but it's in my personal library as a good reference work.However, if you can only buy one or two books about life 100 years ago, I'd recommend &quot;Never done&quot; by Susan Strasser and &quot;Victorian America&quot; by Thomas Schlereth.These books get to the nitty gritty and have more substance. Again, &quot;Light of the Home&quot; is not a bad book - I bought it, after all and I kept it! It's in my top five favorite books of women's life in history. I'd just put a couple books above it, in my personal preferences."},{"Title":"The Light of the Home: An Intimate View of the Lives of Women in Victorian America","review":"Green studied the domestic lives of women in Victorian America. Because they left few written records of their daily lives, Green used the memorabilia from the Margaret Woodbury Strong Museum in his investigation. This collection of clothing, cooking utensils, bicycles, furniture, and other impedimenta of daily living evidenced the routines of these women.The nature of this material limited his study to white, urban, middle-class women in the Northeast, who could afford these objects. Green accepts that limitation because he claims these women shaped popular domestic culture.The book is divided into chapters dealing with specific concerns of ordinary women, such as courtship and marriage, motherhood, housework, interior design, and leisure activities.The onset of puberty signaled the end of women's freedom as their clothing and hairstyles changed to reflect this more constricted existence. Corsets and hairpins restricted women's movement and represented their limited opportunities in society.Unmarried women's activities centered around choosing a husband. After flirting, dates, and engagement, couples married. Overnight, women were transformed from blushing virgins to world-wise matrons and were expected to act accordingly.Society deemed children the essential component to marriage. This strident advocacy contended with the dangers of pregnancy and childbirth in this era. Mothers then created a safe garden in which their children could grow.Women oversaw the home, which displayed their social position, and furnished them with handicrafts and artwork to create a miniature universe of culture, stability, and learning.Because society equated cleanliness with moral worth, women spent most of their time cleaning. Green detailed these daily chores, such as baking, washing, and sewing, and described the change which labor saving devices wrought.With the new free time, women pursued a variety of leisure activities, such as shopping, social calls, sports, and volunteer work.Women participated in religion more than men, and theology reflected their influence. Heaven came to resemble the Victorian home. Religion emphasized the feminine virtues of nurturing, generosity, passivity, and moral stewardship.Women's health revolved around their reproductive system. Physicians and reformers decried the corset, high heels, masturbation, and female orgasm as dangerous to reproduction. Physicians used neurasthenia, a vague non-disease, and prescribed tonics and placebos for other complaints.Green's study contained several problems. His material limited his investigation to white, middle class, urban women from the Northeast. These women represented a minority of the population in this period. He overlooked the relationship between wives and husbands. He made several broad assertions, such as that \\"the vast majority of middle class women accepted their position,\\" (p.57) without substantiating these allegations. His study suffered from these oversimplifications and from his narrow research material.If you are seeking information about women's material culture, then this is the book for you.

It has some good illustrations a well."},{"Title":"The Light of the Home: An Intimate View of the Lives of Women in Victorian America","review":"This book irritated me and it took a few days to figure out why. It's because an author who disrespects his subject is like a director who casts a film with dislikable leads: it's difficult for the audience to bear through to the end. Mr. Green's take on the lot of Victorian women is at all times disparaging and smacks of victimage. Women are cast as weak victims of their times. In truth, individuals living so many years ago did the best they could within the networks of their families and beliefs of their era. We in the present do the same, although we are blind to it. Never a word about that from Mr. Green. Rather than consider Victorian American culture as a whole, Mr. Green limits himself to \\"WASPs\\" (he uses the term more than once) and their popular help books and magazines, to pass overt or implicit judgments on how exclusionary and eccentric that stratum of the population was. Goings-on of immigrants pouring into the country are only mentioned to point out how much \\"WASPs\\" feared them. Yet recent arrivals from Europe were also convention-bound from the old country and as eccentric as anyone else. In addition, some things that Victorian self-help books were adamant about--women breast feeding rather than using bottles and formulas, for example--are indorsed today as especially healthful for children both physically and emotionally. Victorians were often right for questionable reasons, and when they insisted that breast feed was best they were probably correct. But again, never a word of this from the author. He implies, in my reading, that this insistence on breast-feeding was just another tactic to keep women house-bound. Extend such thinking to other areas and arrive at my overall objection to this book. The author has prejudices that no doubt sat well in a university's atmosphere in the 1980s but get in the way for popular readers. The many pictures in my soft cover version were not reproduced well, either, for which Mr. Green is blameless. I'd give this text a \\"C.\\""},{"Title":"The Light of the Home: An Intimate View of the Lives of Women in Victorian America","review":"This is a truly extraordinary book.

Although his time period is confined to the years 1870-1910, it's worth noting that \\"Victorian\\" America actually began at the same time Victorian England did, in 1837, and that most cultural assumptions of the former period carried over from the latter. At the same time, Green has purposely focused his light on the Eastern and Middle-Western middle class, quite ignoring the pioneer, the poor, the naughty, and the iconoclastic (of whom there were a goodly few). This much said, his book is full of useful data much of which can be carried over to other segments of female reality of the day. Organized into broad chapter categories including courtship and marriage, motherhood, housework, home decoration, health, leisure, and \\"religion, death, and mourning,\\" it provides a good basic picture of what 19th-Century women mostly aspired to, as well as the justifications given for society's limitations upon them. There's a good index, though a reading list might have been helpful too."},{"Title":"The Light of the Home: An Intimate View of the Lives of Women in Victorian America","review":"As many reviewers have pointed out this book focuses on 1870 to 1910, in the region of New England, on female WASPs. That may be a fault, but Harvey Green does point it out and then proceeds to examine, explore, reveal the lives of woman in this Victorian America. Green states that only the urban centers of the northeast were civilized. I guess the rest was uncivilized frontier.Mr. Green uses a limited amount of first person sources. Most of the book relies on ads, health guides, magazines, artwork, and even some photos. Some of his statements are generalizations that would easily collapse under any attack, but please remember he is not talking about Virginia, Texas or Alaska. He is dealing with a small slice of the United States populace during a 40 year period and many of his views may be correct, to a point.I would look at it as a fun and not-very-serious study on women's history of the period and leave it at that."},{"Title":"The Light of the Home: An Intimate View of the Lives of Women in Victorian America","review":"What a wonderful insight into the Victorian Life Style!

This doesn't mean Christian writers such as Eugene Peterson and C.S.

The book helped inform us of the day-to-day activities of Jesus, and helped us sense his heart as he connected with the people around him. Some of the characters are not actually mentioned in the Bible, but Margaret brought them into the story to make it more real. We better understood the attitudes of various types of people who had contact with Jesus or heard him. We felt that we were over-hearing his close conversations with his heavenly father, and even comments from the unseen angels who were present during all the events of Jesus' life. We would recommend this book for people who have never really read the Bible or for those who want a comprehensive understanding of who Jesus is and what he did while he walked in sandals on the earth."},{"Title":"God In Sandals","review":"Da Vinci Code? Margaret Montreuil's Jesus is interesting enough without shocking revelations.Like Anita Diamant's The Red Tent, this book takes a fresh, original approach, focusing not just on Jesus' ministry and miracles, but on his drama as a human being with his own disappointments and fears, his own joys and sorrows, and his awesome destiny that he surrenders to: to suffer, be crucified,, and be reborn to save mankind from sin.Hollywood secularists, repent: The Jewish religious leaders, channeling Jim Bakker, as well as the Reverend Fred Phelps who erected a monument against murdered Matthew Shepard (who Montreuil's loving, fiery Jesus would not have damned) in Wyoming, condemned Jesus because of their own arrogance. Oh wait, that sounds more like the Hollywood secularists trying to block Mel Gibson's \\"Passion.\\" In the Jewish leaders' denial of Jesus we see grim specters of the ACLU and the liberal left banning Nativity scenes, prayer at public events, and at high school football games.

This book was written in 1833 by Blessed John Henry Newman and is a beautiful current edition of the work. By having these reprints available to us we are able to read such important source documents. This book was pivotal in the conversion of Newman to Roman Catholicism. The book gives a very detailed (510 pages) study of how Arianism developed, how it spread, and how it was finally curtailed.Newman helps us to understand the world that existed and the various pressures on this world. Christianity was trying to develop in a pagan philosophical world. In order to grow and be accepted the Christian religion needed to be explained in terms understandable in a Hellenistic world. Newman does an outstanding job of explaining the total milieu Christianity developed in.Arianism developed in this changing world and Newman helps us to understand why Arianism had the appeal that it did and how it became so pervasive in the ancient world. Newman also guides us through the different Church Councils that developed the doctrine to counter Arianism.The book is very readable and Newman is a masterful writer who keeps the readers interest. If you wanted to gather a much better understanding how Church doctrine developed this is an excellent book to read."},{"Title":"The Arians of the fourth century","review":"This is a great book if you want to understand how early Church doctrine was developed.

If you are looking for a rock-business guide I suggest: Managing Your Band by Dr. Stephan Marcone, All You Need to Know About the Music Business by Donald S.

Oddly enough, it appears that nobody involved in the printing of this book even bothered to read it.

It is an unassuming, straight forward walk through the elements of computational number theory. The author claims all that is required is high school math; however, once cracking the book open the reader finds that the material is more directed at the advanced undergraduate, or even the graduate math student, computer scientist, or to he/she who wants a singular experience in good mathematics. For example, there are side bars that touch on some of the very brightest of the number theory elite; providing much needed insight as to their motivations and pursuits of attack. Many a complicated concept is rendered harmless and fashioned readily available for the learned reader. It is the kind of book that you can not put down. I passed it around to a few of my colleaques; the book quickly became a pleasent read for them followed up by a request to forward the ISBN number to their email accounts. The author knows the crafts of both writing well and displaying the beauty of number theory. Lastly, the technical content is not watered down, the author maintains academic discipline while making anecdotal information available via side-bars. Otherwise, the inspired reader would have to track down a text on the history of mathematics to sort out the 'story' behind the insights. Instead it is &quot;all&quot; there for you to consider or mark for a later read."},{"Title":"Lavochkin's Piston-Engined Fighters - Red Star Vol. 10","review":"With about 25,000 Lavochkin piston engined fighters built both during and after World War II, these aircraft rank as one of the key Soviet combat aircraft types. This book is in roughly chronological format, beginning with the development of the LaGG-3 before turning to the La-5 and La-7 and post-war La-9 and La-11. Within each section the versions with different power plants and armament are detailed, and brief operational histories are provided. Many of the photographs are previously unpublished. The book concludes with three-view line drawings of each fighter type, statistical performance tables, and paintings showing in vivid color different sample aircraft. Unlike other books on this topic, much of the information is new given recently opened Russian/Soviet archival material. In short, this is a good book to have on an important Soviet fighter series."},{"Title":"Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Eman Poet Lib #17 (Everyman Poetry)","review":"I cannot think of a better way to introduce the poetry of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow than this small volume. The selection is excellent and of interest you the young reader. The commentary is quite relevant as are the pictures which accompany it. I find that often now, our young people go all the way through the early grades in school and many of them have never heard of Longfellow much less read his poetry. This was the sort of stuff my generation and the generation before it grew up on and cut our teeth on. I do not feel I am any worse for the wear. I am fearful that we are bringing up an entire generation (rightfully or wrong, although I feel it is the later) of young folks who will have no appreciation to this great art form and will miss a lot. This book helps. This entire series helps, as a matter of fact and I certainly recommend you add this one and the others to your library. Actually, it is rather fun reading these with the young folk and then talking about them. Not only do you get to enjoy the work your self and perhaps bring back some great memories, but you have the opportunity to interact with your child or student. It is actually rather surprising what some of the kids come up with. I read these to my grandchildren and to the kids in my classes at school. For the most part, when I really get to discussing the work with them, they enjoy it. NOTE: After reading the reviews above from School Library Journal and Kirkus review, I am not sure if they or I read the same work. I would personally recommend you rather ignore some of the negative comments. I will say though, that this is one you might want to read with your child or children though, as there are some rather archaic terms used, delightful, but archaic. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy","review":"First of all, one has a very difficult problem in defining exactly what this compendium is. Is it a book, a poem, a history, an epic? Well, I think it is all of those and many more. The Anatomy of Melancholy is, without a doubt, the best book ever written, bar none.It was compliled from all the books of the 17th century and is not really about melancholy, per se. It is, rather, Robert Burton's view of mankind and mankind's condition. All mankind. And all conditions. It is about melancholia, sure, but it is about everything else as well. Melancholia was just Burton's excuse to write about everything under the sun in a strikingly original way and then have the nerve to remind us that there is nothing new under the sun. This is a book filled with both endless quotes and endless quotable material and, to the surprise of many, it is a comic masterpiece. Perhaps &quot;the&quot; comic masterpiece. Burton chose to publish this book as having been written by &quot;Democritus Junior,&quot; and if that doesn't give you a hint regarding the humor that follows, then not much will.If you like good literature, you'll love this book. If you like psychology, you'll love this book. If you want to seem pretentious, you need this book. Mostly, however, this is a book for people who love words. Burton may have seemed like a raving madman to some, but he was a man obsessed with a love for the English language...and it shows.The Anatomy of Melancholy wasn't meant to be read from the first page to the last; I have never met anyone who did that and one would have to be more than a little mad to even try. Just pick up the book. Open it to any page. You may find lists, digressions, bits of 17th century prose, quotes, much Latin. Whatever you find, it is sure to please if you only give it half a chance.The Anatomy of Melancholy is definitely &quot;the&quot; desert island book. The only problem with taking this wonderful book to a desert island with you (or anywhere else, for that matter), is its size. If you have the one-volume edition, as I do, it can be terribly unwieldy. I once tried reading it on a trans-Atlantic flight and had difficulty keeping my grasp...physically. I highly recommend the three-volume set, if you can find it. If not, make do with the one-volume. Just don't go without. That would be a terrible mistake.Be warned: this dense and brilliant book is extremely addicting. Once you start leafing through the pages and writing down your favorite passages, you'll find you never want to be without the book. And, as you'll come to see, that won't be such a bad thing at all."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy","review":"Of all the editions of THE ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY that have ever been published, this may be the best for the general reader. The NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS CLASSIC edition wisely reprints the great 1932 Everyman's Library edition, with its wonderful introduction by the noted bookman Holbrook Jackson. (Readers are advised to skim or skip the rather pretentious new introduction by William H. Gass.)Unlike the &quot;all-English&quot; edition referenced..., the Everyman/NYRBClassic edition gives the Latin tags as Burton scattered them through his work and translates each and every one, either in brackets immediately afterward, or (sometimes) in an endnote to each of the three volumes (now bound as one). I've tried to read the &quot;all-English&quot; edition, and it's disappointing, because it turns out that Burton wanted readers to read the Latin tags whether they could understand them or not. He included their syllables in the rhythm of his prose, so as you read this edition, you can almost hear him quote, then translate, then continue onward.No booklover should skip this one, and this is the edition to have."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy","review":"Don't be misled by the title of this book, nor by what others may have told you about it. In the first place, it isn't so much a book about 'Melancholy' (or abnormal psychology, or depression, or whatever) as a book about Burton himself and, ultimately, about humankind. Secondly, it isn't so much a book for students of the history of English prose, as one for lovers of language who joy in the strong taste of English when it was at its most masculine and vigorous. Finally, it isn't so much a book for those interested in the renaissance, as for those interested in life.Burton is not a writer for fops and milquetoasts. He was a crusty old devil who used to go down to the river to listen to the bargemen cursing so that he could keep in touch with the true tongue of his race. Sometimes I think he might have been better off as the swashbuckling Captain of a pirate ship. But somehow he ended up as a scholar, and instead of watching the ocean satisfyingly swallowing up his victims, he himself became an ocean of learning swallowing up whole libraries. His book, in consequence, although it may have begun as a mere 'medical treatise,' soon exploded beyond its bounds to become, in the words of one of his editors, &quot;a grand literary entertainment, as well as a rich mine of miscellaneous learning.&quot;Of his own book he has this to say : &quot;... a rhapsody of rags gathered together from several dung-hills, excrements of authors, toys and fopperies confusedly tumbled out, without art, invention, judgement, wit, learning, harsh, raw, rude, phantastical, absurd, insolent, indiscreet, ill-composed, indigested, vain, scurrile, idle, dull, and dry; I confess all...&quot; But don't believe him, he's in one of his irascible moods and exaggerating. In fact it's a marvelous book.Here's a bit more of the crusty Burton I love; it's on his fellow scholars : &quot;Heretofore learning was graced by judicious scholars, but now noble sciences are vilified by base and illiterate scribblers.&quot;And here is Burton warming to the subject of contemporary theologians : &quot;Theologasters, if they can but pay ... proceed to the very highest degrees. Hence it comes that such a pack of vile buffoons, ignoramuses wandering in the twilight of learning, ghosts of clergymen, itinerant quacks, dolts, clods, asses, mere cattle, intrude with unwashed feet upon the sacred precincts of Theology, bringing with them nothing save brazen impudence, and some hackneyed quillets and scholastic trifles not good enough for a crowd at a street corner.&quot;Finally a passage I can't resist quoting which shows something of Burton's prose at its best, though I leave you to guess the subject: &quot;... with this tempest of contention the serenity of charity is overclouded, and there be too many spirits conjured up already in this kind in all sciences, and more than we can tell how to lay, which do so furiously rage, and keep such a racket, that as Fabius said, &quot;It had been much better for some of them to have been born dumb, and altogether illiterate, than so far to dote to their own destruction.&quot;To fully appreciate these quotations you would have to see them in context, and I'm conscious of having touched on only one of his many moods and aspects. But a taste for Burton isn't difficult to acquire. He's a mine of curious learning. When in full stride he can be very funny, and it's easy to share his feelings as he often seems to be describing, not so much his own world as today's.But he does demand stamina. His prose overwhelms and washes over us like a huge tsunami, and for that reason he's probably best taken in small doses. If you are unfamiliar with his work and were to approach him with that in mind, you might find that (as is the case with Montaigne, a very different writer) you had discovered not so much a book as a companion for life."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy","review":"The Anatomy of Melancholy may be a worthwhile read.

Buy the book from another publisher."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy","review":"I am reviewing the NYRB's edition of Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy.It's good to have Burton's Anatomy back in print in an affordable edition. NYRB has reprinted the three volume Everyman's Library edition in a rather thick paperback. This is not the first time the three volume Everyman's Library edition has been reprinted in one volume. Everyman's Library had a one volume edition in the 1960's and Vintage had an edition in the 1970's, but these have been out of print for many years. Except for some minor changes such as a new introduction by William H. Gass, and the removal of the out-of-date select bibliography the NYRB edition is identical to the earlier reprints.There are disadvantages to this reprint. Perhaps the biggest is that this reprint does not take advantage or even acknowledge the 70 or so years of scholarship that has come and gone since it was published in 1932. In the 1990's Oxford University Press issued a multi-volume scholarly edition of the Anatomy but the price is prohibative for most readers. You should know that NYRB edition is still good as a reader's copy, but it is not a scholarly edition.Another problem is the editorial decision that Holbrook Jackson made to clear away Burton's anotations that were originally printed on the page, and moved them to the end of each partition. Instead of looking on the page for Burton's citations the reader is flipping back and forth to track them down. Burton sometimes has a great deal of fun in his marginal glosses, and you will miss them if you are not careful.A third problem is the index. If you wanted to find Burton's references to English writers such as More, Shakespeare, or Spenser you would be out of luck if you used the index in the NYRB edition, but you wouldn't be if you were reading Shilletto's 1893 edition. In that edition authors Burton quotes are listed and you have no trouble tracking most of them in Burton's Anatomy.These days I am more likely to read one of the 17th century editions of Burton's Anatomy or Shilletto's edition, but it is good to have Burton available again in a popular edition, even though this one is not ideal."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy","review":"Usually available only in expensive private editions and nineteenth century complilations, the New York Review Books paperback edition of Robert Burton's \\"The Anatomy of Melancholy\\" is handy and relatively cheap. It reprints the sixth and final edition that Burton issued, each edition expanding with afterthoughts by the author. The original in 1621 was one-half the size of the last edition.Burton was an Oxford scholar who had spent much of his life in Christ Church College of that institution accumulating quotes, ideas, and general collectible wisdom from the classics. His self-styled anatomy of the causes of melancholy is both ponderous and witty--quite in tune with Burton's styling himself as \\"Democritus Junior.\\" Democritus, you will recall, was a Greek philosopher of the 5th century BC who developed the idea of atoms forming the basis of the universe. He was also sometimes called the \\"laughing philosopher\\" because of his wit.Burton himself has a good time with this kind of humor, and his book is not at all a gloomy analysis of melancholy. What it is is a compendium of every kind of thought on the subject, and is replete with Latin quotations and Greek philosophy. It is a museum of myth, ignorance, and insight. Written in a uniquely antiquarian style, it is a treat for the modern reader. Like Sir Thomas Browne's gothic prose, Burton's is unique as well as intriguing. His book is meant to be dipped into, not to be read straight through. The wonderful thing is that it's not just a classic but a readable classic. It is, yes, antiquarian, but happily antiquarian.I loved it."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy","review":"Don't be misled by the title of this book, nor by what others may have told you about it.

A plausible translation of the title into modern terms would be &quot;A Study of Abnormal Psychology.&quot; The application of Scholastic methods to this topic --- so similar, and yet so different, from contemporary academic discourse --- creates a curious impression. He invokes astrology and theology in forming his psychology.But in fact, Burton uses this arcane subject to go off on a profound and lengthy meditation on the melancholies and misfortunes of life itself. The author, it seems, was easily distracted, and his distractions are our gain. The passages on the Melancholy of Scholars, and the Melancholy of Lovers, are themselves worthy of the price of admission.His prose is unlike anything before him or since him. It has some kinship to the paradoxical and simile-laden style of the Euphuists, but his individual sentences are often pithy and brief.This seventeenth-century classic ought to be read by anyone interested in the period, in early psychology, or in the history of English prose."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy","review":"This book is quite interesting because it holds within its many pages a teaching that is deeper than what it may seem. There is a deep psychological teaching that mixes itself with high spiritual principles, esoteric Christian Gnosticism in its raw form, and countless viels that keep such things hidden from the eyes of the average literary scholar... Why would Burton write in such a way? The same reason Dante did...But what is it that Burton is trying to show us, with his quotes from the Alchemical Master Galen and Latin stanzas?Why must we understand the \\"Anatomy of Meloncholy\\"? The anatomy of our own suffering and the suffering of the world...The Master M refers to Burton in his books of Occult Mysticism.For us, as common \\"modern westerners\\", to understand such esoteric psychology-and not have to learn Latin, Tibetan, Sanskrit or Chinese, we must study the books of SAMAEL AUN WEOR. He writes in such a way as to unveil those truly hidden mysteries: \\"Know thyself and thy shall Know the universe and all its Gods\\".Find the book of \\"Revolutionary Psychology\\" or \\"The Perfect Matrimony\\" by the said author. These books are amazing supplements to books like Burton's. These books give the western student a strong foundation in the psychological aspect of Occultism. SAMAEL AUN WEOR's books can be a bit difficult (to find), as they are continuously being translated from the original language (Spanish). Yet they can be bought from any Gnostic Institute (www.gnosticinstitute.org)."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy","review":"This book is almost unreadable. First, physically. It is a paperback, but very thick and heavy, and does not allow easy reading except on a table; almost impossible to read in bed.Second, subject matter.

Everything, I say! Talk about motormouth. He goes on and on long after anyone could possibly find him interesting. Oh, how this man needed an editor.Third, he is viciously anti-Catholic. Yes, I know it was (is?)the fashion in England for the best people to be anti-Catholic, but this guy can't be beat for vitriolic, venomous, bigotry.

A true feast."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy","review":"Those who read Robert Burton's ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY for the first time most often do so as part of a course in 17th century English literature. And even then they wade gently through a few pages rather than simply plunging in and learning, perhaps for the first time, that words are more intoxicating than any drug could be. There is no melancholy in the book, at least not to the extent that one might think because of the title. Instead the intrepid reader finds that Burton has attempted what we now know to be the impossible: to master the sum total of human knowledge in one book. Astoundingly, Burton did not know that it was impossible, so he went ahead and tried anyway. He came damn near close to succeeding.Robert Burton was typical of many contemporaries, many of whom tried to be a master of all trades, but it was only he that came close. Burton's love of learning and his dry and droll wit excuse his failure to such an extent that we do not even care that he failed. Rather, we focus on his successful attempt to draw us into the magical world of knowledge for its own sake. His critics have been merciless in their snippets that TAOM is no more than a collection of informal and disorganized essays on man's dissatisfaction with the universe. They complain loudly of his wild abandon of Latinate phrases that pepper every paragraph or his frequent mention of obscure authorities that exist nowhere else save this book. Yet, I suggest that wild abandon has its charm too. If one considers his book as a very nearly unlimited number of paragraphs, each of which exists in its own self-contained universe, then that paragraph sheds light on the human condition itself. Human beings have eternally sought knowledge of the macro universe and its mirror, the microverse. It is only in such seemingly unwieldy tomes as TAOM that humanity may find answers. The beauty of Burton is that the effort to find Eternal Truth is worth the effort. One need not be a grad student of literature to know that."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy","review":"There have been recently some reviews complaining of shoddy paperback editions of this book, published cheaply and with many dubious errors, lacking translation of the Latin, etc. (These problems are due largely to the publishers' use of outdated or uncorrected texts.)

I have been involved with many editions of this work over the years, and have a couple of things to add to what's been so eloquently said. First, it's a reference book and not a novel, and therefore shouldn't be read in a continuous way. It becomes tedious and incomprehensible. Like grandma used to say: \\"Take small bites so you don't choke!\\" There are parts of it that are dated but much that is totally applicable today. Second, it is a book about society, and the hypocrisy of the way different people get treated:\\"A sheep-stealer is hanged for stealing necessary victuals but a great man in office may safely rob, pillage, and destroy, and be honored for good service, and no man had best find fault with him.\\" This prefigures much of Enlightenment thinking and can be seen to relate to Culturalist Analytic thinking, like the works of Karen Horney. Third, it is a historical contemporary look at the Jacobean age, and even the Elizabethan world. If you're interested in the cultural climate of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, here is an overview of what was known and opined by a scholar. One wonders how melancholic he really was (in the modern sense) since the preparation and writing of such a compendium certainly requires motivation and energy, not generally associated with chronic depression. I would suggest the Preface and the Digression of Air as fascinating views of knowledge in the early 17th century.

This is one aspect of this Gargantuan tome, and the most delightful one. The other aspect is rather more nebulous: What exactly is this book about, and why was it penned? The obvious answer to the first part of the query is &quot;melancholy.&quot; But melancholy, as here laid forth, is a seemingly ubiquitous and all-encompassing malady, as it were. &quot;For indeed who is not a fool, melancholy, mad?&quot; And who knows exactly why it was penned? So little is known of Burton and the incidents of his life: Save, of course, that he was well-acquainted with the unfelicitous side of things. - There is a sweetness in his accounting of it though, that is oddly reminiscent of the subaqueous tones of Debussy. One is not surprised either to find that Keats was one of Burton's readers.-The same dulcet sadness lures us into a kind of bittersweet repose, as in the opening lines of the poet's &quot;Ode To A Nightingale.&quot;-Burton had a calling and this book was his answer to it.- All arguments in re the whys and wherefores are really for naught.- He had a calling and his answer remains a unique monument in Western literature, to be treasured and pored over again and again by all of us logophiles and solitary scholars...And anyone else, by the way."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy","review":"Despite translating thousands of worthless Latin quotations, the editor of this edition leaves large passages from the section on Love Melancholy, which Burton waggishly wrote in Latin, untranslated.

After plodding through over a thousand pages, the reader has earned a little titillating trivia. Also, if you've forgotten your Latin, Burton's notes are left untranslated.

So I am reading it again, and I'm reminded of our tendency to blame others for our problems and our resistance to scientific thought in favor of ideology. Indeed, it seems our national LOGIC has diminished to an even greater extent. Oh yes, we are still our own worst enemy, and have not yet moved beyond clannish thought.Thanks Amazon for helping me track down this old book."},{"Title":"Don Camillo and His Flock","review":"Don Camillo and his Flock, the second in the series of Guareschi's fabulous tales of Don Camillo, a hot-tempered parish priest, and the communist Mayor Peppone, his equally hard-headed enemy. The two loathe each other, and often resort to blackmail and schoolboy tricks in order to gain an advantage over the other. The stories are outrageously funny: there's the tale of Rhadames, the choirboy who can't sing. And the story of Smilzo, &quot;a young gentleman who decides to put the doctrine of free love into practice.&quot; And finally, the gilded angel on top of the church that Don Camillo can't quite fathom. At the end of it all, it's Don Camillo and Peppone who must temporarily sort out their differences to bring order to the day. A fine rainy day, any day read, over and over again, this book is truly one of the finest examples of satire, with, and literary magic ever to weave its spell on me."},{"Title":"Don Camillo and His Flock","review":"This second of Giovanni Guareschi's &quot;Don Camillo&quot; books delivers more humorous tales featuring the big, outspoken priest and his opposite number in the Communist camp. With the Cold War in full swing, and both America and Russia sending supplies and representatives in an effort to win the people's allegiance, it's up to Don Camillo and his arch-rival Mayor Peppone to negotiate a particularly Italian brand of peace for their little village.Whether their aim is to help get a local boy his big break in show business, to defend a thoroughbred dog from a cruel master, or to insure that no one in the Little World goes hungry when it can be prevented, this team proves that sometimes there's no friend like a good enemy."},{"Title":"Don Camillo and His Flock","review":"These short stories are absolutely charming. They're not cute, sweet, or preachy in the slightest, and although they deal with a Christian priest, I really don't think anybody of any faith could read these short stories and not enjoy them. I myself am not Christian but I love the Don Camillo stories.They're short stories about a priest in Italy (Don Camillo) around mid-century, when communism is just gaining a foothold in the country. Don Camillo is a big, strong man with a hot temper despite being a priest, and he strongly disagrees with communism. The leader of the local communist party and Mayor of the town is an equally strong and hot-tempered atheist called Peppone who believes Christianity and Communism are incompatible. The two constantly fight and resort to all sorts of tricks and schemes to best the other -- Don Camillo to convince Peppone to respect god and the church, Peppone to convince Don Camillo that Communism is the way of the future and that Christianity is standing in the way of progress. Don Camillo often treads a very fine line between defending the church and behaving inappropriately as a priest, and occasionally gets a reprimand from god for going too far, as well as whatever Peppone may have dealt him.The stories are great satire on the follies of people in general, and very funny. I don't believe in god, but if I ever did discover I am wrong and there is a god, I would like him to be Don Camillo's god. The overall message is not anything preachy, but simply the basic goodness of people and the importance of tolerance and forgiveness."},{"Title":"Don Camillo and His Flock","review":"okay, til i read the reviews above, I had no idea these were \\"kids\\" stories! duh!

Wish more people knew about them."},{"Title":"Don Camillo and His Flock","review":"I read most or all Don Camillo books as a kid. I loved them then and I love them now. Only one of those books survived in my collection so I'm glad they're available through Amazon. These books were originally my father's and I have no idea where he found them. These books have been circulating around in my family's and friend's homes forever, and must be like the most often read of all of our books.I used to reach out to these books whenever I needed a good laugh. Still I think the books often send out a story of love and loyalty towards the reader as well. When push comes to shove the villagers stick together against outsiders and common enemies. This of course while trying to outsmart and get the upperhand over each other in the process.While there's a lot to laugh about in the books there are also more serious issues dealt with in the books as well. I'm sure that these books will appeal to both the younger and the older generations. If you don't know these books, please pick up one and I guarantee that you will be in for a real treat.

Adults may even enjoy it more than kids, but it presents an even-handed and sympathetic portrait of &quot;the little world&quot;- the Po valley in Italy. It's unfortunate that it's not read more often. i'm told that Guareschi was very well loved by a generation of European children, regardless of nationality. If in doubt, just get it!"},{"Title":"Don Camillo and His Flock","review":"Don Camillo books are such wholesome treasures. The first time I read the series was more than 25 years ago and I wanted to revisit them. They were still fresh and applicable in many ways to our day to day lives. Don Camillo's eternal rivals are the Italian communists of the day. A communist Italian sounds like a joke today and the Don was the first to see it in his day, I suppose. (How can you make a communist from an Italian? This impossibility becomes quite obvious in the visit to the former USSR.)When I was reading it again I could not help finding parallels with the corporate bureaucracy and its systems that we created in the past decade or two. The tactics to maintain the corporate bureaucracy seemed quite similar to those humorously described in Don Camillo's world. A very entertaining read, that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"A diary from Dixie,","review":"Mary Chesnut's diary of life in the South during the American Civil War is possibly the best of all American diaries. You could spend weeks making your way through the labyrinth of events -- trivial and important -- and personalities found in the diary.This edition of the diary is superseded by a better one: \\"Mary Chesnut's Civil War\\" edited by C. Vann Woodward which won a Pulitzer Prize for History in 1982. Woodward's edition offers a more complete text and is heavily footnoted with explanatory material. The text in Woodward includes many interesting passages excluded from \\"A Diary from Dixie\\" because of limitations of space and because some of them reflected unfavorably on the South and Southerners.One virtue of this edition is a fine foreword about the diary by literary critic Edmund Wilson, but Wilson's foreword can also be read in his book \\"Patriotic Gore.\\" I recommend you read Woodward's \\"Mary Chesnut's Civil War\\" instead of this book.Smallchief"},{"Title":"A diary from Dixie,","review":"I was unaware, until I read the previous reviewer's remarks, of the fact that this was a heavily edited version of Chestnut's Journals, of which broad and more forthright passages had been deleted. Certainly, more liveliness is needed here to keep one's rapt attention. But, of course, this is a fault inherent in journals as a genre, such as those of Samuel Pepys for instance, every day can not be a page out of The Three Musketeers. Chestnut, as has been noted, is both cultured and independently minded, debunking the myths of Southern ignorance and complacency, especially among women. This alone makes the book an interesting read. Nevertheless, one grows weary after a while, slogging along to the pathetic outcome that we know awaits the trials under which this woman bears up so bravely.-What interested me the most was that, at times, there are sparks of poetic insight that could have sprung straight from Faulkner or even Proust, such as &quot;Of all our sorrows, memory is the worst.&quot; p.102 or &quot;Time works its wonders like enchantment.&quot; p.141 One ponders what would have been the outcome had Ms. Chestnut turned her hand to novels or poetry!-I only gave the book 4 stars because of the expurgation of the journals and the slogging reading at times. But I'm going to check out the texts mentioned by the previous reviewer and hopefully return with an extra star tacked on to my reviews."},{"Title":"A diary from Dixie,","review":"If the Confederacy had survived Lincoln's invasion, Mary Boykin Miller Chesnut might be a household name in the literary world.And that's pretty good when one considers that her oeuvre was written without the slightest whiff of literary pretension or ambition.highwayscribery is not sure if a deep interest in the Civil War, from the southern side of things, is necessary for her scribbling prowess to impress. But if it's there, \\"A Diary from Dixie\\" is for you.Chesnut was well-positioned to chronicle Dixie's misery both as a South Carolina lady intimate with Jefferson Davis and his wife, and wife to a Confederate officer whose competence is apparent in his upward trajectory throughout the book's (and war's) course.The authoress succeeds in engaging the reader without any real structure other than the natural chronology of events as she lives them. The gentle lady moseys from one happening to another, recounting those things she witnesses, and those others have told her about, with nary a transition.But the recounting is so casual, the prose so clean, the reader is niever tried, taxed or bored. Chesnut was a feeling, seeing person with the literary chops to put what she felt and saw into words, as in this passage describing the family plantation, Mulberry, in Camden, South Carolina:\\"It is so lovely here in spring. The giants of the forest -- the primeval oaks, water-oaks, live-oaks, willow-oaks, such as I have not seen since I left here -- with opopanax, violets, roses, and yellow jessamine, the air is laden with perfume. Araby the Blest was never sweeter.\\"There are fascinating, first-hand insights in \\"Diary\\" as to the way slaves and masters interacted, and the ambiguous attitude of negroes in the south when freedom beckoned, but their familiar world crumbled.Chesnut's tones are not the stark blacks and whites of Harriet Beecher Stowe's south, rather a wide array of grays.The relations between the furiously independent member states are also depicted, with Virginians, and Kentuckians, and Carolinians both north and south, remarked upon for their peculiar, geographically bound traits.In these times, as a single electronic culture inexorably engulfs humanity, it is interesting to read about the differences between neighboring communities and see how they celebrated those differences.The book's tone morphs from light to dark as the northern noose tightens around the Confederacy's neck. Noteworthy is the early opinion, expressed by rebels in high places, that the South had no chance of winning the war.\\"Diary\\" tells us that had clearer heads prevailed, the cataclysm might have been averted.The dominant portrait is that of a small, agrarian society confronting a behemoth that will leave no stone unturned, no home unburned, and kill-off a generation of fine young men -- not all of then enamored with slavery -- so much as loyal to their homeland.\\"Others dropped in after dinner; some without arms, some without legs; von Boreke, who can not speak because of a wound in his throat. Isabella said, 'We have all kinds now, but a blind one.' Poor fellows, they laugh at wounds. 'And they yet can show many a scar.'\\"Chesnut is in the rearguard, her lofty status slowly reduced to a state of hunger bourn with ladylike dignity. Hers is the Confederate women's story, a dreadful enumeration of lost sons, sundered families, and mothers literally dying from grief.\\"Isabella says that war leads to love-making. She says these soldiers do more courting here in a day than they would do at home, without a war, in ten years.\\"Perhaps most valuable are those anecdotes Chesnut recorded which give the war between the states, and the Confederacy in particular, a greater depth and richer texture.Without her we might not have known that President Davis' little boy died at home, nor of the suspicions that a turncoat on staff, or a spy snuck into the house, actually killed him in a cruel effort to demoralize Dixie.The tragic deaths of innocents stepping out from a cave for some air in Vicksburg during the Union siege might have gone unrecorded. We could not be aware that France's last Count de Choiseul had thrown his lot in with the south and died for it, too.Without her desperate scribblings, we would have known only the winner's account, and been denied the terrible beauties associated with losing, which is so much a part of life."},{"Title":"Practical mysticism;: A little book for normal people,","review":"This very poetic and lyrical book is a real gem in the mystic literature. It does a wonderful job of describing and bringing to life the interior experience of a mystic, the various stages and accomplishes this goal in a relatively short space.I have studied comparative religion for over 20 years and I speak regularly on a variety of topics relating to this area. I have also studied integral psychology, which looks at psychological within the context of the world's wisdom traditions. I believe this makes me a good candidate to review this book and where it fits in the landscape of literature on the topic.This book takes and packages the mystical experience which Underhill describes as \\"the art of union with reality\\" in terms anyone can understand and relate to. Her metaphors are powerful and I believe many of them apply across traditions.While it's true that this book does not cover Eastern traditions as such, more than likely the interior experience of mystics is similar or the same. What is likely to be different is the conceptual framework that they apply to make sense of them. In this respect, the book definitely packages the content into metaphors and words that are consistent with Christian Mysticism. However, the insights of the underlying experience are invaluable and apply to every tradition.For example, a Christian might say that, \\"I had an experience of being God.\\" What they probably mean is that I participated in involuntarily in God's being and it was a grace or gift.\\" A Hindu might take the same fundamental experience and say, \\"I had an experience that my Atman (deepest Self) is Brahman (God). I've read literature on both sides of the fence and it appears to me like the mystics are having the same transrational, noetic and ineffable experience, but are doing their best to capture it in words that they are familiar with within their historical context.If one approaches reading Underhill from this perspective, it can be a very enriching experience. She covers a lot of good ground in this little book and it will provoke many insights. If you are not familiar with mysticism at all, this could be a great place to start reading, especially if you are a Christian.If you are not a Christian, I see a lot of advantage in looking at these phenomena from different vantage points. I think each tradition has something valuable to contribute to the ongoing dialogue of the meaning of direct knowing and to get the full picture you really need to read a variety of material.There are LESS EXPENSIVE versions of this book out there. So... if you are on the fence, get a less expensive or used version and prepare to hear some age old wisdom. However, do approach it from the perspective of a modern person looking through the lens of someone who lived at the beginning of the 20th century. What to me is surprising is not how different things were, but rather how the human condition has remained much the same."},{"Title":"Practical mysticism;: A little book for normal people,","review":"There is simply no other book that I know of that is more clearly written, thoughtfully presented, and graspable in every way about the nature and practice of mindfulness than Evelyn Underhill's Practical Mysticism.

Even more recent mystics like Thomas Merton are hard to fathom. Evelyn Underhill is the easiest to understand. She writes her book for the \\"practical man\\" who is far too busy and practical to delve into mysticism. I, too, am a \\"practical man\\" (an engineer by training), but I found her pathway to mysticism so fluently and effortlessly stated that I was drawn into it immediately. A definite read for any one who is curious about or aspires to be a mystic!"},{"Title":"Practical mysticism;: A little book for normal people,","review":"Evelyn Underhill wrote numerous books about mysticism, an amazing number of which are still in print (click on author name to see). In this little book, published just at the start of WWI, Underhill attempted to distill a summary of the mystical pursuit in simple language.Addressing an imaginary &quot;practical man&quot;, Underhill attempts first to justify the validity and value of the pursuit of mystical experience; then explains the stages of the mystic's quest in several chapters. These chapters represent a synthesis of the works of dozens of mystic authors from all ages and traditions.The writing style is lyrical: at times quite beautiful and striking, at other times crossing the line to become pretentious and old-fashioned.Is this actually a book for the (modern) &quot;practical man&quot;? I think not. Underhill's instructions in how to begin meditating are quite vague and could easily mislead a beginner into fruitless paths. Also, the descriptions of the stages of mystical progress are strongly influenced by the Christian mystics of the middle ages -- Underhill clearly had studied few, if any, primary sources on Eastern traditions. That's understandable; relatively few Buddhist or Hindu documents had been translated at the time of writing. But it reduces the value of the book for modern readers."},{"Title":"The Wall","review":"I tried to get through this book. It took me about three weeks to get to page one hundred. The format was a mess. It was supposed to be the collected documents of the main character. This format just made reading the book a chore.

This could have been a good 400 page novel, but the author tried too hard to be clever and it ruined the impact.

Memorable characters, an exciting plot that keeps you riveted to the story, wonderful characters, and the great Berson and his concertina and Rachel, homely, wonderful, fantastic. I've read this work many, many times, and each time I am swept up by the story. All the hoopla that surrounded \\"The Naked and the Dead,\\" and who reads it anymore anyway, and \\"The Wall\\" is forgotten by the quote literary world. This work, read in tandem with I. B. Singer's \\"The Family Moskat,\\" is the quintessential portrait of Polish Jewry from the turn of the century up until, well, speaking in literary terms, up until \\"Exodus.\\" Uris's novel is a journalistic movie--don't look for nuance or depth. Hersey's is a novel in the Tolstoyan sense in which you never forget the characters and they live inside your soul forever. Uris's Ari, for example, is a kind of Ayn Rand Howard Roark superhero, superman, \\"Who is John Galt?\\" kind of guy, way beyond my caring too much about him other than to wish that Paul Newman were still alive.Read \\"The Wall.\\" Live \\"The Wall.\\" Tell your friends about \\"The Wall.\\" Maybe NYRB will reissue it with a proper intro by some literary bigwig and put Hersey's novel back on the map."},{"Title":"The Wall","review":"I have to say, John Hersey is a great writer and this probably one of the best books on the holocaust. The writing style took a little getting used, but gradually, you really feel like you are living behind the ghetto wall. This is probably one of the most realistic accounts of the Warsaw ghetto and the ultimate uprising, as these are very real people living in an extraordinarily bad time, and doing what they can to survive. There are no superheroes here, or the super-perfect and physically stunning flawless characters which inhabit so many books of this type. What is most interesting, and so politically incorrect, is the squabbling that went on between the Jewish groups--rather than unite against a common and deadly enemy, they chose to argue and fight amongst themselves, almost until the end.I really felt like I knew these people, as they lived, died, married, and survived. The book is based on the actual notes kept by Emanuel Ringlbaum, who is the \\"real\\" Noach Levinson, the fictitious narrator and diarist of this book.But I gave the book 4 stars for 2 reasons. One is that the book dragged on longer than it had to. This is a big book, about 650 pages, but the last 150 could have easily been condensed to less than half that. It is ironic that the most \\"exciting\\" part turned out to be the most boring. Towards the end, when the ghetto is being emptied of its last survivors and the Jews are armed and fighting back, the book begins to crawl along slower than a dead garden slug. The entries are repetitious--same thing repeated over and over again. The musings of Noach are dull, and very little happens. The interactions between the characters, and the portraits of their daily lives has vanished, and now they are hiding in bunkers and little more. And this goes on for over 100 pages. I began to skip paragraphs then whole pages at a time, trying to move this along.At the end, just when about 40 survivors are about to get out, there is a delay, so they are stuck below ground for another 24 hours. Why? The author threw this in so that Noach could do \\"interviews!\\" Talk about boring. I skipped those after trying to read through one of them, and then finally, they are out. The survivors, the characters that we have come to know intimately, are now free in the forest and meet up with partisan groups. But then the story ends, abruptly. What the...?There is no closure, no epilogue, nothing, to tell readers what became of them. It is only May 1943, and there are two very long years of war left. What happens to the characters? Where did they go? What became of those who were living on the Aryan side? What about David--did he ever make it to Palestine? In the prologue, we learn the names of two characters who survived and one who died before the end of the war, but that's it. I can't fathom Hersey's reason for doing this. It was such a letdown, not to have any closure or know what happened, where the characters went, if they survived the war and where they ended up."},{"Title":"The Wall","review":"This is written in an unusual style, as if a historian was keeping a diary of the events he witnessed in the Warsaw Ghetto, along with interviews of the inhabitants. The preface refers to the Levinson Archives, discovered after that war. Of course, that's just part of the fiction, but it was so believable, I didn't realize it at first.Despite the terrifying situation, most of the book is about relationships and personalities. Levinson, a recluse, finds a spirit of camaraderie and a \\"family\\" as people are forced to move into ever-closer quarters and to rely on one another for survival. The story gets more harrowing as the end draws near, and the ingenuity, bravery and breaking points of the various characters are tested.It's an unique look at the Warsaw Ghetto and I liked the diarist style. It's long , 640 pages, but it is riveting. I would love to be in a book group to discuss it. Sometimes I wonder why we need all these new books, when there isn't time to read the old ones. And most of those can be read more than once."},{"Title":"The Wall","review":"I had read several other works by Hersey, but this is his best by far- far better than I dared hope when I ordered the book from Amazon. The reader is immediately captured by a story that is compelling and realistic, without ignoring a very dark side of human history. It is the best of historical fiction, because you learn a lot without ever finding it tiresome. The characters are fully developed. By the end, I can honestly say that I came to love them.If you are at all interested in the Holocaust in general and Warsaw Ghetto in particular, buy The Wall! It is one of the best novels that I have ever read, and I intend to read Hersey much more widely now."},{"Title":"The Wall","review":"I assigned myself to read aloud from the pages of this book to a couple of friends. I told them it was a really intense book so I just opened a page and started readingI got to the part where a rounded up Jewish father refused to give up a large duffel bag and inside was a baby with its mouth bound to keep it from making any noise. This father was sneaking the baby into the camp like a goody bag refusing to be parted from it! I managed to finish the page without choking-up but somehow a part of myself had never been the same since.I was just filled with some kind of remorse at having chosen that page at random to read out. It is doubtful that the father or the baby ever made it out and there is some great cost at the back of every instance that shakes us back to our empathizing self.John Hershey has put into words some of the most tragic accounts of our age. It is not so much the taking of lives as the denial of dignity that made the Nazis so evil. He paints a clear and genuine snapshot of people desperately clinging to the vitals of humanity- their dignity and family.I would recommend for a follow-up novel Exodus by Leon Uris- just to know that Jews did indeed fight back and win the day. Throw in Inglorious Basterds for higher feel-good effect."},{"Title":"The Wall","review":"I read The Wall almost forty years ago, when I was 16 or 17.

I read Mila 18 many years ago and it was an exciting read. But the book has not lived with me as The Wall still does. If your satified with excitement, read Mila 18. If you want something more, read The Wall. Which is not to say that The Wall does not have excitement. It certainly does, but it has a lot more.

I thought there should have been more to the ending."},{"Title":"The Wall","review":"Hersey is probably America's greatest unrecognized writer. Hersey probably didn't care. The Wall drove me to my local library where I soon found the names of many of his fictional characters. The Jewish historian who hid his writings in milk cans has a name. He died in 1944. Milk cans were still being found in the 1950's according to my research. How did the son of Protestant missionaries to China write this Jewish story? It was easy---Hersey loved them very much. His characters are largely doomed to the fate the Nazi's inflicted upon them. But you cry for them--we lost those wonderful people because they were Jewish. Hersey writes with a pen in one hand and a lightning bolt in the other. This is a great read, filled with compassion and a skill with words that is nearly gone from today's garish bestsellers."},{"Title":"The Wall","review":"You can read the other reviews to get an idea as to what the story covers, but I want to share with you my experience as to the impact of its delivery and tale. I read a lot. And it's rare for a book to make me laugh out loud or cry tears. At first, I neither liked nor cared for any of the characters. At the end, I cried; hard. I've never had a story affect me this way."},{"Title":"The Wall","review":"One of the only true accounts, which will leave you wondering 'could this ever happen again.' I began the book, thinking it was a mistake, but after reading the first page, my mind was drawn to the wondrous text. I read page after page, loving each milisecond in which I could enjoy the classic. It tells of a Jewish 'family' living in the Warsaw ghetto during the second world war. Many exciting, and interesting charcters sweep you off your feet as you read. People who otherwise would never have been remembered, during one of the most tragic times, in all of the world's history will at last get the credit they deserve. The 'family' consisting of several families, with ages varying between a few months to nearly sixty years of age. Every charcter has a story in which they wish their close friend, Noach Levinson, to record in his archive. His archive was retrieved by a Jewish girl, Rachel Apt, and her older Jewish lover, Dolek Berson, after the war. Levinson's archive was filled with documents containing information concerning his friends, and enemies, the Nazis. Also contained in his archive were plays, stories, and journals written by people in the ghetto. The book explains in detail the thoughts, conversations, and contributions to the war, of the forty+ Jewish who escaped the tragedies of the ghetto, through the underground sewer system. You'll feel as you end the book, that you are one of these Jewish struggling to survive in the climate of a war-torn Europe. You'll know the 'family' personally, even though you have never met them, and probably never will. I personally loved the book, and hope people of many future generations will be able to experience the sadness, hope, and frustrations felt while reading this classic novel"},{"Title":"The Wall","review":"Although I read this many years ago, it is on my re-read list. I recall that it was a fast read and held my interest to the end. If you have ever wondered just how the Holocaust could have happened, read this book and get a feel for just how an intelligent group was identified, manipulated, herded into the ghetto, managed to survive as long as they could.....a real eye-opener. Probably one of the better WW II pieces of historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Wall","review":"This is a very deep and powerful historical novel involving Poland, Jews and the Germans.

This is the story of the condammed Jews in the Polish ghetto trying to fight back without any help from the outside and not for the survival (it was impossible and they knew it) but for the remains of dignity and for the right to die standing tall. Mila 18 by Leon Uris comes to mind when you read \\"The Wall\\"."},{"Title":"The Wall","review":"This is John Hersey's stunning novel about the Jews in the Warsaw ghetto during WW II. It's a huge, sprawling book, and revolves around upwards of fifty different characters in their struggle to survive Nazi atrocities within the ghetto. Hersey based much of the novel on thousands of pages of original source material written in Polish and Yiddish by Jews in Warsaw. A handful of the characters begin to take center stage and relate what's going on and their feelings and impressions through first-person narratives: Dolek Berson, Pavel Menkes, Henryck Rapaport, Rachel Apt, and especially Noach Levinson become leaders of the \\"Jewish family\\" that first confront the Germans and then finally escape as the last buildings are being razed. With so many characters we witness the vast array of human qualities, from the strong to the weak, the resourceful and resilient to the helpless and feeble. Not only is the book an indictment of the horrors that people are able and willing to inflict on others, it's a rousing hurrah for those who fight against and somehow survive the torture and humiliation. The book is an amazing achievement, certainly Hersey's greatest novel."},{"Title":"The Wall","review":"This book seems to be based on the real-life diaries of Emanuel Ringelblum, whose copious writings were unearthed after WWII, and also takes a similar form to the novel 'Mila 18,' which is also based around journal entries taking place in Warsaw during WWII. This particular journal was kept by Noach Levinson, whom we find out in the foreword died in March of 1944 of TB, and was unearthed by several of the survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto. However, it isn't the normal book told in journal form, since Noach mostly describes what happens around him and to other people instead of just focusing on himself and his own feelings. Many of the entries are told from the point of view of other characters, who later related their stories and feelings to Noach, even opening up to him about very personal private matters. I would strongly recommend it to people looking to read more in this sub-genre of Shoah literature, right up there with 'Mila 18' and Ringelblum's actual journals.However, this book was a little slow at first for me, but it quickly became more interesting and faster-paced. And I'm hardly one to talk since my own writing features a lot of characters as well, but sometimes it was hard to remember who was whom because there were so many characters, even minor secondary characters, and sometimes these characters would go unmentioned for pages at a time, making it a bit difficult to get a picture of just what this person's significance was or even what this person was like. In a book with a lot of characters, it's easier to keep track of everyone if characters are introduced and developed at around the same time instead of just popping up sporadically. As a result, I didn't feel attached to all of these characters in the same way. Still, that's a relatively minor criticism given that the subject matter itself is so engrossing and detailed.My other relatively minor issue with the book is the writing style itself. Sometimes it does seem a little pretentious or confusing how an entry will be broken up midway through with an insert in brackets, an insert containing an older entry or an entry that would be written at a future date, or notes from conversations that took place while the survivors were hiding in a sewer after the revolt, on a subject related to the main entry. This occasional nonlinear structure didn't really seem that effective or natural to me. There were also a number of inserts in brackets referencing older entries; even if this was meant to be told in a journalistic matter, that still seems a bit pretentious in a work of fiction, kind of interrupting the natural flow of the story. I also wished there had been some sort of afterword, providing more of a sense of closure on what happened to the survivors after they were taken from the sewer to the partisans in the woods. I was left wondering what had happened to some of the characters who had escaped the Ghetto and were now living on the Aryan side, like Rachel's father and sister, or Rachel's little brother David, who was in a secret convoy going to Palestine. Still, all in all, in spite of a few comparatively minor shortcomings, I would strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in this particular sub-genre of Shoah literature."},{"Title":"The Wall","review":"This is a fictitious drama, but most of the characters and incidents are based on historical facts surrounding the 1943 Jewish uprising in the Warsaw ghetto. It is truly an epic, divided into four parts and surround several families' experiences and comraderie during the Nazi occupation of their hometown. Hersey makes a painstaking chronicle of their everyday lives, their hardships and underground networking, leading to the eventual revolt. It is a sad, yet ultimately triumphant story.A quick, personal rebuttal regarding the teen commenting on this book being boring (and for other youngsters considering reading this book):1. Just because you're in high school does NOT mean your opinions are not important; they are. If you really feel this book is endless, you can and should say so. But what parts of it do you find objectionable? Are the sentences long-winded (you might find this to be true since Mr. Hersey was trained in journalism, hence he chronicles a great deal of detail into the story)?2. You might think this is crazy, but try reading this book again! But this time, focus your interest on perhaps just one or two main characters (ie: Dolek Berson, Noach Levinson, Rachel Apt, etc.) By doing this, you'll probably find that your interest level in the material goes up since you'll be more attentive to the goings-on of just the people you want to follow within the story. The remaining details will indirectly fall into place as you continue in the book.3. Don't let the length of this or any other book intimidate you. I agree with you that \\"The Wall\\" is a long piece of work, but the contents makes it worth reading. In contrast, you may have encountered books that are only 100 pages long, but they are so dry and uninteresting that you cannot wait to get to the end of them (I had assigned reading like this in high school, so if you too feel this way, I can empathize!).In any case, I hope you (and others) are not discouraged from studying this very important era of World War II. All the best!"},{"Title":"The Wall","review":"If you read this book, you will enter the Warsaw Ghetto during the 1940's, and live there along side the Jews, Poles, etc. You will experience their joys, humor, cleverness, sadness, depression, anxiety, and terror. The characters are fictional; the history is factual; and the heartbreak too real! If you want a history lesson on Nazi persecution, on the sense of family under horrendous pressures, on the claustrophobia of living underground, and the exhilarations of courage and weapons acquisition--and a cold, hard look at the Final Solution in action--this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"The Wall","review":"John Hersey's The Wall is a fictionalized account of the Warsaw ghetto (November 16,1940 to May 16, 1943). The emphasis is on the whole historical experience, not just the uprising (April 19, 1943 to May 16, 1943). Hersey has a handful of his characters escape on May 10, 1943, so that there is someone left to tell the story and to allow the reader to sense the flicker of hope which the characters express. The narrative technique is brilliant. The story is told in the form of an archival record written by one of the survivors and dug up after the war. This technique allows multiple first person accounts as recorded through conversations of the archivist with the handful of people who form a \\"family\\" as the Germans compress the ghetto and with members of the Judenrat where the archivist works. It's like having numerous narrators, but the point of view remains consistently focused by the archivist and the author in the role of \\"editor\\" of the records. By carefully positioning the characters within the ghetto (some in the Judenrat, some in the Socialist Bund, some on work details), Hersey allows the reader to \\"see\\" and understand the ghetto and its horrors from several perspectives. The dual filtering of the stories by the archivist and editor allow the reader to encounter the horrors of the Warsaw ghetto without being repulsed by them. The characters grow, develop, and learn from their experiences and the archivist relates those changes even as the ghetto changes and life becomes more difficult. It's an engrossing and emotional account which follows the historical sequence closely. Hersey is a compassionate story teller, and the reader develops a strong emotional attachment to many of the characters."},{"Title":"Foundations of Food Preparation (6th Edition)","review":"This annoying book is poorly written, sloppy intellectually, and poorly formatted. It is used as a college food science textbook and the workbook is a separate purchase. Too bad because the workbook is well written, well organized, and thoughfully put together. This book assumes a year of recent college chemistry. It lacks a glossary and serviceable index; but that seems unimportant when you consider the frequent contradictions and misinformation on things like the ratios of ingredients in self rising flour. AURGH! The authors are clearly not writers and the publisher clearly does not care to adequately edit this book for information, style, or presentation. Given the topics this text covers, it is hard to imagine how anyone could have done such a pitiable job. Food and food science should be exciting subjects. All I can say is the authors must have enormous egos. Shame on the authors... They must have gotten degrees from colleges that did not have an English requirement.

Leonard Maltin's Carole Lombard may have been the first volume in the series I owned and it's definately one of the best ones.

The time is during the space race in the 1960s, and the Americans and the Soviets are racing to claim the moon. Both sides are vying for advantage both on the technical and propaganda front.While such great events are afoot elsewhere one must pity poor Count of Mountjoy, a man who aspires to greatness but as the Prime Minister of the Duchy only gets to deal with trivial matters. He has to arrange to have the potholes in Fenwicks single road repaired, or to pay for the restringing of the bows and the purchase of new arrows for the nations tiny army. He dreams of superhighways and modern facilities and budgets in the billions for Grand Fenwick, but instead is stuck dealing with 2 pounds and 10 shillings to purchase some new arrows.One day the Duchy's beloved princess Glorina decides she wants a sable coat, which costs considerably more than the Duchy's entire annual budget. This request combined with considerable diplomatic maneuver by Lord Mountjoy and diplomatic posturing by the US and the Soviet Union starts a chain of hilarious events that catapult the Duchy into the forefront of the space race. The US and the USSR are trying to get ahead of one another in a military space race, only if Grand Fenwick can beat them both will cooperation prevail in space.This book avoids most of the pitfalls that render most sequels inferior to the original book, and I would highly recommend it. The only minor pitfalls to this book is that of course it is a bit dated and some of the historical nuances may be a bit inaccessible to young readers.

The effect is something like a bucket of cold water over the head! The warts-and-all biography is alive and kicking! Diana Souhami has written a book that is both fresh and thoroughly researched which forces us to do the best thing a biography can make us do - view the subject with fresh eyes. Absolutely no punches are pulled and we experience the vividness of Radclyffe Hall's life, the horrible childhood, the pointless spiritual dabbling, the suffocating upper-class lesbian coteries, we practically live her relationships with Mabel Batten, Una Troubridge, Eugenia Souline.There is a lot to dislike in this subject who in many ways behaved like a spoiled child, sacking servants and disposing of pets without a moment's thought. But there is also a shining flame of fierce courage, and we see here the huge cost of coming out as a lesbian in those early days. Three cheers for Diana Souhami!I urge you to read this book!"},{"Title":"Trials of Radclyffe Hall","review":"I recommend reading Diana Souhami's biography of the writer Marguerite &quot;John&quot; (Twonnie) Radclyffe Hall. The author's prose is lucid. The book contains documentation and photographs of this rather extraordinary &quot;sexual invert,&quot; as Radclyffe Hall insisted upon labeling herself and others like her. Extraordinary in large part because of the hoopla and trial that unfolded around Radclyffe Hall's novel The Well of Loneliness (1928). Souhami's biography presents a full account of Radclyffe Hall's: troubled childhood; poetry and fiction publications; beloveds; animals and birds (cherished, but quickly abandoned when they did not &quot;obey&quot; her); law suits (she was perpetually willing and financially able to sue anyone at anytime); and writing and editing processes. This is an interesting biography of an interesting woman."},{"Title":"Trials of Radclyffe Hall","review":"Radclyffe Hall was not a major literary figure-- but she was an immensely fascinating one. She's not less fascinating because there were so many things to dislike (depressing love affairs, callousness about pets, and a definite preference for fascism).What Souhami manages to do is to paint a picture that owns the negative without playing down the brave and even important side to Hall's life. For the students of history and sexual politics, the trials surrounding the Well of Loneliness make fascinating reading and we see them through this book in a totally different light than I've seen them before.Great biography."},{"Title":"Portraits of the Civil War","review":"&quot;Portraits of the Civil War&quot; is the latest offering by acclaimed Civil War author William C. Davis (author of &quot;Lincoln's Men&quot;, &quot;Duel Between the First Ironclads&quot; and so many other fine works), and although a slim volume (128 pages in all), for the Civil War enthusiast it is worth its weight in Gold.Using photographs by Brady, Gardner and others, Davis writes brief but interesting profiles about the well-known (Lincoln, Lee, Grant, Custer and Davis) but also provides interesting commentaries on some lesser-known figures, including Jefferson C. Davis, the volatile Union General, Thomas Custer, George Armstrong's Medal of Honor winning brother, and Confederate Sergeant Richard Kirkland, the so-called &quot;Angel&quot; of Fredericksburg, whose compassion towards wounded Union soldiers on the Fredericksburg battlefield is now part of the Civil War legend (less than a year later, Kirkland, by then an officer, died gallantly on the Chickamauga Battlefield). Brothers who fought on opposite sides, such as Percival (who was Farragut's flag captain at Mobile Bay) and Thomas Drayton and James and William Terrill (&quot;...perhaps their education either reflected - or influenced - their decisions&quot;). In the latter case, both Terrills died on the battlefield, Union General William at Perryville, and Confederate General James at Bethesda Church.Davis also brings to life Women, Blacks, and Native Americans such as the Confederate Cherokee Stand Watie who served in the Civil War. For those already familiar with Davis' earlier works, he also brings to this volume his antipathy (less than well-concealed) towards Confederate General Joseph Johnston (&quot;Afterwards Johnston fought Davis with a vigor he never showed against the Yankees&quot;).Outside of this opinionated analysis, and the exclusion of other colorful figures such as Medal of Honor Winner Union Nurse Mary Walker and Confederate General Joseph Wheeler (in a 128 page book you can't have everybody), this book of fine portraits and well-written profiles clearly belongs on the bookshelves of both the beginning student and the diehard enthusiast, and makes a fine holiday (or otherwise) gift for those in both categories!"},{"Title":"Human Resources and Personnel Management","review":"I am studying Bussiness Administration at the Universidad de los Andes, Santiago Chile.

It resembles the GD tarot, but is not a Golden Dawn deck per se - it differs from it in many details. Those looking for a GD tarot deck proper would be better off with the Golden Dawn Magical Tarot by the Ciceros or Zalewski's Classic Golden Dawn Tarot.The black and white art is detailed, beautiful, and charming, which clicks to many on first sight.Many of the Qabalistic attributions appear on the cards themselves - 72 fold name of God, angel names, Hebrew letters, and more, making the cards full of details. Problem is that errors invariably get in. Some errors were corrected in this version, but a few still remain, such as 7 of Pentacles having the name MTzREL twice, instead of MTzREL & HRChEL. The details assist memory and motivate study, which is a great plus for this deck.The new edition is also printed on better material. My old copy was printed on kind of card board, which soaked water when stored in a bag on a floor flooded by rain water. The new edition is printed on plastic, which can be washed.To follow on two comments by another reviewer. Some quality seems to have been lost in the new edition.

I am not sure why that is. I am not talking about pixelation here I am talking about the actual drawings. Some are excellent, while some look very sloppily drawn.

These mixed and varied symbols allow the reader to draw inspiration from any number of religious schools of thought, the very fact that attracted me to purchase this deck.

Once you have worked with this deck, you will never part with it."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"The pictures are fine and clear but yes some parts are small like hebrew characters but they are easy to make out. The other people probably need glasses. I never owned the other copy or have seen them but these are just fine. I love them.

They are even better than I had hoped!"},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"After now personally handling and working with both the original Hermetic Tarot and the new re-issue thereof, I can say without the slightest hesitation that I am very thankful I only paid $20 for my Hermetic Tarot deck by Dawson.It is replete with excellent symbolism, of that be sure. It's the artwork that isn't very good. Kind of like what you would expect to find in a Graphic Illustration/Rendering 101 class. Very medoicre.If one could just splice together the symbolism of the Hermetic Tarot by Dawson, the symbolism of the Thoth deck by Crowley, with the artistry of the Robin Wood deck,.. Folks we'd have a winner.As it is the Dawson Hermetic Tarot was pricey and vigorously sought after due to a simple case of scarcity. It was an over-inflated legend, now deflated to its correct size.If you can pick up a pack for no more than $20, buy it and learn to use it. In fact, compare it side by side with the Crowley deck - and then color in your own B.O.T.A. deck with what you've learned.And if you really want to know Tarot, study \\"Tarot Symbolism\\" by Robert V. O'Neil, \\"Prophetical Educational and Playing Cards\\" by Mrs. John King Van Rensselaer, \\"The Tarot\\" by C.C. Zain, and \\"The Thursday Night Tarot\\" by Jason C. Lotterhand. Everything else will seem soft-headed in comparison.Gnothi seauton."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"I have read with this deck for many years now it is one of the 2 best decks I have read with.

They are not miscut, or badly aligned, or crappily executed. They are what they are, a reconstruction, according to one person, of an historical deck. They are well-made, and fascinating in their own right. The B&W artwork is singularly easy to grasp at first glance, the connections are clear, the symbolism(s) obvious, straightforward and easy to decipher. I have no complaints at all about this deck, it is lovely. It is what I expected, not the \\"ultimate Tarot deck of All-Time.\\" I can't help but think that \\"someone\\" expected this particular deck to provide answers that weren't forthcoming, and when the same old tired, limited, unwilling-to-work talent got the same pitiful results with this deck as with others, he/she turned bad-mouth and trashed every facet of the experience.

I picked up the energy straight away as I went through the cards prior to their first shuffle. I find mine is a potent deck; it holds many secrets and has many lessons to reveal.I will use this one for in depth study but would be more than willing to use this deck for clients.

I would recommend that anyone wishing to develop their intuition using tarots considers this method."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"This was one of the very first decks I ever bought when I began exploring Tarot. I saw it one day in a locked cabinet with all the others and something about it just called to me and to this day I still don't quite know why but the call is still there. A couple of years ago I gave it to a friend who was in need of a lot of emotional help and she enjoyed it but eventually lost it in a move. At that point I tried to find it again only to find that it was out-of-print. I was terribly upset but moved on. Since then I've had several great decks but none of them have ever worked for me quite as well as this one. I can't say that I've noticed the poor quality that others have brought up as it seems to me to look exactly the same as the last time I saw it, but then again my eyes tend to unfocus a little when I read the cards so I'm probably not the best to judge."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"I own 2 copies of this awesome deck!

I do hope these online shops start carrying in their inventories soon."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"These cards were made in Italy, glazed tarot cards. Very nice, since I ordered with Golden Dawn Tarot - which were made in China without glaze, and really cheap. So the quality really stands out in comparison. I will try to order, made in Italy, cards more frequently.Many levels of meaning to the cards. I frequent this deck on [...] so I was looking forward to getting a deck for meditation and touch. I like the more esoteric elements to the deck. Don't know Hebrew enough, many cards have Hebrew letters, words. And the Hermetic Tarot is really easy to read , since most cards have meaning written on bottom of card. I miss color, since all black and white. I am glad, I added this deck to my collection. Good for more indepth learning, and analysis. The images appeal to me, and the price and shipping was good. I added to other deck order, to get Amazon free shipping deal. I originally started using the Hermetic Tarot because Tarot.com doesn't have, or offer Golden Dawn Tarot, and I couldn't find Golden Dawn Tarot anywhere for a few years now. This Hermetic Deck was the closest I could find. But now, having both decks, this deck offers more info than Golden Dawn, is easier to use. Just, lacks the color visual triggers ."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"The re-printing of this beautiful Tarot deck is utter rubbish. The amazingly intricate drawings of Godfrey Dowson have been blurred and pixilated to an embarrassing degree. Also, the cards themselves were cut irregularly, so no two cards were even uniformly shaped. Seriously, I could go down to Kinkos and make better replications of these cards! In this day and age of technology there is no excuse for blurry pixilation and irregularly cut cards. If you think that you are getting the inspiring original printing of these cards, you will be sadly mistaken.I've contacted U.S. Games Systems and they have ignored me. I tried to warn customers on their site but they didn't post my review. If I were to speculate, I would think that they are trying to retain the inflated value of the original printing by releasing a disgustingly low quality representation in their latest re-printing at the expense of you, the customer. Buyer beware.Update: I have posted two pictures which capture the quality issues I mention; one of the poorly clipped corner and one of flagrant pixelation. Please note that this pixelation is not due to my scanner but is an exact replica of the shoddy quality. In the original printing, these lines were razor sharp and clean. They are now a blurry mess. If someone could post a similar picture of VIII, Fortitude, I would be grateful, just to make sure I didn't get a shoddy deck."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"Many years ago, I was given a reading with this deck. I was frightened and amazed by what I saw. Sheer Magic in its purest form. This is THE occult tarot deck. More so than the Crowley-Thoth. I thought someday I would like a copy of this precious artifact. I guess I waited too long as it is now out of print. What a shame when the folks at U.S. Games have multiple renditions of the Rider-Waite deck for sale, among others that do not hold any interest to me.Maybe it is because of the black and white presentation. It could simply be too scary for many! It is no less dark than others on the current market. I really wish someone else would pick up rights to this masterwork and get it back in publication. Or better yet, how about U.S. Games doing so. They are great at what they do. Except holding back this classic and others.I finally purchased my copy of this deck from the publisher and love it. The LWB presents nothing new here. The deck itself is not ideal for beginners, 12 and older would do best. Astrologically, this system soars! It is also fun to see these images up close. Its possibly the most detailed tarot ever created."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"This deck reminds me of Crowley's. Its black and white drawings are crammed with so much symbolism, it can be overwealming at first. But it all becomes very clear with experience. I use this deck for meditative purposes. The little booklet is a bit sparse on interpretive meanings, check out Wang's book on the Golden Dawn deck."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"\\"The tarot is a mirror of reality. Its construction, based on the four elements, the celestial phenomena, the Holy Qabalah, and a very evolved psychology, can lead its devotees to the inner recesses of psychic and intuitive awareness. The tarot itself can be used as the basis of occult study, as it may be said to possess all aspects of the inner wisdom tradition.\\" - From the Little White BookComplex and stark, the black-and-white images are jam-packed with alchemical, astrological and Qabalistic symbols easily recognized by those familiar with those and other esoteric systems. Revealing many of the workings of the Secret Order of the Golden Dawn, this deck draws heavily upon the work of Mathers, Crowley, Case, Levi and others.The Hermetic Tarot comes with a 70-page LWB, which is thicker than most, which details astrological attributions for the cards and the numerological correlations of the Minor Arcana with the Tree of Life. The LWB also has a handy chart of elemental and astrological glyphs, as well as an illustration of the Tree of Life. However, Hebrew letters rather than actual card names depict the paths on the Tree.Upright and reversed meanings are provided, as well detailed explanations for many of the symbolic components of the cards. The various angels connected with the Minors are given, as are the thirty-six decans of the Zodiac. The astrological placements for the Minors appear in the image proper.Cards measure approximately 4 x 2 inches and although card backings appear fully reversible at first blush, they are not. The elemental symbols for the Courts are placed in the top corners of the cards (e.g. Knight of Cups shows the glyph for Fire then Water for \\"Fire of Water\\"), and follow the ordering of Knight, Queen, King and Princess.For the Majors, the corresponding Hebrew letter and card number are on the top corners, while the elemental/astrological symbols are within the actual image. The titles of all the cards are on the bottom (e.g. Lord of Material Success for the 6 of Pentacles, the Magus of the Voice of Light for The Hermit, Spirit of the Primal Fire for The Last Judgment and so on).The Hermetic Tarot is fascinating to look at, although the crowded nature of the symbols can be a bit overwhelming. In fact, when I gazed upon a group of these cards, I began to get a headache!Inexplicably, a few of the cards appear smudged and pixely, in contrast to the cleaner lines of the rest of the cards. Also unusual is the pronounced uneven trim on the bottom of the Court Cards, which gives them a slight lip (you can see this a bit on the lower-left hand corner of the Queen of Cups image).If you're looking to enhance your magical practice or further your knowledge of Golden Dawn esotericism and Qabalistic associations, this would make a fine deck for your studies. The intricacies of the Hermetic Tarot almost serve as a meditative scrying mirror--and if you enjoy the art of M.C. Escher, you may very well feel an affinity for this deck.I feel that the symbol-laden cards would lend themselves well to small spreads and contemplation. However, it's definitely not a beginner's deck for those wanting to learn the Tarot. In my estimation, the Hermetic Tarot would likely appeal to those who prefer decks like Thoth or the Liber-T, more so than those who are ardent devotees of Rider-Waite-Smith imagery or decks with animated minors.(To see 12 images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)"},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"I must completely agree with the reviewer who commented on the quality of the scans of this deck. In interest of full disclosure, am I not the world's biggest fan of this deck but that being said, US Games has done a terrible disservice to these keys. Although the image quality varies from card to card, the pixelation and fuzzy scans are just inexcusable as they greatly diminish from the art work of the cards themselves. If you really want this deck I would strongly suggest buying an older printing. It's a shame that a deck that has so much to offer would be subject to such poor production values."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"I was really excited when I found this deck on-line. I had the original printing from the 80's and had given it to a friend never to be seen again. The images are fantastic and filled with symbolism. However, this edition was so poorly executed I actually gave the cards away after I received them. The printing was so off on the images it almost looked like the images were out of focus some cards were worse than others but the pixelation was too much for me...Then again the price of the cards was not high. So if you had the original and get this one I feel you may be unsatisfied. If you never had them and want a copy go for it for the price. I'm going to try and find a used copy on line they are not cheap for the original."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"This is an excellent deck for those who wish to study the literature and symbolism of the tarot. In interpretation, it falls between the Waite deck and the Thoth deck. So it is a good choice for people who want to move up from the Waite, but do not care for the Crowley deck's card substitutions (no \\"Lust\\" or \\"Debauch\\" cards) or creepy emanations.These cards are loaded with symbolism, including zodiac and planet signs on the minors. The court cards are marked with elemental signs on the margins. One of these is incorrect, however you can easily correct it with a fine black sharpie pen. If you add your own information or symbols with a black sharpie, the change will blend right in, due to the freehand style of these cards. I suppose you could color them, but I am not yet that ambitious.The LWB contains a tree of life path diagram. However this is the \\"Outer Order\\" diagram given by the Golden Dawn to Neophytes, and therefore has the paths running in the wrong direction. The Inner Order will provide the correct attributions on request.This is a serious, heavy duty tarot deck. Cards are thick and heavily coated. They are stiff and slippery when new, but gradually become easier to handle.This deck was out of print for a few years, so there are quite a few \\"gray market\\" decks out there. The reviewers who complained about quality probably had gotten one of those. Both the legitimate and the gray market cards come in the same box pattern with U.S. Game System Copyrights for 1979 and 2006. The gray market cards have a thin line around the border of the card which may have gaps due to poor reproduction. The legitimate cards with the 2006 copyright do not have this border line.The legitimate cards are of the very highest quality in reproduction and cutting. So if you get a deck that is not perfect, send it back for a replacement."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"About 35% of the cards are sub-par from the originals. I have both new and old decks. The first edition has sharp clean lines on the art, the new edition looks as if the didn't have access to the original art and scanned first edition cards as the master copy. Some of the art is much darker loosing the detail of the pictures.They also changed the size of the card to make it a bit bigger, unfortunately this causes the back of the cards to loose the balanced look of the geometric shapes because they are stretched length wise. This deck will work but its not an equal to the original."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"When I recieved the entire deck and looked through all the illustrations, I felt them to be lacking in comparison to the examples provided online. Maybe I don't know very much about the artist, but I felt the overall art, while I'm sure it was meaningful, to have an immature look to it. I hate to say this, but kind of like the Led Zeppelin Icarus drawing. The drawing style is crude in an unskillful, unintentional way.Say what you want of my critique, but I know that in the art of Tarot you should have a meaningful bond with your cards (and I have plenty of decks myself that share this bond with me) but I never felt it with these."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"This is an excellent deck for many reasons. I would rate it with five stars, had there not been four cards which clearly were not printed correctly. As others have observed, U.S. Games Systems won't be winning any prizes for Quality Assurance...my deck also has an odd \\"cut\\" which leaves an unexpected small \\"ridge\\" atop the cards. I suppose this can be carefully sanded and smoothed, but I've been working with the deck \\"as is\\".I would think some damage had occurred to the master plates for the deck which caused the glaring imperfections appearing on some of the printed cards, except for the fact that there are those people who've written reviews stating that the decks they received showed none of the anomalies I and many others have observed.This is, without question, one of the most beautiful and intricately illustrated decks I've ever encountered. What's more, it is an excellent tool for learning Hermetics and moreover expresses the planetary and zodiacal associations with particular cards and in many cases provides the Hebrew numbers and name translations. The cards reference Kabbalistic elements and in some cases, geomantic patterns. There is a great deal to be gleaned from this deck, as it is not \\"simplified\\" and thoroughly challenges the novice to become well-versed in Hermetics. The other great resource I've found, which requires much more active work and participation, is Franz Bardon's masterpiece \\"Initiation in Hermetics\\".I've come to think of this deck as a form of sophisticated Flash Cards, wherein one must sit and learn to recognize all the information being expressed in each card. I do in fact recommend that one reads the small manual accompanying the deck only *after* they've studied each of the cards and questioned what it is they are seeing. Mastery of Hermetics entails many actions: one must learn self-reliance and pay attention to the details.I've long believed the expression \\"the devil is in the details\\" is one to be taken seriously. Although I do not believe in The Devil, at all...it is just that we are apt to run into problems and frustration when we overlook even some tiny detail and do not have all the facts. Regarding this deck, a mystery one is seeking to unravel may remain a mystery if any part of the card is not acknowledged and understood by the viewer. Mastery of Hermetics also requires mastery of patience and solitary time put to good use. This deck is an excellent tool for practicing meditation and becoming better at looking inward while making accurate connections to outer energies.Thus, it is a stone bummer that in my deck, the \\"Fortitude\\", \\"Seven of Swords\\", \\"Princess of Cups\\" and \\"Two of Pentacles\\" are filled with artifacts and/or blank spots, are printed sufficiently off-center that the right-hand side of a card has a portion of the image cropped. These are the ones which stand out as truly sloppy printing. Much of the rest of the deck lacks real clarity, which is especially noted in the slightly \\"fuzzy\\" look of the Hebrew characters. I study the cards, regardless. I didn't and won't return the deck, as it seems likely I'll get a replacement as bad or worse than the one I've got. Even though the deck is not expensive, this does not mean it deserves slipshod reproduction. Quite the opposite is true when such intricacy of line drawings and so much information resides within the image(s) on each card.I'm considering it might be worth scanning in the cards, doing a bit of cleanup and changing contrast and brightness for each of the cards that is \\"off\\" in some way and reprinting an improved copy of the deck for myself. Although I believe I can see every detail, even on the four really badly reproduced cards, it may be that some things are being obscured and I'm missing something important that is not appropriately visible.My deck has the legend (c) 1979, 2006 US Games Systems, Inc printed along the lower right edge. Does this mean the entire 2006 print run shows errors? As for any complaint about the Master Plates \\"being old\\" or \\"needing replacement\\", this seems implausible. It appears to me that each card was captured in a digital photograph and, because someone did not understand graphics file formats, either chose to export and print JPEG images (well, duh) or exported bitmaps and then resized the bitmap to fit the card surface, which is, politely stated, a no-no.I'll get around to uploading digital images A.S.A.P. At his point I think no one will argue that U.S. Games Systems has screwed up royally and ought not have shipped this \\"run\\" out for public consumption. If this had been defective lettuce, children's toys or the majority of Toyotas, the decks would have been recalled and every purchaser issued and apology and a free replacement deck with cards that look as Godfrey Dowson intended."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"I received my Hermetic Tarot in perfect condition, and in a very very timely shipping manner. I was very pleased."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"I was reading that this deck has all the Alchemist's secrets drawn in it so I bought the deck. The images are wonderful and as I learn more I do think this deck just might have all those secrets."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"Overall a very crude and amateurish deck. If you are interested in hermetic Tarot, the Crowley-Harris deck is truly all you need. This deck, with its clumsy, off-kilter, amateurish art and complete lack of color (and yes, that is important when working with a Tarot deck) is not worth bothering with. There are any number of better Tarots that address hermetic material and concepts. I fail to see why this badly drawn, poorly drafted, confusing deck would attract anyone. The Crowley-Harris deck and the Cicero and Wang decks are still available, and are far superior to this colorless, crude mess."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"This deck was recommended in Donald Michael Kraig'sModern Magick: Eleven Lessons in the High Magickal Arts (Llewellyn's High Magick), and in studying that book I picked it up (it was either this deck, the BOTA deck, or Robert Wang's GD Deck). I'm really glad I did, as it's one of the few decks I own that really helps me learn the different associations of each card. For instance on all the trumps can be found the Hebrew alphabet letter associated with it. The minors you will see the astrological signs worked into the cards image, as well as the names of the two angels associated with it written in Hebrew. The court cards are shown with the two elements at the tops of the cards, and all of the cards have their titles written along the bottom (Magus of Power, Lord of Ruin, etc.)The court cards are a little different in this deck though, and it took me a little while to get used to them. They use the following order, descending from Fire to Earth: Knight, Queen, King, Princess. So Knights are Kings as in the Thoth deck, Queens are the same, Kings is where it gets tricky. Kings are to be read as Princes/Knights, which can be a little confusing at first. If you are a student of the Western Mysteries this can be easily solved by looking at their elemental attributions if you get confused ( King of Wands is Air of Fire). Princesses are the same (some decks known as the Page).The cards themselves are really rich in symbolism, and you'll find that they take nods from several of the GD decks. I'd recommend this deck to anyone interested in Tarot, but especially to those who are studying High Magick."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"Some reviewers had mentioned that some of the images on the cards were blurred and some cards were unevenly cut. The deck that I received does not have those flaws, so perhaps those problems have been rectified since those reviews were written. I had never heard of this deck before and found it by chance while browsing on Amazon. The artwork is very impressive and the symbolism very cleverly woven into the images. It would make an excellent deck for meditation and study."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"This was my first Tarot deck. I was seeking what would be the most accurate or well-constructed deck. But, I had no idea what Tarot was all about, and didn't really know what I should be looking for. The cards are nice and big, with a nice laminate surface. Unfortunately, the art is somewhat pixellated, but I still find them enjoyable to look at. I wish they were colored though. I also really appreciated the little booklet thats included, which gave a short history of the Tarot along with discussing some major Tarot figures (Crowley, Waite, Case). The booklet has a lot of handy information actually, but not to the point where one could master understanding of the deck or even come remotely close. Overall, I would probably not buy this deck a second time, but as I learn the Tarot more I may come to appreciate its artwork more. I think I would recommend to a beginner the B.O.T.A. tarot deck, which is very similar to the Rider-Waite deck, except I think that Case makes a couple valid improvements."},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"wonderful and inspiring deck the art is perfect, the black and white images work wonders. if you buy for art you will love it. informative and just different enough to make you re-examine what you think the cards mean"},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"This black & white Tarot deck is unsurpassed as a study deck or teaching deck. It empowers the reader to make full use of all aspects of interpretation at a glance.The Hermetic Tarot - Qualities of AstrologyThis deck is one of the few that easily reveals the planetary influences at work in a matter, or the overall spread and thus lends itself to shades of meaning relevant to the seeker's own elemental nature and birth sign. Each card is visually identified with corresponding planets, aspects, and elements. These qualities alone improve the student's ability to grasp the possibility of deeper levels of understanding in the book of Tarot ...and to expand the readers' scope of divination.Qualities of Imagery in the Hermetic TarotThe symbolism used is powerful and intricate.... a review of any Major Arcana reveals many influences at work. The imagery in the Hermetic Tarot facilitates study of the Tree of Life and the Cabalistic perspective.The Hebrew letter associated with the Major Arcana is clearly visible on each card. The names of the angels of the decans of the heavens by day and by night are included on all the Minor Arcana. Cabalistic and Hermetic symbols that lead one into deeper understanding of the Tree of Life and the Golden Dawn appear on many Tarot. This is one of the few decks that offers two male and two female images in the Court card, in keeping with the balanced view of reality offered by the Tree of Life model.Quality of Instructional Booklet - the Hermetic TarotWith constant referrals to SEPHIRAH on the Tree of Life, this booklet makes it clear that the study of Tarot is a deeply spiritual process. Terse, yet thorough, each card is clearly described. Reference to the interpretation of the symbols used is clear. Interpretations of the cards are given as \\"Dignified\\" and \\"Ill-dignified\\", which in my opinion is far more freeing to the reader than the standard \\"Reversed\\" interpretations given by so many decks.Reference is made to the Four Worlds, and the Paths of the Tree of Life in the instructional booklet... leading the student to a deeper consideration of the expansive nature of accurate interpretation. The cards are printed on sturdy stock, and have born up well after 3 years of regular use. They are of normal size, which make shuffling easy, and it is easy to determine both suit and number of each.Copyright for this review - Ann George Studios, Inc. - 2000"},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","review":"This is an acceptional tarot deck.

I agree with one reviewer who wrote, &quot;Its ludicrous to expect someone to read 3-4 pages to get to know something simple like modifying feature dimensions or setting references&quot;."},{"Title":"Pro/ENGINEER: Advanced Tutorial Wildfire","review":"This \\"Advanced\\" manual wasn't quite what I'd hoped for. I was looking for instructions on setting up drawing formats (including automated BOMs). While this book had some basic information, there wasn't enough in the book to start from scratch and develop a fully-formed drawing format for several sheet sizes. In particular, the book assumes some system parameters exist by default; however, when running Pro/E without a PLM system (small company, single license), they don't automatically exist, and it isn't obvious how do an end run to compensate for this lack.In thumbing through the book, it looked like it had plenty of other step-by-step walk-throughs which may be helpful in the future, so it's not a loss, just deferred gratification."},{"Title":"Pro/ENGINEER: Advanced Tutorial Wildfire","review":"This is the perfect book to get up to speed with the advanced features of pro eng. I totally disagree with Mr Bruce Lee's comments. Looking at some of the bad reviews of this book, I seriously think that some of these are written to make other books look and sell better.

Don't listen to the negative reviews...this book is a goodun!!"},{"Title":"Pro/ENGINEER: Advanced Tutorial Wildfire","review":"I had used Pro/E version 20 for over 4 years when I switched to Wildfire. This book has greatly helped me find where things are in Wildfire (because they have moved things around so much), as well as learn a few things that I had never done in version 20, such as creating parts in Family Tables, assembly drawings with Repeat Regions and automated BOMs, etc. What I like about the book is that it is very clearly written, and gives you instructions step by step: &quot;click on this&quot;, then &quot;click on that&quot;, and so on. It has example exercises, and lots of graphics and pictures to help you along. Great book!"},{"Title":"The Chase (Jill Lewis Mystery Trilogy #1)","review":"The Chase, by Susan Wales and Robin Shope, was excellent.

You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Chase (Jill Lewis Mystery Trilogy #1)","review":"Engaging suspense and heartwarming intrigue gives The Chase a balanced pace. The characters are believable and real. Jill, the main character, endures real life events that leaves her to make real life choices. I could feel the terror she felt. I could share in the suspicion of everyone around her. Who could she trust? I would not have trusted some of the people she did, and would have trusted others she hadn't. The book plays out in a well organized fashion with plenty of twists that kept me guessing. The unfolding of facts, the emotional roller coaster, and how God played a role in it left me satisfied! I give it two thumbs up! Good job!"},{"Title":"The Chase (Jill Lewis Mystery Trilogy #1)","review":"I've just had the opportunity to read THE CHASE by Susan Wales and RobinShope and I just had to comment. The authors have a real gift for creatingmulti-dimensional characters with heart. I fell in love with the maincharacter, Jill, but I loved all the secondary characters like Miss Corneliaand Jill's Mom and especially Marge at the newspaper...she was a hoot!Jill, the investigative reporter is like so many young women today on thefast track with their careers, leaving time for little else in theirlives...friendships, romance or a relationship with God. When her career issuddenly taken away from her in some shocking and unusual circumstances,Jill Lewis find that she has little else to hang onto. She has no faith topull her through, and just plods through her dire circumstances until shegives up and realizes what is missing in her life. First she fallshopelessly in love with someone who is not available, and then she discoversthings about her family that are devastating, but as we all do her lastresort is to give it up to God. When she gives her life to God, thingsdon't automatically turn around; in fact they get worse, which is often trueof the Christian walk, but she has peace for the first time in her life; acalm assurance that whatever happens next, she can handle it with God'shelp, and she does! I found it very difficult to figure out what was goingto happen next and who the bad guys were, but that's what the kept mereading until I finished the book in two sittings! I highly recommend thisbook, a great thriller, and I must admit that the romance is very guyfriendly. It helped me figure out some things about women I'd not learnedbefore. The ending left me longing for a sequel."},{"Title":"The Chase (Jill Lewis Mystery Trilogy #1)","review":"I just read The Chase: A Novel and I thought it was very,very good.

It was interesting to be able to imagine all this going on in such a lovely town. As I read,I would try to figure out what was going to happen next,but I was always taken by surprise. I also loved the way the authors described, in detail, things like clothes, the house and other items. It made it more enjoybable and I was able to picture them better. I am not a person who likes to reread a book but this one I will enjoy rereading many times."},{"Title":"The Chase (Jill Lewis Mystery Trilogy #1)","review":"I was compelled to read The Chase in two sittings. Because I am familiar with the Lake Geneva and Door County locale, I especially appreciated the descriptions of the settings. I did not feel that Jill was unlikeable; however, I was surprised that she would be ready for a new love after being so recently burned. Pearl was well delineated, always putting a positive face on her life as women of her generation so often did. The adoption ring and Mr. Lewis' involvement in it did not seem like a stretch at all. A recent People magazine article told of just such a scheme. I liked the quotations at the beginning of each chapter. I usually don't read in the Christian romance genre, but I will recommend this book to my friends."},{"Title":"The Chase (Jill Lewis Mystery Trilogy #1)","review":"I love this series on Jill Lewis!

Regrettably, I found it to be everything that gives Christian fiction a bad name: predictable, trite, unrealistic, and patronizing. The story was choppy and lacked any real connection between characters (much less to the reader), and the narrative repeatedly is a convergence of events that shatters any ties to credibility.There are several authors who skillfully synthesize faith and quality story-telling; unfortunately, this book is not in the same league."},{"Title":"The Chase (Jill Lewis Mystery Trilogy #1)","review":"I really enjoyed this storyline.

Lots of these companies, even surprisingly small ones, had uniformed staff in corporate livery. If you looked closely enough, you'd see the carrier's logo (and maybe lots more) on the buttons on those uniforms. That is what this book is about, the buttons. It is profusely illustrated - in fact, it has different listings for the front buttons on a jacket and the smaller cuff buttons on that same uniform. That's how thorough this book is, and it's just as thorough about each company, it corporate mergers, acquisitions, and more, and about the company's changes in uniforms through the years. It documents not just the buttons, but the rise and corporate fall of the carriers that used those buttons.Amazon does not carry this book, just because of some labeling issues. It is still available from its self-publisher, though.

However, six months into daily practice, I did want to learn a bit more about how Buddhism goes about attributing so much importance to \\"just breathing.\\" Rosenberg's book is just the ticket: straightforward basics in the context of different kinds of Buddhism, with beautiful writing, a bit of humor, and not even a hint of arrogance or strident tone. Organization around the Anapanasati Sutra, the Buddha's own instructions about breath to meditators, gives a particularly authentic quality. Now, if there were just one more thing: a Kindle version! My plan is to re-read this book and Full Catastrophe... every year or two."},{"Title":"Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation","review":"What I liked most about this book is that it explained meditation in light of an explication of sutras.

Rosenberg's approach to meditation and Buddhism comes without the baggage of superstition and folklore that attach themselves to some books on these topics. Rosenberg offers not only basic instruction, but a path for advancing one's practice through the various contemplative steps beyond that, using the anapanasati sutra. I also love the fact that his background is from the East Coast of the U.S., and Jewish. I get a little tired of the condescending attitude toward Westerners from some of the more traditional Eastern authors and teachers. Rosenberg doesn't have a built-in cultural bias toward the East, and is clearly an experienced, dedicated and wise teacher with a sense of humor. I'm usually too cheap to buy the hard-back version of any book (sorry, Amazon), but this one's hard-back, and I'm glad for it because it's a keeper."},{"Title":"Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation","review":"The Anapanasati Sutra is the simplest of the several teachings of the Buddha on mindfulness and meditation. In many ways it is the very basis of the Vapassana tradition and the core of Insight Meditation. Mr. Rosenberg does not get carried away with this teaching, but approaches the sutra in a traditional manner. Of the many meditation books I have read, including better known Insight Meditation books, this is the easiest to understand and follow. Mr. Rosenberg is a very experienced teacher of this approach to meditation and the book shows it.This was the only Dharma book I took on a self-guided meditation retreat last winter. I am now on my third reading of it and I am finding it as helpful now as the first time. If you are interested in a basic approach to Insight Meditation and a clear description of the Buddha's most elementary teaching on meditation, this is for you. I give this my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation","review":"This is an excellent introductory book for any meditation student, but it particularly well suited to a serious beginner.The book is targeted to a Western audience and presents the essential concepts of Insight Meditation using the Apapanasati Sutra and the practices of the Theravada tradition as a framework.I feel this book goes into more depth than most popular books on the subject, but it is still very readable and contains a wealth of information. It is also contains essential Pali definitions without getting bogged down in too many Pali terms or esoteric language. He is also very clear in his explanations and complete in terms of presenting the important concepts.For an even deeper dive, try Mindfulness with Breathing by Buddhadasa Bhikku. This is a more difficult read, but well worth the effort. In fact, Larry Rosenberg based a lot of his book on his contact with this meditation master and he references him in his bibliography. Rosenberg also wrote the forward to Mindfulness with Breathing. In short, I think both books are complimentary and together form a comprehensive introduction."},{"Title":"Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation","review":"Insight (Mindfulness) Meditation - the Vipassana Meditation of Theravada Buddhism - can change your life whether you are Buddhist or not, and this is one of three books that can take you there. To get acquainted with this excellent meditation method and for lots of inspiration to try it, start with \\"Wherever You Go, There You Are\\" by Jon Kabat-Zinn. Then, to learn more about just how to do it, move on to \\"Mindfulness in Plain English\\" by Henepola Gunaratana. Now you're ready for the Big Leagues of Mindfulness - Larry Rosenberg's outstanding book, \\"Breath by Breath: the Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation\\". He takes the potentially complex topic of how to do this meditation just as the Buddha taught it, and explains the entire Anapanasati (Mindfulness with Breathing) method in a way that Westerners can understand and relate to.I've practiced Insight Meditation for more than a decade, and have accumulated a pretty good library of books on Buddhism and on Meditation.

He understands meditation to be a whole life activity, a way to understand being a human -- the way to make sense out of our lives.

Now more students can benifit from his wisdom."},{"Title":"Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation","review":"Much impressed by the technical (and I mean that as a complement) detail. So many meditation books are wishy-washy. This is not. It is experiential and practical.

Does the word \\"meditation\\" conjure images of bald (or dreadlocked) dudes in robes sitting in a remote mountain temple, pondering wisely? Well, it's actually something that YOU can do in your daily clothes walking down the street, in your gym clothes working out, wherever and whenever. And the point is not deep thought, nor blocking thought, but experiencing reality and living in the moment. It's about recognizing your personal filters and biases, then letting them fade away so that you can see the truth.

(learning how to harness stream of consciousness, imagination/visualisation etc etc). the kingdom of god is like a baby seed that becomes a little sapling and then and then on it grows. you will find that one thing leads to another, but ultimately to uncover who you are you will need to rely on yourself and not be confused by other people. every snow-flake is unique and has its own unique route to the earth/attainment. you are all snow-flakes, but you just dont see this yet, or do not have enough experience/conviction to know this.as a digression... what is suchness? put in circular terms suchness is: As is ness, thusness. things just are, what is is what is. 'is' is is. this view is the ultimate 'relative' statement... it indicates that all truth is relative. everyone has their own truth. on the other hand it can be said to be the ultimate 'objective' statement. this 'is' objective reality. is it emptiness?, is it form? actually... no. it just is. this can seem to be the ultimate buddhist statement. that all knowledge is beyond conceptualising, beyond formulation. as is ness is just as things are. this is the water approach, which levels all theories. it is empty of knowledge in knowing much. suchness is the water of the moon. female womb, sometimes empty, sometimes full. rising and falling, rising and falling. bringing with it peace. (but... do not become attached to suchness! without speculation/conceptualization, we will not see where we are walking, nor will we see what thing matters most, mistakenly believing all things to be of equal importance).what is absolute truth? if you seek the truth you will find it, generally speaking truth is 'understanding'. but, actually only true love/loving kindness is the absolute truth, and only this truly understands, if i/you do not know true love, then i/you do not know God, however there are lesser, though still objective truths. truth can be seen as what is... reality, taste and see. everything that 'is' has its roots in the one absolute truth, which is true love. the truth is true love, without love there cannot be understanding (truth). love is the truth, and this should gear our entire understanding of reality. even 'this'(consciousness) has its roots in ineffable true love/loving kindness. in the christian faith, we believe that what we seek is what we find. if we seek relative truths in accordance with suchness then we shall find them... like-wise, if we seek absolute objective truth, eventually we will find perfect love. true love is the ultimate seed and root of all, of essence (existence/is) itself. love is the fire of the sun.bringing with it warmth. the light of the sun, penetrates the darkness of the moon. rising and falling, rising and falling, a child is born.some feel that knowledge is helpful... well yes and no. yes if that knowledge is truth/understanding. however no, very often, and this is since much of what people know leads them away from the ultimate truth... and so i say, it is not ignorance that matters, nor is it knowledge (which puffeth up). what matters is truth/understanding. And anything that engenders true love is in accord with God. \\"he that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love\\". \\"he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.\\" \\"everyone that loveth is born of God\\"(born anew, spiritually). knowledge is not sufficient, we must not forget the heart, seat of emotions.the buddha realised that without the anchor of true love/loving kindness, one becomes a nihilist... and you only need see their actions and crippled emotions to realise how unsatisfying nihilism is. (freedom of mind is not everything).this is also why certain types of philosophy are utterly unsatisfying. theyve ripped their hearts out.larry may have given more than he ever realises, this man is a true master.true love/chesed, snow-flake. xxxblessing/prayer: may all of us who read this, including myself, see the ultimate truth, loving kindness and become it and be it/him/her, by the grace of the one truth, loving kindness. amen."},{"Title":"Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation","review":"Larry Rosenberg has given us a book which combines his humor with profound seriousness. He uses an older Buddhist teaching on specific contemplations which are joined with mindfulness of the breath. However, don't expect a book which operates on the \\"meditation is cool and relaxing\\" premise. This is definitely written for a committed meditator, or one who is ready to take the next step in his practice, and go beyond \\"meditation to feel good\\". Yet, the by-product of following the practice and become more awake is certainly deeper serenity. This is a great book to help you with the ups and downs that occur as your meditation and life practice deepen. He takes each of the 16 contemplations, such \\"aware of the body, breathing in, aware of the body breathing out\\" and gently lays the foundation for incorporating each of them into your practice. If you enjoy the Vipasanna approach, I would really give Larry Rosenberg a read. His approach is friendly, down to earth, relevant to your meditation and no holds barred."},{"Title":"Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation","review":"Beginners often have a hard time establishing meditation and mindfulness as a practice, not just something they read about. For this, there are better books than Breath by Breath, which is a bit longwinded and unfocused. For an excellent Theravaden introduction, I suggest \\"Mindfulness in Plain English\\" instead. Its explanations are clearer and more motivating toward actually sitting. An excellent Tibetan introduction is \\"Joy of Living,\\" also extremely clear and motivating. Reading perspectives from two traditions can be eye opening.In addition, I've found that reading a Western treatment of mindfulness has helped my understanding and practice. \\"Calming Your Anxious Mind\\" outlines a serious program of meditation and mindfulness, completely compatible with Buddhism, lucidly written by a down-to-earth, practicing MD."},{"Title":"Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation","review":"This book really inspired my meditation- it simplified all the baggage I had acquired from a lot of other reading about Buddhism. No mysticism, no dogmatism, no exoticism, just a practical breakdown of what happpens as you practice. It made me realize that meditation is not about some later enlightenment experience, but about the experiences you are having now- that understanding made meditation much less of a labour."},{"Title":"Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation","review":"This book details the 16 Contemplations of the Anapanasati Sutra of the Theravada tradition and is the \\"uncompromising embodiment of that understanding in the domain of ordinary living in the secular world...This text constitutes the basic meditative instructions of the Buddha, and so serves as a fundamental vehicle for gaining insight into the core teachings of Buddhism.\\" (Forward pg 9). The awareness of breathing can be used to embrace both Samatha and vipassana meditation and its importance towards a complete practice cannot be underestimated.I personally use the breath as a point of concentration for my own meditations. I chose this book to enhance my understanding and knowledge; I was not disappointed, quite the contrary. Larry Rosenberg has great wisdom drawn from decades of experience. The list of teachers that Larry has sat under is equally impressive I.e. J. krishnamurti, Korean master Seung Sahn and Japanese master Katagiri Roshi etc. I was also encouraged by the information regarding the meditation retreats that Larry talked of; this included retreats that extended many months. Coupled with this were the insights into the many pitfalls that can accompany meditation. Larry's personal experiences and \`Zen stories' gave an added flavour and enjoyment to reading this book.I was happy to see that Larry provided a two-step version of the sutra's 16-step practice. My mind tends to like things condensed, probably because I live in the west and tend to input too much and then forget things. I'll keep Larry's book on my book shelf in that it not only provides the two step version but also summarises the 16-steps (Pgs 7 & 8) and the \`4 foundations of mindfulness' towards the \`7 factors of awakening' on pages 202-207.I studied Buddhism through a Gnostic instructor. Insightful for me was reading information regarding the \`ego' in Larry's book. \\"The ego gets frightened because there is no place for ego in it.\\" (Pg 110). Anatta \\"there is no self that gets enlightened\\" (pg 121). \\"...cessation is not annihilation\\". (Pg144). \\"...often our problems are not so much solved in this practice but dissolved.\\" (Pg 146). \\"In the sixteenth, that last vestige of self disappears and there is just the seeing. You relinquish any trace of ownership and give up any clinging whatsoever, even to the practice itself.\\" (Pg 147). The tip of an iceberg, there has to be a certain level of understanding to appreciate what I am trying to convey here. Equally insightful was the information given on \`Breathing into Silence' Chapter 7; this is only attained via direct experience and obviously cannot be fully comprehended otherwise.I was happy to find that Larry Rosenberg included the Buddhist \`5 precepts for right living' (Pg 173) with his book. This fits in with my understanding that morals and ethics are a fundamental necessity on any inclining path of spirituality. All in all, this is an excellent book for those new to, and for those seasoned in the art of meditation; a highly recommended book to read. For those wishing further references of study, Larry provides the following works, 'Mindfulness with Breathing' by Buddhadasa Bhikku and 'Breathe, You Are Alive' by Thich Nhat Hanh, both of which I intend to read."},{"Title":"Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation","review":"Very good book on vipassana practice and how to do it. Rosenberg writing style is very good and his simple and clear explanations of complex or confusing ideas is most helpful. One of the best books I've read on buddhism or meditation. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation","review":"Having read this book in February of the year 2000 what I found was that the actual meditation or meditations here were way too abstract and verbal for any immediate or practical purpose.I wanted a book that would teach a meditator wanna-be like myself to meditate in one clear, distinct session. Larry Rosenberg and the book claim that this book's purpose is to provide for a series of meditations, but if so, it's aimed at someone more seasoned in meditation practice than myself, a real beginner.However, I found the book is a wonderful and profound overview of Buddhist meditation practice. Larry Rosenberg writes on page 94: \\"You can talk about it all you want, but what it comes to is observing your mind in this moment.\\" He writes, \\"it's helpful to remind ourselves that what we are discussing is blue-collar work.\\"Larry Rosenberg also draws a comparison between fire and anger, the imagery being so distinct and clarifying that I began to recall several dreams from my past in which big fires show up in the school or in the workplace, pressure-cooker situations for the creation of anger.Larry Rosenberg talks in this book of how so many objects of our desire really are only made of plastic after all. He writes about the value of silence while remarking on how little of it actually is available in our society today. He writes about our distractions as manifestations of \\"doggy mind\\" whereas what we want to have, at least while meditating, is \\"lion mind.\\"Finally, a sweeping insight was provided when he noted how repetitive our lives actually are, making Gertrude Stein's thousand-page book, \\"The Making of Americans,\\" which itself is already quite repetitious, seem merely like the eye of a needle in comparison to the reality of so much repetition in our lives.Larry Rosenberg tells his readers that the words (about meditation) are not the experience, and he's right. However, since he does goes on and on to tell about the limitations of the ego experience, on and on about how vain, greedy and mean our egos are, it becomes very easy for the mind to begin to absorb Buddhist philosophy by pretense and become saddled by his criticism and his analysis and judgments -- as if one \\"knows\\" verbally how vain, greedy and mean life can be and how false one's own ego is. It all becomes too heavy, serious, full of gravitas. Larry Rosenberg helps the ego to \\"know\\" without full, direct observational experience as such.This book bears down so heavily on the ego that I felt myself at one point suffocating from the absence of lightness or levity. Yes, my own ego was taking itself very seriously. But Larry Rosenberg's book was not helping me! I found myself having to try a different sort of meditation in order to shift my mind-state away from the ponderous insight of my meaningless ego!"},{"Title":"Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation","review":"Breath by Breath is an outstanding and seamless synthesis of interventions and talks that Rosenberg held about the Buddhist sutra (i.e., text) on the 'awareness on breathing' during his thirty-year teaching experience at Vipassana retreats and courses. Rosenberg style is plain and direct and his personal anecdotes make this fundamental teaching even more vivid and present for both beginners and expert practitioners. Clear links to other relevant Buddhist teachings make this text a good introduction to the Dhamma (Theravada tradition), as well.All things considered, one of best introductions to the matter, a book that sheds a contemporary and western perspective on an universal and antique wisdom by focussing more on the main concepts and underlying rationales of Buddhist mindfulness practice and breath awareness (and its consequences on any personal life) than on some particular technique or method."},{"Title":"Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation","review":"I've been practicing insight meditation for almost 2 years now, and I've read many books about Buddhism and meditation.When I bought this book, I was a bit skeptical, but as I read on I realized that Larry Rosenberg is a man of immense wisdom and experience, with an excellent ability to relate his insights in a clear and comprehensive manner. Larry Rosenberg addresses many pitfalls that meditators may and will encounter at any point in their practice with encouraging advice and guidance. He uses many examples from his own life to illustrate aspects of the practice, and also has an entire chapter dedicated to practice throughout one's daily life that I found to be very pragmatic and helpful.All in all, though I've read books like this before, I found Breath by Breath to contain a wealth of concise, easily understood advice for Insight (or Vipassana) meditation, and to be very inspiring."},{"Title":"Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation","review":"Engaging the reader into the depths of meditation is not easy. Breath by Breath is an in-depth look into meditation that succeeds in doing just that. It is a translation and commentary on one of the Buddha's core teachings, the Anapanasati Sutra.Like all of the Buddha's teachings, the Anapanasati Sutra is a path to liberation from suffering. The Buddha gives clear instructions, a detailed map, of how to get there through sixteen contemplations. They are grouped into four tetrads. The first four are about the awareness of the breath as experienced in the body. The second four direct the awareness to feelings as perceived by the sense organs. The third set focuses awareness on mental formations and the content of the mind. The last is \\"pure vipassana, seeing into the lawfulness underlying all phenomena.\\" The contemplations are held by the constant awareness of the breath, the in-breath and the out-breath.We are all breathing. The instruction is just to know that we are, not in an intellectual sense, but to be aware of the simple sensation, the in-breath and the out-breath. Even in this first instruction, we are learning something extremely important: to allow the breathing to follow its own nature, to breathe itself. We are not trying to make the breath deep or keep it shallow. We are seeing how it is.This is how the author guides you, one contemplation after another. The commentary is lengthy, conversational, and includes the author's personal experiences. Each contemplation is explained in context and detail, often with anecdotes and humor. There are suggestions for practice. The book plays the role of an important guide to practice, whether it is a \\"yogic practice\\" or a \\"Buddhist practice\\". As meditation develops, the initial distinctions and labels disappear. To one who is thirsty, the semantics are irrelevant. Quenching the thirst is the only relevance.There are many striking commonalities in the structure of the Anapanasati Sutra and Satynanada Yoga Nidra.In yoga, the breath is critical as seen in pranayama. It is through conscious breathing that the process of meditation begins. In these Buddhist practices, there is constant awareness of the in-breath and out-breath. Both require the awareness to be attentive, the attitude of being a witness. They are guided meditations that release past experiences or samskaras. Freedom from past experiences follows a very similar structure: tensions in body, emotions, and mind must be released before insight is possible.A major difference is that breath awareness is not constantly held in Yoga Nidra. Just the witnessing awareness, mindfulness, is held after a certain point. But both practices are rooted in the same pool and over time arrive at a similar state. Who watches, or is mindful of the breath? Who is mindful of mindfulness?No matter what you practice, the encounters and experiences are universal. The commentary is immensely useful for everyone. Meditation starts out as a form self-therapy through catharsis. No matter what \\"style\\" is practiced, meditation happens a single breath at a time. No one can breath more than one breath or live more than a single moment at a time.Breath by Breath invites us to linger and revisit frequently."},{"Title":"Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation","review":"This is an excellent book for beginner or advanced practitioners of meditation. It is both an informative and inspiring presentation of one of the major Buddhist sutras. (One does not have to be Buddhist -- I am not -- to benefit from the concepts presented in this work.) The chapters advance us through the \\"Anapanasati Sutra\\" explaining each part, while reminding us all along the way that meditation is not an academic exercise. Readers are encouraged to begin meditation practice from the very outset and this book is about helping us do it.The authors write in a highly engaging style. The writing is interesting, honest, often humorous, and full of examples to bring clarity and meaning to the concepts. I have read this book twice, cover to cover, and I'm continually dipping into it for inspiration. On days when I have trouble settling myself into meditation, I begin by picking up this book until I am able to sit with my breath. The authors' words are a great encouragement. Larry Rosenberg is an experienced Buddhist who has been trained by some of the world's renowned teachers; yet he is able to skillfully write for the lay person.Roxie Smith"},{"Title":"Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation","review":"Larry Rosenberg presents this seemingly simple practice in a very clear and inspiring way.

Other reviewers have clearly described the excellent qualities of the book. I only wanted to add that Larry succeeds in clearly laying out the path that one is on having made a commitment to practice insight meditation.The book is very readable and inspiring in so far as he lays out what one can expect if one is prepared to put in the time on the cushion. There is no promise of instant gratification but an assurance that this is worth pursuing and that patient application is all that is really needed.Since reading the book I find that I am more accepting of my \\"monkey mind\\" and much more patient when my mind refuses to be tamed. I am already able to sit for longer and feeling happy with my practice just based on the wise guidance I have gleaned from the book."},{"Title":"Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation","review":"My two cents worth: Read this book and see for yourself.There's a lot here and much of its content will require re-reading and further contemplation. For example, for me, the concept of \\"no self\\" is puzzling, but at the same time kinda makes sense.One writing technique the author uses that I found interesting and enjoyable was to introduce each of his teachers as his first one. Initially I had to do a double take and re-read earlier chapter sections to make sure what I was reading was correct. This technique parallels meditation practice; in a sense every breath is our first breath because we are taking it at this unique moment which has never existed before.There is much depth to this book. Be good to yourself and read this book."},{"Title":"Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation","review":"this book is terrific. i strongly suggest any beginner or seasoned veteran give it a read.

I FOUND HER LIFE VERY INTERESTING. I REMEMBERED HER FROM MY CHILDHOOD WATCHING WHATS MY LINE."},{"Title":"Kilgallen","review":". . . That point being the last chapter. Israel (author of the definitive Tallulah Bankhead biography) writes an incisive, well-researched and sympathetic book about journalist Kilgallen, who was often unfairly dismissed as a narrow-minded harpy. Fascinating stuff, and well-written, till Israel goes off the deep end in the last chapter and concocts all kinds of hare-brained murder scenarios (evidence indicates Kilgallen accidentally OD'd or perhaps commited suicide). Israel's dependence on Kennedy assassination buff Mark Lane explains some of this goofiness. But this should not overly detract from a wonderful book about an important cultural figure."},{"Title":"Kilgallen","review":"I encourage people to buy a hardback copy of this 25 - year - old book because I have seen two pieces of evidence that make the Dorothy Kilgallen murder theory plausible. First I'll ramble on for a few paragraphs, then I'll describe those two pieces of evidence.Of course, we don't have evidence that the &quot;accidental&quot; death of any celebrity really was murder. I believe Princess Diana was murdered, but I also believe that we will never get evidence of it. Dodi Fayed's father is chasing his tail.So posterity needs to evaluate each mysterious death according to how plausible the murder theory is. Lee Israel puts in this book some evidence that a broken love affair with Johnnie Ray and the fall of the Hearst newspaper empire gave Dorothy Kilgallen trouble sleeping, and she *could have* mixed barbiturates with booze. But Lee also details the strange circumstances of Dorothy's death. Police and medical examiner reports say her body was found in a bed in which she never slept. Nobody slept in it. It was a showroom to convince celebrity houseguests who partied in the next room that everything was hunky dory in the 25 - year marriage of Dorothy and her husband Richard Kollmar.There was no pill bottle on the bedside table or anywhere else in the death scene. Dorothy had fallen &quot;asleep&quot; while reading a new novel by Robert Ruark, even though she had said in her newspaper column four months earlier that the protagonist of the book dies in the end. She had discussed said novel with her hairdresser Marc Sinclaire some weeks before cops and doctors found the book in her dead hand. She had told Mr. Sinclaire that she had enjoyed the work after having finished reading it.That's what you will find in this book. Now I'll add the two things I've seen while sight seeing. First, you can find Dorothy Kilgallen's death certificate at the National Archives in Maryland, a popular tourist site. In the section where the doctor makes the classification of natural causes, suicide, homicide, etc., the thing says &quot;undetermined pending further investigation.&quot; Strangely, the deputy medical examiner of Brooklyn signed it &quot;for James Luke,&quot; the chief medical examiner. Kilgallen died in the borough of Manhattan, and Dr. Luke had no reason not to sign it. He visited the death scene for 45 minutes, according to the Washington Post obituary. That Brooklyn deputy M.E., Dominick Di Maio, is still alive.The second thing I've seen that's not in the book is a video interview with criminal defense attorney Joe Tonahill preserved at Lamar University in Texas. On it he says his last telephone conversation with Dorothy Kilgallen happened a short time before she died, &quot;maybe a week before.&quot; They planned to participate in a radio talk show about the JFK assassination, but she died before the plans could materialize. Shortly before that conversation, Dorothy visited Miami to discuss Oswald, etc. on the talk show of a young Larry King. The same Larry now on CNN.You won't find the death certificate or the Tonahill video interview in this book, but what it does have will hold you spellbound. Please buy it even if you pay 50 dollars."},{"Title":"Kilgallen","review":"Even though she seems to be remembered as just a gossip columnist, DK knew many important persons and reported on their comings and goings at a time before we were &quot;blessed&quot; with E and other similar cable channels. Catch her on the What's My Line?&quot; reruns and you'll see her charm, wit, and catch many bon mots traded with her cohorts."},{"Title":"Kilgallen","review":"The previous reviewer, Mr. Nolen, wrote:\\"That Brooklyn deputy M.E., Dominick Di Maio, is still alive.\\"[Dr. Di Maio signed Dorothy Kilgallen's death certificate even though she died in the borough of Manhattan. That's one of many mysteries surrounding her death that might have something to do with Kennedy's assassination.]I'd like to add that not only is Dominick still alive, but a book he co-authored with his son Vincent, also a medical examiner, is still in print three years after its publication.The title is \\"Forensic Pathology, Second Edition.\\"I can't really fault Lee Israel, author of the Kilgallen biography that I'm reviewing here, for not interviewing Dr. Dominick DiMaio. She had a tough job. Her publisher couldn't have advanced her all that much money because the market for biographies of female journalists was small in 1975 when she got the job. Stuff about Kilgallen's journalistic colleagues Theo Wilson, Clare Boothe Luce and Dickey Chappelle didn't come out until long after 1975.While Ms. Israel's access to Dorothy Kilgallen's mortal remains was limited, she did a great job of communicating with the living. Newspaper colleagues and criminal defense attorneys opened up to Ms. Israel. In the book you will get fascinating stories of the demure, beautifully dressed Kilgallen doing her job in male - dominated courtrooms. I particularly enjoyed one man's description of Kilgallen: \\"She's a newspaperman in a 500 dollar dress.\\"Lee Israel also did a great job of documenting Kilgallen's love affair with pop singer Johnnie Ray that the Beautiful People of New York witnessed starting in 1957. Lee interviewed Johnnie in his home in 1976. She respected his privacy. Who cares what he did when Dorothy was busy covering a murder trial?Dorothy Kilgallen and Johnnie Ray were an unlikely match in the Eisenhower era. It's wrong to judge this man based on what he said at press conferences. Back then record company executives and TV producers ordered celebrities to say nice simple things. Let's just say Johnnie's public persona and Dorothy's public persona were out of synch in 1957. He came across as a passionate gentle boy from a farm below a cloudy sky. Her image was that of a pushy reporter demanding to know what a total stranger did for a living or why a rich doctor would cheat on his wife with a tramp at 10 Downing Street in London or with a stripper in Dallas, Texas or what have you.Lee Israel proves these two public figures loved each other nonetheless. Johnnie was permanently traumatized by Dorothy's death. Lee wisely avoids speculating why. Only they knew."},{"Title":"Kilgallen","review":"Upon reading this book I came to find a few facts for myself. First, Ms. Kilgallen was quite fond of \\"stirring the proverbial pot\\" back in a day when such stirring was hardly acceptable. For this she should be rendered a pioneer of such journalistic endeavors, not the wicked stepdaughter she is, sadly, left to memory. In truth, this book reveals a tough-as-nails reporter that was vying ever-diligently to live up to her father's name and image while carving her own niche.At a time when women were scarcely known to venture out of the home, Dorothy Kilgallen was honing skills as a writer and reporter, covering such events as the Sam Shepard trial and Grace Kelly's regal wedding and hosting her own \\"Voice of Broadway\\" column for many years in New York City. More than a TV personality and columnist, she was an icon to many an aspiring writer of both sexes; the shame of ti is that no one seems to pay her such a compliment. She was to females of the journalistic world what Deborah Harry and Madonna were and are for women in music - an innovator who kicked open doors and let her talent and drive lead her to unimagined and wondrous heights.One gets a deep glimpse into her private life, which, as \\"friend\\" Johnny Ray oft said, is where the real Dorothy Kilgallen emerges as a soft, loving and emotionally-fragile woman searching for the perfect life in a sea of imperfectness. Further, she seems the type of woman you'd like to love and shield from the world, a far cry from her icy persona on \\"What's My Line?\\". The book makes use of her seemingly-perfect marriage by exposing it for what it really was: a fairy tale with a sorrowed span. The famous feuds with Sinatra, Paar, Gardner, a bevy of journalists and writers alike are also touched upon, as is the infamous Jack Ruby interview and her untimely death, making this not only an interesting read but essential one to find the real Dorothy. Trust me, she was worth \\"meeting\\".I've seen it said that Lee Israel's diction is often overpowering, inducing a difficult read, though I don't see it that way. While some phrases and words definitely left my general scope in spots it did little to ruin an otherwise terrific reading experience. I feel it's certainly worth your money and time.Dorothy Kilgallen may have been a lot of things, good and bad, to a great many persons through her life, but one thing's certain - she was far more interesting inside and out rather than simply the latter."},{"Title":"Kilgallen","review":"I'd like to echo praise of the book. I like it for the same reasons as the other reviewers. Mr. Nolen, you are right on target except for your identification of Dr. James Luke. When the NYC medical examiner's office handled Dorothy Kilgallen in 1965, Dr. Luke was associate ME, not chief ME.But you are right about the strangeness of her death certificate. Why would Dr. Luke ask the man in charge of Brooklyn deaths to sign out a Manhattan death as \\"undetermined pending further investigation ?\\" Dr. Luke hardly had the day off. He visited Kilgallen's house while her body was still there.Lee Israel did a great job investigating this by herself. When Anthony Summers investigated Marilyn Monroe several years later, he had the help of the BBC and the entire staff of \\"20/20\\" including the legmen for Barbara Walters and Geraldo Rivera. But Lee Israel worked almost entirely alone. She did such a great job that her text makes me sad that nobody picked up where she left off.In 2006 Dominick Dunne is reviving the Kilgallen mystery in the April issue, but he's saying it's too late to know more than Lee. He says too many sources are dead. I hope he's wrong. Dominick is a great guy but he forgets that any of us can query his old friend Phyllis McGuire. I do thank you, Mr. Dunne, for showing Lee Israel's hard work to a new generation of young people. I mean that *sincerely* the way the McGuire Sisters expressed it in 1955.It is likely that Dominick Dunne has never met Dr. James Luke. The good doctor probably never heard of Mr. Dunne's erstwhile company Four Star Pictures that he ran in the 1960s and 70s. Dr. Luke, who worked in Oklahoma for much of that period, lives today.Also still alive are Dr. DiMaio (that Brooklyn deputy ME), Ms. McGuire and retired NYPD detective Jack Doyle along with God - knows - who - else. I hardly expect Mr. Dunne to investigate how much power and privilege they have in 2006, but I do thank him and I do thank Lee Israel."},{"Title":"Kilgallen","review":"Lee Israel did a one-woman investigation into the life and death of columnist Dorothy Kilgallen, and found some extremely interesting bits of information. Every answer seemed to raise two more questions, however, and like many other mysterious deaths in the entertainment community, I suspect that this one will also go unsolved. I'd love for someone to pick up where Lee Israel left off and see if there's more that can be uncovered now that there are few identities to protect. Who was the \\"Out of Towner,\\" for instance? The only family member who would cooperate with her was Kilgallen's younger son, and that was because he was so small when she died that he wanted to know more about his mother. Kilgallen's father, sisters and other children were still alive at the writing of this book, but declined to participate.Having only ever seen Dorothy Kilgallen on What's My Line? and having never read any of her columns, I was fascinated by her investigations into the JFK assassination, and not terribly surprised that she was found dead when she was getting too close for comfort for those who had something to hide. She is one of many who have gotten too close to the truth about the JFK assassination, and the price she paid is not an unusual one."},{"Title":"Kilgallen","review":"I really can't add anything to what the other readers (who liked this book) have written, suffice it to say that I found it fascinating, detailed, and not at all sensational. Ms. Israel is a fantastic writer and her comments, conclusions, and questions are all those of a very bright, inquisitive, and determined woman. To be honest, toward the end, the story started making me uneasy. Ms. Israel described Dorothy's five-story townhouse as, \\"...that house of lies, and pills, and darkness, where power could buy cover and get more than it paid for, where an overdose was an assumed eventuality.\\" Actually the uneasy feeling creeps up on you, and you're not aware of it until you're well entrenched in the story. Something, clearly, happened to Dorothy that has never seen the light of day. If you doubt me, read the book. All her papers re the Kennedy assassination... gone. Where? How? We don't know. All the papers in the police report... gone. A lot of hemming and hawing when Israel tries to pin people down. Then there's the \\"Out-of-towner,\\" whom Israel does not name but who apparently had some sort of part/knowledge in the circumstances under which Dorothy really died. Clearly, it wasn't suicide."},{"Title":"Kilgallen","review":"This is a Kitty Kellyesque biography of one of the more troubled celebrities of the 20th century. I am a huge \\"What's My Line\\" fan and have read bios/memoirs of Bennett Cerf, Fred Allen and Arlene Francis. This pretty much completes the quartet since nothing is available on John Charles Daly. The book provides detail on the professional triumphs and the personal problems. Both were so much a part of the Dorothy Kilgallen story. It certainly discusses her untimely death in 1965 and the on-going controversy surrounding it 4 and half decades later. It's an interesting look behind the curtain of New York cafe society from the 1930's to the 60's."},{"Title":"Kilgallen","review":"This is an interesting and informative book about Dorothy Kilgallen's life and gives a good flavor for the times in which she lived. The author's writing style leaves something to be desired, as it detracts from the information she is conveying to the reader. Two excerpts: \\". . . her breasts seemed finally to be self-governing.\\" And \\"Her tart and contumelious views were not noticeably affected . . . \\" The language is somewhat affected as well. Nonethless, I would recommend the book to anyone specifically interested in Dorothy Kilgallen. Another author might have been able to provide a more modern perspective and, thus, more insight into the life of this very intesting woman who was full of contradictions."},{"Title":"Kilgallen","review":"The Kilgallen case is similiar to the case of Marilyn Monroe. In the case of Ms. Monroe:*********** The toxicology report showed high levels of Nembutal (38-66 capsules) and Chloral Hydrate (14-23 tablets) in Monroe's blood.* Police noted that the bedside table had numerous pill bottles but the room contained no glass to wash down the pills and the water was turned off. (no, that's not suspicious!)* The pathologist Dr. Thomas Noguchi could find no trace of capsules, powder or the typical discoloration caused by Nembutal in Monroe's stomach or intestines, indicating the drugs that killed her had not been swallowed.* Monroe was found lying face down but lividity on her back and the posterior of her arms and legs indicated she had died lying on her back.* Eunice Murray, Monroe's housekeeper, claimed that she couldn't open Monroe's bedroom door the night she died because it was locked, but she also had a spare key. (so why did she not use it?) Police noted that Murray appeared quite evasive and extremely vague and she would eventually change her story several times.***********It's clearly obvious that the death scene was faked, and Monroe did not swallow all of those pills . . .It seems Killgallen was killed in a similiar manner."},{"Title":"Son of dust","review":"Originally published in 1956 by MacMillan, SON OF DUST by Anglo-Catholic novelist Hilda Frances Margaret Prescott is a historical romance set in eleventh century Normandy shortly before \\"William the Conqueror\\", Duke of Normandy, crossed the Channel to capture England in 1066.The story is simple enough: Fulcun Geroy, a young and passionate and idealistic member of the landed gentry manages to resist one illicit sexual temptation only to be drawn into another and much more dangerous liaison with a married woman. And since this is a time when marriages were largely affairs of property and convenience, the reader can't help but feel sympathy towards Fulcun and his star-crossed love--the more so since, as we come to see over the course of the novel, the relationship is not only based on lust but on respect and regard and, eventually, as the characters mature, *caritas* as well. Be that as it may, Prescott does not flinch from confronting both her characters and her readers with the collateral damage, personal and societal, attendant on the breaking of marital faith.What separates Prescott's historical romance from most of its genre kin is that it does not hew to the deliciously funny but terribly skewed interpretation of benighted \\"medieval\\" life offered up by the likes of (much as I love it) Monty Python and the Holy Grail--you know, the image, so hackneyed that it has itself become something of a joke, that life for most people in the so-called Age of Faith was nasty, brutish, short, and above all, priest-ridden and superstitious. Indeed, though Prescott does not hesitate to show us ill-educated and morally lax clergy here and there, her sketch of the eleventh century world as coherent and civilized, for all its simplicity, anticipated the revolution in historical thinking that has occurred in the last few decades as the result of the pioneering work of scholars such as Eamon Duffy, whose research into the everyday life of townspeople in late medieval England revealed a commonal way of life far removed from the beastly existence depicted as a staple of secular historiography ever since the publication of Gibbon's anti-Catholic masterpiece, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.Moreover, and in keeping with Prescott's sketching of medieval life as both civilized and religious,hofwever flawed, her hero, Fulcun Geroy, is not only strong and brave but--*quelle surprise!*--a believer; a conscientious child of the Church who knows full well that his lust is wrong, struggles against it, and even as he fails, does not forget entirely that God is merciful and that he must change his life.In terms of literary value, SON OF DUST may not be in the first rank of Catholic novels, but it is a solidly structured and largely very well written story. Prescott's \\"action\\" scenes were sometimes a little confusing to me, and I occasionally found myself thinking, \\"What just happened?\\" Nor did I react well to her habit, much as I love epigraphs, of setting off her eleventh century chapters with anachronistic quotes gleaned from sixteenth century Shakespeare and obscure twentieth century poets; it tended to lift me right out of the book.But Prescott makes up for these little narrative wobbles, for this writer/reader at least, with passages of remarkable lyrical beauty, such as this one:\\"He did not, it is true, think of her--she was a blank patch in the picture in his mind. He thought instead of riding out to hunt (having said good-bye to her), on autumn mornings when the bracken was on fire, and the milk-white, slim trunks of the birch trees were warmed to a faint rose by the sun that shone through their showering red-gold leaves; mornings when the deer went by with the sunlight and soft leaf shadows rippling over them like moving water gleams, and the horns blew up clear, with a merry noise, in the sharp, shining, blue air.Wow.\\"For Catholic fans of historical romance who have a hard time finding anything out there that doesn't insult either their intelligence or their faith, H.F.M.

The last several chapters are written with exceptional realism that engulfs one's emotions and feeling you are experiencing the horrors of war, with the action in the last chapter very authentic and reading like one of Indiana Jones' movies with constantly changing situations and drama. The fictional career of Ensign Mason parallels that of many fine Coast Guard officers during World War Two, and typifies the role played by the Coast Guard in manning Navy ships and landing craft in that war. This is a novel that will be of particular interest to those who served in the military during any war."},{"Title":"The Court-Martial of Ensign Mason","review":"This book deserves wide circulation. It is maserfully written and depicts accurately life aboard an escort vessel in the Mediterranean during World War Two.

It is beautifully made. The outside is a satin-like fabric in an orange-golden color. The general design is very pleasing, with small pictures of flowers and more, scattered throughout the book. Inside and out, a very attractive book.The style of the book is more like a quick reference. In the front of the book is an explanation on how to cast your coins and how to get your result. After the introduction, it offers keywords and how to relate the result of your coins to your questions.Overall, an easy to use book, and a lot more pleasing to the eye than most others I have seen."},{"Title":"I Ching: The Perfect Companion (Perfect Companions!)","review":"I completely agree with the review given above by Giasa, but like the book even more than that.

He also has as a goal that the reader use this as a self-help book. This very readable book is a little out of date as REBT continues to evolve; his sections on REI--Rational Emotive Imagery--and the 11 Irrational Beliefs that Ellis originally formulated have been changed and fine-tuned since he wrote this manual.

It's full of great recipes and stories by a very talented cook and writer. This one focuses on 3 major influences in the culinary world. Jeff Smith entertained us for years on his PBS program 'The Frugal Gourmet'. Not only did he teach us many savory dishes, he also educated us. Not satisfied with just cooking delicious meals for his viewers, he would give detailed history lessons about the origins of the dish and made it all a lot of fun!This may be Mr. Smiths best cook book and it is a worthy edition to everyone's cook book library. I own and have read many, if not all of his cook books, not only for the man's knowledge of cooking, but his incredible wit!

He can be--and often is--brilliantly hilarious, but he can also make your skin crawl. Fortunately, in 'Let Nothing You Dismay', there's more of the former than the latter. His puns and tropes keep coming, but there's less of the soppy emotionalism that ruined 'Homer' for me. This one kept me interested and entertained from beginning to end.Also highly recommended are O'Donnell's earlier works, including 'Vertigo Park' and 'Elementary Education', as an introduction to this awesomely clever writer."},{"Title":"Let Nothing You Dismay","review":"Christmas is less than a week away, but for Tad Leary there is little to celebrate. He has just lost his job as the storyteller at a Manhattan elementary school. He is about to be tossed out of the apartment he is subletting. His thesis on folklore is past due and going nowhere. Worse yet, even though he is over thirty, all his friend, family, and associates treat him as if he is a child due to his short frame and boyish appearance.In spite of his trouble's Tad has vowed to make this Christmas different. He plans to make the rounds by going to the seven parties he has been to attend. He hopes to land a job and a room for his marathon efforts and enjoy the season.LET NOTH-ING YOU DIS-MAY is a wonderfully wacky seasonal tale that will bring joy to anyone who reads the novel. Tad is a great character, struggling with his recent set-backs, his sexual preference, and his treatment by one and all. Mark O'Donnell is a gifted humorist, who brings the likes of Thurber into the late nineties as Tad is the urban, poor man's Walter Mitty (without the dreams of grandeur). Like his previous novel, GETTING OVER HOMER, Mr. O'Donnell gifts his audience with a non-stop jocular story that demonstrates even when it is too dark for Green Lantern's ring, there remains the light of comedy to pull one through the night.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Let Nothing You Dismay","review":"Even though some reviewers did not like this book, I thought it was a lovely little novel. It is a week before Christmas in Manhattan and Tad, our protagonist, has just been fired from his job at an elementary school (as a story-teller) because an affectionate child has told his mother that Tad was his favorite hugger or some such nonsense (the mother is, of course, on the board or somehow related to those who worry about this). Tad has also realized that the apartment he has occupied for some time will no longer be available to him as the rightful owner is coming home. It is a Sunday and Tad has been invited to seven different events (functions) which he decides that morning he will attend in spite of the feelings of doom and gloom and utter loneliness he is feeling about his life. The reason I so liked this little book is because, while droll in its humor, it was at a very basic level, uplifting. We have brunch with Tad's family who are bizarre yet strangely accommodating, especially a brother he was never close to but who provides him with some food for thought. We meet old friends of Tad's who offer him a place to stay for a while if he needs, we meet the sister of an old boyfriend (who Tad treated poorly) who is actually rather forgiving, we meet some other friends who are artists and so self-consumed and weird that Tad seems perfectly fine by comparison, we attend a high end party where Tad drinks too much, says the wrong things to the wrong people, yet manages to stir compassion in the (potential new boyfriend) heart of someone who returns his wallet. And we visit the basement in the elementary school Tad has just been fired from, some of his better co-workers who have snuck away from the holiday party and commiserate with him. I liked this book because Tad has every reason to be depressed and wallow in self pity and yet he ventures out in his very vulnerable state and manages to let people take care of him in a very off-hand sweet sort of way. He allows himself to see that life is not over and that things are going to turn up. I liked the whole premise."},{"Title":"Let Nothing You Dismay","review":"I loved Mark O'Donnell's last book, Getting Over Homer, so I immediately bought this one.This one is not as great, but it's still worth reading. I think O'Donnell's fresh metaphors and descriptions are a little forced in this book. A lot of times, they just sound stiff and awkward.But as always, there are great, vivid characters. O'Donnell is a great creator of people--particularly families. Each character is unique and interesting.The story is a fun concept, and keeps you reading. The ending was the cherry on top--I loved it--Tad has a dream that he and his brother are little boys again, but they're on a boat and as they reach the equator they will age and go through puberty, adulthood . . . &quot;it's Indian summer, and our brains are delighted by knowledge; our hearts are unaware of their own existence; since the big bang, the universe has been a fire--slowly dying out--but fires are beautiful to watch . . .&quot;Beautiful, Mark."},{"Title":"Let Nothing You Dismay","review":"There is a character in this book who most readers will recognise. Simon is an acquaintance (rarely a friend) who must &quot;win&quot; conversations. He is smug and asserts 5 words where one would suffice.While Mr. O'Donnell may identify with Tad, the sterotypically sweet main character, he really seems to me to be so much more a Simon. His writing is laboured and his sense of sentimentality, while earnest, is always overcome by a need to be clever. I like writers to be clever but more than that, I like them to write characters, not to prove to me that they know a whole lot of really big words. Mr. O'Donnell's writing lacks depth and humanity. I understand that Finding Homer is his better work but this piece of tripe will prevent me from experiencing that book."},{"Title":"Let Nothing You Dismay","review":"Mark O'Donnell is one of the funniest writers that I have read.

The ideas about how to teach your baby about where his foot is, or how to sit up, or that bubble float, are terrific, and the look on his face when I do something the book recommends is just pure joy! My only recommendation is that you stay at least one month ahead, and do things from that month which you think your child is ready for."},{"Title":"Your Child at Play: Birth to One Year","review":"I have a 4 month old baby. I'm a stay-at-home mom and while I know \\"everything is fascinating\\" to such a young baby, the fact is, we have to do something to fill in the hours. I do not think that certain exercises will help baby roll over faster, or that watching Baby Einstein videos will make baby smarter. I DO think that activities are invaluable for bonding with the baby.Enter this book. This is the book I have been looking for! Other books with activities for babies tend to focus more on the toddler ages--aka after walking, or at least after crawling. This book has fun activities even for pre-crawlers--even for babies who cannot yet move their head! And the activities are grouped month by month. O fcourse, take these monthly guidelines with a grain of salt--every baby is different, and as another reviewer mentioned, crawling at 6 months is a little ambitious. Having just found the book, I've gone back and pulled some activities from the youinger ages as well.Finally, while the activities may seem simple, even the most creative caregiver cannot think of everything. For example, in the 4 month section, Dr. Segal recommends placing baby on a blanket and picking up the blanket to cause them to roll over. I've been playing rolling-over games with my son, but never thought to use a blanket to roll him over, and it turns out he LOVES it. The activities mentioned have also sparked my imagine for other activities, and at the very least, are invaluable in the middle of the afternoon when baby is on napping strike and the day seems to drag on....HIGHLY recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Your Child at Play: Birth to One Year","review":"We have a library of books to help us understand what we can do to best understand and stimulate our childs growth/development(i.e.- What to expect series, Brazleton, Baby book, etc).

There was nothing on the design, selection or provisioning of the survival retreat (since \\"that information was covered in other books\\").I read it in a couple of hours; many pages are little more than full page, stock-image photos.

Not since Michael Coe's &quot;Breaking the Maya Code&quot; have I found a book on the Maya so exciting to read and so easy to get through. David Drew doesn't bog you down in academic minutae.I found two things in this book that were particularly fascinating. One, that the Maya were not a single pre-Columbian empire, as is so often portrayed, but rather a set of city-states involved in constantly shifting alliances with other political entities. It made the Maya seem that much more accessible and real as people.The second item I found fascinating was the fact that the Maya city of Tayasal survived into the period of the Spanish Conquest, while the bulk of the Maya world, and its once proud city-state, had collapsed several hundred years earlier. I am curious to read more about this particular city in a book by Grant Jones.I highly recommend this book to all those interested in the Maya.

For some years now specialists have eagerly awaited the Martin and Grube work. The use of a roughly similar title for the Drews book would seem to reflect, as far as I can tell, sharp practice and uncertain truth-in-advertising -- in fairness perhaps entirely beyond the control of Drews. I hope I am wrong, and that Drews' title existed long before this long-awaited, splendid effort by Martin and Grube. Until that book appears, readers will find a capable (but derivative) treatment of Maya history in The Lost Chronicles of the Maya Kings."},{"Title":"The Lost Chronicles of the Maya Kings","review":"As a general reader with an interest in the Maya, I found that this book delivered. It was well written and not difficult and didn't get bogged down in archaeological minutae. But it IS thorough. Not just about the so called &quot;Lost Chronicles&quot; but a total survey of our knowledge of the Maya, from their &quot;discovery&quot;, the serpentine journey to understanding them, and what is known from their origin through to recent times. But he is clear to point out that in Classical times we are restricted often to the lives of rulers, and often only of a few cites that have lots of inscriptions and are well studied. He even agrees that it is time to return the study of Mayan culture to the Mayan descendants. One still gets a sense of sketchiness in the presentation, which only reveals that even with all that has been recently aquired is still not very much. Contains maps, many b&amp;w illustrations and color plates. He could have used twice as many, these things are really beautiful.Aside: One aspect of Maya scholarship is the destruction in the 16th century of several Maya bark scrolls by Friar Diego de Landa. Although he is only supposed to have burned a few dozen, Drew appears to be wringing his fists as he goes on, as if at each turn these irreplacable items - and he claims the loss of hundreds or thousands - would have answered all his questions.

It goes into detail on such cities as Tikal, Copan, Palanque &amp; Quirigua for example. What you will get is a conglomeration of all the research in these areas in relation to history, art, architecture, politics and religion where information has been found.This is a very informative book and reccomended for an overview of the entire Maya civilsation. It brings into context what caused the changes in Maya civilisation (where we know it) and the limitations on the knowledge we currently have.A word of warning however - despite being 'reader friendly' this book can be slow to get through if you don't have a long background in Maya history because of it's sheer depth and array of information."},{"Title":"The Lost Chronicles of the Maya Kings","review":"This book was very good in so many ways I found it to be a very objective and informative."},{"Title":"Beyond the Indigo Children: The New Children and the Coming of the Fifth World","review":"Beyond the Indigo Children: The New Children and the Coming of the Fifth World(Bear, 2005; ISBN 1-59143-051-8) By P.M.H.

It is not fair to restrict ones views with the opinions in the book"},{"Title":"Beyond the Indigo Children: The New Children and the Coming of the Fifth World","review":"The hypothesis of P.M.H. Atwater's new book suggests that the new children (those born since the early eighties and somehow \\"different\\" from the moment of their birth) are the living examples of an evolutionary shift occurring in the human species.Atwater weaves a finely crafted tale of the descent of the human soul from etheric realms of spirit into involvements and entanglements with matter. She leads us through discussions of the root races and onward to a theorized purpose of the Mayan Calendar. \\"As creation unfolds,\\" Atwater explains, \\"and as it shifts and re-shifts to accommodate finer frequencies of vibration brought on by the expansion of higher states of consciousness,\\" the evolution of the human family is described.Her work has provided me with additional wisdom identifying the importance of sharing the keys to the world with children. I have often felt that I learn as much from the children, if not more, than what I attempt to impart to them. I have never taken that privilege lightly. Through her composition, Atwater has illuminated the fact that what I have witnessed for over twenty years as a Montessori Directress has been the most significant activity that I have ever pursued, i.e. the practice of observing children's remarkable growth and development - experienced on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis in an environment prepared for their exploration. I am again drawn to the assertion that I am watching evolution unfold right before my very eyes in the classroom.Atwater has organized a fascinating journey. Her attention to detail and careful documentation of numerous references launches the reader into veiled descriptions of sacred legacies that have been passed down through oral tradition. Storytelling: the myths, legends, prophecies, ancient wisdom teachings, collections of revelations gained from dreams, memories, channeling, spirit guidance and other worldly encounters all speak of an origin in the indistinct, primordial past. But, as she says, \\"far from being crude tales devised by primitives, certain ancient myths record a sophisticated cosmological science of exceeding brilliance.\\"Atwater pursued every source of information she could find about the purpose of human existence, about our place in the universe, and the reason for the soul. During her research into the phenomenon of Near Death Experiences, Atwater noticed how similar children born since 1982 were to the children who had experienced their own adventure with NDE and the ways in which they had changed after the occurrence. And, she has a story to tell us about certain postulations relative to creation and consciousness and the challenges we face and how all of this blends into her own experiences and observations.She goes beyond labels, asserting that the human family is no accident upon this Earth and that there was a plan created by a Source above and beyond all things visible and invisible.It is the children, the new children, who are here to help lead us through rapid changes. These are the children that P.M.H. Atwater helps us to recognize and welcome through her research. She offers it to us here, in her new work, entitled, Beyond The Indigo Children; The New Children and the Coming of The Fifth World,."},{"Title":"Beyond the Indigo Children: The New Children and the Coming of the Fifth World","review":"I just had to post a review of this book after reading it. I am very disappointed with Ms. Atwater, who had the opportunity to write a very informative book, but instead wrote a very confusing and highly 'opinionated' story. First off, you can't tell what view she's coming from- scientific, new age, or biblical? It's like she wrote in a format to try to please all of the people, all of the time, and instead came up with a tangled mess of confusion. A big problem might be that she seems to have cut & pasted so many other people's views and research, that you can't tell what is from her, and what is from other people. It's weird because one minute she seems like one person, the next, she comes across as somebody else. VERY confusing.Secondly, for someone who is writing a book to supposedly 'help people', her descriptions in chapter five about the different generations- are mainly all negative words and descriptions! She totally destroyed her credibility with me when she said of the 'Millenial' generation- \\"Many of the older ones are bisexual and practice oral sex\\". Someone should tell this \\"professional\\" that these things have been around since the dawn of time... and I find it incredibly judgmental of her to state this in regards to any generation. She comes off, to me, as a total \\"know-it-all\\" who lacks a true understanding of the topics that she writes about. She quotes enough sources as \\"fact\\", which most can't be substantiated... yet she's quick to try to debunk other people's views because they can't be substantiated. Or is it because SHE doesn't believe them, so thus, they're wrong?Third, she totally misses the boat when she talks about ancient civilizations- as she didn't write about one important thing. There is a cave picture by the Hopi people, the picture prophecy says there are two parallel paths for humanity to walk as we make our choices. One is a path of darkness, while the other is a path of Light. We can move freely back and forth between each one for a long time (many lives) because the Great Spirit wants us to explore and experience different ways of life. But, a moment in history will arrive when we must make a final choice between the two. That moment has arrived. Those who choose the path of darkness are shown in the pictograph as people whose heads hover above their bodies, while walking a path that turns into a broken zigzag and leads to nowhere. These people will experience the great purification (shift) as a time of confusion and chaos that leads to destruction. Those who have chosen a way of Light have a clear, strong path ahead of them, as they live to advanced ages. This appears to be very different from what she describes for our \\"future\\".Fourth, she mentions the Chakra energy system in her book, but she obviously hasn't researched the subject- because her information was very basic at best and only partly correct.I'm also confused as to how she can claim to know what is going to happen in the future, when she doesn't even have a clue as to what the \\"next\\" root-race is even called. She is basing her information off of the believe that the earth will begin the original cycle over again... kind of like a 'never-ending story'. Which makes you wonder, when does the ride stop? In her theory, it never does... but even science is aware that at some point the sun will go super-nova. So maybe it's possible that what the Mayans and Hopi were telling us, is that a 'new world' will begin- and NOT become a continuous cycle like she would have us believe.I also had a big problem with her using 'specific' dates as far as when Indigos started to appear. There is many different opinions, but the most common is that they started to arrive on earth around the early 70's. I was born in 1970, and am definitely an Indigo- and it has nothing to do with my aura color. A much better book on the Indigo children is \\"The Indigo Children\\"... as it offers much better insight into who the Indigo children really are; and Lee Carroll clearly states that most early Indigos were missed because people during the 70's didn't notice them. So once again, Ms. Atwater here, truly doesn't have a clue... and just presents her opinions as 'fact'. She rips on \\"The Indigo Children\\" claiming it wasn't based on information that could be substantiated- but it was pretty obvious to me that she never actually read the book from the way she described it. Plus, like I said earlier, can anything in her book be substantiated? No. Other than the quotes here and there and all the other people's information and research that she used.Another part that bothered me is when she talked about the next generation coming in will have 'lots of fear'. Now I don't know where she got her information from, but this is not the case. One of the major problems with society today, is the constant state of 'fear' that most people seem to live in. Most of the fear comes from organized religion, instilling in people that you must fear pretty much everything. However, the reason the Indigos are here, along with the Lightworkers, is to help show people that fear is not the way, to help people overcome their fears and follow a new path of spiritual love.So Ms. Atwater is completely wrong on several accounts- in my opinion. She bases her beliefs on speculation and pseudo-science-metaphysical-biblical information generated by other people. The one thing that I highlighted in her book, but she seems to fail to put any weight behind is this statement by Edgar Cayce \\"ONLY those who accept same [the influence of the vibratory influences] will even become aware of what's going on about them!\\"Makes it sound more like the Hopi's \\"picture\\" of what is coming, and not Ms. Atwater's 'long-range forecast'. As we all know how well weather forecasters do with their predictions!Unfortunately, I can't even recommend this book for really anything that it contained. At least other books that I reviewed, I got at least a little something from. The only thing I got from this book, was the quote from Edgar Cayce!If Ms. Atwater spent as much time speaking to people with true psychic gifts who have more advanced knowledge, and less time promoting her other books, she might actually learn something. I lost count of how many times she managed to stick in plugs for her other books, within this one; everything seemed to tie back into her \\"near-death experiences\\" books. Maybe she should stick to writing those books, because that might just be the one thing she actually knows something about."},{"Title":"Beyond the Indigo Children: The New Children and the Coming of the Fifth World","review":"While it used to be true that if someone had psychic abilities, they had one particular talent that stood out beyond all the rest, the new \\"indigo\\" children (and adults) are much more like Renaissance people, in that they typically have multiple enhanced senses and abilities. PMH Atwater's newest book, BEYOND THE INDIGO CHILDREN, provides the most complete, comprehensive, and clear-headed overview of the phenomenon of the wonderfully irreverent and intuitive \\"new children\\" born since 1982. Atwater clears the fog of confusion and hype surrounding indigo kids, crystal kids, super-psychic kids and AIDS kids as she presents visionary views of how these children are already making a positive difference, and what's about to come next.BEYOND THE INDIGO CHILDREN contains fascinating stories from children of the new generations that demonstrate the depth and breadth of their talents, needs and motivations. While many of the new kids remember their births and previous lives, can see deceased relatives, and know what others are thinking, their true significance on Earth seems to be that they herald a transformation in every aspect of society. Parents and schools are beginning to wonder what to do with these new kids, who are so often dissatisfied with the status quo, and who make demands for increased honesty, accountability and meaningfulness everywhere they go. Atwater shares dozens of practical suggestions for how we may best address the needs of these new children in positive ways that help make their lives better at the same time as they begin to transform our world.For those of us older \\"new children\\" who are now in our midlife years, BEYOND THE INDIGO CHILDREN is packed with useful ideas and tips for better utilizing our gifts and better caring for ourselves. We will need to be strong, since Atwater points out that there are many signs that indicate we are living in a time of shifting consciousness as we encounter environmental crises: \\"The time span of 2013 through 2029 concerns me most. This is when generational statisticians and a percentage of children who underwent near-death experiences say the greatest challenges will occur in our country and around the world, generating anything from 'stirring achievement to apocalyptic tragedy'.\\" Ancient prophecies have foretold that our successful passage through the coming \\"gateway\\" of December 21, 2012 depends on the \\"fifth root race,\\" or the new children.BEYOND THE INDIGO CHILDREN should be required reading for every parent, teacher, therapist, healer, and doctor who works with children, in order to better understand the spirit of the architects who are rebuilding the way humans will exist on planet Earth, and better support the creation of the most positive future for us all. I give this book my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Beyond the Indigo Children: The New Children and the Coming of the Fifth World","review":"I have worked with \\"at risk\\" young folks for most of my career. Indigo's are not new to me, I first noticed them around 1989, as the first ones began to move into Adolescents.This book expands on what we know, and does it without to much Woo Woo.D.G."},{"Title":"Beyond the Indigo Children: The New Children and the Coming of the Fifth World","review":"I couldn't put this book down! It was very informative and I really like her writing style. I am a mother of two young children and this book was very helpful to me in a lot of ways. I highly recommend it for everyone!"},{"Title":"Beyond the Indigo Children: The New Children and the Coming of the Fifth World","review":"In an concerted effort to uphold her self image as a respected and respectable researcher, Ms Atwater steers so wide of the target as to be almost irrelevant. Her topics deduced from the title are Indigo children which she essentially debunks with \\"none of these claims hold up in the face of research, whether via scientific observation or via studying mystical/esoteric traditions...The notion that children with indigo or purple auras are now commonplace is greatly exaggerated\\" and the Fifth World which is a native peoples legend describing obliquely the quantum leap of consciousness to the fifth dimension. The phrase \\"fifth dimension\\" is mentioned once in passing at the bottom of a page, never to be heard from again. Her take on the Fifth World is kind of similar to that of Al Gore--we're a planet that is down for the count, in a state of collapse and there is no hope, we're goners.What did I expect? The cover says this book \\"combines objective research with mystical revelation and prophecy.\\" The only prophecy we get is one sentence from Edgar Cayce who died in 1945 and some theosophical material from Charles Leadbeater who died in 1934. In other words the only good prophet is a dead prophet. Not one word from Ken Carey, or any of the dozens of living prophets whose detailed fifth dimension New Earth information outshines native prophecy by an order of magnitude. To me the only useful sentence in the book was the stetement \\"In my research with child experiencers of near-death states, about 20 percent said they were here in this lifetime for 'the changes,' that the Earth and all the peoples on the Earth would go through great shifts that would alter the world.\\" It would have been nice to know her sample size.The inescapable conclusion is that Ms Atwater does not want to sully her reputation by giving us detailed paranormal information about a consiousness shift, because it does not have the scientific ring to it that she wants attached to her name--just throw it out with the bath water."},{"Title":"Beyond the Indigo Children: The New Children and the Coming of the Fifth World","review":"This is not another guidebook for parents of Indigo's or the children themselves. It is more of an overview of the ages of humankind, called Worlds by native tribes, most notably the Mayans. Atwater describes in detail the generations peopling the planet since 1901 to the present, their tasks, the energy of the times and how they handled that. She also thoughtfully discusses the current young adults and the new children being born, and what lies ahead for them in terms of the state of the world, their potentials, strengths and weak points, as well as what various prophecies may mean to humans, the planet and beyond in the years ahead."},{"Title":"Beyond the Indigo Children: The New Children and the Coming of the Fifth World","review":"I believe in the overall theory of this book. For those who have nothing good to say of the book, (OK, your opinion) However, being the parent of 2 very special children, I know first hand that this is real and not some result of bad parenting or \\"lack of medication\\"! Wow, some people really do toss stones without walking in the shoes. As for chakras and other Metaphysical beliefs... Perhaps it really is REAL... Perhaps some people will never believe... Perhaps some people will go on forever casting stones at others without knowing at all what they are really talking about... Perhaps someday, they will know... Perhaps in a next life there Karma will be... to Know, to feel, to cry, to hurt... and to finally see where thier heart should have been all along."},{"Title":"Beyond the Indigo Children: The New Children and the Coming of the Fifth World","review":"Beyond the Indigo Children: The New Children and the Coming of the Fifth World--is the second book I have read by Ms. Atwater. The first book, Near Death Experiences, The Rest of the Story--was very impressive. I admired Ms. Atwater for her courage in dealing with the NDE subject and the lifelong commitment she has made to this endeavor. I found that book to be very informative and revealing, as well as thought provoking. This good experience is what influenced me to buy this book too. My interest in human evolution and development makes me very interested in the emerging idea of \\"Indigo-Children\\". However, I found this book goes way beyond the subject of \\"Indigos\\" . . . as it evolved into a broad and wide ranging survey of many factors in mankind's progress along the evolutionary path. Drawing on more speculative sources than scientific, the book touches base with the Mayan calendar, Hopi Indian myths, Edgar Cayce, to Chakra energy fields . . . to name just a few. I did find the book more of a speculative survey of a wide-range of ideas, and author's opinions, on not only Indigos, but a wide-array of remotely related topics. Meanwhile, Ms. Atwater does a commendable and occasionally compelling job of weaving all these diverse elements into an interesting testament on the continuing development of Indigos and other type of children that may appear in the present, and then on-going into the future. I have an open mind and found most of this material interesting and sometimes fascinating . . . but it left me wanting a greater understanding of the Indigos . . . which is where I started.

The format is basic and non-threatening for new believers, as well as educational for life-long Christians...I can't recommend it enough.

This brief (14 pages) pamphlet was republished in this edition in 1977, but it was originally a chapter in Spencer's bookSocial Statics: The Conditions Essential to Human Happiness Specified and the First of Them Developed (Classic Reprint). It had not previously been published in English as a separate essay.He begins by arguing that \\"If every man has freedom to do as he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man, then he is free to drop connection with the state---to relinquish its protection, and to refuse paying toward its support.\\" He further asserts that to compel a man to continue in a political corporation would be \\"a breach of the moral law.\\" (Pg 3)He further asserts that government is \\"essentially immoral,\\" asking, \\"Does it not exist because crime exists?... And must not government cease when crime ceases, for very lack of objects on which to perform its function?\\" He goes on to say that \\"Not only does magisterial power exist BECAUSE of evil; but it exists BY evil,\\" since \\"Violence is employed to maintain it; and all violence involves criminality.\\" (Pg. 4)He suggests that the very existence of majorities and minorities \\"is indicative of an immoral state,\\" since in the pursuit of their happiness, \\"the majority inflict a certain amount of UNhappiness on the minority.\\" (Pg. 7) He asks rhetorically, And what is meant by ignoring the state? He replies, \\"Simply an assertion of the right similarly to exercise ALL the faculties. The one ... must stand or fall with the other.\\" He accordingly rejects a distinction between \\"civil\\" and \\"religious\\" liberties. (Pg. 10)He concludes by reiterating that government is an institution originating in man's imperfection; \\"How, then, can that be a true system of morality which adopts government as one of its premises?\\" (Pg. 14)This brief essay is a real \\"gem\\" of libertarian sentiment."},{"Title":"The right to ignore the state (Freedom pamphlet)","review":"Basic 19th century anarchist theory.

The spirit of the colonists (both races) who wanted nothing more than to escape their stagnating worlds; the Hrrubans' sense of humor when they realized the humans thought they were savages; the release for Todd to discover there was indeed still a world where children can play and make the noises of childhood; all of these things are portrayed as fully as the bureaucracies that had me grinding my teeth in sympathetic frustration for both the Terrans and the Hrrubans. I later discovered Pern and Ms. McCaffrey's other worlds but Doona has always been my first love. The sequels to the original came many years after but they are no less dogeared, at least in my library. And In MY library, Ms. McCaffrey's worlds take up more than one shelf.

It's hard to believe I didn't notice at the time how absolutely pathetic the female characters are. Though set in the future, women cook and look after children - that's it! The protagonist's wife is the only woman who gets to say more than a sentence or two and she spends most of her time in tears. Except when cooking. The author was able to create female characters who weren't idiots in the Pern books, so it's surprising that she made no such attempt here. Even thirty years ago, this should have seemed oldfashioned, and it certainly isn't necessary to the plot. Perhaps the sequels were more believable in this area, but I am reluctant to try them now."},{"Title":"Decision At Doona","review":"My overall impression after reading this book was that it was a cute little sci-fi throwaway novel.As a lot of people have pointed out, the book is over thirty years old, and it shows. The portrayal of the women is enough to make you cringe. They are perfect housewives who have a sole purpose of keeping a clean home and raising the children while their \`men folk' do all the hunting and gathering. I thought it was ironic that the aliens seemed to be more advanced in that regard than the humans.Todd, the child character was written so that he seemed almost cartoonish. Although he was six he had an entire ship load of people in terror at his tantrums. At times when I was reading his descriptions and his terrors though the book I was wondering out loud if this was a joke.Also the ending, with all the different earth organizations just outright confused me. Eventually I lost track of trying to keep track of the names of the government officials because I eventually realized it didn't even matter.So why did I give this four stars? The plot itself was very original. I loved the way that Anne Mccaffrey painted life on earth. It really drew you in and made you realize truly how desperately the colonists needed to get out. The aliens were original as well, and I truly enjoyed the twist at the end (which I will not give away here).So despite its major flaws in the characters, the book didn't make me feel like I wasted my time. My advice is to read it knowing that you will be reading something that was written in a society with a different set of gender morals.

The art and story are both amazing. The plot is surprising and dramatic. Anybody who's a fan of this series should also check out the anime series, which is pretty close to the manga plot, except it introduces characters a bit faster, and it doesn't run as long (I think). Also, the Guyver series is still going on in Japan. I think that it's on issue 80 or something now, and it shows no signs of stopping.

Actually, the first time I laid eyes on the series of books, I merely flipped through a few pages in the last volume (&quot;Armageddon&quot;), found that I couldn't make sense out of the dialogue, and then thought little more about it. Until, that is, I came across the very first book, and started reading it in the store. I didn't buy it, I just read it. But I bought the next volume, figuring that I'd just continue along. I didn't need the first book, if I had already read it, right? Well, I found that the second book just didn't seem right without the first one, so I bought the first one. Now, I have six out of the 7 published graphic novels, and I'm looking for the last one.In the storyline, we are introduced to Sho, a high school student who accidentally activates a top-secret bio-boosting device called the G-Unit. This unit used to be in the hands of a ultra-secret organization called Chronos, and they want the unit back because it is the only thing that stand in the way of world domination. By activating it, Sho becomes bonded with the unit, which is actually the Guyver suit. Chronos quickly pursues Sho and his friends Tetsuro and Mizuki. If you buy this book, let me warn you..you might find yourself heading back to the bookstore for more!Unfortunately, the publisher hasn't printed all of the volumes of the Guyver Comic books because of a lack of interest.

All I want to say is that Guyver with all the characters has its own life. The personalities and their struggle for survival make it breath. The emotional part of the boy was most apparent when he killed his own dad and afterwards failed to transform because he felt guilty. But then, he was only defending himself and the creature Enzyme II (his dad) was under complete control of a commander. His brain was not malfunctioning and the guyver suit simply took control and defended him without regard to human emotion. The whole story got me really stuck into it. It's just that the pusblisher tend to print it once in 3 to 4 months here(Malaysia). My manga collection is only up to when guyver I and guyver III were inside the living spaceship and trying to evacuate the people who were against Chronos( they were professionals forced to work for Chronos).

And so many other books that empathize with writers about how hard it is to write.This book does not empathize about anything. This book offers some feedback about planning and about publishing. But the true priceless value of this book is the way in which it makes it possible to write a book in 40 days. Just write it, usuing the process in this book, and revise it later.

There's little here I haven't been told by many other teachers, so I feel the littlest bit bamboozled. I was hoping for insider tips on how to turn into Agatha Christie and write my book in 40 days. Melton's answer is meat & potatoes: sit down and grind it out. Don't stop for meals or Sunday school. If you live in a cabin in primitive Alaska, you can do this.

It was a staple for working field geologists for decades. This is because the identification of \\"index fossils\\" was, and is, the handiest way to date strata in the field.The book is organised by phylla: Protozoa, Porifera, Coelenterata, Echinoderma, Annelida, Conodonts, Bryozoa, Brachiopoda, Mollusca, and Arthropoda. There are also sections on fossil plants and miscellaneous objects of probable organic origin. Everything is illustrated by crisp, sharp, photographic plates, clearly indexed to the corresponding text.By today's micropaleontological standards, the Protozoa section is pretty thin, but otherwise this is still a very useful volume."},{"Title":"Index Fossils of North America","review":"No other single volume can compare with this classic. Any serious student of paleontology or sedimentary geology or any serious amateur collector should have a copy. And with several copies available for less than $100 - compared to the $35 I paid in 1959 - it is a bargain. Death of older geologists and discards by librarians who think because of the date it is useless (I personally know of three university libraries that have discarded their copies!) maintain the supply.Only four stars because:1) Treatment of protozoa is too scanty to really be useful.2) Many species have been reclassified so one must do further research on names.3) Some geologic ranges will have been refined."},{"Title":"QuarkXPress 6 Killer Tips","review":"This book has valuable tips, design know-hows &amp; covers those &quot;gotchas&quot; that mess up design work.

He has some natural and amazing skill for convertions, so dont try to replicate what you see in the first run, study the sbs and practice, practice and practice some more, this book will provide a really good reference on how-to.Painting Waffen SS camo is considered almost a sin, it aint pretty to deal with all those confusing patterns, my advise: Research and study before smelling those trusty Vallejos (my brand of choice), take your time and get used to them (the patterns), buy a good reference book like Waffen-SS Uniforms In Color Photographs: Europa Militaria Series #6 (Europa Militaria), this two books work together like a charm.Regarding painting techniques, Tan breaks it down really nice, from a sbs face painting to uniforms, some terrain and weathering armor tips, BUT, do your homework and you will realize that pro-painted figures are a sum of many different techniques. Again dont do and compare, just practice your way up, one step at a time. I really liked how he shows the early stages of a camo to its final touches, keep in mind that some techniques like glazing, feathering, etc, are not depicted here.Over all a really good book that will help improve your figure painting skills."},{"Title":"Modelling Waffen-SS Figures (Osprey Modelling)","review":"There is always something new to learn from this book.

The author provides an easy to follow guide to painting several patterns using acrylic paint (Vallejo brand). It also incorporates; techniques for super detailing battle field dress, equipment, major figure modifications, full sculpts and groundwork. There is quite a bit of information provided using numerous pictures of the work progressing.The best part for me was the breakdown of each camo pattern with specific color mixes and how to apply the colors. These are challenging patterns to reproduce in this scale. The following patterns are explainedPlane Tree PatternDot/Pea PatternItalian PatternOak-Leaf Pattern - SpringOak- Leaf Pattern - AutumnIf you are serious about improving in this specific area I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Modelling Waffen-SS Figures (Osprey Modelling)","review":"I bought this book, not because of the subject (I don't model many Waffen-SS figures) but for the acrylic painting techniques and I was not disappointed. Calvin Tan provides insight into how he transforms plastic model figures into true works of art.He starts the book by covering a painting and detailing a SS-Sturmmann from the 1st Panzer Division in Kursk 1943. This introduces his basic techniques for painting with acryilics which are unique and invaluable. The chapter then goes on to show how he details the soldier's equipment. He then moves on to more complex topics such as figure conversion, more complex painting and finally figure sculpting.While I will never be the master that Calvin is, I learned a lot and have applied the techniques to my own work with some success. My only criticism is that he uses terms such as wash and glaze without really defining them and -- it feels -- sometimes interchangeably. If you're new to the artform, keep your browser handy as you'll need to look up terms and reread passages to make sure you really understand what is going on.But, those are minor critiques.

Many of the construction and painting techniques will be beyond almost everybody's skill level never the less studying this book should improve your abilities and enhance your enjoyment of the hobby.This book must be an early work in this book because you can tell Tan's latest works are noticeable improved where he sculpts most of the figure and doesn't modify and use existing commercial figures anymore. Also I think possibly Calvin has changed/improved his face painting technique since he wrote this book."},{"Title":"Modelling Waffen-SS Figures (Osprey Modelling)","review":"Much like their other modelling books, it covers a veritiy of projects in a step by step instruction.

The book is unnecessarily complicated, skips non-obvious steps in the examples, provides no review for material that justifiably should be reviewed, and has a very poor approach to explanation of concepts. Contrasted to James Stewart's Calculus book that I've used for the past year, this book almost makes me want to cry and turn into an English major. The key to surviving a class that requires this book is to get another book.

For non-math majors, the book may become difficultto follow. Therefore; it may help to consult with the Schaum'sOutline in order to supplement this text. Boyce and DiPrimais more than enough to get you through the Fundamentals ofEngineering Examination. Differential Equations is a subjectwhich requires students to take copious notes. It pays tostruggle through the homeworks and to plan daily study sessionsof 15 minutes to 1 hour depending upon where you are in thecourse.

I've used this text both as a student and as a TA, and my hatred of it has only grown as I've tutored students out of it. Engineers and scientists don't need the lengthy descriptions provided in this text, which make it difficult to quickly refresh one's memory on a particular method. In addition, this text is suffering from a blight that affects many calculus and differential equations texts--moving important methods and/or concepts into the exercises. The examples are fairly good and provide the only way to figure out what is going on without spending hours reading. Its other redeeming quality is that almost all of the answers are provided in the back of the text, which is helpful to students who will rework problems until they get the right answer. Students should beware that instructors and graders quickly catch on to this fact, so you really need to work through to the right answer, or your score will suffer.Additionally, this text's price is rising quite rapidly. I don't understand why it is, but the book certainly isn't worth its current price.Don't buy this book unless you have to!"},{"Title":"Elementary Differential Equations","review":"I do not see what all the negative reviews are about.

This book is well written and contains numerous examples and a plethora of problems. However, a student would do well to have a very firm knowledge of calculus and a quick mathematical mind; some of the methods covered are not candy coated to go down easier. As such, it is important that a strong professor and a strong curriculum accompany this book. This is NOT a good book for self-instruction. However, it is a very useful reference to go back to when dealing with more advanced mathematical topics."},{"Title":"Elementary Differential Equations","review":"Both the student's solution and the text book has the traditional Wiley's style.

This book didn't get a lot of use by me because my diff-eq teacher didn't completely follow the book. However there were some very good examples in the book that definitely helped me out in understanding what was going on in the course. As I said in the title, differential equations is not an easy class, so you can't expect this book to make it cake, but it'll get you farther than just searching the internet IMO."},{"Title":"Elementary Differential Equations","review":"I had used this book for a Introductory Differential Equations class I took my Junior year and because of this book I had the worst time understanding the material in this class. The explanations are convoluted and lengthy, yet somehow manage to skip important steps, leaving it up to the student to have to decipher the logic behind the example problems and core theorems/methods. You know a textbook is bad when understanding the concepts and examples takes just as long as doing the homework. Professors, I beg you not to make your students have to purchase and use this book in your Diff. Eq's classes. I guarantee you'll have a more motivated and successful class if you choose a more interesting, less lifeless book than this."},{"Title":"Elementary Differential Equations","review":"This is the standard text for D.E.'s at Stanford University. Stanford's syllabus and problem sets can be located at this address: http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/034/index.htmlUsing this book in my Ordinary D.E. course initially was a problem; the material in the book more often than not favors pretentious symbols to conventional ones, which can get really annoying during exams and especially when trying to learn unfamiliar concepts.Calculus I, II, and III are immensely useful in this text, as certain steps are omitted for the sake of verbosity that are already used in Calculus.Regardless of prerequisites and the above trivialities, this book WILL teach you differential equations.In conclusion, Boyce's text is superlative compared to most others out there (so I've heard), presenting material clearly. Schaum's Outlines for Differential Equations or some other supplementary course would prove invaluable as companions in D.E.'s. Finally, skip the first chapter, since it is repeated in the second and third ones and presents nothing novel."},{"Title":"Elementary Differential Equations","review":"In all fairness, my impression of this book actually comes from their 3rd edition, which I used in my first Diff. Eq. (DE) course. However, I remember seeing later versions in various bookstores, only to see little change. I was a good student in math, but grew to hate DE because of this book. It was written in a very complex, dry &amp; boring way, with virtually no graphics, and the examples were never explained enough (i.e. to give you a solid intuitive feel of the subject). Thank God for Schaums Outline to get me through the course. As a practicing engineer, I have found other books, calculators (HP-48GX, TI-92, etc.) and the computer to restore my interest and fascination in DE. I wish Steven Speilberg could do a movie showing how fascinating differential equations really are, because this book sure doesn't."},{"Title":"Elementary Differential Equations","review":"Please take this advice; I have been using this book for the past four months.This is a rare occasion. I never take to the time to go to a site and write a review unless there is some outstanding reason. This is my fourth year as an engineering student and while I have had some bad books, I have NEVER had a book this bad. For example, the text almost never gives full examples let alone examples on how to do the practice problems/homework problems. When the text gives example problems, it will randomly skip important steps. Ironically, in a lot of cases, it will skip the step/method that is being covered in the section. Also, the text mainly discusses theory and usually doesn't really show how to solve these equations. Furthermore, the solutions manual is just as bad. Solutions are given in a sloppy manner that are unclear and incomplete. I would not recommend this book to any university as an introductory differential equations text."},{"Title":"Elementary Differential Equations","review":"I didn't but this book here, but I got a similar one used from local book store ISBN 978-0-470-18533-9 (8th ed, copyright 2008). It came with a the ODE architect CD (version 1.6), which I assume is the same one this book comes with. Mine partially worked (I had to manually install it), except for the multimedia module (ODE Architect MM), which completely DIDN'T work on my Windows Vista 32 bit. It gave a floating point error when it loaded and basically hanged. I did find a thread in the [...] forums about someone having an install problem with ODE Architect using Vista-64, and they recommended using an older Windows version on a virtual machine. So I eventually tried this and did finally get it to work. Here's what I did: (1) Installed Microsoft Virtual PC 2007. (2) Installed Windows 98 SE onto the Virtual PC (smaller install than WinXP). I got an error during install, but rebooted the VM and it finished OK. (3) Installed the MVPC2007 \\"add-on\\" onto the Windows 98 SE image (note: this is important, you will still get errors if you don't do this step. This \\"add-on\\" is built into MVPC2007, you just have to click the button to install it onto your Win98SE image). (4) Installed ODE Architect from the CD to the Win98SE Virtual image. --- And now I can actually run the multimedia program! It's nice, but perhaps not absolutely necessary if you don't want to go through the work (I just felt I was missing out on something). Hopefully you won't need this info because you get a newer CD which works OK on your OS. I thought I would post the info anyway though, just in case.Update: Well, I was going through a module today and still got a TB50 error, so it's not completely error proof with this microsoft virtual PC. But I think it is 95% working."},{"Title":"I Love Yoga (Yoga for Kids)","review":"My children are too young for the yoga classes offered in my area (and there are very few studios).

Finally a great yoga book for kids. Some of the other instructional books out there seem boring to my children...and me! This book is so well done. Some of my kids do yoga regularly and some don't, but they all enjoy looking at this book and trying the yoga poses. The pictures are very self explanatory. For the non-readers, the children are able to look at the pictures and do the poses.

We see the world through his eyes, and we see how well it serves him, keeping him wealthy and comfortable. While he may notice that some suffer and are oppressed, he is not moved to do anything that would make a difference for them. Instead, he justifies his indifference with a sense of racial and class superiority.Gordimer captures the mental framework of someone who feels little or nothing for the misfortunes of others. What is interesting for the reader is that it requires an effort to step out of his mind and see his thoughts and behavior for what they are -- insensitive, self-serving, and at times brutal.Gordimer finds him at a time in his life when he is middle-aged and living alone, no longer married, his grown son estranged from him, and his mistress not all that endeared to him. While money, property, and influence keep him at a safe distance from the political troubles slowly encroaching on his private world, Gordimer reveals his physical and emotional isolation. His defense is to cut his losses and retreat even farther into his solitary world. It's a fascinating, well-written character study."},{"Title":"The Conservationist","review":"Gordimer's Booker-prize winning novel is one of the least overtly political of her works--at least in the most traditional understanding of &quot;political fiction&quot; (fiction about the machinations of state power). Yet the book remains a forceful, intricate exploration of power, as timely today as it was in 1974, as relevant to contemporary America as it was to minority-ruled South Africa. I have read--and written about--each of Gordimer's novels, and The Conservationist remains a favorite. Nowhere else in contemporary English-language fiction have I found such memorable passages about landscape; nowhere else have I found such a subtle exploration of self. I recommend the novel to anyone remotely interested in the modernist novel, to anyone who has ever sat under the spell of Virginia Woolf (Gordimer, too, is a Woolf reader), to anyone who turns to literature for both Beauty and that old hound Truth."},{"Title":"The Conservationist","review":"Gordimer, as always, provides the reader with stunning, vivid descriptions; living imagery. She describes life on the South African veld, the contrasts between city and country life, and the relationships among people that inhabit this backdrop. Gordimer is always subtle and endows her characters with a realism that illustrates her mastery of perspective and point of view. She intrinsically understands the different people about whom she writes and expertly conveys her understandings to people like me, who can only imagine a world in which daily, mundane details of life are shocking but accepted in apartheid-era South Africa.Like much of Gordimer's work, The Conservationist starts out slowly, but draws the reader into its intricacy with its exploration of the human mind and the development of human relationships.The main character of the book, Mehring, is a wealthy businessman who owns a farm in the veld, mostly just to be able to says he owns the farm. His relationships are probed in the book... including relationships with his teenage son, his mistress (who is somewhat of a liberal supporting equality for the South African blacks.) Gordimer is most adept at exposing some of the hypocrisy inherent in these people's dealings.Gordimer writes some of the most powerful passages I have ever read, including the following: &quot;Change the world but keep bits of it the way I like it for myself-- who wouldn't make the world over if it were to be as easy as that. to keep anything the way you like it for yourself you have to have the stomach to ignore-- dead and hidden- whatever intrudes. Those for whom life is cheapest recognize that.&quot;Taken out of context perhaps this comment does not have the same impact, but it is an invitation to read the book. And all of Gordimer's other works which are equally as important and moving."},{"Title":"The Conservationist","review":"Oddly enough, I could appreciate the magnificent density of this book less from reading it than by thumbing through it afterwards. Only then could I see the intricacies of its recurrent images, its shifts of voice and time, and the rapid interplay of the separate cultures -- white, black, and Indian -- which made up South Africa in the last years of Apartheid. It is not an easy book to follow; drift for even a moment, and you lose track of who is talking about whom. Other readers have compared Gordimer to Faulkner and Virginia Woolf; I personally find her slightly easier than Faulkner, but a lot more difficult than Woolf -- mainly because it is not only Gordimer's style that is strange to me, but her entire world. These are people who live under outrageous legal and social conventions and consider them normal; they inhabit a country where even ordinary things can have strange names (like \\"mealies\\" for corn, or \\"vlei\\" for shallow lake), and apparently ordinary words (such as \\"location\\") can have special meanings. But I am grateful for the insight; from first page to the last, this book breathes authenticity.The Conservationist of the title, a wealthy industrialist named Mehring, buys a weekend farm and works to restore it. This puts him into a new relationship with his black employees, his Boer neighbors, and the land itself. As the ecological task turns out to be largely beyond him, the title comes to have other meanings: the conservation of the way of life of a privileged elite, the preservation of a benevolent patronage between the races, and the search for a basic humanity. Mehring may fail, but he is not a bad man nor, as some have suggested, a cold one. We will meet his like again inDISGRACEby fellow South African Nobelist JM Coetzee -- a much easier novel, though less rich. The protagonists of both books have some unwise (but here very erotic) sexual encounters, and try to find themselves through closer contact with the land. But whereas Coetzee's antihero must learn to cope with a world that has changed more quickly than he can, Gordimer's is trapped in the cul-de-sac of a society where no progress is possible because the true change has not yet happened.Difficult though the book may be, Gordimer holds everything together by three very special qualities in her writing: the ease with which she penetrates the mind and slips into interior dialogue, an underlying sensuality in almost everything she writes, and a deep love of the African landscape. A single example must suffice; in the midst of lovemaking, Mehring thinks of the landscape of nearby Namibia: \\"The dunes of the desert lie alongside the road between Swakopmund and Walvis Bay. Golden reclining nudes. Torso upon torso, hip sweeping from waist, smooth beyond smoothness, suggesting to the tactile imagining only the comparison, in relation to the hand, of the sensation of the tongue when some substance evanesces on it.\\" Simple images shifting and becoming denser. Complex writing, perhaps, but appropriate to a novel fueled equally by love and despair, that attempts to shine a moral clarity upon a situation that is virtually impenetrable."},{"Title":"The Conservationist","review":"I never properly understood this book until I lived in South Africa. The myth of the veld -- dating back to the early 20th Century in South African literature -- and the use of land by white South Africans historically is a very powerful force in the region. This book explodes the myth of the veld and the respect some have had for the earth in a way that is very compelling."},{"Title":"The Conservationist","review":"This is the story of Mehring, a wealthy high class businessman and landowner from Transvaal who narrated his life throughout internal monologues, reflections and fragment of conversations with the distant son, lovers, adquaints and the workers of his farm, giving us and idea of how empty and lonely without love or ilusions his life is but at the same time full of wealth and privilegues.Ms Gordimer - using Mehring character - gave us a portrait of a South Africa divided by the Apartheid where social status is linked with the color of the skin and at the same time gave us an idea of the idiosyncracy of all the characters mentioned in this story, the boers, indians and blacks who interact and live together but separated by the racial laws of South Africa."},{"Title":"The Conservationist","review":"Cuando terminas de leer El Conservador, suspiras, descansas, dejas caer el brazo por encima del sill&oacute;n y sueltas el libro. Cuando has llegado al fin te devuelves p&aacute;ginas arriba (como un salm&oacute;n por el r&iacute;o, a saltos) para confirmar que lo que t&uacute; crees haber comprendido era eso exactamente, eso que te cuenta la se&ntilde;ora Gordimer en las &uacute;ltimas l&iacute;neas de su novela.Te encuentras con el final llevando el mismo paso que te marcaron desde el comienzo. Porque nuestra autora nunca pierde la compostura. Como en la fotograf&iacute;a que acompa&ntilde;a la solapa, ella no se despeina, no se le mueve un pelo, ni para encontrar un cad&aacute;ver ni para describir un demonio. Su prosa es contenida y espesa. &iquest;O debiera decir contenida \\"pero\\" espesa?Si lo que busca es transmitir dolor por medio de la arquitectura de su prosa, ella lo consigue. No puedo dejar de pensar en William Faulkner, probablemente el primero en saltar por encima del relato sumario para encontrar esa forma de contar que consiste en inducir al lector, en llevarlo a empujones, a saltos, &iquest;qu&eacute;?, &iquest;c&oacute;mo?, &iquest;cu&aacute;ndo? Bien, ella, como Faulkner, escriben como quien teje -dig&aacute;moslo as&iacute;- por el rev&eacute;s. Y como levantar esta construcci&oacute;n no es simple, porque todo el tiempo vemos palabras antes que texto, el relato suele resentirse de dinamismo, de vuelo en altura, de ca&iacute;das al vac&iacute;o, todo ello en raz&oacute;n de un intelectualismo que apela a un lector que tiene todo el tiempo por delante, que se ha vuelto invulnerable a los finales amplios como sabanas, y que no se obstina en que la literatura sea entretenci&oacute;n, pura y simple entretenci&oacute;n.Creo que de esto &uacute;ltmo adolece gravemente esta novela. No entretiene, no seduce con el suspenso, con la prestidigitaci&oacute;n con que el autor persuade al lector de que ning&uacute;n destino (literario, al menos) puede arrogarse un final predecible. La novela es, tambi&eacute;n, entretenci&oacute;n. Leemos para escapar de la rutina y no, como en este caso, para volver a caer en ella. Considero esta novela como buena literatura para escritores, para estudiantes en busca de temas de tesis. Al lector que busque entretenci&oacute;n inteligente (para decirlo como Somerset Maugham) le recomiendo devolver este libro al estante."},{"Title":"The Conservationist","review":"Written during, and extensively alluding to, South Africa in the mid 70's during the shifting moods of apartheid,the novel is about Mehring, a wealthy business man at the peak of South African elite society who has added a 400 acre farm to his list of aquisitions.Divorced and estranged from his son, who holds new ideals of equality, Mehring only earns superficial respect from his farmhands, led by Jacobus, who see him as merely a transient presense. During a drought, a dead blackman is found on Mehring's farm whom the authorities are to lazy to investigate or do anything about.When the floods come the dead body resurfaces..I found this a really absorbing, powerful book that survives its apartheid setting as it paints a much broader picture of mans relationship with the forces of nature he cannot control, and of the dislodging of an ancient culture that has formed to be in harmony with its surrounds by one fixated on money,power and alleged progress.Written in fragments and overlapping stories, this reminds of Dos Passos, Sartre (in \\"The Reprieve\\") and Vargos Llosa in \\"Coversations in the Cathederal\\", it won't be to everyones taste. I love this style as it absorbs, demands concentration, and creates a much larger picture than books twice the length.For that, I would recommend 'getting into' this style; maybe reading other works by Gordimer prior to this, as this is well worth savouring."},{"Title":"The Conservationist","review":"Slowly engaging, this story weaves the life of an African farm into that of its weekend farmer. Thoughtful and compassionate."},{"Title":"The Conservationist","review":"This book impressed me in a strange way. It doesn't have a storyline. It is almost uneventful if you will. The text depicts a general situation in which a rich businessman decides to buy a farm in order to escape city life once a week. There he finds himself constrained to live with people of other ancestries in late 1960s/early 1970s South Africa. Social and cultural tensions are present all the time and they are much more disturbing because Mrs. Gordimer doesn't state them as such, but chooses to weave them into everyday's life in a way that is so matter-of-fact.The narrative is not linear, so I decided to go with the flow and it worked fine for me."},{"Title":"The Conservationist","review":"The Conservationist was shortlisted for the Booker of Bookers and Gordimer won the Nobel Prize for Literature for her body of work. I liked the Conservationist though it's not a book that I've thought a lot about since I read it about 6 months ago.It is focused on Mehring, a rich white man in South Africa. He doesn't appear to be an evil man but certainly demonstrates the famous quote , \\"The only thing necessary for evil to flourish is for good men to do nothing.\\" He is very accepting of apartheid and the ingrained social structure.Mehring lives an empty existence, content in his financial comfort but missing something in his life. He has everything and yet nothing.I really enjoyed reading about South Africa in the 70s as written in that time. It had a very real feel to it. It takes a very neutral approach and is not preachy nor is it overtly political. It simply lets the reader reach the obvious conclusions.I think this is a good book and an enjoyable read but and I was surprised at it being shortlisted for the Booker of Bookers.

Rybakov *was* Pankratov -- he knows whereof he speaks.I cannot agree with Kirkus Reviews' damnation-with-faint-praise. There are weaknesses in &quot;Fear,&quot; but many of them are due to a somewhat clunky translation which alternates over-literalism with quaintly inapposite English idiom, and also has a problem handling Russian verb aspect and verb reflexivity in the translation. These faults can certainly not be ascribed to Rybakov! Kirkus also considers Sasha a minor character (i.e., as opposed to Stalin) -- clearly not true; it is Sasha who represents the Russian people, as they are and as they should be.I do share the Kirkus criticism of several of the (actually) minor characters. Home-town love interest Varya Ivanova, who sowed numerous wild oats in &quot;Children of the Arbat,&quot; has become a plaster saint in &quot;Fear,&quot; really too good to be true. NKVD agent Yuri Sharok is a plaster villian: you can see the black hat on his head all the time. But several of the other lesser characters are excellently drawn, particularly some of Sasha's comrades in exile and in post-exile wandering.One is tempted to write that the character of Stalin is overdrawn -- that is, until one remembers that the hell of the 1930s purges really did happen. Rybakov does a fantastic, and thoroughly chilling, job of getting into the mind of the mad despot.I'm sure that for full value this book should be read in Russian -- while not fluent, I do know enough of that expressive language to spot many of the clunkers. But even in English, this book stands alone in bringing to life the reality and horror of the Purges."},{"Title":"Fear (Ome)","review":"Rybakov's sequel toCHILDREN OF THE ARBATcontinues chronicling the lives of five Soviet youth in the 1930's, as they mature and begin to go their separate ways: the protagonist, Sasha exiled to Siberia (a blessing in disguise, as he misses the worst of the Terror), Yuri is recruited into the NKVD, others struggling with a spiritual crisis as they begin to see the idealism that so swept them up following the Revolution replaced with the cruelty and fear of the \\"Yezhovschina.\\" The gradual growing apart of the \\"children of the Arbat\\" is universal, I think, as young men and women shed their childhood friends, strike out on their own and begin to find their own way in the world. Rybakov does a marvelous job in showing this with his characters. With the backdrop of Stalin's Terror - and how each individual wrestles with the uncertainty, sense of foreboding and the fear of the time gave an added dimension to the conflict and heightened the sinister mood of that place and time. Had Rybakov focused exclusively on his primary characters, it would have been a five-star book.Instead, Rybakov also devotes a large part of the book to Stalin. His internal monologues illustrating his paranoia (and strongly suggesting he was insane) were a real distraction; I also strongly disagree with the assumption that Stalin was crazy - ruthless, cold-blooded and monsterous, to be sure, but hardly insane. I would have much prefered him to remain an ancillary character.While a seminal Soviet book (Rybakov originally published it as samizdat in the 70s before it was finally published under glasnost'), I didn't find it as powerful as _Children of the Arbat_; it also drifted thematically. I look forward to reading the conclusion to the trilogy, as I am invested in the lives of the characters, with the hope that there is a stronger catharsis than provided here."},{"Title":"Fear (Ome)","review":"The Arbat Saga continues and , together with greats such as Arthur Koestlers 'A Darkness At Noon' Vassily Grossmans 'Forever Flowing'and the works of Solzhenitsyn ,the Orwellian terror of the Stalin years in the Soviet Union been captured so accurately. The true characters of some of the people who we met in Children of The Arbat are revealed. Sasha Pankratov becomes a wiser,more cynical man who finally realises the nature of the Communist society in Russia. Varya Ivanova blooms into a remarkable young women who faithfully waits for Sashas return and through her mistakes,trials and tribulations has gained great strength One of the most touching aspects of the book is the relationship between Varya and Sashas mother Sophia Alexandrovna who Varya is devoted to and who sees Varya as a beloved daughter Together they help each other through these terrible times .Yuri Sharok fully integrates himself into the NKVD with all the cunning and cruely which this evil organisation requires .Vadim Marasevitch shows himself up as a spineless flunky who sells innocent people out in order to survive.However unlike Sharok ,his conscience destroys him psychologically in MacBethesque fashion.His sister Vika -as opportunistic and immoral as she can be-has to be admired for managing to extricate herself from the Soviet tyranny and through an opportune marriage resettling in democratic France where through her husband and an aqauaintance with a colourful Russian emigre/celebrity she enjoys the high life she has always yearned for.Nina Ivanova for all her blind loyalty to the Communist Party falls victims to its brutal machinations and ,helped by Varya, flees to the Far East ,to escape being another victim of the purges,to her soldier boyfriend Maxim Kostin. Rybakov's extensive delving into Stalins mind is a brilliant study of evil. Ultimately we learn how tyranny and removal of even the most basic freedoms destroys the lives of so many ordinary people . We are forced to realise the terrible horrors we create by letting power be concentrated in the hands of one man,group,clique or party"},{"Title":"Fear (Ome)","review":"This is the second volume of the Trilogy of which The Children of the Arbat was the first (see my Amazon Review). It continues to document Stalin's reign of terror, now after the murder of Kirov in November 1934. The balance between politics at the centre and the impact on the \`Children of the Arbat' we met in the first volume has shifted markedly towards the former - not, I think, to the advantage of the book as a whole. We are sometimes given solid chunks of history in the sort of detail which are more appropriate to a history book than to a historical novel. Towards the end of the book, for example, the fictional characters become involved with a General Skoblin, who really existed and whose story as a triple agent for Russian emigr&eacute;s in Paris, for the Soviet Union and for Nazi Germany, is told in rather indigestible detail. While the main political figures - Stalin, Yagoda, Yezhov, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Tukhachevsky and some others - are well known to most who are interested in this period, there are a host of lesser politicians who would be known to real specialists, but who are likely to be unknown to the rest of us and often figure as mere names. It is hard to keep track of them all, not least because they are sometimes referred to by their surname and sometimes by the first name and patronymic.As in the first volume, we have a chilling account of Stalin's thought processes: ceaselessly megalomaniac, paranoid, crafty, cynical, treacherous, ruthless - and actually insane. Though expressed in fictional terms, they are pretty convincing. So are the discussions between Stalin and his henchmen (and on one occasion, between him and the doomed Zinoviev and Kamenev), even when one wonders whether they actually happened. The physical and mental cruelty that is unleashed on them (and later, even more savagely, on the victims of the subsequent trials) to force confessions from them are sickening to read about, anticipated though they have been by Koestler's Darkness at Noon. Rybakov also from time to time ends his chapters with historical passages in italics describing the fate of the victims and of their families in so far as these are not in the body of the work.As far as the Children of the Arbat are concerned, we see how the Fear of the title permeates them all, even those who are instruments of the regime. The slightest chance remark, the slightest acquaintance, past or present, with anyone who is already in trouble, the slightest \\"error\\" in carrying out the tasks with which they have been charged, moving a bust of Stalin in a van and securing it by tying it to the side of the van with a rope around its neck, - any of these can and often do spell their ruin. And among Stalin's entourage a young man was shot because Stalin caught a look of dismay on his face when Stalin coarsely used his fingers instead of a paper-knife to separate uncut pages in a new book. (Fact or fiction?)If the trilogy has a central figure it is Sasha Pankratov, who in the first volume had been exiled to Siberia just before the most intense phase of Terror, following the murder of Kirov, began. When Sasha's three year term of exile was over, the local police chief released him, and Sasha did not face the fate that befell so many other exiles whose sentence was simply prolonged or renewed. In Siberia he had been cut off from personal experience of the wholesale terror which could indiscriminately sweep up the humblest of citizens. A very telling part of the book is how swiftly Sasha comes to realize how infinitely more dangerous life had become since May 1934 than it had been even before, what strategies one has to adopt not to be trapped into some unwary remark. Even asking for the name of a popular song which had circulated since that date would betray his dangerous record as a recently returned exile. But Sasha's story loses tension towards the end of the book which, at 686 pages, is perhaps overlong.The book, I think, fails to be the epic it is said to be in the blurb. A true epic has to have a heroic element in it, and there really cannot be anything truly epic about a society reduced to craven terror by an insane tyrant and his toadies, great and small. Even so, we get an invaluable picture of life in the Soviet Union, from top to bottom, during this terrible time."},{"Title":"Fear (Ome)","review":"Rybakov is a master story teller and tiller of the human soul.I have read few books that have a better story and that tell it as well.

What I found instead was a somewhat Orwellian perspective on information control seasoned with a generous amount of hubris. Baker envisions a future where the plutocrats conduct their business in utmost security, where only those with worthy causes are allowed access to strong cryptography. The first question that comes to my mind is: who will determine which individuals and corporations have &quot;worthy&quot; causes? The government? Lawyers, perhaps?

Looking at the book again, I certainly still recall my own feeling that this author was on a different side of the proverbial fence than I have ever been. However, his insight is invaluable and in retrospect, even somewhat balanced, and the issues he brings to light are pertinent.The evolution of thoughts, facts, and opinions similar to the ones found in this book will (imo) be a driving force behind the development of an acceptable solution to the strained relationship between privacy and security which we have all been feeling in one way or another.

Less melodramatic than his previous novel, The American, and therefore showing less of the influence of European writers, Confidence rather establishes familiar Jamesian themes and explores ideas that contrast European Old World and American society, albeit in a style that is rather more light-hearted that his more notable later works, with the advantage however that it is still entertaining and more readable than some of the latter-day novels.The story is centred on Bernard Longueville, a young man travelling freely around Europe, sketching and painting, who meets two fellow Americans in Siena - a Mrs Vivian and her daughter Angela, who he sketches while she inadvertently poses picturesquely outside a church waiting for her mother. Bernard expresses his admiration for the young woman and offers her the sketch, but is not so delicately rebuffed by the rather defensive and dismissive young woman. A few weeks later, Bernard receives a letter from his friend Gordon Wright in Baden Baden, exclaiming that he is in love and wants to be married. Bernard rushes to visit his friend and discovers that the object of his affections is none other than the same young woman he painted in Siena.The majority of the novel explores at length Bernard's attempts to comprehend the actions and motives of Angela Vivian, a young lady who does not act like other society girls such as their rather feather-headed travelling companion Blanche Evers. This attempt to get to the bottom of this strange but undeniably fascinating young woman is initially on the request of his friend Gordon, but Longueville has difficulty coming to terms with his own feelings for Miss Vivian.Confidence is a slight work by James, a little longer than it needs to be, but witty and entertaining all the same, delighting in the \\"intellectual fencing\\" that goes on in the realm of human interaction, relationships and communication, seeking to find truth in the less than precise - and sometimes even contradictory and deceptive - use of language. James manages to do this without over-elaboration, using some nice allusions and metaphors (losing himself to a bout of gambling, although successful, Bernard at one point realises that contrary to the impression of controlling his actions, \\"he had not been playing - he had been played with\\"), and without the extravagant verbosity, over-analysis and sometimes unendurable length of his latter works."},{"Title":"Confidence (Notable American Authors)","review":"Two leisure-burdened young Americans frolic around Europe during the 1850s. One is rich and science minded and without a sense of humor or common sense, the other just well to do and art minded and a little inconsistent and frivolous. They meet some women and try to figure out what they think of them. The artsy one (Bernard) is more in the focus of the narration. His friend (Gordon) asks him to figure out what he thinks of the woman to whom he has recently proposed and who has rejected him (Angela).Our hero tries to do that and the inevitable complications happen. The woman becomes aware of the consulting project and sabotages the investigation by odd behavior. (This situation is reminiscent of the physics problem that the observation of an experiment tends to interfere with the results of the experiment.)The basic story sounds as old and solid as a Boccaccio tale. The Decamerone would have gone straight for a love affair between the hero and his spying object, but James didn't do things nice and easy. He thrives on the roundabout way. Frankly speaking, James overdoes the complications of the plot towards the end. Had it shut down after 25 chapters instead of 30, the novel were better.James lets the spy give his friend a negative verdict on the advisability to renew the quest for the woman. Decisions in other directions are taken (Gordon marries somebody else), but there will be a later re-match, a second round of guessing.The novel is structured like an hour glass: the first half set in Italy and Germany, then an interruption (with an un-detailed Asia trip), then a continuation, some years later, in NY and France. By now, Bernard has started to feel the emptiness of his life, while Gordon has at least started doing something: he owns a chemistry research lab (unclear if for profit or not).One of my favorite little texts by Bert Brecht is this:Herr K met a man whom he had not seen for a while. You have not changed, said the man. Herr K paled.Consider this Jamesian version, which has clear historical precedence, making Brecht a plagiarist:You are the same man I used to know (says Gordon to Bernard when they meet again).I am sorry for that (says Bernard). (The dialogue is repeated by two other protagonists later in the story.)"},{"Title":"Confidence (Notable American Authors)","review":"I wish that I had met (main character) Bernie Loungeville in the 20's... riding across Europe in a traincar... what an interesting trip that would have been."},{"Title":"La Vida Del Cuore","review":"I do not know how this book is because my library does't &quot;agree with the language used in this book&quot;.

I just love how this book uses a variety of study films to correspond to the different elements/chapters. It really helps to visually see a film and see how it looks on a script. While reading this book I was actually inspired to start thinking and re-thinking some of my own concepts and have been working thoughtfully on a couple different outlines. Now I can look at just about any film and break it down to all it's separate elements and understand how and why the writers pieced it together in such a way. This book has given me great deal of knowledge, tools, and confidence to where I feel I'm ready to start putting it all into practice and finding my own style as a writer. This book is great for those who are passionate about creating screenplays that are intelligent just as they are entertaining. It doesn't constantly hammer the industry standard into your head.. while thats certainly helpful and necessary to know.. thats another book. This book is more concerned with the craft rather than how to deal with a cut-throat industry."},{"Title":"Secrets of Screenplay Structure","review":"This is a really good screenplay book. I've probably read 40 of them, and mostly like them all, but this particular one is long on nuts and bolts and \\"how to,\\" and short on gratuitous \\"Hollywood\\" advice, which after the first 25 or so screenplay books becomes obnoxious, even if true."},{"Title":"Secrets of Screenplay Structure","review":"First off, it is important to watch the films in the order presented in the book. Each chapter builds upon the previous ones in a very logical and intuitive fashion. I watched each film, read the screenplays I could get my hands on, then read the corresponding chapter. Occasionally, I rewatched the film afterwards. This is a lengthy process, but it was well worth it. I felt like I was attending my own personal film school!A short round up chapter at the end would have been welcome, but I suppose it wasn't really necessary.

When talking story structure, it's all about the forest, not the trees."},{"Title":"Secrets of Screenplay Structure","review":"I didn't think a book on feature screenwriting could contain so much information that is helpful, clear and new. This is a wonderful book, written in a clear style that doesn't tell you how to write a screenplay, but what goes into making a great screenplay. And instead of analysing the screenplays, which are often quite different from the films we see on the screen, she discusses the actual films in screenplay terms. Unlike many other books, this book is not filled with references to films no one has ever seen or the popular films everyone says they like, but they don't remember why. Instead, she has limited the number of reference films making for manageable and helpful examples. The films discussed were excellent (although I might lose some of those listed in the appendix). This book also has 2 meaty chapters on ENSEMBLE FILMS and NONLINEAR FILMS. I've yet to see another book that gives more than 2 or 3 pages on these topics.

It has concrete examples which I find make the difference in understanding. If like me, you are still trying to get a good handle on this whole, sometimes mysterious writing process, this is a great manual."},{"Title":"Secrets of Screenplay Structure","review":"As a twenty year veteran of the television movie screenwriting wars, I love this book. The basic approach is to examine the structure of a number of generally well regarded and famous movies and see what makes them tick. The intention is to help writers construct believable, unpredictable and exciting plots and characters.The book is also a fascinating introduction to the real world of filmmaking, since it deals with production changes that are often made to &quot;finished&quot; shooting scripts.I guarantee you'll see these movies in a whole new way, even famous old titles like CASABLANCA and CITIZEN KANE, no matter how many other &quot;similar&quot; books on screenwriting you've read.WITNESS is obviously one of Linda Cowgill's favorite films, and it gets a detailed going over. The writers Earl Wallace and William Kelly wrote a great script. Linda J tells us how and why.(Ironically, the way she breaks down the structure of a movie script comes very close to the seven act structure of a television movie. Needless to say, she provides a lot more rationale for this than the need for commercial breaks!)A more brilliant analyst would be hard to find, and she doesn't shy away from dealing with fine movies that may seem to violate her own rules; QUIZ SHOW and ANNIE HALL, for example (I'd like to see her tackle KING KONG next!). She obviously has the qualifications of a writer and teacher in a higher degree than most of her contemporaries (and seniors), and seems to me a great deal more stimulating."},{"Title":"Secrets of Screenplay Structure","review":"Along comes a another book on screenwriting, and what do you know, it does have new things to say and better ways of saying the old things. Clear points, great example films, laying out not a formula but points to consider when looking for the best way to tell a story. As a writer, I know that not all stories will make good or great screen stories. Cowgill's book tells you why. Screenplays need characters who are active to bring a story to life. Structure is the way you understand a characters actions in drama, so that a story has meaning. I especially liked Cowgill's chapter on theme. No one says it better explaining why theme plays such a big part in determining the greatness of a film. And how many films today leave you feeling eh? For many it's because no one focused on what the story was ultimately about for the characters, and so it has no meaning for us. She has many great points, all well-said and important. Do yourself a favor, buy this book. Not only will it help you write a better screenplay, it'll help you get more out of the films you see."},{"Title":"Secrets of Screenplay Structure","review":"Ms. Cowgill's book is, simply, the most engaging screenwriting book I have read. At last, someone doesn't talk &quot;around&quot; screenwriting and bring up the occasional example; on the contrary, her book is one big example! By watching the study film in each chapter, you have an immediate point of reference where the concepts you just read about come alive on the screen and make complete sense in your head. I continue to read the various chapters over and over. Note: Some chapters tend to be repetitive, especially as she brings up plot structure in various chapters, but it doesn't harm the overall brilliance of this book."},{"Title":"Secrets of Screenplay Structure","review":"Secrets of Screenplay Structure will help writers and film buffs to understand how and why great films work, as well as how great form and function can combine to bring a story alive.

Not only does it clearly explain how to structure your screenplay but it does what no other screenwriting text does - it gives very in depth examples of how these structural elements work in well known great screenplays. The author is extremely knowledgeable and well versed, being an instructor and a professional screenwriter herself. The knowledge she imparts is highly useable, it's not just there to make academic points.

The build from chapter to chapter and film to film flows beautifully to complete a comprehensive view of the whole picture of screenwriting. Without qualification, I recommend this book to beginners and professionals alike."},{"Title":"Secrets of Screenplay Structure","review":"Linda Cowgill's Secrets of Screenplay Structure is the finest example of accessible scholarship I have ever read. (I say this as a UCLA Ph.D. in Comparative Literature). Not only is it evident that Cowgill is someone who has what it takes to write REAL screenplays with depth and intelligence (we need more of those!), it is clear that she also has the ability to take the best films apart--like swiss watches--and help us understand exactly what makes them tick. And like a swiss watch, Cowgill's book is exceptionally well put together.A listing of the titles of the 18 succinct chapters of Secrets of Screenplay Structure might help give an indication of the tremendous scope and depth of Cowgill's book, which analyzes and illustrates all of the major elements of story through film. Each chapter features a current or classic &quot;study film,&quot; to illustrate its chapter's main points.The book is divided as follows:1)The Essence of Dramatic Structure; 2)The Three-Part Nature of Screenplay Structure (&quot;Witness&quot;); 3) Five key Focal Points (focusing on the THREE-ACT structure and its segments) (&quot;Risky Business&quot;); 4)Characterization's Relationship to Structure--including the vital point of character development and its relationship to plot structure(&quot;Casablanca&quot;); 5)Theme's Relationship to Structure (&quot;The Piano&quot;); 6)The Structure of Plotting (&quot;Chinatown&quot;); 7) Review, which includes detailing the mechanics of what characters WANT and what,in contradiction, they NEED (&quot;Quiz Show&quot;); 8)The Structure of Subplots (&quot;Tootsie&quot;); 9) Structure and the Ensemble Film (&quot;Diner,&quot; &quot;Parenthood,&quot; &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives,&quot;Grand Hotel&quot;); 10) Structure and the Nonlinear Plot (&quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and others); 11)Building Momentum: Structuring Scene and Action Sequences (&quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;); 12) Openings and Main Exposition (&quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;); 13)The Middle--the Rising Action; (&quot;North by Northwest&quot;) 14)The Main Climax and Resolution (&quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot;); 15)The Structure of Planting and Payoff (&quot;Groundhog Day&quot;); 16)The Structure of Scenes (&quot;Se7en&quot;); 17)Dialogue (&quot;It Happened One Night&quot;); 18)The Subtext of Meaning (&quot;Thelma and Louise&quot;).Cowgill's study films are works that have been used as examples in many other current screenplay writing books. However, Cowgill presents these films with a fresh, exceptionally insightful perspective, never wavering from the point she wishes to teach through the films' specific examples. Her thought is ORGANIZED; her writing is exemplary: clear, concise, lively and engaging.I highly recommend Secrets of Screenplay Structure to new and established writers of any form of fiction. It is an elegant work of scholarship and practical advice by an artist in her own right. The only name that comes to mind right now who could pull off such dual and contradictory roles is that of T.S. Eliot.Carol Zapata-Whelan, Ph.D. California State University, Fresno"},{"Title":"Secrets of Screenplay Structure","review":"She's got the &quot;Recognize&quot; part down cold. The analyses are excellent. &quot;Emulate,&quot; however, is almost entirely absent, except in the vaguest of terms. This book has helped me to become a slightly better viewer of movies, but not a significantly better writer of screenplays.That's my major quibble. My minor quibble is the constant use of the word &quot;great&quot; when, in fact, what's really meant is &quot;extremely solidly constructed, with clear points of interest for commentary.&quot; Not the same thing.If you just don't know what makes a story tick, this book is good for getting you up to speed. If you already know what makes a story tick, and you're looking to expand your understanding in a practical, useful way, this is not a good book for it. For instance, I already understand what a subplot is--but being able to recognize it in a diagram after the fact isn't the same thing as knowing how to construct one. This book is mostly &quot;Look at what a subplot looks like after you've made one.&quot; Again, recognition rather than emulation.Worth the time, and interesting. But not as practically useful as I would have preferred."},{"Title":"Secrets of Screenplay Structure","review":"This is a terrific concept for a screenwriting book. It is structured like a screenwriting course, laying out its foundation with a limited number of study films to clearly illustrate how screenplays are constructed. The author doesn't use a convoluted language, but gets right to the point, explaining what goes into in a great screenplay and film. This book is a classic. What's even better are the detailed chapters on ensemble and nonlinear films. No other screenplay book I've seen takes on this daunting task of analysing these two difficult types of film structures. At the end of each chapter, Cowgill discusses a final draft or late draft of each study film's screenplay and compares it with changes made to the final film. What would have been more interesting is to include a discussion of the selling screenplay, but that's a minor quibble. This is a great book for anyone interested in screenwriting or just understanding film in general. A real 5 star achievement."},{"Title":"Secrets of Screenplay Structure","review":"&quot;If you were stuck on a deserted island with a typewriter, and with what you think is a great story, this is the one book you'll want with you.

I need more value for my script procrastinating dollar."},{"Title":"Secrets of Screenplay Structure","review":"This book is a real find! I've read more than a few screenwriting manuals, and have film and television credits, but this is one of the best. Instead of just laying on theory and formulas, this book leads you through the principles of screenwriting. It builds on fundamentals and really teaches you what to look for when you analyse a movie, then it helps you then apply these same criteria to your own project. The book uses a limited number of film examples, directing you to watch these films either before or while you read a chapter. (If you can find a copy of the script, she tells you to read this before you watch the film! But watch the film!)This is especially helpful, because the points made become crystal clear. Many films change between even the final shooting script and the movie that's made. Cowgill addresses this, showing why changes are made and talks about what makes the film better. Limiting the number of example films is also helpful, because you are not overwhelmed by information on films you have never seen or have no intention of seeing. For the most part, she selects popular and great films for each of her chapters.Author Cowgill also includes a detailed chapter on nonlinear films. This is a real find. One of the hardest structures to master, very little has been written about it to help a writer working in this area, and yet it's popular with many filmmakers (and very difficult to pull off). Cowgill's work should be a must read for them. But then again, it should be a must for all of us.All in all a great text, and something every screenwriter should have on his bookshelf."},{"Title":"Secrets of Screenplay Structure","review":"You don't just read this book, you &quot;do&quot; it. This book gives you a list of films to go out and rent. After you've watched the film you will read a chapter covering that film with emphasis on certain attributes that made it great. You may not like all the films, but pay attention! You will learn from them. I loved Secrets of Screenplay Structure, and recommend it to all would-be screenwriters."},{"Title":"Secrets of Screenplay Structure","review":"I agree with the observations of all the positive reviewers of this book. As an aspiring novelist, a psychologist, and a movie fan I can add three more: First, this book was tremendously helpful in writing my first novel. The points Cowgill makes about structure in film go beyond simple &quot;how to do it&quot; or &quot;how to sell it&quot; gimmicks, and leave you with a far better appreciation of how, and why, &quot;structure&quot; works in ANY medium, be it film, fiction, or even nonfiction. It's made all the difference in my own writing. Second, as a psychologist I liked both the general depth of her writing and her ability to demonstrate just HOW good structure affects the audience (Robt McKee does, too; his &quot;Story&quot; and this book comprise a great two-volume complete set on this stuff.) Third, as a movie fan, I'd give my greatest recommendation: literally every movie I've seen since reading this book, whether a new flick or an old favorite, has become a completely different and richer experience. If for no other reason, read her to increase your perceptiveness and appreciation of the films you see!"},{"Title":"Secrets of Screenplay Structure","review":"Anyone who appreciates great films will love this book. It gives you insight into how great films are put together, and what really makes one. This book starts at the beginning, yet it doesn't feel like it's written for the beginner. It covers a variety of topics, including nonlinear and ensemble films -- which I, frankly, haven't seen covered in any other screenwriting book, at least not in this depth. This book uses a limited number of films to study, so examples can be viewed, and I loved each film she used. I'd forgotten what terrific films Quiz Show, Risky Business and Tootsie were, and now have a greater appreciation of them. I can't say enough good things about this book. It makes you want to sit down and write your great screenplay, yet also lets you know just how much of a collaborative process it really is to get there."},{"Title":"PUTTING AN END TO THE HUNGER","review":"This book makes you feel like your not alone in this. It has lots of info and experiences. This is a very very very well written book"},{"Title":"Breast Cancer Wars : Hope, Fear, and the Pursuit of a Cure in Twentieth-Century America","review":"Like many others who have discovered this treasure of a highly readable but profoundly illuminating book. I fully agree with Dr. Susan Love, who called it a &quot;riveting&quot; story and &quot;one of the best books I have read in a long time.&quot; As someone who has long been active in the women's health movement I am sure that THE BREAST CANCER WARS will become a fixture on the short list of &quot;must have&quot; titles for any patient or advocate. Dr. Barron Lerner is a gifted writer, a caring clinician(Associate Professor of Medicine and Public Health at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons) a distinguished PhD medical historian, as well as the devoted son of a breast cancer survivor whose &quot;quiet perseverance in the face of a terrifying disease has been an inspiration.&quot; Thus, he brings a thoroughly rounded perspective to the history of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment that (to my knowledge) no other male physician has ever attempted, much less achieved. His fascinating descriptions of the central role that activist patients have played in forcing doctors to treat breast cancer more humanely, and, yes, believe it or not- more scientifically, is a major contribution to modern social and science history. Dr. Lerner's title is well-chosen, as he escorts us through the maze of controversies and &quot;wars&quot; that mark breast cancer diagnosis, treatment and prevention, showing them to be dramatic, amazing, frustrating, sometimes ridiculous, and often highly unfair to patients. While THE BREAST CANCER WARS is not a &quot;how to&quot; book it provides women- and men-with a wealth of necessary background and information that will enable them to become far more savvy and sophisticated on every aspect of any breast cancer discussion."},{"Title":"Breast Cancer Wars : Hope, Fear, and the Pursuit of a Cure in Twentieth-Century America","review":"In trying to understand and have an appreciation for the larger perspective of Medicine, Doctors and the Medical/Cancer Establishment, I found &quot;Breast Cancer Wars...&quot; to be the most insightful and helpful book of its kind that I have read. And in seeking to understand my disease (Leukemia), and the process I have been going through, I have read dozens of books on Health, Healing, Cancer, Medicine, the Medical Establishment etc...Dr. Lerner provides a comprehensive, readable and above all balanced book in which he examines all the factors which impact on the development of a cancer treatment in the U.S. And he maintains this sense of balance while examining what is one of the most emotional, sensitive and controversial areas in all of cancer diagnosis and treatment; Breast Cancer and the Radical Mastectomy.What particularly distinguishes his writing is the way in which he is able to provide a clear, detailed history and narrative while exploring the human, cultural, political, societal and gender-related issues that have impacted on the development and treatment of Breast Cancer.In this extremely controversial and politicized area, he does not look for, or find a villain; his is not an attempt to blame or demonize. And that is a great relief.Instead, in discussing the individuals involved - the physicians who first espoused and continued to advocate the use of Radical Mastectomies and those who opposed it, the prominent women who elected this procedure for themselves, the women who began to oppose the Radical Mastectomy and who challenged the medical system, the women who used their influence and resources to initiate important cancer and support organizations - Dr. Lerner provides very human portraits which helped me to appreciate how and why these individuals developed their views, and how each one of them came to effect the course of the debate and the evolution of Breast Cancer treatment.And he does not fail to convey the tremendous emotional, physical and psychological impact that these doctors, individuals and organizations have had on women coping with Breast Cancer.I recommend this book to anyone who is trying to understand the context of an illness and treatment and the various forces, from individual to societal, which play a role in the treatment of disease in the U.S."},{"Title":"Breast Cancer Wars : Hope, Fear, and the Pursuit of a Cure in Twentieth-Century America","review":"Barron Lerner's \\"Breast Cancer Wars\\" joins Ellen Leopold's \\"Darker Ribbon\\" as an eyeopening look backstage at the Breast Cancer Follies in America. They are both important books, and make many of the same points, but if you are of a mind to read only one history of this disease, make it this one.Leopold's book, written from a frankly feminist (and that's OK)point of view is dry and academic. But as a frank feminist myself, I must say I much preferred Lerner's lively, even juicy, warts-and-all look at the nature of American surgeons and how they make their decisions. But be warned: like they say about watching sausage being made, it ain't pretty. In fact the chapter on super-radical surgery that was the fashion for a, thankfully short, period of time in the 1950's upset me so much that I couldn't sleep that night. Do NOT read that part at bedtime! The phrase \\"human remnant\\" used by one famous surgeon in referring to his patients - or what was left of them when he got through with them - still gives me nightmares.Lerner is himself a doctor - he teaches internal medicine and medical history at Columbia, so he has an insider's knowledge and interpretive skills that Leopold lacks. In detailing why, exactly, it took nearly half a century for American surgeons to even agree to scientifically test the efficacy and safety of the radical Halsted mastectomy, Lerner exposes the thought processes that dominate the surgical profession. Trust me, you will never look at your doctors the same way.His thoughts on the risk aversive, controling mentality of the American population, and how that is reflected in the kind of doctors and medical procedures we traditionally prefer - the mindset that allowed the Halsted and its horror chamber cousins to hold sway for so long - is particularly important.Toward the end of the book, Lerner touches on chemotherapy - which is a case of poisoning the many in order to help a miniscule few. It is impossible not to see the similarities with the now discredited Halsted. Like the Halsted, chemotherapy is basically a sales job, with no studies that show it is very helpful at all to non-metastatic women. And yet, we risk averse, bigger is better, give it all to me Americans - and our doctors - are embracing it with the same mindless fervor as the radical mastectomy.Wake up folks. Read this book - it is a must."},{"Title":"Breast Cancer Wars : Hope, Fear, and the Pursuit of a Cure in Twentieth-Century America","review":"Before signing the consent forms for my lumpectomy, I asked my surgeon if there was a possibility that I might wake up from my operation without a breast. &quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;we don't do that any longer.&quot;Ah, but they used to. In fact, according to &quot;The Breast Cancer Wars&quot; it was standard procedure during most of the twentieth century for a woman to go under the knife for a biopsy and wake up without her breast, axillary nodes, and her chest wall muscles. If she were unlucky enough to be operated on in the fifties, she might also be minus an arm and part of her rib cage.Chapter 4, &quot;The Scalpel Triumphant: Radical Surgery in the 1950s&quot; is truly grotesque to someone who had her own surgery in December, 2001. One surgeon of that middle decade even accused a colleague of &quot;having performed a 'humanectomy.'&quot; People who went in to the operating room with breast cancer might lose a whole forequarter (clavicle, scapula, and an arm). For reproductive cancers, there was an operation called the hemipelvectomy, &quot;which required removal of the 'hind-quarter': a leg and an adjacent bone from the pelvis.&quot; A surgeon named Pack performed over 200 hemipelvectomies on men and women, acquiring the nickname 'Pack the Knife' from his admiring colleagues.How did the war against cancer come to involve such radical surgeries? According to the author, surgeons gained experience with extreme operations during World War II, where they also learned about the life-saving qualities of blood transfusions and penicillin: &quot;Indeed, the Surgeon General had reported a remarkable 96 percent survival rate among injured World War II military personnel.&quot;When the surgeons returned from the battlefields, they were prepared to take extreme measures against an enemy more ancient than the Nazis. Cancer researcher Michael Shimkin later noted, &quot;'surgeons went radical and then superrradical' during the decade following World War II.&quot;I started reading this book fully prepared to despise William Halsted, the surgeon who invented the radical mastectomy and performed it first in 1882. However that was not to be the case. Halstead was a great surgeon and &quot;believed that his operation, if performed early enough in the course of the disease, could substantially prolong the survival of patients&quot;--as did generations of surgeons following his training and example, even though 75% of their patients were dead five years after surgery.Even after statistics like the above, randomized controlled trials involving lumpectomies and follow-up radiation, womens' activism, better mammography, and a new theory on how breast cancer metastasized, older surgeons performed radical and modified radical mastectomies well into the 1980s--a century after Halstead performed his first. When speaking of one of the old-school surgeons who turned 80 in 1980, Dr. Susan Love, herself a notable breast surgeon, remarked: &quot;It was sad. He had lived too long. He just couldn't make that critical jump.&quot;Dr. Lerner has written a superb medical and cultural history of America's war against breast cancer. Women who are considering treatment options for breast cancer should, at the very least read Chapter 11: &quot;The Past as Prologue--What Can the History of Breast Cancer Teach Us?&quot;"},{"Title":"Breast Cancer Wars : Hope, Fear, and the Pursuit of a Cure in Twentieth-Century America","review":"This is a great read.

Lerner makes a passing reference to Leopold's book, mistakenly dismissing her as a &quot;journalist&quot; and &quot;radical feminist.&quot; Neither appellation is accurate.

The essays are clearly written and well-reasoned, and Mr. Herschman's path through the beginnings of the field, connecting folks I wouldn't have immediately fingered as architectural photographers, was a great read. Unfortunately, as we approach the contemporary (or contemporary for the date of publication), Mr. Robinson gets rather grouchy-old-man on the new photographers, somehow finding William Clift's brilliant juxtaposition of a new international style mirrorglass skyscraper and the more classical/beaux arts courthouse it reflects and fragments a failure, as it does not particularly document for us what the courthouse looks like. There are also no plates in color, a great omission.However, the book is beautifully printed otherwise, and (with those few crochety moments aside) very well written. A last minor gripe is the proportion of the volume. Large and nearly square, reading it would be greatly aided by a lectern; it sits in the hand with all the grace of a beached octopus."},{"Title":"Teddy Bear Treasury, Volume II: Identification & Values: A Salute to Teddy","review":"I love this book.

Good theories should have testable results. This book describes examples in history where the government initiated price controls. It then shows the ill effects such controls caused. The most insightful criticism comes from perceptive contemporary sources who cite the source of their misery. Examples from ancient Eqypt, Hammurabi's Babylon, ancient Greece, French and American revolution, Civil War, World War I and II and the Communism states. The book was written as a polemic against political pressure to freeze prices (remember Nixon's price freeze), yet is still readable and valid today."},{"Title":"Forty Centuries of Wage and Price Controls: How not to Fight Inflation","review":"This is a history of wage and price controls, and a sermon against them.The history portion covers antiquity to modern times, in Asia, Africa, Europe,and the Americas, in democracies, monarchys, and dictatorships of the left andright, from gentle, moral persuassion through \\"jawboning\\" to long prisonsentences and long lists of death sentences.They claim controls have never worked, always cause additional social damage,such as shortages and crime, and often make inflation worse. I know of nocounterexample of their claim.Washington's terrible winter at Valley Forge was caused by the price controlsimposed by the Continental Congress. The Allies retained the Nazi controlsafter WWII. Goering, from prison in 1946, wondered why. He could not makeit work. Why would we repeat his mistake. The German economic miracle startedalmost immediately after controls were ended.Other controllers also admitted their attempts failed. I wish the authorshad collected opinions from all controllers, admitting failure or offeringexcuses. They could not, of course, because there were so many, all divertedfrom doing something that might have been useful.There is an extensive bibliography, a useful index, and chapter notesdocumenting the claims in the main text. They even include a translationof the price fixing portions of the Code of Hammurabi.The sermon at the end is less satisfying. They summarize the historicalevidence, speculate on the process of inflation (but get the cause right-- government), and try to demolish the plans they feared Jimmy Carterwas about to launch.This book is over 25 years old. I did not notice anything that would haveto be erased from the history section for a second edition, just change thespeculation about Carter's actions to history and add a few more chapters.I recommend this book for all politions, and all voters.

In some cases it is due the lack of information from very old scenarios and in other cases I think the authors tried to keep it simple enough to be readable.The book is old and if you are looking for recent information, you won't find it.In general, a very interesting and insightful book about a topic not yet understood by a lot of people and governments (e.g. Argentina)"},{"Title":"Max Clifford: Read All About It","review":"Unfortunately, this one doesn't live up to expectations.

As his European world was collapsing in ideological extremism and descending into chaos, Mann turned his imagination to the Semitic and Egyptian worlds of 1600 BCE and invested the prodigious gifts of his ironic imagination in the all-too-human desires and deities of that world. Though it is enormously long--over 1400 pages of smallish print--the Joseph Saga unfolds its treasures of humane perception to the patient reader who savors Mann's delicious comedy. Read it slowly for full effect.Formerly available in Lowe-Porter's impossibly stilted Biblical prose, John Woods continues his Mann-cycle of translations here in what must have been a labor of love. No doubt the audience for this work is only a tiny fraction of that for his earlier Mann translations--especially Magic Mountain and Buddenbrooks. Let's hope Woods is still game for Felix Krull or, perhaps, a large selection of the shorter works. Woods' English is smooth and agreeable most of the time (consistent with Mann's German) and tart and biting when Mann's irony deserves it."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"This is one of the most wonderfull books ever writen, no doubt. The story of the bible is the point of departure for a beautiful analysis of humanity, full of humour and grandeur. The book is big and one has to read it carefully to enjoy it completely. Every sentence is a jewel, every passage is full of simple life elements that wonder and links us to the past to a point were we conclude that being human is a universal experience, independent of time and space. This is all blended in with a carefull historical research, a detailed reading of the Bible and of the sacred texts. A masterpiece at its fully extent that is curiously not that popular in the english language."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"This is the third of Mann's long works that I've read, the first two being \\"The Magic Mountain\\" and \\"Buddenbrooks,\\" in that order, the former being one of my favorites. I'd once read a quote by Mann saying he considered \\"Joseph and His Brothers\\" to be his masterpiece. If so, I used to think, why wasn't it still in print? I suspected it may have been disingenuous on Mann's part. The two novels I just mentioned had already secured Mann's reputation as a master novelist and their staying power must have seemed all but assured at the time. Joseph, on the other hand, was a different story. Apparently, it never attracted near as much attention as those other creations of his. Whether or not Mann truly believed Joseph was worthy of being considered his best work, it was his longest and the one on which he spent his most strenuous effort. Its neglect clearly caused him anxiety. This is all discussed in the translator John E. Woods' introduction to this edition of Joseph, as well as in Mann's introduction from a much older edition which is also included here. Will this latest edition from Everyman help Joseph finally garner the critical acclaim Mann thought it deserved?A potential reader must seriously ponder at the outset the problem of deciding whether or not to read a 1500 page novel based on a quite familiar biblical story of about 40 pages in length. It would seem that the legend of Joseph has done just fine on its own in its inherited form. The main reason I would say to read this, if for no other, is that Mann demonstrates here that he is the consummate scholar-novelist. Beyond its novel aspect, Joseph is really an elaborate commentary and explication on the Book of Genesis and, in a most indirect manner, its impact on the Judeo-Christian heritage. The novel is rewarding in that regard, as well as for its magnificent historical set pieces. We are presented with vignette after vignette of how the people of this time lived and viewed the world, and particularly how myth blended with, indeed was synonymous with, their consciousness and how that determined their actions. Through Mann's glosses of the ancient myths of Egypt and Mesopotamia, one is able to trace the origins of many of the primary theological concepts of the Christian and Jewish faiths.If, however, the astounding scholarship is the novel's strength, then it is also its weakness, for it labors under it. There is too little mystery to the story - we all know what happens from the outset. Mann takes the biblical myth, blows it up, and refills the lacunae. Thus, one can get a better understanding of the motives of the players, and why things may have happened in the biblical myth as presented. To me this is all very interesting, yet academic. In reading a novel I desire the novel experience, and in this I look for characters not pre-determined. This would present quite a challenge to Mann were he not to alter the story. He is often successful in breathing new life into the players. For instance, his portrayal of Esau as the piping, uncouth goat-man and the disdain which Jacob feels for him in that regard; or Abraham as the shadowy figure who spurns the moon citadel of Ur and wanders Mesopotamia, forging a new religion along the way. Yet I feel the novel seldom becomes more than a presentation of exquisite detail, and the character Joseph is always as one would expect him to be. If you love Joseph already, as Mann clearly does, and feel he holds a special place in your faith or worldview, then this will be quite a delightful book. If not, if Joseph is looked upon only as a very important mythical figure with some basis in history, then it may not be so easy to share Mann's 1500 page enthusiasm for him."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"For all the great technological magic of our age we suffer the misfortune of living in a time where the depth of hyperbole rends the edge from language leaving us bereft when the time comes to describe something truly remarkable. Thus to say that John Woods' translation of Thomas Mann's Joseph and His Brothers offers readers a gift of almost indescribable value may leave one wondering if I am making a literally true statement or simply wallowing in the common puff of our day. In this case the latter is the case for Mr. Woods' translation of Mann's great opus offers the reader an experience both challenging and sublime.Readers unfamiliar with Mann's work may feel a sense of vertigo beginning this even more than his other works. Much of the style of narration, unique with its perspective shifting through time, seems almost purposely designed to leave one doubting their footing. Increasing the sense of dread is the books sheer heft, with over 1500 pages of small type and weighing in at almost two and half pounds. Yet those brave souls who resist the temptation to lay down this load in favor of a more easily digested work will come to in the end appreciate the feast to come. Mann's work rests on its own unique rhythm, and once the reader grows acclimated they will surely appreciate both the work and the great skill of Mr. Wood as translator. This series of four novels expounding on the biblical tale of Jacob, his son of Joseph of the famous robe, as well as his brothers, often comes when people engage in the entertaining and fruitless parlor game of determining the greatest literary work of the 20th century. While no single work can claim such a title, the complexity of the work and the Herculean task of translation should be evident that this is only the second instance of its translation into English in the more than 60 years since it first appeared.Beyond simply outlining the work's subject matter, in many ways it seems written with the express intent of defying further description. With a complex web of interrelated stories, occasionally taking subjects that the bible reflects on for only a sentence and expanded on them for a hundred pages and at the same time seeking to place this seminal tale in its religious, historic, and cultural context, the work often leaves the reader gasping at the audacity of Man's enterprise. Yet almost every one of his efforts comes as a remarkable success, leaving one much to ponder. Indeed, any expectation that one can rush through this work will surely leave you with only a headache and little to show for the effort. Instead, one must take their time and slowly chew on Joseph and His Brother's digesting each piece in turn. Like many great works this one takes effort and diligence, but the reward comes as more than just bragging rights for having read it. Far more, it will offer an often eye opening new perspective and beckon from the book shelf to be taken down again so that you may reread this section or that.One last point: to end where I began, Mann's attention to detail and word choice often gives pause, making each of us consider the harm done when we rain down words on a subject when a mere drop would do."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"The philosophical meaning of the book as well as beauty of the language combined with encyclopedic knowledge and mastery of the author are outstanding, but certainly it is not an easy reading.

Certainly, I got what I expected, but also something more: a gripping work of transcendent lyricism, and riveting reading for its many hundreds of pages. Mann gives his characters both monumental depth and thoroughly human qualities, so that you feel that you both know them and are in awe of them. You empathize at the recognizability of their situations, yet you gain so much insight and perspective into a past world and emerging religion. I found the book highly readable, but even for those who find it tough going at first, I recommend staying the course, for one of the most rewarding reading experiences I know."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"It has been a pleasure reading the reviews of others of this magisterial work. We form a kind of brotherhood across space and time in the task of praising to the outside world the grandeur of the work Mann himself considered his magnum opus. I once owned the previous Lowe-Porter translation and could get precisely nowhere with it. Now Mr. Woods has made it accessible to any literate spirit. I use the term \\"spirit\\" advisedly. For in the Prelude, entitled \\"The Descent into Hell,\\" Mann sets forth a cosmogony derived from Gnosticism apparently, in which God permitted the soul, at its urgent request, to descend to earth to intermix with matter and then, in order to redeem the soul from this entanglement sent out a second emissary, as it were, the spirit, from the heavenly realm. But the spirit also got itself overengaged with this earthly compound of soul-matter, losing sight, one might say, of its original mission of rescue, much as an ambassador to a foreign land, if he stays there too long, loses the sense of his original representation and instead becomes an advocate for the foreign country, as Mann points out with exquisite irony. But then, gentle reader, the bombshell explodes, and Mann cuts through all of his own thick and multilayered ironies to set forth what I, at least, consider the strongest sentence I have ever encountered, anywhere:[The spirit] remains, no matter how it presents itself, what it is: the messenger ofwarning, the principle of opposition, umbrage, and wandering, which stirs upwithin the breast of one individual, among all the great host of the lustilycomplacent, an uneasiness at our preternatural wretchedness, drives him outof the gates of the past and the given and into the extravagant adventure ofuncertainty, and makes him like the stone that, once it has broken away andbegins to roll, is destined to set in motion an ever-growing, rolling,incalculable cascade of events. [pp. 35-6]And from this immediately ensues the epic spiritual adventure of Abraham into the uncharted domain of grasping for an understanding of and relationship with the sole and ultimate source of sovereignty in the universe. And if this weren't enough, Mann then goes on to equate Abraham's adventure with the adventure of the storyteller (!) in daring to reach out to compose a tale such as this one.Obviously I could go on forever in this vein, but my sole object is to plant my flag with the other on-line reviewers here and perhaps by this to induce some innocent wandering passerby of a reader to get out there and buy the book and read it, and by that act of participation, under any view a daunting and time-consuming committment, to join in Mann's festival of life, of storytelling as high art, of recapitulating in himself or herself the tradition of absorbing one's own cultural roots at the deepest level of joy and satisfaction.

It took Thomas Mann over 1,400 pages to retell the story just how he wanted it, and the result is one of the best long novels ever written. I'll say up front that I can't recommend this book enough. It's gorgeous, funny, heart-breaking, and intellectually stimulating. If you're like me, you'll want to read it all over again as soon as you finish. It's that good. What follows are some of the reasons why I think this is so.The story is fairly simple. Jacob's son Joseph is sold into slavery by his jealous brothers. Joseph ascends from slavery to the highest office in Egypt. Many years later, Joseph has mercy on his brothers when they come to Egypt because of a famine in their homeland, and the whole family is reunited. It's a little bit Count of Monte Cristo, a little bit of the Odyssey, a little bit Ben Hur, and a whole lot of ancient Near Eastern myth and religion. Anyone familiar with Mann's other novels can already see that this is an uncharacteristically happy subject for Mann's imagination to work its magic on. But after reading all of Mann's major fiction and much of his non-fiction writing, I am convinced that Joseph and His Brothers is his greatest achievement. This tetralogy has the sad warmth of Buddenbrooks, the intellectual play of The Magic Mountain, and the intense creativity of Doctor Faustus, and so much more.More than any other Mann novel, the characters are incredibly loveable and memorable. Jacob, Joseph, Reuben, Rachel, Benjamin, Gad and Asher, Bes and Dudu, Huya and Tuya, Behknakons, Potiphar, Akhenaton, and so many more! (Sorry if I misspelled any of those; my copy of Joseph is in another state at the moment.) As far as long novels go, the only other times I have become so attached to fictional characters were while reading David Copperfield, War and Peace, and The Brothers Karamazov. Mann is sometimes called a novelist of ideas, and there are plenty of beautiful and complex ideas to think about here for years to come, but in Joseph and His Brothers Mann seems more interested than ever before in appealing to the heart.Another reason I think this is Mann's best is the narrative voice. The narrator is incredibly knowledgeable, but also good humored. He teases and hints, constantly winking and pretending that he's just as mystified as the reader is and then summing up several pages of difficult text in a single, perfect sentence. It's a welcoming, friendly voice, and you never feel like you're being talked down to even though you're always being catered to; in other words, it's the voice of a great storyteller.I've run on too much. My enthusiasm when talking about this book always spills over. But I have to say that this hardcover edition from Everyman's Library is THE edition to get. Not only is the type and size and everything about the book itself just perfect, but John E. Woods' translation is an absolute miracle. At no point does the text feel like a translation. If you aren't obliged to read this book in a rush, then read it aloud slowly so you can appreciate Woods' craftsmanship. Overall, just enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"Labor of love indeed, I finally finished this book. 1,492 pages of dense text. It took me 4 months.The book is in serious need of editing: Mann repeats himself often, and not always to good effect.But that said, I kept reading it for a reason: It's good.I can honestly say that I have never read a book using the voice that Mann employed here: Pedantic yet charming, it feels like you are being told a story by a kind hearted professor who sometimes rambles and repeats himself.Of the books by Mann that I have read, this is my favorite, followed by Faustus."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"This isn't really about Joseph and his brothers, but about his father, Jacob. An amazing achievement, taking the bare bones of the biblical story and adding research from Judaism and Egyptian and Near East mythologies and oral histories. Plus Mann went to the land covered in these histories to see it for himself. There is an ironic, slightly satirical tone which surprised me - I thought it would be so religious - not at all. He made everything matter-of-fact and plausible and made the biblical characters come alive as real people, always adding the small details of their way of life then. Jacob seems such a sympathetic man, as Rachel does a woman, but Joseph comes off as a tattle tale, and there is the one line in the bible to support this as in everything of which Mann writes. Such a sad and touching ending to this first book."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"I immediately bought the four volumes in a single hard cover book after hearing a Joseph Campbell lecture on this work. To say I love this book is an understatement. This and The Magic Mountain stand as true literary classics of the 20th century. Mann brings ancient Egypt, the Levant and the Bible to life. Do not hesitate to read these sublime books."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"Thomas Mann has recreated the Old Testament epic of Joseph and brought it to life. I cannot praise the book highly enough. I would recommend it for everyone and consider it to be one of my favorites. The only problem is its length. But if you stick with it, you will be amply rewarded."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"Mann considered this novel to be his greatest achievement. History and critical opinion have begged otherwise. But could Mann maybe have been right? Part of the problem, at least for English speakers, was the lack of a suitable translation. (The only other translation I know of, by Helen Lowe-Porter, was senselessly rendered into stilted King James English. I find it incredible that Mann actually lent his blessing to that translation.) A few years ago, Woods solved that problem brilliantly, rendering Joseph into clear flowing English. To my surprise and delight, Joseph and his Brothers is actually compelling and entertaining reading, and really a far easier read than, say, Doktor Faustus. So, don't let its size scare you off. If you like Mann's other work even a little, try this one."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"Anyone who has read my Listmania \\"Escape Mass Market Fiction\\" knows that I touted this novel (tertrology actually) as having \\".... the most exquisite language since Shakespeare\\". But it is truly beyond that. After 30 years and over 3,000 books read I can affirm that there simply has been no greater work of fiction produced in any century by man or woman. One of the reviewers below was dead-on saying you keep wanting to go back and reread the last 20 pages you managed to finish just to savor the experience. Original editions are a little rare and expensive, but, like any treasure, it's rewards are transcendental, and once read, you can consider yourself part of the most esoteric world of the true literati. NOTE-- Beginners who are easily scared off and prefer to sample first might want to skip the Preludes and go straight to the main chapters."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"I'm at a loss about how to begin a review of the titanic marvel \\"Joseph and His Brothers\\" because of its being so many things, adding fright to the one who tries to properly bring forth what future readers are in store for upon opeing its first page and delving into \\"Descent into Hell.\\"I have never before and doubt ever will again read a 1,500 page 'tale,' let alone one that includes a continuous barrage of gripping stories alongside psychological insight of God-like proportions. What's icing on the cake as to this book's sheer power and unforgettableness is its comic charm. I did not know I was going to be reading what is pretty much a comedy when being pulled into this marvelous Old Testament narrative.If you have read the biblical account of Jacob and Esau on down to Joseph in Egypt and are worried that its contents couldn't stay intriguing for this many pages, there is good news, because it, for the most part, very much is.In the preface, translator John E. Woods accurately proposes he thinks that \\"Mann ... wanted to make sure he had readers worthy of him\\" while explaining that some portions of this interweaving jewel are prone to be more difficult to read than what is, thankfully, the majority. And it is this truth, in which I agree with this stirling translator, that I breifly dwell upon.In several used bookstores I've been to, the only part of this story that I ever saw available, and in a volume all its own, was H.T. Porter's translation of \\"Joseph in Egypt.\\" Given its apparent availability over the other three parts, I suspected it would be the best - which Mann himself thought to be true. But, solely from the perspective of, as Virginia Woolf would aptly call me, a 'common reader,' I bring forth that those trickier 'riddles' that Woods forwarns, or maybe just mentions, occur most often in this third volume. The feel of being sidetracked a little too much continues on into the beginning segments of \\"Joseph the Provider.\\"Do these, I will dare to say, overly descriptive, meandering pages that include some repitition detract all that much from the sheer pleasure that dominates most of what is nothing short of this literary feast and party? Hardly not. For outside of this minor qualm over the author perhaps going a little too far about content that probably didn't require as much attention, there is no book I have read up until now that has offered more to a reader than this. I guess \\"sublime\\" is not a bad word to use when measuring the result of Mann's cataclysmic efforts that encompassed a time span of 16 years, no less, including a 5-year absence between the third and fourth stories.He touches on such juicy, delicious insights about mankind, helping to devour the notion that life is different now compared to then. And while it is entirely varied in custom, how could our experiences be all that different due to the fact that we all have one monstrous thing in common, our humanity.Mann had me wondering if he wasn't something more than human, though, his elegance, wisdom, humor and charm are in such top form. And while it could have been one of the great many gods of Baal that Mann includes throughout who could have helped guide his pen, I'm more prone to believe it was the God of the wanderer who possessed his wrist on occasion."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"A good book but too heavy:This letter is to the publisher of Joseph & his brothers by Thomas man.

The readings are low-key but very well delivered--perfectly suited for the subtle genius that permeates the Winnie-the-Pooh stories.

Its also nice to have this selection include some of the poems, though it does not include my favorite (Vespers). You should note that this is not a dramatization of the books, but a reading. Mr. Kuralt gives the characters personality and inflection, but does not change his voice to create this effect. It is much more like grand-dad reading a bedtime story. As much as I love the other popular audio renditions of the Pooh tales and poems (particularly the Broadbent and Shaw edition), this is a welcome and oft-played part of my Pooh collection."},{"Title":"The Silver Castle","review":"This was my first Clive James book. I loved it. I've not yet been to Bombay, or any part of India, but having read the book, I feel like it's a place that I must (but not necessarily want to) visit.It's a sad story about the life a young boy growing up in poverty in Bombay. It is tragic, but it is told with such objectiveness that you cannot cast judgment upon any of the characters involved.This is a brilliant display of James' talent of telling things how they are, without imposing a moralistice slant. You'll even laugh a lot.This book is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Silver Castle","review":"The sad and moving story of a young life lost. Told with wit and grit, the tale at first engenders the reader's sympathy for the young, precocious Sanjay growing up under deplorable conditions. And then by some curious trick, James allows the reader to distance himself/herself from Sanjay just enough to accept the &quot;return to roots&quot; ending without tears. Perhaps the trick is that you never really know what is in Sanjay's heart. Perhaps he doesn't have one: he is simply an opportunist who climbs the shakey ladder of success by any means possible. And perhaps the saddest indictment of all is that this may be the only hope for the bright sparks among India's poorest people. A thought-provoking, highly-readable novel written with insight and style. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Silver Castle","review":"I was amazed to find his knowledge of India, the film industry and the politics of the streets so authentic.

Read it!"},{"Title":"The Silver Castle","review":"Forget Patrick White; Clive James is the best writer to ever emerge from our post-colonial back woods. Like Joseph Heller who has never been able to match his stunning debut Catch 22 (possibly the greatest novel of the century) it appeared as though Clive James would have trouble living up to the genius of his autobiographical trilogy, Unreliable Memoirs, Falling Towards England, and May Week was in June. If Brrrmmmm Brrrmmmm, The Remake, and Brilliant Creatures however saw the emergence of a talented novelist, then The Silver Castle has seen the birth of a great one. Clive James sent us a Postcard from Bombay and stayed around long enough to really capture the taste, smell and feel of the place. He gives us a sense of this wonderfully vibrant yet equally appalling city from the dirt up - you can literally feel the grit between your teeth. From the poorest slums where having a deformity is a career, to the glass sparkle of the ludicrous Bollywood, The Silver Castle is an absolute gem of a novel."},{"Title":"The Silver Castle","review":"What an amazing book! An insight into the poverty and caste system of India.....just returned from there and Clive James descriptions of Mumbai were so vivid that he transported me back there page after page!"},{"Title":"The Silver Castle","review":"Clive James' best novel is probably the third book of his autobiographical trilogy. If you want to laugh out loud, I'd recommend &quot;Brilliant Creatures&quot;. &quot;The Silver Castle&quot; is funny, but I feel that Clive should stick to writing about Australia or the UK. When I read the book, I was left with the impression that he doesn't know India that well."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"Safe Harbor by Radclyffe is one of my favorite books. I say that with confidence, because I have read it three times, once in electronic format and twice more since I received my print copy a few weeks ago.I do not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone who likes a good romance. It is better than most romances because it not only satisfies the heart, it satisfies the head as well. The strong and effective characters are the reason why. Both the primary and supporting characters work.Deputy Sheriff Reese Conlon and Dr. Victoria King are the two women who meet in Provincetown and fall in love. They are a very engaging pair, each a woman of strength and integrity, with a passion for their jobs and for each other that makes the heart soar to read about it. Teenager Brianna Parker and her lover Caroline are secondary only in that their love is not the focus of the book. The characters of Kate, Reese's mother, Catherine, Tory's sister, and Sheriff Parker, Brianna's dad round out the roster. While they are all minor characters, they ring true too. They help make the book the success it is.One quality that you find in good fiction is that it picks you up and deposits you in another world. When I read Safe Harbor I am always very reluctant to leave that world."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"When an author takes a nom de plume to honor that pioneer of lesbian fiction Radclyffe Hall, it should come as no surprise to learn that she writes stories about women who love women. When Radclyffe Hall's classic work The Well of Loneliness hit the literary scene, there was nothing like it around. And as recently as thirty years ago, lesbian popular fiction was comparatively rare. Now, not only is lesbian literary fiction not uncommon, but lesbian pulp romances are everywhere to be found, with several presses both in the US and in the UK dedicated solely to its production.Radclyffe's first published contribution to the genre is, however, a breed apart. Set in Provincetown, SAFE HARBOR is the story of two strong women -- one the town doctor, one the new deputy sheriff -- whose growing mutual attraction wars with layers of pain and past betrayal that each wears like a suit of armor. Tory and Reese must learn to trust, must open themselves to possible pain, so that their love has a chance to flourish. And while Tory and Reese are sorting their own lives out, two younger women are coping with the dangers inherent in being out and in highschool.What sets Radclyffe's story apart from much of the lesbian pulp out there is that, in addition to the first-rate story, fascinating characters, and romance, Radclyffe writes beautifully. And her love scenes will singe your eyebrows and fry your circuits.We anxiously anticipate her future publications. Meanwhile, we read and reread and reread SAFE HARBOR."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"Safe Harbor is one of the best lesbian fiction novels that I have read in a long time. Anyone who has ever visited or lived in Provincetown will appreciate the authenticity of the setting.The author did a great job of crafting the personalities of both the gay and straight characters in this story. The two main characters, Tory and Reese, are strong and competent women in their fields but we are also shown their insecurities and human frailties. The chemistry between the women heightens as the story progresses which makes the romance more believable. She also does an excellent job interpreting the struggles of gay youth in today's society. I found her portrayal of Caroline and Brianna,two teenagers discovering love and the heartaches that go with it, both heartfelt and realistic.Radclyffe is a master storyteller. Her works are always intelligent and beautifully written. If you are looking for romance, no other writer even comes close to her style in writing a love scene.I would not hesitate to recommend Safe Harbor or any other books that she has written."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"Award-winning writer Radclyffe lists among her bestselling novels \\"Safe Harbor,\\" in which Reese Conlon leaves a military career to become Provincetown's new Deputy Sheriff. Once there, she finds herself fighting homophobia, which is directed at P-Town's local youth. While upholding the law, Reese also discovers truths about herself when she meets and falls in love with Dr. Victoria (Tory) King.\\"Safe Harbor\\" has a character driven plot and presents a diverse well-defined supporting cast with each having an integral contribution to the story. The main character, Reese, is easy to fall in love with. An extremely private person, she has everyone curious to know more about her. \\"She's handsome, strong, sensitive, tender, and deeply passionate. And devoted-can't beat that,\\" according to her creator Radclyffe; Reese turns more than a few heads. Comparable to a knight in shining armor, she is hard-working, decent, and honest. Reese upholds the law and takes her oath \`to serve and protect' very seriously. Her boss, Sheriff Nelson Parker, and other locals are in awe of this admirable woman.Sheriff Parker has a lot more than crime to deal with when he learns his daughter Brianna is gay. Radclyffe does a commendable job of describing the anguish he feels as he works his way, hopefully, toward acceptance.Reese meets Dr. King while out on patrol to check on a break in at the East End Health Clinic. Tory has an \\"unanticipated visceral reaction\\" (p. 21) to the precise, professional, and truly stunning sheriff. Having endured a bad breakup and an accident that dashed her Olympic hopes to bits, Tory is leery of a gorgeous, self-assured woman, and she's unnerved that she's so taken with Reese. Trying not to fall for Reese's charm is a daunting task-especially when Reese says things like, \\"I saw you this morning-kayaking out on the bay. You were so much a part of the sea that you didn't even disturb the rhythm of the waves\\" (p. 31). Tory endears the reader with her professional manner while adeptly healing the sick in her care. Dr. King is a respected physician who puts other's needs before her own. In hopes of avoiding further heartache, she adamantly tries to deny love. Can she learn to trust Reese and more importantly, can she trust her own feelings?Brianna (Bri) Parker, the sheriff's gay daughter, is a tough, troubled, and frightened youth who becomes the target of gay bashing. Although strong, Bri is no match for her attacker. Reese helps Brianna overcome obstacles that she and other gay teens face. Surprisingly, even the \\"gay Mecca\\" of P-town has its share of hatred. Reese helps not only Bri, but all the other gay kids in her jurisdiction to fight against homophobia.Tory's sister, Cath, acts as Tory's conscience, playing devil's advocate as she wrestles with her heart and mind. When Tory thinks, \\"[Reese] has no idea what she's doing-she hasn't a clue to the effect she has on any lesbian with a heartbeat\\" (p. 111), in fact, Reese has no idea what she does to straight women and men either. Cath may be a straight, married, mother of two, but she empathizes with her sister and can fully appreciate how Tory feels about Reese.\\"Safe Harbor\\" is a love story, a coming out story, and crime drama all rolled into one. When Reese was young, her mother Kate left home to be with her lover, Jean. She reconnects with her mother not knowing what to expect. She also must deal with her father's reaction to the news that she's gay.Caring deeply about an author's characters, yearning to find out what happens next, feeling like you're a part of the action, and hating for it to end, is what great novels are all about. \\"Safe Harbor\\" by Radclyffe is such a novel. From the beginning, Radclyffe uses mystery and foreshadowing to keep the reader interested, and there is never a dull moment. The fabulous setting is the perfect backdrop and makes the reader long for a trip to Provincetown, with its \\"Mardi Gras energy\\" (p. 90).A great story, memorable characters, fresh dialogue, important issues, scenic descriptions, an engaging plot and meticulous editing makes \\"Safe Harbor\\" a five star novel that can be enjoyed by both a gay and straight audience. I highly recommend \\"Safe Harbor\\" and anything penned by award winning novelist Radclyffe, whose recent accolades include two 2005 Golden Crown Literary Awards for \\"Fated Love\\" and \\"Justice in the Shadows.\\""},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"Some readers seem to be confused about what it is that they are buying. This book is unapologetically a lesbian romance -- modeled after the pulp romances of the 50s and 60s (except in this one, the girl gets the girl!). It is fantasy -- not real life. Radclyffe has spun an achingly beautiful tale of two women, each heroic, each wounded, who find the true love they never knew they were looking for. The characters are wonderfully complex, the dialogue is crisp, and the sex is... um, inspiring! I highly recommend this book for the true romantics in the world. Those who want gritty realism should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"My favorite books aren't necessarily perfect books, but they're books that stick with me over the years, that I read repeatedly, and that touch me in some additional way. I can't deny having spent time with this book over the years, since I discovered it online, and more recently upon reading the published version. I actually understand the weaknesses pointed out by the lower-star reviews given to this book, but I can't agree about the impact of these weaknesses. Part of it is nostalgia, but mostly it's the strength of the characterizations and how they spoke to me.I thought it was interesting to read a book about a fairly well-adjusted adult who hadn't \\"come out\\" to herself. It was very believable to me that someone who lived and breathed duty in the military would just wall themselves off, particularly when raised by a father she loved and wanted to make proud. When that ceased to be the case, she left that life. A very pragmatic decision and in line with her characterization. Some people are very good at compartmentalizing, and while that may not be the average person, the character of Reese as created wasn't average herself. Perhaps too idealized? I don't think so. She definitely had her flaws, but they just weren't the blind spots that everyone would have, necessarily. She certainly had no illusions about herself, it was more that she was allowing herself to explore a different aspect of her life because it was time.I enjoy reading books about people who try to deny their attraction for whatever reason. I enjoy characters who have a past that is explored, because that really fleshes out the characters and gives them and their motivations dimension. I enjoy the vivid setting that the author sets for this book, and indeed this series set in Provincetown. I enjoy the depiction of family, and the emotional issues surrounding those relationships. A lesbian can't have a lebian mother? Seems close-minded.The wounded strength of the main characters, who are the center of the book, and eventually have to get over their hesitations and give in to their attraction is graceful, and fun to read about as Radclyffe has formulated them. An excellent foundation for this series. Perhaps not for everyone, but the characters are original, and celebrated for their strengths and humanity. Therefore, this book gets my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"Radclyffe's first book introduces us to Reese Conlon - the newly hired deputy sheriff; Tory King - the town's only doctor; and, of course, Provincetown - the legendary gay mecca. Tory and Reese have a lot in common - both are insulated from others, both are workaholics, both are dedicated to their professions. But they are quite different from one another as well - Tory knows why she's insulated herself whereas Reese has never learned to be with others.Radclyffe is a fresh voice in the lesbian fiction genre. She writes about strong women overcoming seeming insurmountable difference to be with one another, she writes about trust and she writes about love. Her love scenes are graphic but gentle and sweet and sh never loses sight of the intensity of new love nor of her story.Beware though. If you start reading Radclyffe, you will find yourself ordering everything the woman has written. Be prepared to stay up long after you should have turned the light off just to finish one more chapter. It is best to read the series books - the Honor series, the Justice series and the Provincetown books - in order so you understand where the characters started and why they do what they do."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"SAFE HARBOR is a remarkable journey and affirmation that the bond between the right two women can be tested, stretched to seemingly irretrievable lengths, and hold.Radclyffe has displayed a talent for creating well-crafted, multi-faceted characters.That gift continues with Safe Harbor.With Tory and Reese she has created two of today's most interesting heroines. Reese, Provincetown's new Deputy Sheriffand Tory, the town Doctor, have various weaknesses but many off-setting strengths which will save their lives as well as the lives of others around them.I found this book to be both lyrical and gut-wrenching. But alsohighly erotic.Tory and Reese reach up from the page to draw you into their lives, struggles, and triumphs.I finished it in one day. I could not put it down."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"My favourite of Radclyffe's lesbian romances. The characters are well developed, realistic, and moreover people I'd like to know if they existed in the universe outside the covers of this book.Considering how often the world shows us betrayal and dishonour, it is wonderful to be able to dive into a Safe Harbor where characters learn to trust and love each other. This book is both a tribute to the traditional romance plot pacing in which it takes time to build relationships and a more modern novel where lovers can be equals in strength and passion.Safe Harbor is a book I have read and re-read and look forward to keeping on my shelves for cold rainy days when summer and true love seem sadly far away."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"I own and have read everything Radclyffe has published. I love her stuff and anxiously await each new release.'Safe Harbor' is her most erotic, heart-wrenching story yet. The reader can't help but fall in love with Reese and Tori, and to subsequently await their coming together.Reese, raised by her Marine father in a very regimented household and kept away from her lesbian mother as a teen, leaves active duty to become a deputy sheriff in Provincetown, MA. Because of the town's large gay population and her androgynous looks (like a cross between a young Gregory Peck and k.d. lang), everyone assumes Reese is a lesbian. However, in her early thirties, Reese has never had a relationship of any sort and isn't sure herself.Tori, a gifted physician and former Olympic contender, is the town doctor. She injured her leg just before the Olympics and ruined her chances of competing. Her former lover, a woman Tori planned to spend a lifetime with, cheated on Tori and left her heartbroken three years prior to Reese's appearance.Radclyffe skillfully takes these two women - one emotionally immature, and one emotionally barren - and creates a painfully erotic and emotional tale. Evidenced by the two sequels that have already been written, she leaves the story open for a proliferation of story lines.Your personal collection will not be complete without this book and its sequels."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"This book is just plain stupid. I hate that I forced myself to make it to the end. The author is a HORRIBLE writer. For example, a young gal gets assaulted by some redneck, and she tells the sheriff that he had hit her on her motorbike with his truck, and she was pretty sure she had done damage to his front end. So the sheriff goes off looking for him and finds him. \\"She sat in her car, looking at the fresh dent in the right front fender of his truck.\\" Really? she could tell it was fresh? Was it still bleeding? Hey, I like adjectives as much as the next gal, but c'mon. They already said that it was no one they knew. How in the world are we supposed to know the dent was fresh. Ugh. That's just one example. Want another? That same section starts out with \\"What happened that night was the thing legends were made of, and as this story was told and retold by every cop on the Cape, and every person in Provincetown, the story grew.\\" Want to know what happened? He steps out of the vehicle, she turns him around and puts a gun to the back of his head, changes her mind, gets her cuffs out instead, he comes at her, and she breaks his arm. That's all. Or at least, that's all the author tells us. If the story was retold by every cop on the Cape, and the story grew, please, by all means, tell us the grown-up story. Because that one sucked. So, yeah. The characters are shallow, poorly developed and unbelievable. In addition to that, let me say one thing about the sex. It seems like something a straight man wrote. It was cheap. If you value your time or appreciate good books, do not take a second look at this book. I am amazed that anyone has left a good review for this piece of trash, let alone read it more than once."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"This was a good book. Characters are interesting and the scenes in Provincetown are truly believable.Makes you want to head out to P-Town!"},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"I highly recommend this book. It is so well written I found myself wanting to believe in love and romance, again. If a Tory or Reese walked into my life, today, I would feel like the luckiest woman on earth!! The development of the story line is so realistic I felt as if I wanted to personally know Tory, Reese, and the fabulous supporting characters. You will find all the women in this story (lesbian or straight) to be warm, loving, strong, \\"step up to the plate\\" individuals. The love scenes are HOT-HOT-HOT!!! FEEL THE HEAT JUMP OFF THE PAGES!!! I normally read a book once, twice at the most, I've re-read this book so many times I may have to buy a new copy, soon. Radclyffe is fast becoming my favorite lesbian author!!! I have read all her books and continually look forward to more..more..more!!!! This is a MUST read, buy it, read it, and recommend it to friends and strangers (by strangers I mean write a review)."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"The Provincetown Tales is my abosolute favorite lesbian romance/fiction series. This first book starts it off right and really draws you into the characters and story. I love the Provincetown setting. So many lesbian romances are stand alone books that leave you wishing to know more about how the womens' lives turned out. With this series you get that and more. I've read all of Rad's books, and this book sets the tone for a great collection. I ended up wishing these characters were friends of mine - I guess in a way they are. Love this series."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"When I read the reviews for this book I decided that I would purchase it. I also, at the same time, purchased the rest of the books in this particular series (and some of her others too). I AM HOOKED!The sexual tension between the characters is quite strong. As the plot unfolds the reader is drawn more and more into the story, hoping that Reese, the \\"strong and silent type\\" and Dr Tory King, the wounded but strongminded town doctor, will realize who they are to each other, and to the town.I loved this book, and couldn't put it down. You will too."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"This was a wonderful story with superbly developed characters and a plot that that makes it hard to put down. Radclyffe has a talent for the written word and exploring inner thoughts, emotions and turmoil."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"Radclyffe is one of the best writers in the genre -- lesbian romance. She can tell a story perfect for a weekend or a vacation or a little fantasy. You'll find a strong sense of place and an unusually good depiction of characters' care in their working lives. The question is, will these otherwise brave and competent women find the courage to risk their own hearts? Count on a happy ending. Yeah, it's candy....bon bons.... but by Godiva quality maker. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"Another great work for a great author. Radclyffe continues to hold my interest with well-developed characters, interesting story lines and well written prose. Another great read!"},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"Safe Harbor is yet another five star winner as part of the Provience Town series. As an ex-Marine this book brought back memories of a similar time in my life. However, lucky Reece ended up with the girl, I did not. Living on the east coast and visiting the space that Tory and Reece became part of added to the sense of real people in a real life struggle for happiness. The romantic soul will start the book and finish it without putting it down.A must read. Thank you Radclyffe for giving us another tug at the heart strings."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"Safe Harbor was the first lesbian romance I ever read and it is still one I return to re-read again.Radclyffe does a wonderful job pulling you into her story with very realistic characters and creating a mental map of Provincetown, MA for you. Her characters all seemed like people you would run into in real life.If anyone wants a good read that is very down to earth then this is the book to read. I think any lesbian will find a \\"safe harbor\\" within the pages of this book and will make a connection to one of the character's stories."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"I would have to say that this was my first lesbian book to ever pick up.

Further, it reinforces the stereotype that being gay is all about sex. The author keeps you in sexual suspense for the first three fourths of the book, then it sort of turns into a sex manual for lesbians. That's not what I call a novel. The heroine is so perfect, she doesn't feel real. A lesbian woman with a lesbian mother makes it even more unrealistic. And if you can believe that a normal woman can live till the age of 37 without any kind of sexual experience - gay, straight, or herself, well..... The characters hold back their passion in a way that doesn't make much sense - it felt as if it was done simply so the author can get through three fourths of the book without the sexual stuff - then she launches into it with a vengeance. The heroine at age 37 is coming out to herself for the first time - yet, there is absolutely no inner processing of what this means to someone at that age. And there is also no depth in the heroine's relationship with the straight world - any attempt at character development (which is somewhat weak for the two main characters) is built around gays only. Since gays live in a mostly straight world, a novel of any depth should incorporate meaningful relationships with the straight characters. But its mostly missing here - there is some attempt at it with her boss, but it was again surrounding gay issues - a lot of issues in real life have nothing with being gay - even if one is gay. If you're looking for a quick easy romance novel with some explicit sexual content but the depth of a piece of paper, this is it. But don't look for anything that will last here...."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"Having read most of Radclyffe's stories, in print or online, I have to say that this one rides in the middle of the pack. The setting is nice and the background of the two main characters is a good start, but this story could have been much better. It's still a good enjoyable read, but if you're looking ofr Radclyffe's best work, read &quot;Love's Melody Lost.&quot;"},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"I have looked for this book recently and yours gave me a great chance to start my collection..Thank you."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"It's wonderful.

It was okay and a fun read, but all too predictable and fast. Despite creative lives the characters had I never really saw them as 3-dimensional. Not a lot of time was spent developing them, but rather telling us what their pasts were."},{"Title":"Safe Harbor","review":"The book was good, but I just get real tired of the long drawn out girl meets girl and in the last chapter they finally get it on. It is so pat - come on authors, don't we all want to come on sooner."},{"Title":"Magic Cottage","review":"Like the reader from England (dated May 20th 1999), I too have read this book numerous times and that tells you something, doesn't it? It is spooky, yet enchanting. It is mystical. I love it. I love the description of the cottage and the woods. Buy the book and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Magic Cottage","review":"This is the best book that I have ever read! I have over 400 horror books and I have read this one over 20 times. James Herbert creates such an atmosphere. You actually feel as if you are part of the story, a 'fly on the wall'. His characters are complex and very entertaining. A good book to read to get into horror and a easy reading book for those already there."},{"Title":"Magic Cottage","review":"The Magic Cottage ended with a bang but started slow. The fast paced conclusion was excellent pulling the story together, filled with horror and wonder. I wanted the story to move faster, the first half was like slogging through mud, you can see the glorious meadow beyond but first have to plod through muck to get there. The story involves a couple who buy their first house after living in London apartments. They find a worn cottage in a remote village, it needs lots of restoration but they believe it will be grand. So after purchasing it, it is fixed up, and they settle into life in the country. They are stunned to find gardens blooming where once weeds had been, animals coming for visits, seemingly unafraid of human contact, they are somewhat dismayed to find a mysterious castle through the woods filled with &quot;Synergists&quot;. They are warned by the village folk to stay away from the Synergists. Slowly the leader of the group, entices Midge to explore her pain filled past. The end is a flurry of spooky horror. What is really behind all the mysteries at the cottage, are the Synergists friends or evil foes, what happened to Flora (the previous owner of the cottage). I recommend the book, but be prepared for a slow start to a slam bang finish."},{"Title":"Magic Cottage","review":"Not up to James Herbert's usual first class thrillers.

Good story that kept me turning the pages, characters were well developed and the story suspenseful. One of his better books."},{"Title":"Magic Cottage","review":"James Herbert is uplifting loving and original.

I started to skip pages toward the end, in fact, just to get it over with. My recommendation: take the advice of other reviewers and read a different book by this author before reading this one."},{"Title":"Magic Cottage","review":"I'm not proud to be a slower reader than most but I have to recommend this only for the faster readers out there. It's very slow paced type of story. Even with the bits of scary in it; they are few & far between. But it does keep you wondering until the end what really is going on."},{"Title":"Magic Cottage","review":"I originally read this book when it first came out in the late eighties and remembered it as being a great book. I just bought another copy and after re-reading The Magic Cottage, I've reconfirmed why I loved this book. Herbert does a masterful job of sharing his story about Mike and Midge, a young talented couple, who venture from the big city and buy a quaint cottage called Gramarye out in the country. Told by Mike's POV, it is as if they have moved into an enchanted cottage straight out of a Disney production as they are greeted every morning by cheerful critters as the couple falls in love with the place. Gramarye proves to be truly magical but it conceals a darkness that will soon take over Mike and Midge's lives.One of my favorite lines is: \\"My fear had reached a new zenith, rising from the sloshy morass of dread like a dripping creature from a swamp.\\""},{"Title":"Magic Cottage","review":"This is a great book by Jamest Herbert offering dark fantasy and horror combined.It is perhaps not ideal for hardcore horror readers, who prefer books like The Rats, this book is more inclined to appeal to readers who also enjoy dark fantasy and paranormal magic in their novels. But that is one of the reasons I rate this book so highly, it combines horror and dark fantasy beautifully, unlike traditional blood and guts horror this book also offers, like the title says, magic.That's not to say it's not horrific in places, my sister had nightmares from some sections of this novel. But then she's never read horror before either. As a fan of dark fantasy and hardcore horror I adored this book as one of my all time favourites as it combines both the genres I love in exceptionally well written prose.If you like horror and fantasy you'll love this book. And if you've never read horror before, it's a great book to start on!For fans of James Herberts other works, expect something a bit different from this novel. The title is a dead giveaway that it's not a hardcore horror novel in James Herbert's usual style.Overall a magical read combining dark fantasy and horror in a truly unique way."},{"Title":"Magic Cottage","review":"I loved how the story started out slow. We got to know the characters,and there was time to suspend belief (extremely important in ghoststories).But--but I didn't find the story scary. The ghost of Mrs. Caldean wasa festering corpse. That's not scary, just disgusting. The part aboutthe bats giving birth was designed to be scary, but it was alsodisgusting (bats don't scare me).A stylistic no-no. Herbert needed an editor. That's a common problemwith famous writers. They begin to think they don't need an editor.For example, what was Herbert trying to prove with the followingsentence (page 308): \\"But still I didn't understand!\\" (\\"Understand\\" isunderlined! Herbert did this a couple times, and it waslike reading a note passed between teenagers. \\"I REALLY HATE you.\\" Underlined.Finally, in pulling the ends of the story together, Herbert did toomuch. Midge's amazon friend arrives in the nick of time. There was noreason to bring her back into the story. She was a sterotypicalcharacter that played a role but didn't need to be returned to theending.Also, it weakens a ghost story to justify the existence of ghosts (orthe paranormal). These things should be introduced in another way. Forexample, I love reincarntation stories, but please don't try to getme to believe in reincarnation by noting the beliefs of the Hindus andother religions. In a couple instances, I felt like Herbert was tryingto show that atheists are wrong (what does that have to do with a ghoststory?). It weakens novels when the author tries to make such philosophicalarguments (leave that for an essay). Yes, there are examples to thecontrary, but I picked up this book to be entertained, not converted tosome new-age religion.Some parts were unintentionally funny. A friend of Mike and Midge wakes up inscreaming terror, and Mike suggests that all the man needs is to go back tosleep in the house! Like, \\"Don't worry, Bill. After experiencing that heart-stoppinghorror, all you need is to go back to sleep in the same room. Funny, and of course,the guy wastes no time in leaving the cottage.In short, I liked the story but thought that it should have been editedto make it more scary."},{"Title":"Magic Cottage","review":"This was one of my favorite books. Probably read it about 15 years ago, so I'll have to read it again real soon! I leant this out to someone, tellng them it was one of my favorites, and I never got it back.

I find James Herbert fantasticly good at making me laugh during even the scariest moments - this book is certainly funny, but equally keeping you on the edge of your seat as you read. Sex, drugs, rock n roll, art, the occult, love, life and death all feature in this unique story, winding you in as you discover more and more about the characters....Watch out for Rambo the squirrel...he appears in several of Herbert's books in different forms.

The two of them make an interesting pair, though their respective jobs (storybook writer and session musician)are an excuse to bring some rather uninteresting supporting characters into the story; Bob the stereotypical frybrain rocker, and Val, the comic relief 'trendy' lesbian literary agent. One gets to fall victim to one of the book's scarier moments, while the other plays an unlikely role at the conclusion of the story.The book, like the cottage, doesn't quite stay together all the way through. Despite Herbert's effort to make the Synergists interesting and different from the usual cult of one-dimensional brainwashed weirdos, they come across as...one-dimensional brainwashed weirdos!The book is narrated by Mike in first person, a device that I liked at first, but ended up wishing Herbert hadn't used. Some of the sentences are choppier than they might have been in the third-person, and some are rather transparent attempts to build suspense, all but telegraphing some plot points, as if he said, 'I didn't think it was important at the time, but I would in about 4 chapters.'I wanted to see more of Mrs. Chaldean and Rev. Sixsmythe(who seems to be the 'red herring'of the story, never really amounting to anything, despite some interesting characterization), and less of 'Mycroft' and his flunkies, who come off sounding like villains in a Dean Koontz book!One thing that saved the book for me was the small but important(not to mention enjoyable) role of Rumbo the squirrel, who certainly had more personality than the bad guys!Recommended for those who have read other James Herbert novels before. Not a good starting point if you're new to the author; in that case, try 'The Rats'"},{"Title":"Magic Cottage","review":"Even though I like James Herbert, I am glad this was not my first book by him, or I probably would not have gone on to read his other works. This book is very, very slow going. A previous reviewer's description \\"like slogging through mud\\" is very appropriate. Not much of anything happens until the very end. Some could say he spent his time developing his characters or building suspense. What little attempts at suspense building that are even deployed are ruined by comments to the effect of \\"if I had only known....\\" The ending was decent, it just took too long to get there. \\"Are we there yet?\\""},{"Title":"Magic Cottage","review":"This book is ideal for someone who doesnt like horror as strong as Stepehn King's or William Peter Blatty's.

A must read, one you won't put down!"},{"Title":"Magic Cottage","review":"The Magic Cottage is quite simply the best horror book I have ever read. I started on Fantasy several years ago, and joined it up with horror about 1 year ago. Since then I have read 10 horror books by various authors, and this remains the best one of the lot. Herbert manages to build up the atmosphere, without detracting from the interest or the plot. A writer like Bentley Little is inclined to forget about the plot and stroyline altogether, for the sake of the atmosphere. Herbert can do the lot. I'm going to keep on reading his books, and hopefully I'll get more of the same."},{"Title":"Magic Cottage","review":"This book is pretty damn good. I found it hard to put down, was absorbed in the story, and growing increasingly tense as I turned the pages. So why the one star?Because the climax is ridiculous.That may sound petty to some, but seriously, is this meant to be scary? The humour and tongue-in-cheek tone completely kill the mood and I didn't feel threatened at all.The synergists - who are supposedly the villains - are ridiculous. They aren't scary in the slightest. I felt as though I could have escaped, had I been in the position that the main characters find themselves in, with ease.There are hundreds of gags throughout this climax which made me hate the book, and it's possible that you're thinking, \\"Why did he only give it one star if he only disliked the ending?\\" to which I would reply: the climax is one of the most important parts of a story, particularly a horror. The entire novel builds up to that moment, and what do we get? The cheesiest, most unrealistic, and formulaic ending we could have expected.Do not read this book if you are looking for horror. This is not it. If you want to be scared, read \\"Outer Dark\\" by Cormac McCarthy, or Herbert's later novel \\"Nobody True\\".

The intro sounded really cool The kind of stuff that you think about at night in the dark, however this book was a big disapointment to me. The book was boring, and seemed to drag on and on. The only neat part about the book was the part about the miracles that occurred in the cottage, the ending, and the add that appears at the beginning of the book advertising the cottage. Also, author's intro about it being a &quot;typical&quot; story so to speak. The main character (the man) had a very boring personality and only seemed to care about his music. I kept waiting for a proposal, thinking that the cottage might make him propse but no such luck. I also was hoping that maybe they would have a baby, and then the story might pick up some, no such luck. The cult, could of been a litte more creepy, again, they were kind of dull also. The only reason that I contiued to read this book was that I wanted to see how it ended. I don't think that I will read any more of his novels. I think that the guy next door could have written a better plot for this book. The title and the cover are really neat, but the story was just plain dull! I wasn't even scared! I was sooooo... disappointed with The Magic Cottage! However, I am very picky, so you may think differently about this story. Judge for yourself!"},{"Title":"To Love, Honor, and Vacuum: When You Feel More Like a Maid Than a Wife and Mother","review":"I admit I rarely read books that are targeted at married mothers. I'm not married and I'm not a mother. Go figure. But since I moved in with my parents and two younger brothers a few months ago (got laid off, minimizing expenses while looking for a job, you know the drill), my healthy, if distant, appreciation for home engineers has developed into downright deification. As an adult member of the household, I'm frequently overwhelmed by how much needs to be done on a daily basis.Perhaps that's why TO LOVE, HONOR, AND VACUUM strikes me as one of the best books I've read in a long time. Written by home schooling mom and entrepreneur Shelia Wray Gregoire, the book is chock full of practical tips for doing everything around the home from cleaning to keeping spending in check to stoking the romantic fires. A lot of her suggestions aren't necessarily rocket science, but she presents them in a fresh way and gives the business of running a family a new spin.One feature of the book that I found especially insightful is a section profiling one day in the life of three women living at three different points in American history. These short fictional accounts reveal that while women over the years share many of the same concerns about the welfare of their families, the tangible nuts and bolts of running a household have evolved significantly. This will be an epiphany for the many modern women harboring guilt-inducing notions that the housewives of earlier generations were better at running their households despite the absence of the time and effort saving conveniences that clutter homes today. On the contrary, Gregoire convincingly points out that these technological advances have actually added more lines on today's to-do lists.And while all of this is helpful, the real value of Gregorie's book is in its discussion of the principles that should guide the division of labor in the home.As the back cover says, this is no &quot;women's lib&quot; book and Gregorie does not fail to mention biblical verses referring to wives submitting to husbands. Nevertheless, she does a masterful job of exposing how commonly held ideas about gender roles within the home are of a cultural construction and not a biblical construction. Furthermore, she points out that these traditional gender roles aren't effective for many families existing in our modern economy. With this in mind, she suggests innovative ways to devise a truly harmonious living and working environment.This harmonious environment is ultimately the goal of everything that TO LOVE, HONOR, AND VACUUM proposes.&quot;As you change your emphasis to people's comfort, rather than keeping up appearances, your attitude toward housework will probably change as well. Having the 'perfect house' as a standard can be very debilitating, constricting our ability to share with others. Maybe you'd like to invite that new couple over after church, but you can't possibly let them in your home right now because there are still crumbs on the counter from breakfast and the kid's toys are lying on the stairs.When we think this way, we are putting things ahead of people. Creating a family friendly home means creating a home where people feel comfortable. Pastor Kevin Dowling, a friend from our hometown says that Christians should aim to be hospitable, not to entertain. Our aim is to share our homes and our lives, not to put on a show. So instead of putting your energy into keeping a perfect home that few see, try creating a comfortable one the people feel welcome in.&quot;And, as a result, TO LOVE, HONOR, AND VACUUM offers encouragement for the overwhelmed, freedom from perfectionism, and a vision of life dominated by care, not precision.--- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel"},{"Title":"To Love, Honor, and Vacuum: When You Feel More Like a Maid Than a Wife and Mother","review":"Stay-at-home and working moms often feel stressed about house chores, their spouse and their children.

Though this book is especially aimed at women trying to juggle children, households and husbands, even those like myself who only have the husband and the household can find useful tips on time management, re-ordering priorities, and spiritual balance.The chapter &#65533;In the Mood&#65533; about sex and romance is worth the price of the book. Her gracious advice in this area will help women to understand their husband&#65533;s very different responses to sexual intimacy. She explains the need for genuine independence and mystery as a key to keeping romance blooming.The book applies timeless Christian principles to the thoroughly modern predicament of today&#65533;s wives and mothers. Wray Gregoire traces the differences in the lifestyles and levels of support our grandmothers and mothers had to the lives we live now where the nuclear family is often isolated from other family members in anonymous neighborhoods. She tells how those principles can still work, despite these changed circumstances, if they are applied with a proper balance. She acknowledges that sometimes certain aspects of Christian teaching have been misinterpreted to promote the idea that a woman should be like a doormat or a maid in the home instead of a loving wife in a relationship of mutual respect. She effectively shows the difference between servanthood and subservience in a way that&#65533;s penetrating and original.I found this book hard to put down because Wray Gregoire&#65533;s style is so accessible and fun to read, but this is a book that would just as useful for a group study. At the end of each chapter are some deeper questions to ponder that would make ideal assignments between meetings. This book could be reread several times because so much wisdom is distilled into it, and its style is fresh enough to make rereading a pleasure."},{"Title":"To Love, Honor, and Vacuum: When You Feel More Like a Maid Than a Wife and Mother","review":"Sheila Wray Gregorie has done a great job with her book. She doesn't talk down to moms as an expert--she comes alongside as a fellow struggler and gives scripturally-based, insightful commentary about the role a Christian mom and wife should play in the family. I was challenged, motivated, and encouraged by her practical ideas, her warm tone, and the real-life anecdotes she shared. As a working mom, I didn't feel that Sheila \\"bashed\\" me, but she gave helpful ideas for cutting back on time away from home and making family dinners, etc., a priority.

The book does offer advice for getting your children involved, but discourages wives from harping on their husband's faults or nagging him to be more involved. Gregoire helps women to focus on their own attitudes and expectations for their role as wife and mother and guides them toward managing their lives and emotions in a way that meets their needs rather than demanding that your husband or children meet them (or even know what they are!) Gregoire tackles numerous issues including intimacy in a marriage when you feel unappreciated, exhausted, and undervalued. She also discusses the dilemma many women face as to whether or not to return to work after children and helps you make that decision based on wisdom, logic, God's plan for your life, and what is best for your family as a whole. There is even a section that specifically addresses the unique needs of the mom who is homeschooling...I did not read that as I do not homeschool. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"To Love, Honor, and Vacuum: When You Feel More Like a Maid Than a Wife and Mother","review":"As a wife, grad student, and new mother, it seemed my joy in life was getting lost in exhaustion. I have a great husband, an exceptionally \\"easy\\" baby, supportive grandparent-care, and flexible hours...and I was still running out of steam. Reading this book may not have changed what I have to accomplish in a day, but it refreshed my perspective. In this book, Sheila Gregoire gave me encouragement, specific and useful tips on how to simplify and prioritize life, and (perhaps what I needed most) sympathy coupled with hope. Sometimes all I need is someone to tell me that \\"yes, it IS hard!! But you're doing okay.\\"As an example, the day after I finished reading the book, I still had to: get everyone ready for the day, express milk, work all day in the lab, go to the gym, come home, do laundry, cook dinner, wash the dishes, pick up the house, entertain my 6-month old while doing all of this, feed and bathe the baby, put her to bed, express more milk, start another load of laundry... But this time, I did all of my morning chores with some fun music on, had lunches ready from the night before, took care of my evening housework with a timer on to finish in a hurry, and had time to go for a walk around the neighborhood with my daughter and my dog while the casserole was in the oven. It was one of the best days I've had in a very long time, although almost nothing besides my attitude (and a few organizational tips) had changed!

My daughter is too young right now to help out much but I am excited to put into practice some of the strategies that the book talks about with sharing responsibilities. I often feel looked down upon because my husband and I have decided that being home is the best place for me instead of the workplace but this book made me feel more enpowered.

It questions us as human beings if we are, indeed, being humane. As the pace of globalization grows significantly, more and more businesses have gone global. We live in one world; which democratize information and technology. Many books have described globalization in business perspectives; its benefit/cost impacts on environment, politics, financial, technology, and information. However, Hugo Bonjean reminds us one of the most important aspect that we're missing out: humanity. How does the system of globalization look at humanity? Have we taken the social impacts into an account?

It is often compared to Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist and Daniel Quinn's Ishmael. There are some similarities to both of these books, yet this one does not live up to the greatness of the other two offerings. However, it does have some insights to offer.In this book, a woman keeps appearing to our author in many forms and in many places. He is told by a priest friend, \\"You have seen Anahita. I call her Mary. She has been seen by many here in the valley and goes by many different names.\\" The book begins with a question by the author's son, \`Why do people have to pay for food?' And, while on a trip in South America, his eyes are opened to many injustices and his worldviews are challenged.Many questions are examined in this volume, such as: \`Are human beings being human?' and \`Is a global society a social globe?' This book raises many questions about the global use of resources, and the distribution of wealth in the world.This book is dialogue-heavy and though the message is good, it was an effort to make it through the book. Less than halfway through reading it, you know where the author is going and it takes him a long time to get there. That, combined with the new-age elements, made this book a disappointing read. If it were closer to Coelho's or Quinn's books and less like the Celestine Prophecy by James Radfield, it would have been more enjoyable.All in all, this book would be a 6 out of 10; good message, but Bonjean's work is a weak telling of that message."},{"Title":"Memoirs of the Confederate war for independence","review":"This book was written in 1866, while the memories of the War Between the States were still fresh in Von Borcke's mind. A lot of the personal accounts I have read were written years after the war and were not as accurate as they could have been had they been written sooner. But, most of the veteran's had a lot more to contend with, than writing a book. Von Borcke,sometime lieutenant of the 3rd Regiment of Dragoon Guards, came to Virginia from Prussia at the beginning of the war to offer his services to the Confederacy. Seeking adventure in the new land, he fell in with Jeb Stuart and found all he needed. Jeb Stuart made Von Borke one of his aides. Von Borcke writes about a lot of small details of Virginia at that time, that someone who was a native Virginian, would not have made note of because of already being familiar with these. He also has written of many humorous events that took place in camp and on the battlefield. Gives a good account of Stuart from someone who was close to Stuart in the good times and bad times. You will not regrett taking the time to read this to read this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of the Confederate war for independence","review":"This is a wonderful memoir of the author's year and half of active service on the staff of the legendary Confederate cavalry General, J. E. B. Stuart. Von Borcke was an aristocratic twenty-six year old former Lieutenant in the Prussian Army when, in 1862, he took passage on a blockcade runner to Charleston. With little command of English, and having burned all of his letters of introduction just prior to his vessel's inspection by Yankee blockaders, Von Borcke presented himself at Richmond unknown and friendless. He was eventually placed as a civilian adviser to Stuart, and soon became a commissioned officer on the staff, and one of Stuart's closest confidants. A giant of a man--he weighed 220, and must have been very tall--he was a gallant and chivalrous fighter. He seems to have been in the thick of every melee, and was often entrusted with special courier assignments by Stuart. Through this, we get wonderful glimpses of many of the great heros of the Southern side, including Lee, and especially of Stonewall Jackson, who shows a wonderful sensitive side to Von Borcke, not often seen by others. The author lyrical prose is delightful, especially when describing the beautiful Northern Virginia countryside, and the many fine families than dwelt in the area. The brilliant, and wonderfully-readable prose is more the remarkable due to fact that this book is in translation from the original German. No where did I find the translator's name, but whoever did it deserves high praise indeed. I have never read a Civil War memoir that was better, though Henry Kyd Douglas' &quot;I Rode with Stonewall&quot; deserves mention for its merit also. This is a wonderful must-read, and would be an excellent book for even those who are but casually interested in the history of the Civil War."},{"Title":"Memoirs of the Confederate war for independence","review":"Heros Van Borcke brings alive life in the Confederate Calvary.

Maps would also aid greatly when he speaks of riding from town to town. Overall, the book was well worth the read. His vantage point enables him to faithfully detail to the reader an accurate picture of General JEB Stuart which makes the read quite intriguing.

This leads MacIntyre to distinguish what he calls the &quot;virtues of acknowledged dependence&quot; from the more widely recognized &quot;virtues of independent practical reasoners&quot;.This book, an expanded series of lectures, is quite easy to read, especially when it focuses on such lively questions as whether dolphins and chimpanzees have beliefs and intentions, or why we have obligations to those thoroughly dependent human beings who will never develop into autonomous agents.I've long thought _After Virtue_ was the best introduction to MacIntyre, but I now suspect _Dependent Rational Animals_ may be the way to go. That way, one can begin with his positive account, and locate the critique in relation to it."},{"Title":"Dependent Rational Animals: Why Human Beings Need the Virtues (The Paul Carus Lectures)","review":"Many virtue theorists seem to think it enough to say that &quot;qua humans&quot; we should flourish, and that figuring out how to flourish &quot;just is&quot; what practical reasoning is, and hence that virtue is intrinsic to being human in about the same way that having roots is intrinsic to being a tree, and that those of us who fail to &quot;see&quot; that are somehow irrational in wanting some further argument. They skip blithely over the obvious fact that much reasoning that seems quite practical and wildly successful seems rather less than virtuous. MacIntyre indulges in no such self-satisfied question-begging. Whatever else is to be said for MacIntyre's &quot;Dependent Rational Animals,&quot; he displays the virtue of engaging directly and forthrightly the hard questions that unsympathetic or unconvinced souls would pose for his position.The way he argues that we need the virtues is quite startling in originality. Generally, ethicists take as their standard the autonomous, self-sufficient reasoner--where &quot;reason&quot; means something like &quot;able to give a logically defensible verbal justification,&quot; usually in terms of some sort of universal rule. MacIntyre sees this as a mistake. The question, he thinks, is how any of us ever come to be independent practical reasoners and what it means to be such. We must, he thinks, understand that &quot;reasons to act&quot; have little to do with our linguistic ability or capacity to display verbally a syllogism that concludes with the action in question. Rather, &quot;reasons to act&quot; are more concrete, pragmatic, and instrumental.Thus, we can say that intelligent animals act with reasons, despite having no language, if their actions are clearly aimed at ends, especially if it is clear that they choose their instrumental acts on the basis of perceptions of the current environment.*Human practical resoning* begins in this aspect of our animal nature--our ability to learn in practice what we need to do in order to accomplish the things we need to accomplish if we are to flourish. Note that the issue here is learning in practice, and identifying correctly through our practice what we find to be needful for our flourishing. Reason, then, is grounded in the practice of flourishing.And rather than look at &quot;autonomous&quot; adults, MacIntyre points out the obvious fact, usually overlooked by ethical theorists, that we are actually always dependent on each other in myriad ways. Our mutual dependency dictates that we need communities of giving and receiving various things--including education, formal and otherwise--not only to flourish but to be able to know, and reason, about flourishing. Without the virtues, the conditions for practical reasoning *at all* cannot exist.The argument, then, is that our animality and dependency dictate what constitutes both flourishing and practical reason about flourishing, and that we can demonstrate that the virtues are necessary for being independent practical reasoners who flourish.Rather, that's the strategy of the argument. The argument itself is, of course, much more involved. In its entirety, does it work? I'm not sure. I don''t know that everyone would agree with his axiomatic/unargued starting point, that to flourish requires us to be independent rational thinkers, even in the sense of \\"rational\\" he's spelled out here. We of democratic mien see thing that way, of course--but so far as I know, MacIntyre doesn't provide an argument for the overriding necessity of independence.A couple of things are troubling--his apparent reliance on D.W. Winnicott's psychoanalytic account of child development, for instance. I'm not sure whether it really matters--so long as one accepts the notion that persons cannot develop into independent rational thinkers without the support of others, MacIntyre's affinity for Winnicott can be seen as a personal quirk, I think.But that does lead to one perplexity: a lot of what MacIntyre says about the necessities of human life--matters of our dependence--is empirical, in a fairly straightforward sense, more than philosophical. Does this matter? It seems so to me. At least some of his argument turns on empirical claims about conditions for human flourishing for which he provides no argument or evidence.Finally, MacIntyre sees current society as more or less beyond the pale ethically--according to him, neither our families nor our nation states promote virtue or independent practical rationality of the sort he has spelled out. One could conclude, of course, that we live in vicious ands heathen times, so to speak--and perhaps we do. Or one could wonder whether MacIntyre's empirical claims, and the philosophical argument he bases upon them, may not have more to do with his tastes than with the conditions of human flourishing. Is it really so obvious that in our culture we fail to flourish? Taken from the perspective of human history, our developed nation states have a few things going for them that resemble flourishing: the highest levels of material welfare, more equitably spread (in spite of the great distance we have to go in achieving equality); the most widespread education and highest rates of literacy; the lowest rates of infant mortality; the longest life spans; the greatest emphasis on human rights, including for women and minoeriites; the easiest access by non-elites to the arts; the cheapest books (relative to per capita income); the most efficient (if not yet ideal) institutions for international consultation and cooperation, and . . .I like MacIntyre''s version of how life ought to be. I recommend reading the book. But I suggest that one not fail to note that his empirical claims are less than obviously true, while some empirical facts about our flourishing seem to have escaped his notice--or at least been given less weight than many folks would give them.One other thing: This book is badly written. Never mind the needlessly poor sentence structure in which he so often indulges (and he obviously knows better, since he often writes clearly). But the structure of the argument and its exposition is generally less than transparent. (The reviewer who thought first that MacIntyre had gone soft reflects this fact.) For instance, on page 107, he tells us there are two ways that a certain thing is important, then spends twelve pages discussing the first--without ever getting around to identifying the second, so far as I can discern. That sort of sloppiness is not unusual in the book. Do you think maybe one of the minor virtues, one of the small obligations owed by people who write books for which they ask our money, is that they not be lazy about how they express themselves?"},{"Title":"Dependent Rational Animals: Why Human Beings Need the Virtues (The Paul Carus Lectures)","review":"Anyone who likes good philosophical writing will enjoy \\"Dependent Rational Animals.\\" In it, Alasdair MacIntyre argues for a concept of human flourishing that acknowledges the virtues of acknowledged social dependence as well as those of independent practical reasoning (the normal focus of virtue theory). Parts of the book are underargued -- particularly the section on politics -- but the writing is lucid, and the philosophy is wise and compassionate. Best of all, the book opens our eyes to the obvious but often overlooked truth that any account of human good is seriously partial and deficient if it neglects the reality of dependence -- a state occupied by everyone at some point in his or her life, and by some persons for their entire lives.

He is an authority on the issue of virtues and Aristotelian philosophy, where virtue plays an inmportant role. What is striking about this book however, is that recent research done on dolphins, chimpanzees and other intelligent nonhuman animals, has been taken notice of by the author. This includes self consciousness and rationality. He, in an excellent way, made these insights philsophically relevant In his previous works he has never made much about animal existence. Now for the first time he meaningfully incorporated new scientific insights on intelligent and rational animals in his thinking on virtues. This indeed a gain in thinking on animal (and human) existence. He does not hesitate to put his views forward. For those who are interested in philosophy and animal issues,this book will be an great asset.In the second half of the book he also addresses the issue of dependence on and the need for virtues in human social life. Amonst many other things , he explains why neither the state nor the family would be primarily normative, why virtues guide us, but are not rigid rules. While he regards emotions as as important, his wisdom namely \\"Sentiment , unguided by reason , becomes sentimentalism and sentimantality is a sign of moral failure\\" (p124)is most relevant today;This surely applies to our making sense of both human and nonhuman animal exsistence.In a time where the killing and possible extinction of whales dolphins,chimpanzess orang utangs by human ignorance, arrogance and error as well as and certain environmental problems, and where people are looking for moral answers, this book indeed tells us why humans need virtues. The book itself fulfill in a contemporary need."},{"Title":"Dependent Rational Animals: Why Human Beings Need the Virtues (The Paul Carus Lectures)","review":"An interesting and generally accessible work by the well known philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre. MacIntyre is known well for his denunciation of the moral bankruptcy of the modern world and his embrace of an Aristotleian/Thomistic account of virtue ethics. This book is an effort to provide a positive account of a desirable life and sketch out a form of political philosophy. MacIntyre begins this book with a fairly straightforward discussion of how at least some non-human animals and humans are not qualitatively different in cognitive capacity but rather on a continuum. If anything, I'd state the case even more strongly than MacIntyre; recent clever experiments establish that rodents, for example, can generalize causal inferences. While MacIntyre is not completely explicit, the discussion of animal-human intelligence is an effort to ground a teleological account of human 'flourishing' in which the purpose of humans is to be, well, human. In MacIntyre's account and by analogy with his discussion of animal behavior, the distinctive telos of humans is to become independent practical reasoners embedded deeply and meaningfully in a web of necessary social interactions. MacIntyre emphasizes our interdependence, both in becoming independent practical reasoners and at other times when we are inevitably impaired. MacIntyre argues as well that this account is distinctly different from most modern moral philosophy, which he views as having a destructively individualistic orientation.There are several problems with MacIntyre's analysis. I doubt that his method really establishes a convincing human telos. No one would argue about the importance of human rational capacities and sociability, but does his analysis lead to his version of the telos? If there is anything really distinctive about humans as a species, its our remarkable social flexibility. Hunter-gather families and clans, oligarchic city-states, primitive monarchies with priest-kings, and many others. All these involve practical reasoning and social interdependence. Along the same lines, how does MacIntyre's effort at naturalistic analysis establish that the cooperative values that he prefers? Why can't human interdependence and needs be satisfied by exploitation and coercion? These are just as characteristic of human life as the values he prefers. This is true for social non-human primates, canids, and hyenas as well. MacIntyre's goal appears to a form of primitive egalitarianism but why not Aristotle's version of the telos which legitimized slavery and the subordination of women? Not only is MacIntyre vague about how to define the goods or ends of human existence, he is also imprecise about the virtues, which he regards as crucial. Is a virtue an instrument to an end, as most of his comments suggest, or is it an end in itself as some of his discussion of just generosity seems to imply? Failure to clearly define how he reaches his conclusions regarding the proper ends of human life and lack of clear definition of virtue gives much of the discussion a hand-waving quality. I suspect that MacIntyre has a covert agenda; his frequent citation of Aquinas and the appearance towards the end of the book of the term natural law leads me to think he really thinks there is a theistic backstop for his position.I'm not sure as well about his statement that moral philosophy fails to acknowledge human dependency. My impression is that the individualistic orientation of much moral philosophy has more to do with the rejection of external authority as a source of morality than blindness towards human dependency. Indeed, much political philosophy, which is an aspect of moral philosophy, often begins with an explicit recognition of human weakness and interdependence. This occurs as far back as the account of the Prometheus creation myth in Plato's Protagoras. MacIntyre attempts to deal with some alternative traditions but these are mainly straw man arguments as he compares his position with a fairly weak account of preference utilitarianism and with Nietzsche's amoralism.MacIntyre's effort to apply his views to a positive political philosophy are likewise not successful. His reasoning leads him to disparage the modern liberal state as being unable to provide the type of primitive egalitrarianism he wants (this is certainly true) and and too much based on exploitative power relationships and competing economic interests to be morally adequate. He finds the family both too weak and potentially too confining to be adequate. Hence, the need for smaller and more moral communities. But is the modern liberal state as bad as MacIntyre would like us to believe? Given his emphasis on the importance of human dependence and mutual care, the fact is that liberal societies have done more to alleviate the problems of human dependency than other societies in human history and the ability to mobilize the resources of entire states is crucial in this endeavour. There is even evidence (see Herrmann et al., Science 319, 2008) that liberal democratic states encourage the type of altruistic behaviors that MacIntyre sees as the basis for a moral society. As MacIntyre acknowledges briefly, the type of communal groupings he prefers are at risk for the same types of exploitative relations that he assigns to the state. Indeed, the types of close social communal networks he would like to see are most likely to arise in smaller groups with strong familial, ethnic, or ideological bonds. These are often the types of groupings most prone to destructive behaviors and tend to resist the idea of universal human values. Moreover, in order to get the types of communities that MacIntyre desires, the initial locus of reform will have to be the state. His reluctance to deal with structure of the state is self-defeating. On the basis of poor justification, MacIntyre would like to exchange our admittedly imperfect state, which has some real virtues, for a vague utopianism."},{"Title":"Dependent Rational Animals: Why Human Beings Need the Virtues (The Paul Carus Lectures)","review":"Dependent Rational Animals is MacIntyre refusing to give up on the task of integrating Aristoteleanism and redistributionist social justice by making up a new virtue that he says is a combination of justice and generosity and is an acknowledge of our interdependence. Whereas Aristotle focused on human excellence, MacIntyre inverts this perspective to focus on human failing and our dependence on other people. This the source of the term Dependent in the title.The other two terms, Rational and Animals, come from the other characteristics of human life that MacIntyre thinks support his ethical system. A good portion of the book is spent reviewing linguistics and animal research. It is important to MacIntyre for us not to have a conception of human nature that is separate from animal nature. He stresses that our understanding of animal language and of what language represents about rational thought implies that humans are simply on a continuum of animal psychology. For MacIntyre, our thoughts are beyond but of a definite kind with animals:\\"It is because any exercise of the power to reflect on our reasons for action presupposes that we already have such reasons about which we can reflect, prior to our reflection. And for us human beings it is because we do have reasons for action prior to any reflection, the kinds of reason that we share with dolphins and chimpanzees, that we have an initial matter for reflection, a starting point for that transition to rationality which a mastery of some of the complexities of language use can provide. Did we not share such reasons with dolphins and chimpanzees we would not have arrived at that starting point and a denial that we have such reasons would render the transition to specifically human rationality unintelligible.\\" (p.56)This animality underlying our thinking not only rebuts the narratives that certain schools of ethics tell about their reasoning from first principles, it also stresses that our rationality is focused on concepts of flourishing that we can recognize in animals and that it develops in a human community rather than appearing fully formed in our minds.This type of rationality belongs to what MacIntyre calls an independent practical reasoner, which is his term for a functioning adult that has met the prerequisites necessary for human flourishing. The independent practical reasoner lives by virtues instilled by his community and upbringing but has the power to reflect on his actions, critique his beliefs, and grow ethically vis-a-vis the virtues.The core of MacIntyre's argument is short (he's wordy) and the book ends with reflections on the scope of community in which the virtues, especially his socialist just generosity virtue, can function--nation-states are too large and families too small--and on friendship and on Nietzsche.For me, this is a rather ingenious but ultimately failed attempt to reconcile socialism and virtue ethics. Although the focus on human dependence across the lifespan and in sickness highlights the many ways in which we can fail to achieve excellence, it doesn't provide an adequate rationale for reciprocity and falls prey to some of the unrealistic ideological rigidity typical of Marxism. For example, the recognition that sickness may strike us all and that the practice and teaching of virtue is a protection against vice is essentially a game theoretical rationale for virtue, acknowledging the continued utilitarian bias in MacIntyre's thinking. And his disparagement of self-sacrifice as a moral defect on the basis that it implies a trade-off between self and other when people should be taking only for their most minimal needs is a recipe for community economic collapse.MacIntyre's writing is not tight. It wasn't in After Virtue, either, but here is less logical and does not progress effectively. He is engaged really in writing about the virtues rather than arguing for virtue ethics and writes with assumptions, blanket statements, and undefined terms. He introduces one chapter, for example, by simply asserting that we are in a debt to our parents that we must repay by helping to raise other youth.MacIntyre has other problems as well. His account of childhood development is excessively psychoanalytic, referring to mastering \\"conflicts\\" in order to achieve independence from the parent and focusing on good mothering. In fact, does research show that parenting has that much influence on personality development? No.At times, MacIntyre's reflexive liberalism even undermines itself. For example, he denounces sentimentality but later claims that meeting someone who has been horribly disfigured by disease can lead us to realize the ways in which we fail to perceive other people's good qualities because of \\"facial appearances of certain types of other\\" (p.137). This is sentimentality at its height, and it implies a body-mind dualism that MacIntyre spent chapters trying to take apart."},{"Title":"Dependent Rational Animals: Why Human Beings Need the Virtues (The Paul Carus Lectures)","review":"This book is more moving than it is carefully argued.

There's no doubt in my mind that he was a great artist, but his persona left a lot to be desired, and George Jacobs helped by William Stadiem has put it all out there for us to judge for ourselves. This is gossip, but it's of the highest order, so to speak, it and includes just about every political and show biz mover and shaker of the times including JFK and the cast of his Camelot. Jacobs worked as Sinatra's valet and he loved his boss. He ended up being treated like many of the people in Sinatra's life who loved him, abruptly and definitively tossed out of the royal circle. Just how and why this happened is a terrific story filled with memorable scenes. My favorite is the one of FS trashing the lobby of the Sands Hotel and Casino in Vegas in a motorized golf cart with Mia Farrow, his then wife, riding shotgun. I recommend this book with no reservations, but in all fairness to Frank Sinatra, I would call attention to Pete Hamill's, Why Sinatra Matters. Hamill focuses on man as Artist, and lest we forget from reading memoirs like Jacobs, he was that in spades."},{"Title":"Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra","review":"FOUND BOOK BY ACCIDENT.

His stories are excellent, and this makes it a great read for any fan of The Man. Sure, we all knew Frank could be generous in the extreme, but he had real issues holding grudges, sometimes for no good reason. The author here is a prime example of one such event.

Some of language, subjects, and activities described in this book are too explicit for my personal taste and can't say I read every paragraph line for line because of this. One quickly learns the activities Frank was involved in with and adding the colorful, coarse details actually degrades the overall quality of the book.The book does go into a fair amount of detail on his relationships with other well known people and families (the Kennedy's, for example). I did find this to be very informative.One cannot rely on any single book to provide the net sum of a persons life. This book should be read as such. However, Mr. S did provide an interesting read that should be added to other sources of information on Frank Sinatra and taken only as one perspective of the man's life."},{"Title":"Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra","review":"Pretty good read, but also a lot of gossip included.

In every page, it is clear that George Jacobs truly loved Frank Sinatra as a brother. Although I knew quite a bit about Frank Sinatra's life already, I was totally unprepared for how interesting and \\"can't-put-it-down\\" this book turned out to be. I loved it.Frank Sinatra was the best of men and the absolute worst of men. He was the most generous of men and yet he was the most vindictive of men as well. He was a contradiction in human nature in extremes. If you even slightly offended him or were perceived as disloyal, you seldom got another chance.George tells of his relationship with Frank and Frank's rise and fall and rise back again to fame. He writes of his adventures with Frank's family and how wonderful \\"Big Nancy\\" was to Frank - long after the divorce. After reading this, I truly thought Frank Sinatra's first wife was a saint!I expected this book to touch on just the superficial, but it really delved into a part of our history. Like millions of baby boomers, I idolized John F. Kennedy. Yes - I knew that he had an affair with Marilyn Monroe, but I didn't know about the barrage of call girls and cocaine. When JFK was campaigning, he asked George, \\"What do colored people want?\\" Diplomatically, George responded that he didn't know and asked Jack what he wanted (for our country). JFK, with a big leering grin, responded,\\" I want to f*ck every woman in Hollywood.\\" Statements like this just amazed me.As we all know, Joe Kennedy Sr. had many mob connection from his bootlegging days. This book relates how Illinois was virtually a present to JFK from the mob in the election.I had heard about the helicopter pad that Frank Sinatra was reported to have destroyed when John Kennedy's visit was cancelled, but I wasn't aware of the extent of John's deception. Frank Sinatra spent over a year campaigning for JFK; having \\"High Hopes\\" written and performed; and spending a fortune in anticipation of JFK's visit. Without Joe's influence, John totally turned his back on Sinatra and decided to stay at Bing Crosby's (who had supported Nixon)! Moreover, it was highly likely that he set things in motion for Marilyn's death when she threatened to expose their affair. Bobby Kennedy (whom I had also admired) and Jackie were even more ungrateful than John.No one deserved what Woody Allen did to Mia Farrow later in life, but I couldn't help thinking that Mia was so wrong in not setting the record straight with Frank about her dancing with George. George was \\"babysitting\\" Mia and trying to pacify her when she dragged him onto the dance floor. When the paparazzi went wild with these pictures, George's life was to change forever. As a result, he was literally fired overnight by Frank Sinatra. George had money saved, but it is clear that he never recovered from this blow dealt to him by Sinatra.My heart absolutely broke for George Jacobs. I literally cried when he tells how he burst into tears upon seeing Frank after 10 years. Frank went over and touched his shoulder and said, \\"Forget about it kid. It ain't so bad.\\" I do feel Frank Sinatra \\"forgave\\" George, but I believe that Barbara Marx would never have allowed him to rehire George because he knew too much about her past.I had always believed Barbara Marx to be a charitable woman with a great deal of class. She was actually a Vegas showgirl from a poor background who married the much older Zeppo. Everyone knew that she was simply trying to marry money and that she regularly cheated on Zeppo - often with Sinatra. He had known her for years. George was not even allowed to attend Frank Sinatra's funeral - but instead had to watch from across the street.In the end, one realizes that George Jacobs has found peace. He honestly didn't deserve the low blow that Sinatra dealt him. However, you also realize that through his own insecurities, Frank Sinatra lost one of his dearest friends who loved him most. In the end, Frank Sinatra was the one who lost the most. I truly pray that Sinatra came to know this."},{"Title":"Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra","review":"Well, if you thought Ol' Blue Eyes was not the nicest human being on the planet, this book won't persuade you any differently. George Jacobs, his valet from 1953 to 1968, was a talented and handsome black man who worshiped his boss and saw him through some of his most famous ups and downs. So when George dishes the gossip, as he does on almost every page, you feel like you can trust the source. George happily adopted his servile role because frankly (pun intended), there was no greater ride in the world than hanging onto Sinatra's coattails. George was able to go places and meet people and have remarkable experiences that were denied to most mortals. He swelled with pride at his insider's identity and thought that Sinatra's cruel streak would never touch him because of his loyalty. Wrong. One innocent dance with Mia Farrow (whom FS was divorcing at the time) brought down the famous wrath upon George: \\"In one split second, my life had been turned upside down, and I didn't have a clue why.\\" One of the black maids abashedly handed him a letter from Sinatra's attorney: \\"It was short and anything but sweet. I had been dismissed, as of this instant . . . I was not to reenter the premises, nor telephone, nor in any way approach or try to contact Mr. Sinatra. My belongings would be delivered to me in three days. There was no explanation, no apology, no severance pay . . . [just the implication of] do not darken this door as long as you live.\\" He never heard from Mr. S again.Wow. This is how the book starts out, so you read on expecting to hear at some point a tone of bitterness or reproach--but it never comes. George remains rapturous about the glory days that he and Sinatra had together, and what results is almost a valentine to the crooner. Even so, the back cover of the book admits that Frank spared few of those close to him from rejection or scorn: \\"only Ava Gardner, Humphrey Bogart, and Betty Bacall.\\" Ava was always his passion, his unrequited love, and he kept chasing her long after it made sense to do so. He basked in the Kennedy era until he felt marginalized by them and then turned nasty--such that \\"to be Lawfordized\\" became a verb symbolizing his total repudiation of someone. His first wife (Big Nancy, as opposed to Little Nancy the singer) did her best to keep the home fires burning long after his departure, but he seemed indifferent to her hausfrau efforts. Mia was, by all accounts, a hippie flake. And Barbara Marx was, well, a shrew who cut George from the funeral list in one of her many arbitrary displays of power.So why did I read this book from cover to cover? Because George's story was itself remarkable. He strikes one as a very giving person, whose dedication to personal service reaped him many vicarious rewards. He chronicled a remarkable flux in the racial landscape during some critical years in US history, and he bestowed a kind eye on the many folks, celebrities or not, who crossed his path during his glory days. [I was pleased to read that he now earns his living as a master chef and carpenter.] And, Yes!, he ladles out the tittle-tattle in generous portions. Anyone wanting to gain real insight into Sinatra's public and private lives might want to read this book first . . ."},{"Title":"Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra","review":"I didn't have high expectations for this book. The British royal family has shown us that tell-alls by \\"valets\\" and the like leave much to be desired, but this book was a wonderful surprise. It serves not only as an unusual insight into an American icon -- Frank Sinatra -- but also a cultural history of a young black man, George Jacobs, coming of age in the 1950's and 1960's with a front row seat on some of the most important figures of our time from Joe Kennedy to Ava Gardner to Sammy Davis, Jr. I think this book gives provocative insight on our American history through the lens of race, gender and popular culture."},{"Title":"Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra","review":"I had resisted reading this book when it was published because I liked Frank Sinatra and did not want to see him trashed as might be expected by a \\"disgruntled\\" ex employee. Hoever, it was highly recommended by a credible friend so I bought it from Amazon. As it turned out I devoured the book in very little time and the author, George Jacobs, is hardly disgruntled, rather he is respectful and saddened and presents his former boss in a very sympathtic, very inside way. As Sammy Davis, Jr.'s biographer (Yes I Can and Why Me? and Photo By Sammy Davis, Jr.)I knew many of the personalities in this book and was aware of many of the situations Mr. Jacobs reveals so clearly and accurately. Some of it is shocking, probably only possible because the people are dead and cannot sue. But he is accurate on the things I knew about so I have to assume he is on the money all the way. It was a wonderful page turning read. Highly recommended to anyone interested in this subject matter.Burt Boyar"},{"Title":"Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra","review":"Don't get me wrong. I'm a Sinatra Fan. Of his music. I never did buy into the crock of b.s. that painted him as some sort of cultural hero. And I always figured it would just be a matter of time before someone who worked this close to Sinatra would spill the beans. And it's all here. His double standards shine like the Hope Diamond. Do as I say and not as I do seems to be the recurring theme in the Frank Sinatra mantra. He demanded fidelity from his wives, but kept hookers by the dozen at any given time and paid for their abortions like they were monthly Visa bills while everyone else painted him as the picture perfect father of Nancy, Tina and Frank, Jr. His mob ties are legendary and by now general knowledge. Here we find Jacobs giving us all the juicy details. For some reason, the pay was good enough for Jacobs to tolerate Sinatra's unending racial and ethnic slurs which he apparently tossed around freely, never fearing consequence. Yet, for his entire career Sinatra was championed as a great Civil Rights pioneer. Okay, but any Civil Rights pioneer shouldn't toss the N word around so freely. It's not until the late sixties that Sinatra becomes a philanthropist of sorts to untarnish his disgusting image. Jacobs paints an interesting portrait of Old Blue Eyes as the Ultimate Paradox. I found the writing tight, honest and overall it's a book I couldn't put down once I picked it up. Unfortunately, Jacobs himself was kicked out of the Sinatra fold eventually, which makes the story all that more credible. I walked away from the book with a bevy of emotions, angry mostly, that such a talent could be such a jerk for most of his life. There were consequences for the Chairman always wanting to have it his way in his personal and professional life, and now that he's gone we may never know how it might've played out. Today I imagine Frank Sinatra would've been diagnosed as some sort of bi-polar idiot. God knows half of our musicians use that condition as an excuse for their stupid behavior. There indeed is a fine line between genius and lunacy. You'll read Jacob's memoir and walk away satisfied yet ticked off. Guaranteed."},{"Title":"Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra","review":"This book reminds me of the movie Forrest Gump. The big difference is that this book is more than likely true.I am a 40 year old black male and I like FS. I always have. I don't own any of his music or anything like that. Quite frankly, one wouldn't think that I was a fan of FS. Given my age, race, and where I grew up (inner city Chicago), I don't fit the profile of a typical FS fan. I just thought that FS was cool and his music was swingin' (as they used to say).George Jacobs is a Forrest Gump type of character. He seemed to be \\"in\\" on almost every major event that occurred between the time he hooked up with FS until the time he was let go in the late sixties. He had associations with all of the major pop culture stars of the time from athletes to movie stars to presidents. Marilyn Monroe, Cary Grant, Sammy Davis Jr., Sam Giancana, JFK, Spencer Tracy, Bogie, Becall, John Wayne, the Rat Pack, Las Vegas, MGM, the mob, and all the rest....You've probably read the book so there's no need for me recant.I envied George Jacobs but at the same time I felt sorry for him. I envied him for living the life (whether vicariously or directly). He was on the inside. At the same time I felt sorry for George because his entire life revolved around FS. I mentioned that I was a 40 year old black male for a reason. Don't get me wrong, George lived the life as far as having money is concerned and being around all of the who's who of the entertainment world and all the rest. But, to me he was ultimately just the help. IM conflicted a bit because I have fantasized about actually being George. I have to remind myself that George was a young man in his 20's when he 1st started. He was from LA and he had the unique opportunity to work for the biggest star in the world. Who wouldn't do it.What I would not have done is accept all of the racial insults and temper tantrums. I was shocked at some of the stars and their racial attutudes inclucing Sammy Davis Jr. In the end the black \\"characters\\" of the story were all put in their places. Sammy wasn't invited to the biggest and most important party of the year and possibly of FS's career. George was shut out of the home interview by that one TV show ( I forgot the name). They were both given lame excuses for their individual snubs. In my opinion, Sammy was snubbed more so than George. Sammy was a real star. A relevant star. George was the help, plain and simple. I liked George, but he was FS's help/valet and a glorified butler of sorts. Again, I would have loved to be right in the middle of it all (without the abuse). George seem to get full of himself and a little lost and blinded by Fs's star. He often used the word we a lot when referring to where FS was traveling or what guest he was having over for dinner, etc. Blacks have a history of over-identifying with their bosses/masters. Remember Gone With The Wind and the black maid Mammy? Let us remember that she used to be a slave and when the Civil War started and was all over she remained with the family. She even looked down on \\"common field hands\\". Why didn't Mammy leave after the war and be with her own family? Maybe because she over indentified with her master. She loved her master and his kids better than she did her own family. But see when you over identify, often times it's one sided. They are important to you and you are important to them just like a car is important to them. When it breaks down or gets too old or unreliable or out of style or when they get tired of it, they simply get rid of it and replace it with another one. The Golden Rule Baby. Those who have the gold, rules. FS got rid of George and virtually never spoke to him again. Did FS had that much pride? Like someone said in an earlier comment, Mia could have help to straighten things out. She and George were tight, right? I guess it's natural to feel the way George did considering FS was his boss and at the same time, their was some closeness between FS and George. FS did depend on George, but FS would be ok without George. George depended on FS, but George could've suffered emotionally and financially without the \\"good graces\\" of FS. It was sort of like FS was throwing George scraps from the table when he did receive gifts. FS did give George stock in his business when he didn't have to. When George was let go, he did receive a \\"nice\\" check a few months later, although it was Im sure unexpected. Again, relying on FS's \\"generosity\\". Another reality check for George occurred at the end when FS's lawyer sort of threatened him and told him not to contact FS and then used an unnecessary racial slur or comment in doing so. I can understand a bit how FS would use the word \\"spook\\" and the like when it's just George and the gang giving each other sh@t. But how could his lawyer issue a parting shot like that. Maybe because someone really didn't like George. The lawyer probably did it on his own. It all ended up being too bad for George (emotionally).FS was a jerk plain and simple. Then again, he seemed to be this way only around people who associations with him. According to George he was very cordial to the casual fan.I was shocked at JFK's behavior and pretty much all of the stars. When I say shocked, Im referring to their racial attitudes and the whore-mongering. These people had serious flaws. The alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking was outrageous. Some of these people were real snobs. I guess we regular people put these people on such high pedistals and we just forget that they are just like us and we are ultimately responsible for their arrogant behavior.I would love to speak with George or email him. I would love to ask him, Why didn't he leave when FS threw the pasta at him in font of guests? How did it feel to be oncall seemingly 24hrs a day? Did he ever give you any extended personal time off/vacation time? Since FS dumped you like you weren't anything to him, why did you wait until now to tell your story? When you were snubbed for the TV interview, did you believe FS's reasoning (because I didn't)?I really enjoyed this book. I bought it about 2 yrs ago and reread it again a few weeks ago. What a life. I wonder if George would do it all again..............."},{"Title":"Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra","review":"\\"Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra,\\" by his valet of 15 years George Jacobs (whom Sinatra fired for dancing with Mia Farrow), is filled with enough vanity, insecurity, envy, racism, drinking, smoking, womanizing and deal-making for three lifetimes. Jacobs takes the reader into the \\"board room\\" and the bedroom to reveal intimate portraits of the supremely talented larger-than-life Chairman himself, the woman he never stopped loving (Ava Gardner), mobster associates like one-time Al Capone \\"wheel man\\" Sam Giancana, that pitiful plaything of the rich and famous, Marilyn Monroe, and the utterly vile Kennedy father (who was even \\"crueler about Jews than he was about blacks\\") and his charismatic, whore-mongering son (drinking, drugs and round-the-clock sex that had even the insatiable Sinatra panting).If Ronald Reagan's motto was \\"Win one for the Gipper,\\" JFK's (and Sinatra's) surely had to be \\"Win one for the zipper.\\""},{"Title":"Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra","review":"I love a great thoughtful insider memoir.

I enjoyed some of the insights given by other readers, I haven't more to add( since I read the book five years ago ), except that I appreciated the George Jacobs insight into Franks musical ambition and matching discipline.George truly loved Frank with all his heart . This is a MUST read for any Frank fan."},{"Title":"Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra","review":"Some of Frank Sinatra's interactions with friends and foes, with which author George Jacobs purports him to have been involved, are quite outlandish, and can only be confirmed by the testimony of those characters themselves, most of whom are long deceased, e.g., all of Sinatra's Rat Pack cohorts, Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, Ava Gardner, Humphrey Bogart, and Joe, John and Bobby Kennedy.Whether fact or fiction, Jacobs is on the money with less controversial events in Sinatra's life, a few seldom reported before. The book is comprised of the perfect syntax of writer William Stadiem, Jacob's co-author, and clever plays on words and names which alone make the book worth the price.One drawback, however, that makes the book difficult to read is the length of Stadiem's paragraphs. For some reason, most of them are nearly a page long and comprise several topics that should be separated. Perhaps that problem was generated in the publishing end of the project, because Bill Stadiem knows better than that.For a Sinatraphile, this book is a must and rates 5 stars if only to air some new rumors. For someone who isn't familiar with the names of Sinatra's cronies and enemies of yesteryear, they are identified for the baby-boomer generation, and the book still rates 4 stars."},{"Title":"Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra","review":"We all know Frank Sinatra did some interesting stuff. The author, George Jacobs, was his valet from 1953 to 1968, so he saw quite a bit of it. With honesty, brevity and wit, he tells us about it. Right out of the \\"truth is stranger than fiction\\" department. I saw a number of celebrities I recognized in here, and it was interesting to see them off camera. I saw a number of celebrities in here that I've never heard of, and they were interesting too. I think that latter point matters for readers who may perhaps be too young to remember when Frank was doing it his way.

As examples, &quot;Data Types&quot; and &quot;Call&quot; are not included in the Index. Programmers using Visual Basic need to have quick access to looking up data types and specific verbs. Without this, the reader is on his own to dig through the book and hopefully spot what he is looking for. I have gone to this book countless times and rarely find the subject matter I need in the index."},{"Title":"Visual Basic 6: The Complete Reference (Complete Reference Series)","review":"I am have been a Borland Delphi developer for 4yrs stooped in OOP, but I have been interested in learning more about the glorious reviews of Visual Basic 6. I have reviewed most of the books and I found this one to be the best for an experienced programmer to be able to get up and going very quickly in VB6. He waists no time to show you how to create real world apps. I find VB6 fascinating on how it handles COM and Class Objects. If any one wants to develop robust apps think about Delphi 4. It makes COM, DCOM, &amp; CORBA very easy to work with and you get total leverage on developing the Interfaces. Major RAD !!!

The sturdy flaps reveal nothing of interest to inquisitive young minds. For example, rather than friendly ghouls, two lightening bolts hide behind one of the flaps. The flaps are difficult for toddlers to grasp. The text is awkward for both children and adults. It is the first Pooh book my children did not want to read again."},{"Title":"Disney's Pooh Says Boo!","review":"I hope the person at Disney who was responsible for this book was fired, because this book is awful. It seems almost impossible to have problems with a five page-turn book, but this one manages it. First, there is the story line where on one page Piglet builds his &quot;spookable&quot; so he isn't afraid, then on the very next page, he hides under the chair. Did anyone else catch the fact that Tigger and Pooh seem to change their Halloween costumes between page turns. First Pooh has a space-suit (pictured on the cover) then he is a ghost with a sheet over him. Tigger starts out wearing a skeleton outfit, then he too is a ghost with a sheet over his head, then he as no outfit at all at the end. Does Disney employ editors? Hello! This book seems to be a half-hearted Halloween themed board book rushed to market without any thought nor effort placed on storyline, consistency, or logic."},{"Title":"Disney's Pooh Says Boo!","review":"This is a short book -- five rhyming verses, five lift-the-flaps. Piglet is scared of Halloween so he builds himself a &quot;spookable,&quot; a mechanical monster, to test his own mettle. He figures if he can handle he spookable he'll be able to handle whatever Halloween brings. The spookable is a scary-looking contraption. If your child can handle the somewhat scary drawings, they might work for the child just like they do for piglet."},{"Title":"Web 2028","review":"In here are 5 different stories from 5 different authors. But somehow they all are connected by the same themes and characters. I managed to read this book within a week. I found it to be well written and easy to understand. It contains short sentences that are easy to absorb. I suspect it may have been written for teenagers. I'm bewildered as to why no one has reviewed this classic book. It's an honour and privilege for me to review it. While it may have been aimed for a younger market the themes in it are ageless and timeless. Mature readers will appreciate it too. What I loved about it was how my current net experience, while relatively plain, simple and uneventful, is correlated to this future vision of spectacular marvel. In one word, it's fascinating how it views the future of virtual reality and the (hopefully) future eventuating of how the Internet will prosper and develop to encompass our daily lives. I just loved how it projects people into simulated worlds like a cat with nine lives. From history to future space everything and anything is imagined within the Web 2028 and with vivid, exciting detail that humans can only dream of happening in their wildest fantasies...Overall I recommend this book. While I'm normally a sci-fi fan who liked Star Wars, X Files etc. this book appealed to me. I recommend it for all ages especially the young. I dare say it's better than Harry Potter as it's relevant to the current Zeigiest way of life and modern pop culture. Who wants to read about witches and magic when you can summon visions of a promising and idealized utopian high tech future. [Forget} Potter and Lord Of The Rings, read this book NOW!!!"},{"Title":"The Wonderful World of Alpacas","review":"This is a book for kids, not an informational book about alpacas! I bought it thinking it would have good information about raising alpacas. The description is sufficiently vague.

Then folks like me wouldn't have to pay return postage for the wrong book!!"},{"Title":"The Wonderful World of Alpacas","review":"This is a very short and romantic description of life with alpacas but do not buy it with the hopes of getting any real information. It contains nothing. It was very cute but has mostly hand drawn sketches that fill the few pages it has with VERY few words on each page. I should have read the description before I bought it. I am not sorry to own it - it is a wonderful description of the relationship one can have with the animals just no information on their care, habits, or anything having to do with raising them."},{"Title":"The Wonderful World of Alpacas","review":"This small picture book begins with the delights of alpaca and children together, then moves onto the pride of showing and general fun that they are to be around. This is not a book that will help you with husbandry. It is a book that would make a nice addition to a children's library or as a simple introduction to show visitors at field days or events.

I want her early reading experiences to be fun and trimphant!This is the first such book that I'm actually caring to review, because it's perfect. It has a cute story with great pictures, and manages to tell a full, rhyming story with minimal words that can ALL be sounded out by a child who has some phonics experience. My daughter had to turn to me just a couple of times when she didn't feel like working too hard, but I knew she was capable of sounding out every word if she wanted to try.It's the story of Jack and Jill, who want their big dog Bill to pull them up the hill again and again so they can go sledding. When Bill refuses to go again, they pull him up the hill instead-- and eventually, a rabbit scares him off and the rabbit goes sledding down the hill on their sled.Sweet little book; I'm going to search for more \\"Phonics Readers\\" in this series."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill and Big Dog Bill (Step Into Reading Early Phonics)","review":"This was the first Step 1 book my daughter read (at the library, all by herself) and convinced me to purchase almost the entire set of books. These Step Into Reading books are excellent as they have a high-interest factor that motivates her to read. The stories are also wonderfully illustrated in full color, and being a visual learner, my daughter latched on to these books quickly.These Step 1 series are recommended for preschool-K - the stories are in large type and the vocabulary is easy. The stories are also in a rhyming format which makes them easy and fun to read. The full color pictures also provide contextual clues as to the word being used in the text. These early readers have raised my daughter's confidence level in reading, and she is doing so well that I'm purchasing the Step Two books (Preschool-Grade 1). I use these books in conjunction with sight words to reinforce her recognition of common vocabulary."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill and Big Dog Bill (Step Into Reading Early Phonics)","review":"My son first read this as a Kindergartener last year.

While my son is interested in being read to, he hasn't yet developed enough confidence to attempt words on his own. Jack and Jill and Big Dog Bill has allowed him to begin to attempt reading on his own, due to the rhyming words and repetitive phrases/story line present.

Well done book."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill and Big Dog Bill (Step Into Reading Early Phonics)","review":"I bought this book for my four year old who I am teaching how to read. She learnt how to read this book in two days. Many of the words are short and simple. The phoneme matches the grapheme so she was able to sound out the letters to figure out the word.

His favorite topics to write on were the Holy Spirit and personal piety, and his most popular work is this one, \\"Abide in Christ.\\"\\"Abide in Christ\\" is divided into 31 chapters, each of which represents a day in the month. Each chapter begins with a verse of Scripture that is the keynote for the chapter's specific theme. Murray's hope in writing \\"Abide in Christ\\" was that the many Christians who trust in their Savior for pardon and help may also come to know the closeness of union and intimacy to which He invites them with the words \\"Abide in Me.\\"The book explores a variety of topics related to this very important topic of abiding in Christ. For example, some of the chapter titles are: \\"And you shall find Rest for your Souls,\\" \\"As the Branch in the Vine,\\" \\"As your Wisdom (and Righteousness, Sanctification, and Wisdom),\\" \\"Every Moment,\\" \\"Day by Day,\\" \\"Through the Holy Spirit,\\" \\"In Affliction and Trial,\\" \\"That you may bear much Fruit,\\" and \\"Obeying His Commandments.\\" As you can see, \\"Abide in Christ\\" is, in effect, an extended meditation on what it means for the Christian to abide in Christ.What Murray says is good and helps to feed the Christian's soul, and the lesson upon which Murray dwells is an important one. However, there are two major deficiencies I find in Murray's work that leave me somewhat unfilled, in spite of the constant refrain to abide in Christ. First, Murray's understanding of how we abide in Christ is a solely individualistic abiding in Christ. There is little or no mention of the Church and no mention at all of the Sacraments. I understand that many Christian readers may come from a more Evangelical background (I consider myself an Evangelical in many ways), but in any theology the Church is a major way that we abide in Christ, whether in the worship of the Church, the Sacraments, the preaching, or the Christian fellowship we have. The second deficiency is in some ways related to first and that is that Murray is too general in what he says. We are, thankfully, reminded that we must abide in Christ at all times, but Murray offers little practical advice about how to do this. It's not enough to simply hear the same call to abide in Christ again and again: we all need more specific guidance on how to do this better.\\"Abide in Christ\\" is, in summary, a useful but limited guide to the Christian's full abiding in Christ."},{"Title":"A Little Book of Celtic Prayer: A Daily Companion and Guide","review":"In the introduction Duncan says that the Celtic religion is the religion of the mind in the heart, and therefore it resembles Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Unfortunately this book is iconoclastic, and therefore not recommendable for Orthodox - Celtic or Eastern alike. From page 5, \\"Believe direct in the King of elements, Put behind thee ikon-worship\\". The Orthodox do *not* worship images, but believe that the veneration of Holy Icons will be translated to the one depicted on the Icon. Those who refuse to venerate the Holy Icons were anathemized by the One and Undivided Church in 843AD. Perhaps Duncan is not aware of this? Or perhaps he is a protestant. This is not clear from his introduction. In any case this book is useless for Orthodx - Celtic or not. The Celtic Orthodox Tradition possess a Spiritual Wealth of Holy Icons, and it is really a shame that Duncan apparently is unaware of this. 2 stars for the nice binding."},{"Title":"Mercury (The Galaxy)","review":"&quot; Mercury &quot; By Steven L.

Kipp."},{"Title":"Paul Gauguin: A Complete Life","review":"I am disappointed to see that this book is out of print but if you have any interest in Gauguin whatsoever, you should try to get your hands on a copy. This is such an excellent book! Mr. Sweetman has clearly done his homework and he writes beautifully. By the time you finish this book you will feel as though you knew Gauguin for, as much as such a thing is possible, Mr. Sweetman gets you inside the artist's head so that you know what he was thinking and what he was feeling at all the important points of his life. The author gives a very balanced view of Gauguin and of the important people in his life, including his wife Mette. Gauguin is not portrayed as a saint. Mr. Sweetman does not let him off the hook for the shabby way he sometimes treated his friends and family. In other words, this behavior is not excused just because Gauguin was a brilliant artist. On the other hand, Gauguin is not demonized for his irresponsible behavior either, as he sometimes could be a caring person and a good friend. Gauguin left notebooks and correspondence, so when Mr. Sweetman gives you his interpretations of the meanings of some of Gauguin's greatest paintings he is not whistling in the dark. Gauguin himself is oftimes present to tell you what he was trying to do. One of the nice things about the book is that it does not focus exclusively on Gauguin. You learn what what was going on in the Paris art world. There is interesting information given about other artists, such as Camille Pissarro and Emile Bernard and you also learn about some of the art dealers, such as Durand-Ruel and Vollard. You are given in depth information of what was going on in the French communities on Tahiti and in the Marquesas. Mr. Sweetman also provides a sympathetic and reasonable explanation for Gauguin's behavior following the death of Vincent Van Gogh. As Mr. Sweetman says in the book, the picture most people have of Gauguin is based almost completely on the portrayal by Anthony Quinn in the 1950's movie &quot;Lust For Life&quot;. If you read this wonderful book you will get a much more well-rounded picture of what this very complicated man was truly like."},{"Title":"Paul Gauguin: A Complete Life","review":"This is a disturbing story. My previous knowledge of Paul Gauguin basically came from a subway ad for the New York School of Visual Arts, which stated that at age 35 he was working as a bank teller. Being a late-bloomer myself, I wanted to know more. Although this is a long book (565 pages of text plus notes and index), it never got tiring for me. I remained fascinated all the way through. Gauguin created some wonderful works, but I really would not want to have known him. He comes across as very childish and irresponsible (which is perhaps a characteristic that all artists share to some degree). His journeys to Brittany and the South Seas are rendered in detail as Sweetman unflinchingly documents Gauguin's descent into drug addiction, madness and destitution. Sweetman also deftly analyzes Gauguin's work and the impact of those influences, creating a vivid portrait of the artist and his world. Parts of the book are horrifying, especially the descriptions of Gauguin's syphillis-ravaged body. Gauguin was a strange man and his story is an unsettling one. I strongly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art. The book has many black-and-white photographs of Gauguin and his milieu as well as color reproductions of several of the works discussed. This book will guarantee a deeper appreciation of Gauguin's work."},{"Title":"Paul Gauguin: A Complete Life","review":"In terms of scholarship, this is an excellent biography; it's very thoroughly researched about Gauguin's extended family and his upbringing; his marriage and other relationships. However, there were times that I found the author's voice too intrusive. For instance, when describing Van Gogh's and Gauguin's nine weeks' residence together at Arles, I felt the author needed to stop referring to Van Gogh as a \\"madman\\".Then again, there was some unnecessary speculation regarding Gauguin's allegedly erotic feelings for his little daughter, Aline. I sincerely dislike when quick-fix psychology is used by an author who's 'analyzing' an artist's paintings, and 'meanings' are assigned thereto. One man's: he's-got-a-little-girl-fixation-because-she's-painted-sleeping-in-her-bed-with-her-back-turned-toward-the-viewer, is another's: It's a portrait of a sleeping child. Mary Cassatt once portrayed a little girl who's flopped into an armchair with her legs slightly open; does that portrayal make her a potential pervert, too?The author seemed to veer from admiration for Gauguin's artistic accomplishments to an almost mocking tone regarding the (again) 'meanings' of the Tahitian paintings (and/or injecting a tone of derision when describing Gauguin's life in Tahiti). My point is, a better biographer would take an objective view of his subject; this one, about 70% of the time, doesn't.I also wish more, and/or clearer, larger reproductions of Gauguin's work had been included with this volume. Other than these provisos, I found this a well researched and readable biography."},{"Title":"Paul Gauguin: A Complete Life","review":"Brilliant biographer David Sweetman has created a masterpiece with his biography of Gauguin. I don't know how he did it; but I was in awe throughout the reading of this well-thought-out and researched book. Gauguin was a complicated man; and through his exhaustive research, Sweetman gives us the rare opportunity to journey with one of the most colourful and oft-misunderstood artists in history. There are so many new facts uncovered in this book... I could feel the spirit of Gauguin rise up and rebel... http://www.mystic-art.com"},{"Title":"Paul Gauguin: A Complete Life","review":"New and up-to-date information that will surprise lovers of Gauguin's art. You'll really understand who he was after reading this wonderfully thorough masterfully written piece of research. It made me feel like I was traveling with Gauguin, suffering his pain and in the end feeling the triumphs of his achievements. Very colorful."},{"Title":"Paul Gauguin: A Complete Life","review":"I am a voracious reader with some knowledge of art history, but after attempting to read this book for the last six months, I am finally stopping at the half-way mark. It is certainly full of new facts and demonstrates an exhaustive amount of research, but I find Sweetman's narrative plodding and unorganized. Also, the book pre-supposes the reader's depth of knowledge on the subject -- the lack of which is quite obviously my problem in enjoying the book."},{"Title":"His Dogs Albert Payson Terhune and the Sunnybank Collies","review":"This is a book created by the Collie Health Foundation (an extension of the Collie Club of America). It was sold at their fifth annual gathering (2002) at Sunnybank. Only 500 copies were printed,and they sold out within minutes. It is a very difficult book to find (I have number 180, myself), but if you are a fan of Terhune, it is a must have. There are stories and photos of the dogs, and his life, that appear nowhere else, and the authour went to great lengths to \\"...separate the 'real' Sunnybank Collies from the ones that live only in their Master's writing\\". If you are a fan, and you can find a copy, BUY IT! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Ethnographic Atlas of Ifugao: A Study of Environment, Culture, and Society in Northern Luzon","review":"There are books that are fine and attractive volumes, books that are valuable for their purview of other cultures, books that stand alone as art. This atlas, in truth a working volume and nothing to be set aside in some sterile cabinet, is all of those and then some. There are a couple of books that joust for the title of the most beautiful and well-conceived in late 20th century bookmaking -- without a doubt this would be one of the very few.A colleague of mine in graduate school first turned me toward Conklin's work; since then, it occupies a place in my pantheon of the most important works of mainstream cartography even produced, right up there with *The California Water Atlas* (produced in 1980 at vast expense to the State of California), the Richard Kagan-edited *Spanish Cities of the Golden Age*, and perhaps some of the Princeton Architectural Press volumes of the late 1990s.And, y'know, that should count for something. An atlas isn't easy to produce, it's costly and it requires an almost impossible amount to labor. To end up with something so spectacular as the Conklin *Ethnographic Atlas* is an ultimate tribute to him and to his team, as authors, but even more, to Yale University Press, which originally printed the atlas -- although they also allowed it to go out of print, for which we can only mouth the phrase \\"shame.\\"Buy this if you can, consult it in a [really good] library if you can't buy it, and in either event, cherish the knowledge of place and of experience that such a work offers."},{"Title":"Ethnographic Atlas of Ifugao: A Study of Environment, Culture, and Society in Northern Luzon","review":"This atlas is a work of art and a national treasure. This ethnographic atlas is for serious students of Ifugao and the Philippine Cordillera Central. The atlas is also a model for world-wide ethnographic studies. There is not another precedent for such a work. In order to truly appreciate his in-depth analysis of Ifugao agriculture, down to the rice pannicle, one has to see how complex Ifugao agricultural life really is. Rarely in this world do we find individuals as dedicated to their scholarly work as Mr. Conklin."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales - Volume III","review":"Not a complete version.. only has SOME of the tales.

In addition, I was very sorry that it was recorded in modern english rather than the original middle english. If I had known, I would not have ordered and am pursuing a refund."},{"Title":"Deluxe Parish Bible - Ivory","review":"This is a beautiful bible because it includes many inspirational pictures. This book is not just a bible, but it is an excellent reference tool for Catholics. It has a very informative dictionary/encyclopedia in the back of the book, including subjective scripture references. The other characteristic of this bible that impresses me is that titles are embedded in the scripture (i.e., Mark 6:34-44 has the title &quot;The Feeding of the Five Thousand&quot;).If you do not have a good family bible, I strongly recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Willowdale Handcar or The Return of the Black Doll","review":"If you have given up on trying to find meanings, or causes and effects, a Gorey book will be just right for you, and this is pne of his best."},{"Title":"The Willowdale Handcar or The Return of the Black Doll","review":"The Willowdale Handcar is hilarious. The main characters inexplicably ride a handcar past all kinds of shocking and tragic scenes, about which they barely even comment. An underlying mystery develops but remains only vaguely resolved. Edward Gorey's characters are colorful and entertainingly odd."},{"Title":"The Willowdale Handcar or The Return of the Black Doll","review":"Classic Gorey. The illustrations are a fantastic companion to the text. Everything from the counting of cannon balls to the tea cakes iced in a peculiar shade of green. An amazing adventure with a surprise ending; although not for those who expect the unexpected from Gorey. Grerat fun!"},{"Title":"The Willowdale Handcar or The Return of the Black Doll","review":"This is the one little Gorey book that I own, because I relish the challenge of figuring it out! A strange little puzzle of a tale, \\"The Willowdale Handcar\\" enigmatically unfolds a tale of death & tragedy..... none of which the readers (or the main characters) are able to figure out, as they navigate its outer bounds in a stolen handcar.Ostensibly a macabre sort of travelogue, \\"handcar\\" presents us three young folk from the kind of early 20th-century scene that Edward Gorey does so well, who simply \\"borrow\\" a handcar and set out on a trip. Their joyride extends surreally for months, and seemingly takes them across the country, while mysterious and seemingly sinister things happen to the world around them, with fatal results for other characters and no explanation readily given to the reader. And through it all, a strange, crudely-fashioned black doll (a reference to an earlier Gorey book) keeps popping up in the background, as if foreshadowing something unknown........Gorey's short book is a like a cartoon version of Tom Stoppard's \\"Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead\\": a tale of enormous impact, made eerily nonsensical by being told from the perspective of its most peripheral supporting characters, through whom the reader is not privy to the essential facts of the plot. The result is a gleefully impenetrable riddle for the kind of reader who likes to look between the lines of their favorite stories. It is also a chilling reminder of the many forgotten, supporting characters in those same stories, whose fate we never bother to learn; perhaps the underlying lesson of the book, is that EVERYONE matters."},{"Title":"The Willowdale Handcar or The Return of the Black Doll","review":"Those who know Edward Gorey know his humour is not for everyone. That said, for those who appreciate this shade of humour (often also fans of the likes of Tim Burton and Charles Addams), this will be a treat. I'll admit that I laughed myself silly with The Willowdale Handcart."},{"Title":"Eating the Russian way","review":"My family is of Russian descent and I wanted to give my son a recipe book with traditional recipes.

But the condition of the book was very poor"},{"Title":"Test System Design: A Systematic Approach","review":"If this book had been available to me 3 years ago, my path to developing an automated test system would have been much smoother. It is a comprehensive coverage of all the aspects of a test system development program which I have recently undertaken, including some areas (such as upgrading obsolete systems) which were not relevant to my situation.The book provides a one-stop reference for the essential information required in the development process for a test system, including choosing and setting up the most appropriate hardware. The book was technically accurate, and the content is an accurate reflection of the title. It is well laid out and easy to read and understand the principles being presented.Clear emphasis was made of the planning and specification stage of the development. The book contains a wealth of practical information, ideal for the engineer working with ATE test systems."},{"Title":"Test System Design: A Systematic Approach","review":"Test System Design: A Systematic Approach is the only book that I have found that fully covers the subject of designing and assembling custom test systems. It is full of practical hints and tips and would be of practicular value to junior engineers. In summary I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Lakota Way: Stories & Lessons for Living","review":"This book has a wonderful message about ways to live ones life! I am not Lakota, but the traits of humility, honor, respect, courage, persistence and so on are not just traits of the Lakota. These are, or should be, traits we all aspire to. As many have said before, we all know the dictionary definition of these traits, but Marshalls stories really illustrate true life application.I find myself thinking back to things my grandparents said and did, and I can see how their generation lived these same principles. I believe the world would be a much better place if our lawmakers, teachers, leaders, parents and children read this book. If our children are disrespectful it is because they have disrespectful role models.I got the audio book, so I can listen to Marshall tell the stories! Amazing!"},{"Title":"Lakota Way: Stories & Lessons for Living","review":"A most readable and enjoyable little book which gives great insight into the spirit of the Lakota people. Instead of trying to make the Lakota into white people, white people should have paid more attention to what the Lakota were trying to tell the world. The problem, in the world today, is the lack of respect people give to each other. People are too full of hate and too judgemental to respect and listen to other points of view beyond their own. This book should be required reading for all people."},{"Title":"Lakota Way: Stories & Lessons for Living","review":"One of the best book I have ever read on a positve approach to life"},{"Title":"Lakota Way: Stories & Lessons for Living","review":"This book offers timeless tales of love, honor, respect, dignity etc. It should be required reading in all schools.

I had already read three of Marshall's books but when I unwrapped it after buying it, my first reaction was it was a mistake to buy it. It was not what I was expecting. Much to my pleasant surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed Marshall's story telling.I highly recommend anything he writes. I am currently reading his book on Crazy Horse and it is excellent. His book, \\"Walking with Grandfather\\" is outstanding.Marshall is certainly one of the Elders of his tradition and is an accomplished writer and historian. His works are a must read."},{"Title":"Lakota Way: Stories & Lessons for Living","review":"This was the best book I have read in almost 10 years. Joseph Marshall presents human virtues, that I would hope we would all strive to achieve, with examples of historical events, life experience, and cultural stories and legends. This presentation makes it so easy to relate to. It is as if a grandfather you look up to is trying to teach you how to live life a an honest, integral person. I personally think it should be a required read for school student, because unfortunately, too many growing people seem to be missing these lessons, and perpetuating horrible behavior. Great Book!"},{"Title":"Lakota Way: Stories & Lessons for Living","review":"I was truely swept away by this book. All the different stories relating to the Virtues are wonderful.

It made me rethink a few assumptions I had about myself. I think all of us know the dictionary definition of virtues such as generosity and wisdom, but Marshall shares stories and personal insights that teach how to weave those qualities into the fabric of your life. This book is warm-hearted and inspiring. Its organization is well suited for discussion groups.

I am a Christian Lakota man and I believe much of this book expresses the invisible, indelible etching of God's fingerprint upon the soul of man...the high morals He has placed in our hearts. I used to listen to my father tell me stories of his days growing up on the reservation and Mr. Marshall's book brought back so many memories of my father....a full-blood Lakota who died much too early."},{"Title":"Lakota Way: Stories & Lessons for Living","review":"Thank you, thank you Joseph, for writing authentically about Lakota life. There is nothing \\"new age\\" or pretentious about this book; it is not \\"mother earth and red road spirituality for wanna-be's.\\" It's a humble collection of legends, interspersed with Marshall's commentary about how the values taught in each legend apply to peoples' lives today. He connects old stories with experiences from his own life--which are the best parts of the book, I think--such as memories of his grandparents' lives, what it's like to live on Rosebud, and how leadership traits are recognized in (or by) others. It's not fancy, it's not glitzy and trendy, it's not perfumed with all sorts of mystical terminology and \\"Indian-religion-for-sale\\" commercialization (there are plenty of other books for that, and sadly, they sell better). This is just a gentle man's stories and well-expressed values."},{"Title":"Lakota Way: Stories & Lessons for Living","review":"I borrowed this book from the library andwhen I started reading it, I couldn't putit down.

Nothing could be further from the truth! Native peoples of turtle island lived a common sense life style. One full of family,nation,wisdom, and freedom. A person was their words and deeds,plain and simple. God and the mystery of life was all around. Not in some far off heaven or some after life only. All life was our realations not something to use and exploit. Life is a sacred mystery.Mr. Marshall shows us the lakota way to live. And some good insight into his culture as well.

Marshall then discusses the virtue more and includes personal stories of how his family and community helped him to learn the virtue. The book also has interesting information about how Lakota are socialized, and more about the history of this nation.

The important thing is we can relate to the stories and learn the moralbehind each of them easily.

Not only was I enlightened in that aspect, but I gained some insight into the kind of life that I want to live, and the person I want to be. Joseph M. Marshall III, does more than simply list the qualities that are important to the Lakota people. He draws the reader a picture of each quality with stories that have been passed down to him through his family. Not only do these stories show that strength and tenacity of the Native American People through all their hardship at the hands of the whites, but they show people overcoming human weaknesses, and their lives being richer and happier for it. Marshall also describes the outcome of the Native American struggle against the whites differently than I've ever heard it described, that the Native people in this country were never defeated! Through everything the whites put them through, they emerged whith a strong sense of where they came from and where they are going. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Lakota Way: Stories & Lessons for Living","review":"This book is an outstanding resource for parents of Lakota children and for teachers, teacher education professors, journalists, counselors, social workers, or anyone who works with Lakota people.Joseph Marshall is an authentic voice bringing back old stories and contemporizing them for his readers as a way of sharing and passing on Lakota wisdom and values for future generations. So many &quot;experts&quot; on the Lakota culture are really just scholars who cannot reach the true center of the culture because they haven't lived it. Joe is the real thing,and his voice is both humble and eloquent as he relates his life to the stories his grandparents told him.I used the book in my summer course for teachers and they have taken it back to their classrooms to use with their students as a way of encouraging Lakota children to write their own stories. I just can't say enough about how great this book is. There is also a CD of Joe reading some of the stories, which is extremely helpful in a classroom setting.His other short story collections &quot;The Dance House&quot; and &quot;On Behalf of the Wolf and the First Peoples&quot; are excellent also."},{"Title":"Lakota Way: Stories & Lessons for Living","review":"If I were still teaching my native language: Lakota, I would use this book in my classroom.

This book was a suggested title through a reading program at our church. While the book contains many traditional stories from the Lakota people, it contains many lessons for life for everyone.It is good to see that this traditional stories have been recorded. As culture has changed, fewer and fewer of our stories are being passed from generation to generation. Stories such as these are timeless. They are relevant now and will be in the future, they are relevant for both Lakota and non-Lakota alike."},{"Title":"Lakota Way: Stories & Lessons for Living","review":"After years of listening to insufferable white posturers and Indian writers beating the tom-tom just a bit too loudly, I have finally come upon a writer who has produced a humble, honorable, knowledgeable book that reflects the application of Indian traditions to the situations that all of us face today. This is not a book for the confused seeker, the desperate wannabe, or the trafficer in the newest new age philosophy du jour. Rather, it is a book for the caring, thoughtful human being who looks into the heart as well as the mind for guidance on life issues. An added benefit is that it is full of wonderful and illustrative stories, lightly told. If you don't feel that the Great Spirit has ordained you to wear eagle feathers and take an Indian name, but you value the rich, earth-embracing philosophy of the Lakota people, please get this book. You will find yourself quietly enriched and illuminated, all in a way that New Age self help books can never begin to provide. Thank you, Mr. Marshall. You remind us that wisdom whispers, it doesn't shout. Keep up the good fight.

There are plenty of writers who can take you for a ride, the whole point of it being the ride. Marshall delivers you to a moral, introspection, or a profound thought.I also loved The Dance House, Marshall's short story collection from Red Crane Books. Oliver's Silver Dollar, which is being considered for a film, is the true story of one man's incarceration in a state mental hospital, all because of a misunderstanding and the division between two cultures.There has been and continues to be a dismissal by whites of the Indian way as pagan and unenlightened. Prepare to be enlightened."},{"Title":"Lakota Way: Stories & Lessons for Living","review":"The wealth of virtues discussed in this book through the legends of the Lakota tribe are presented in a way that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. A wonderful book that is enjoyable to read, and educational as well. This book now sits on my top shelf, with the few other books that I re-read regularly. This is a place of honor, and speaks to the greatness of Mr. Joseph M. Marshall's explanation of the traditional legends, and their connection to modern life. You don't have to be a Native American to enjoy this book. Read it, and re-read it.

Each chapter is dedicated to a virtue essential to the Lakota (better known as the Sioux) people. Mr. Marshall masterfully paints a picture of each virtue by sharing traditional stories passed down through the generations. Important lessons in life are wonderfully illustrated and can easily be connected to modern day life. He incorporates his own fascinating life story throughout, providing additional insight into Lakota beliefs and customs. A historical overview featuring tribe development, ceremonies, battles, heroes, and relocation makes this a wonderfully enlightening read as well. For instance, the compelling story of Crazy Horse, \\"whose humility outshone his fame\\", was utterly captivating.Mr. Marshall is truly a gifted storyteller with an engaging and eloquent writing style.

Some of the customs were strange, but I found that the story and the characters really kept my attention. The writing is intelligent. Children of many cultures will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Aruna's Journeys","review":"I whole heartedly recommend this book to Indian Americans as well as American kids. It is a very authentic portrayal without the usual stereotyping that occurs."},{"Title":"Aruna's Journeys","review":"I would give this book a four star rating. I would recommend this book to a friend. In this book I felt as if India was important. Some characters in this book were supportive, and liked India. This is a good book and I think Indians would really like it. Girls would probably like this book."},{"Title":"Aruna's Journeys","review":"This book is out dated and I've never met anyone like that. Aruna might be disliked because her personality doesn't match people she hangs out with. Aruna Journey is from an older time and doesn't reflect current situations. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, because they will get the wrong idea about Indians. For example, Aruna's parents don't let her have sleepovers or become what she wants when she grows up but other Indians do that. Or Vandana's education and marriage other families in India have love marriage, and everyone gets an education, and they are Indian. This book is not very good and I give a recommendation to nobody."},{"Title":"Aruna's Journeys","review":"This book made me feel different. I felt that I wasn't something good, like all Indians/Indian Americans were bad. But they did show our traditions and stories. I liked that the author showed character in each of them. I would not recommend this to anybody, because again, it made me feel different than who I am. My relationship with India is that my parents are from India, so is the rest of my family, except my grandpa. Though I was not born in India, I still love India."},{"Title":"Aruna's Journeys","review":"This book is really good, but I think the author could have done some things much better because some of the things in this book are very stereotypical, like when she's at her friend's house eating a hamburger and they call it the \\"American dream.\\" The author also made the parents of Aruna not very time wise because right when Aruna wants to go to summer camp they want to go to India. I would rather go to India, but she was kind of selfish because she wanted to go to summer camp. The part I liked was when Vandana went on a hunger strike since it was unique. Next time the author writes a book, she should get rid of stereotypes."},{"Title":"Aruna's Journeys","review":"I encourage kids to go to India this very summer - with Aruna. (But any time of year and any age traveller can do ARUNA'S JOURNEY with her and learn so much - about many things.) My husband and I lived in Karnataka, India, during our years in the Peace Corps (and then returned to India several times later), and this book brought back lots of memories for me. First of all, it is an adventure of place and the people Aruna finds there. The journey also becomes one of discovery for Aruna - of the richness and complexities of her heritage, of being loved by so many, of what happens when a desire to fit in crashes head-on with a new sense of who you are and your power to choose your own way. And it's not all about Aruna. Some of the other characters just complicate life; others make you wish they'd return the visit so you could spend more time with them and learn how their lives will unfold. This is a book to read AND to talk about together. I'm so glad to see that there are materials already available to extend the learning in the classroom, and I recommend this story to teachers looking for books that will spark curiosity, thought, discussion, and a love of reading."},{"Title":"Aruna's Journeys","review":"Aruna's Journeys describes an Indian girl with an inner struggle as she merges her native culture with her American life. Aruna doesn't want to be different from the other kids in her class at her American school. She wants to be accepted. Children who read this story will be able to relate to Aruna because they have dealt with similar situations regardless of what culture they are from. Aruna's journey would be relevant to use in the upper elementary and lower middle school grades. The book could easily be integrated in a large unit focusing on diversity and culture. Character education could also be emphasized. Concepts such as respect and kindness could be discussed."},{"Title":"Aruna's Journeys","review":"In my point of view, I think that the book Aruna's Journeys wasn't the best book I've read. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone in particular because the way it was thought out was showing ways that what the author thought was how all Indian Americans acted when talking about their culture. When Aruna says that she's different than her classmates, I find that true, but I don't mind that I'm different, unlike Aruna who wants to change the way she looks so she can fit in. I was born here in America, but I still visit India every two years and I celebrate my culture whenever I can. If a teacher or one of my friends asks me about India, I can answer without feeling guilty about it or feeling out of place. Aruna always feels uncomfortable when she's asked questions about India. So in the end, I don't feel awkward when someone asks me about India, and I like to celebrate my culture."},{"Title":"Adam's breed","review":"Set in an italian neighborhood in England with WWII as a backdrop, a child is born, fatherless and instantly motherless, into a family who can not love him. He is not one of them, and his grandmother and grandfather see him as the murderer of her child, thier daughter...but they raise him out of obligation, teach him to work in their deli, send him to good schools, and fulfill their obligations to him. Gian Luca does well, forges his way very well in everything he does, but a time comes when he can no longer offer himself to his own success...he begins to see himself, and others in a way that challenges his sense of place in life.. A beautiful book for those who appreciate the culture of food, the myth of neighborhood, the dynamic and extraordinary constitution of family, and how all of these things tie to each other and lead back to the individual man's relationship with living. This is a strange, and engaging book, so well written, and very unique. I wish there were a way to get this book back IN print! I buy this book as a gift often. A book you want to share with others."},{"Title":"Adam's breed","review":"This book sheds light on male identity, bi-racial attitudes and connection to place and time.

It does walk you one by one through every possible menu item etc, although again not in a particularly useful order. As others have said, most of what is there is already available in the online help. It would have been much better to have gone though the process of building a site to show the user all of the steps involved from planning to implementing to refining...My other major complaint is one of the legibility of the screenshots - of which there are very many. They are presented at a size where it is very difficult to read the text on them, although this is important to understanding the book.There are other brief niggles, the language is strange in some portions, and there is one point where the author refers the user to a very good online tutorial in German (can't really think why a professional editor would let that get through.)Lastly, the price is rather high for a computer book - maybe it would be better value if a real example based tutorial were added."},{"Title":"Building Websites with Joomla!

There is no tutorial here, there is no step-by-step here.Honestly, I played with the software for a few hours before I bought the book and I felt I was already way ahead of what was written here. Bitterly disappointed."},{"Title":"Building Websites with Joomla! A step by step tutorial to getting your Joomla! CMS website up fast","review":"Having downloaded and installed Joomla without incident, I played around with the administration pages enough to get a feel of what was going on: there were templates that had places to put sections, which contained various categories, that contained content. After convincing myself Joomla! was exactly what I wanted, there were three tasks I wanted to get into immediately. 1) Removing the example junk from the page (e.g., \\"powered by Joomla!\\" and its banners). 2) Customize my own templates. 3) Inject some of my own PHP. Given that I'm familiar with Linux, Apache, MySQL, HTML/XML/XSLT/CSS, and PHP, all I needed was some simple documentation to show me where to start and how the architects laid out the system so that I could make modules that were Joomla! friendly.This book totally failed to live up to the task.There's something slightly off about the author's command of the English language. Word choices don't seem quite right, the analogies are obtuse and unnecessarily complicated, he gets overly excited about non-issues, and there's inconsistency between diagrams and corresponding code. (e.g, a picture will show something as a \\"section\\", but the HTML will show it as a \\"part\\" -- very confusing when it's unclear if this code is related to that picture).The book does a half-way decent job of walking through each menu item, which is an extensive feature list. Problem is, the book is already dated, and the descriptions aren't that much more detailed than the text hints provided on Joomla! pages themselves.The section that talks about creating templates instead presents a horrible and incomplete example of basic HTML, no where getting to what you need to know to make an actual template. Right at the point where PHP calls are needed to inject content or behavior, the book glosses over details, providing not so much as a function reference. In short, you're flying blind.The section on modules and writing PHP is just as bad, if not more so incomplete. You're pointed a list of modules other people have written, but given very little instructions other than to fill out the forms when presented after installation.I was really under impressed with this book.After going through the whole book, I realized there wasn't a thing covered that I hadn't figured out in 15 minutes of casual playing with the software.There's much more that's needed other than a bunch of screen shots. This book simply doesn't deliver. Try another title."},{"Title":"Building Websites with Joomla! A step by step tutorial to getting your Joomla! CMS website up fast","review":"As one of the previous reviewers mentioned - the book does not cover anything more than one would be able to find on Joomla! forums. I was disappointed by the size - although the structure seems to be good and the chapters cover every aspect of Joomla!, the author does not bother to go into details and present explanations that would go beyond the Joomla! forums or their help service.Besides the quantity, the print (it seems to be printed through a laser printer) and the design just do not go together with the price. Most of the space is cluttered up with huge screenshots that would not have to be so big if the print quality would be better thus leaving much less space for more thourough explanations.For the same price one can find better manuals with more text written with the conscience that the writer should be creative in understanding how to help beginners and not just copying the texts that are already available online.This is the most disappointing buy of a software manual in this year for me and I strongly suggest customers to wait for a better book and be satisfied with the extensive Joomla! help service."},{"Title":"Building Websites with Joomla! A step by step tutorial to getting your Joomla! CMS website up fast","review":"This book is worth the $40+ dollars I paid for it b/c I believe it will save me time messing when compared with the rather frustrating online documentation for Joomla!The text is an introductory one and focused primarily on NON-PROGRAMMERS. It reads much like the manual that should be in the Joomla! online documentation, but isn't yet. It is true that you can muddle through the Joomla! program and get most things figured out, but this book will help you do it quicker.What it will be really good for is to loan it to clients I've installed Joomla! for so they can quickly get up to speed on what most things do. There are so many options in Joomla! it can be overwhelming at first and this guide helps break it down into bite sized pieces.What it isn't, and I sooo wish it was, is a particularly effective guide on how to program components, modules, and mambots. It can be done from the information provided but I like to understand every little thing before I start programming and that is not the case here. It is after all an introductory text.The spelling errors and language issues mentioned in another post are isolated to the Preface, Chapter 1, & Chapter 3. Page 2 has fro instead of for. Chapter 1 pages 16 & 17 show some example sites in German & Norwegian, however the language is unimportant since it's the style I was concerned with. Page 50 mentions a tutorial in German, not real useful, however since I understand how to work a search engine I'm pretty sure I can find the htaccess information I need.I would definitely buy a intermediate/advanced version of this book. There is an Apress book coming out in August about Joomla! I hope that will fulfill that product niche. I also really like that the publisher donates a portion of the proceeds back to Joomla!I actually scanned chapters 7-9 & the appendix and carefully read the rest of the book.

Do you really need the author to tell you to place the title of your page or module in the box marked Title???? For modules and components, it explains what they are but does not offer one line of text on either telling you how to use them. I can go on and on, but to make a long story short save your money.

The only thing you need to get started is PHP, Apache and MySQL. Joomla's modular structure allows the user to customize and extend the basic setup to meet their needs.Graf begins by discussing Joomla's various features and gives a general overview of how the program can be applied in real world situations. He then begins to give step-by-step instructions for how to install Joomla. Because the purpose of Joomla is content management, Graf explains in detail the program's structure and how to enter and organize your content.After covering the default setup, Graf talks about extensions - components, modules and mambots which are three ways to extend and customize Joomla. There are many of these extensions available on the web that can be used with or have been written specifically for Joomla. Graf discusses a few of his favorites. First, he talks about the Simpleboard component and accompanying modules which will add a forum to the Joomla base program. He also covers the Events Calendar component and accompanying modules. Next, he discusses the gallery component called zOOm Media Gallery and the E-Commerce component called VirtueMart.You can customize more than just Joomla's functionality and Graf explains how to create your own webpage templates to customize the appearance of your site. You can even use Adobe Dreamweaver to create these custom templates. Finally, for those readers who have a special need that has not yet been addressed, Graf shows how to create your own extensions.Hagen Graf has been programming since the late 70's and now works in his wife's consulting company as well as many other projects. He has written three computer books in his native German language and two have been translated into English."},{"Title":"Strike!","review":"Mary Heaton Vorse, author of \\"Strike!,\\" had been a labor reporter and activist off-and-on for 17 years when she ended up reporting on the Loray Mill strike in Gastonia, North Carolina in 1929. There were many strikes during the 20s and 30s, and the reasons for this one was typical of the time: low pay, the \\"stretch-out\\" system - which forced them to double their work load for small increases in pay - and 12-hour work days. Before it ended, a strike leader was murdered, a police chief was killed, and several organizers and workers were tried and convicted under dubious circumstances.The Gastonia strike wasn't the bloodiest, nor was it even successful. But it was unusual because it happened in the South, where unionism was weak, and because of the number of women and girls involved in it. Not only did women make up nearly half the work force at the mill, but many of the strike leaders as well. One of them, Ella May Wiggins, was a 29-year-old mother of nine who'd written a number of ballads about the union and the strike. After she was killed, the strike collapsed.Within four years, six novels were written about the strike, now collectively known as the \\"Gastonia novels.\\" In addition to \\"Strike!,\\" the novels were:\\"Beyond Desire\\" by Sherwood Anderson\\"The Shadow Before\\" by William Rollins, Jr.\\"Call Home the Heart\\" by Olive Tilford Dargan\\"To Make My Bread\\" by Grace Lumpkin\\"Gathering Storm\\" by Dorothy Myra PageVorse's book is a fictional version of the events in Gastonia, and the first of the six to get published. The story is told through Roger Hewlett, a Northern reporter who's been sent by his newspaper to cover the strike. Through him, we meet Ferdinand \\"Fer\\" Deane, the Northern organizer leading the workers, and Irma Rankin, another organizer. There's a sexual tension between these two, and because Fer is idolized by the workers, Irma resents him and the attention he gets.Roger gets to know the striking workers, and over time becomes not only a supporter, but a collaborator. Because he grew up affluent and well-connected, he was able in the beginning to mingle with the upper classes in town, where he hears first hand their views of the mill workers. Most of the \\"comfortable people\\" see the workers as ungrateful, wasteful, and easily manipulated. They also feel the strikers are criminals who should be run out of town, or worse.Many of Roger's colleagues from the other papers mention a \\"lynchy feeling\\" in town early in the novel, which foreshadows the legal and vigilante violence that comes later.During the strike, the workers face months of abuse and attacks from the townspeople. After the strikers started a food storehouse, masked vigilante's break in and destroy everything, including all the food. When workers come to fight them off, the vigilantes' rush off just as National Guardsmen arrive on the scene. But, in a perversion of justice, the guardsmen arrest the workers and allow vigilantes to walk away.Later, the mill starts evicting workers from mill-owned housing - most workers lived in mill houses - but instead of giving in, they band closer together and start a tent city on the edge of town.The harassment continues until one night, for unknown reasons, the police chief and some of his officers try to force their way inside the tent city. All of them are drunk, and at some point one of them starts shooting. The workers fire back, and in the gunfight that follows, the police chief is killed. After a mob attacks the striking workers, 72 of them are arrested and held for murder.The heart of the book, nearly a third, is dedicated to the trial, and Vorse describes it in detail. But, the climax comes after the trial, and it lives up to the \\"lynchy feeling\\" some reporters had noticed earlier in the novel.Throughout much of the book, Vorse describes the strike as a living being. After the workers had resisted the evictions, she describes the strike as, \\"A living thing which had a life of its own. It was strong and lusty, it almost bled to death, it grew feeble, and again it became stronger.\\" But, on the other side was the mob, which a preacher called, \\"A raving, witless thing.\\" As Vorse writes, \\"Collectively human beings are at their best or their worst. They climb perilous heights of beauty and sacrifice together. And together they revert to the hunting pack, creatures aslaver for blood.\\" It's clear who she sees as being at their \\"best\\" and who's at their \\"worst.\\"The one weakness in the book is the number of mill workers Vorse juggles. Getting to know so many of them helps the reader see the workers as people, as opposed to simply a faceless mass, but most are not important to the main narrative and at times it's hard to keep them straight. Fortunately, it doesn't distract too much from the story or the climax.The book this review is based on contained an excellent introduction by Dee Garrison, a historian who's studied Vorse and her work. Garrison gives a general background of the period, of Vorse's life, and the facts of the Gastonia strike in just 12 pages. I recommend buying a book with this introduction."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Weight Training for Skiing (The Ultimate Guide to Weight Training for Sports, 23) (The Ultimate Guide to Weight Training for Sports, ... Guide to Weight Training for Sports, 23)","review":"DisappointingWhen the Soviets tested potential ski racers the key desirable capability they were looking for was leg strength (60%) with specific focus on explosive power (plyometrics). The remaining attributes tested for were skeletal alignment (posture), flexibility, balance, reaction speed, and range of movement from center core through the hips, knees and feet (joints) - with special attention paid to range of dorsa flexion.BTW neither the Soviets nor anybody else cares about upper body strength other than how it might be tweaked to improve posture or overly trained which might negatively affect flexibility.So you would think a book so targeted to weight training for skiers would focus on lower body strength with special emphasis on enhancing both flexibility and range of motion. And would most certainly reference the bio mechanics required to be a good skier. \\"The Ultimate Guide to Weight Training\\" ignores all these frames.Rather it is a standard rehash for a general strength program - it might as well been written and targeted for badminton players and weekend anything."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Weight Training for Skiing (The Ultimate Guide to Weight Training for Sports, 23) (The Ultimate Guide to Weight Training for Sports, ...

Eventually Vesper becomes part of Holberg's milieu, a transcriber of Holberg's compositions, confidante of his wife and sister-in-law, friend and admirer of Holberg's iconoclastic, elderly aunt, and a member of the &quot;hideous Greek chorus of yes-men who can't do a thing ourselves.&quot;The relationship between Holberg and Vesper and the parallel relationships between Vesper and the other members of Holberg's &quot;family&quot; are fascinating for their psychological insights, and Astley develops them with sophistication and elegance. The debilitating effect of Holberg on those surrounding him is obvious, but just as obviously, most of those involved with him are unable, for a variety of reasons, to break clear of him. They are, as Vesper says, &quot;like the slaves who built tombs for the pharaohs,&quot; until, of course, the tension builds to a life-changing climax for all.More character-based than many of Astley's other novels, this novel is filled with details which the reader must filter and evaluate in order to figure out what is happening. Astley is distanced from the action, requiring the reader to draw conclusions on his/her own. A certain archness or self-conscious cleverness, which may be appropriate in telling about a character like Holberg, nevertheless requires the reader to &quot;translate&quot; what she's saying into real-world terms, and it sometimes feels artificial and off-putting. Mordantly satirical in parts, the novel is filled with religious imagery, and as the tension between Holberg and his acolyte, Vesper, increases, the reader finds the boundaries between savior and sinner increasingly blurred. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Feeding Nelson's Navy: The True Story of Food at Sea in the Georgian Era","review":"Cervantes in \\"Don Quixote\\" lampoons the writers of chivalric romances for failing to address the mundane realities of life, chief among them being how their heroic knights errant managed to feed themselves. To a lesser degree, perhaps, the modern authors of nautical fiction likewise do not much address the question of how their seaborne heroes (and their crews) were fed, day in and day out. Undoubtedly this is partly because it is far more interesting to write about boarding an enemy frigate than boiling salt beef, but I suspect that it also has to do with the absence of readily available, reliable information about the subject. Now, Janet Macdonald has addressed this want of discussion with \\"Feeding Nelson's Navy: The True Story of Food at Sea in the Georgian Era\\". Coming from a background of writing about cookery, she has tackled the complex and surprisingly mysterious question of how in the world the Royal Navy fed itself during the classic Age of Fighting Sail. Although it might be thought that a matter of such obvious vital importance to maintaining a fighting fleet of tens of thousands of mariners would have been recorded officially in detail, in point of fact Macdonald has had to sift through obscure primary documents such as ships' logs, personal memoirs, and period letters to adequately explore how it was all done: from procuring the foodstuffs (and drink) in the first place, to storing them, getting them to the ships in port and at sea, storing the victuals aboard, preparing meals, and serving them to officer and crews. And even with such diligent research, she must resort to informed speculation to address some questions, such as just how a ship's cook kept separate the rations for the various messes and served them out in an efficient manner. The breadth of coverage is impressive: the Navy's Victualling Board administration, officially mandated rations and substitutes, typical recipes, shipboard organization, disease and vermin, the \\"hardware\\" of food preparation and consumption (stoves and dining implements), and surrounding social customs. For anyone interested in the real world of the Royal Navy behind the fiction Horatio Hornblowers and Jack Aubreys, \\"Feeding Nelson's Navy\\" is a revelation, dispelling old myths and offering new facts such as the caloric and vitamin content of the men's meals. Macdonald throughout her book illustrates the practicalities of the subject by citing numerous real-life incidents drawn from period documents."},{"Title":"Feeding Nelson's Navy: The True Story of Food at Sea in the Georgian Era","review":"In \\"Feeding Nelson's Navy\\", author Janet MacDonald has put together some remarkable research to lay waste the myths of shipboard feeding in the British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars.The British Navy, in the long struggle against Revolutionary and then Imperial France, kept tens of thousands of men at sea for months on end. Popular myth has them subsisting on rotten salted meat and weevily bread. MacDonald shows the sailor aboard the average British warship ate a sufficient and reasonably nutritious diet. Official rations were based on biscuit (pilot bread for today's readers), salt beef, salt pork, cheese, peas, oatmeal, and beer. These were the foods which kept best in a world without refrigeration or canning. Other foods were provided when available, and the British Navy lead the way in experimenting with dried vegetables, \\"portable\\" soups, and lemon juice to stave off nutritional diseases such as scurvy.The British Navy's ability to supply its sailors with a good ration through years of war were thanks to the efforts of the Navy Board and its victualing system. MacDonald's description of its business techniques may be daunting for the reader, but the lesson is that the system was made to work, around the fleet and around the world, in a consistent manner. No other navy of the period enjoyed so much consistent success at sea.Along with the details of the ration cycle and the mechanics of the supply system, MacDonald provides considerable insight into \\"messing\\" at sea, a vital and often unremarked portion of naval culture.This book is very highly reccommended to students of the Nelsonian Navy and of the Napoleonic Wars. MacDonald has mined this particular academic niche to its reasonable limits."},{"Title":"Feeding Nelson's Navy: The True Story of Food at Sea in the Georgian Era","review":"Author Janet Macdonald writes an informative and in depth book about feeding English sailors in the early 19th century. Macdonald covers everything that made up the sailors diet, from hard tack (ships biscuit) to salted beef. She writes in detail for example how the hard tack was made, who made it, and how it was delivered, stored and dispensed on the ships. She covers the different subjects throughly and supports her writings with facts from many sources such as the Naval historical archives and log books to name a few sources.This book is an interesting read for those who want to know about such a integral part of the English sailor's life!"},{"Title":"Feeding Nelson's Navy: The True Story of Food at Sea in the Georgian Era","review":"This is a subject that has always fascinated me, and also a subject of great misinformation. Many naval fiction books tell of the horrible food served to the British navy during the Age of sail, yet we know it couldn't have been that bad.This book contains the truth- with and without weevils. One surprising conclusion is that the daily diet was nigh on 5000 calories! yes, it might have been boring and surely some of the tales of rock hard \\"salt horse\\" are true, but by and large it wasn't that bad.The well researched book also contains looks into the diet and rations of the other sailing navies of the time.One nice addition is a number of recipes at the back, where you can try your one hand at eating like a \\"jolly tar\\". Make yourself some lobscouse and imagine you're supping with Cap't Hornblower or Aubrey.Fun, interesting and informative.She missed one small item from the nutritional chart on page 180- dried peas.

This book is one that justifies HIS devotion, and rewards the reader for his/her loyalty. Time well spent!It has been pointed out in many cases that it is difficult to give Magnus a task too difficult to accomplish, too daunting to undertake, but this one gives him a REAL challenge.The plot is simple... Magnus' continuing goal to provide regressed colonies with the government best suited to the needs of the society present on each planet he encounters, primarily by inserting himself into said society. What he finds on this planet is a Brazil-esque bureaucracy managing every facet of society. With no open rebellion in sight, and fewer even capable of thinking of one, Magnus has no method to use short of bloody mayhem. What he actually does do is both innovative, and emotionally draining. Magnus does things which, while noble and compassionate in nature, still have him questioning his own ethics. The solution to this society's problems takes much longer to implement than in previous quests, a statement on how difficult it is, even with Magnus's considerable talents, to start a revolution where there is no conception of what revolution IS.From the lofty viewpoint of three books later, it is easy to say that, so far, this is the BEST of the Wizard series. Magnus has to make some very difficult decisions on his own about HOW to use his abilities... Stasheff poses some difficult questions about what is the RIGHT THING to do. So... if you were slowing down on the Wizard series, this book will give you momentum to keep going onto future books."},{"Title":"A Wizard in Peace (Chronicles of the Rogue Wizard, Book 4)","review":"A Wizard in Peace is the 4th book in the Rouge wizard series where magnus and his sidekick Dirk once again find themselves on a planet abandoned by their old government but unlike the other stories this planet hasn't been taken over by a dictator but by bureaucrats.

Now that my children are reaching the age I was when I was introduced to Lankhmar and the rest of Leiber's worlds, I thought they might find them as much fun as I had. I was dismayed when I discovered that most of Leiber's work seems to be out of print, but I was delighted to see that many of the stories are now on Kindle.If you're a fan of Leiber, then you are either going to buy this book, or own in already, no matter what I say. If you're just starting with Leiber and Newhon, then you probably want to read the books in order and reach this book later. It's possible to leap into the middle without missing much -- most of these stories were written as stories for magazines, so they're intended to be understood independently -- but there is some backstory, and there is some fun in watching Leiber develop the characters and figure out who they are.\\"Swords in The Mist\\" is a solid entry in the Fafrd and Grey Mouser tales. These tales, which range from short stories to longer, novel-length works, also range in topic, tone, and plot. Unlike many authors, who seem to make a career writing variations on the same stories, Leiber is unpredictable and difficult to characterize. As a result, some of the stories have more appeal than others, but which stories these are varies somewhat from reader to reader. In my opinion, \\"Lean Times in Lankhmar\\" and \\"The Adept's Gambit\\" are the best of this bunch, and are essential stories in the Newhon chronicles."},{"Title":"Swords In The Mist (The Third Book of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser)","review":"Swords in the Mist (1968) is Fritz Leiber's third collection of stories about Fafhrd, the big northern barbarian, and the Gray Mouser, his small wily companion who has a predilection for thievery and black magic. The tales of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser originally appeared in pulp magazines, short novels, and story collections between 1939-1988. Swords in the Mist contains:* \\"The Cloud of Hate\\" (1963) -- This is a short eerie metaphor in which hate becomes a mist that reaches out in tendrils throughout Lankhmar to find corruptible souls to use for evil deeds.* \\"Lean Times in Lankhmar\\" (1959) -- In this novelette, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser part ways and find themselves at odds when Fafhrd becomes an acolyte and the Mouser is hired to extract money from Fafhrd's cult. Humorous and cynical, this story makes fun of Lankhmar's polytheism and makes the seediness, decadence, and corruption of the city come alive. The ending is hilarious.* \\"Their Mistress, the Sea\\" (original publication) -- This story makes a nice bridge between \\"Lean Times in Lankhmar\\" and \\"When the Sea-King's Away\\" but it's entertaining in its own right.* \\"When the Sea-King's Away\\" (1960) -- This is a fun fantastical story with a great setting (under the sea!) in which Fafhrd has a sword fight with an octopus.* \\"The Wrong Branch\\" (original publication) -- This is a bridge between the previous story and the following novella:* \\"Adept's Gambit\\" (1947) -- Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser arrive in our world (Macedonia) in this novella. There are some funny parts here -- Fafhrd kissing pigs and analyzing Socrates, but mostly I found this story dull. The sorcerer Ningauble of the Seven Eyes has sent the boys on a near-impossible quest, but the exciting parts are quickly skipped over and too much of the story is spent with an unpleasant character's excruciatingly long autobiography.I love Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser because they're intelligent rogues. They look like a big dumb barbarian and a sneaky little street urchin, and they love nothing more than drinking, fighting, and wenching, yet they've got big vocabularies, make glorious similes and metaphors, and enjoy philosophizing. When they're doing these things, they're irresistible, especially in the audiobook versions narrated by Jonathan Davis (Audible Frontiers).However, half of Swords in the Mist consists of a novella that was not as fun as I've come to expect from Fritz Leiber's Lankhmar stories (perhaps this is partly because it doesn't take place in Lankhmar). I would suggest that, unless you consider yourself a completist, you find \\"Lean Times in Lankhmar\\" and \\"When the Sea-King's Away\\" and skip the rest of Swords in the Mist."},{"Title":"Swords In The Mist (The Third Book of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser)","review":"Don,t really want to review each book of this series.

My introduction to Fritz Leiber was hearing the author himself reading \\"Lean Times in Lankhmar\\" in Berkeley. His Shakespearean voice made this the single most memorable reading of my life. The story is a satire of formal religions, but a rather gentle one in most ways, it is very funny and the closest comparison I can make is Terry Pratchett's \\"Small Gods\\" with a similar, though rather more harsh appraisal of religion (Pratchett is an avowed fan of Leiber...Ankh-Morpork is an homage to Lankhmar). We learn when Fafrd becomes an acolyte of \\"Issek of the Jug\\" (\\"...not to be confused with 'Jugged Issek', who owed his fame to being confined to a not overly roomy eathenware jar...\\") what the difference is between the Gods OF Lankhmar and the Gods IN Lankhmar. This volume is Leiber at his best with his best characters, Fafrd and the Grey Mouser. The first collection \\"Swords Against Death\\", was mostly dark. In \\"Swords in the Mist\\", the third book, Leiber lets out the lighter side of his characters more than any of the other collections. Not that there aren't dark stories here, both \\"The Cloud of Hate\\" and \\"Adept's Gambit\\" are dark explorations of evil, familiar territory for Leiber. But with Fafrd and the Grey Mouser...and he is GREY for a reason...navigate between good and evil and always triumph in the end.

This is one of my favorite Leiber novellas and it works in so many ways, for example: the ever watchful eyes (or prognostications) of Ningauble that appear at important moments are priceless and original; the skillful way Leiber lets us in on what is said and sometimes left unsaid, sometimes crucially, between the two heroes.I have read elsewhere that this novella was originally written at a time when Leiber was corresponding with HP Lovecraft and that he intended to pay at least some homage to the Cthulhu stories. Which is why it is strangely set on Earth, in Tyre (and east of there, mostly) during the time of the Seleucid Empire. (Perhaps Leiber was toying with more of these \\"beyond Nehwon\\" stories.)I will say that, for me, it bogs down a little with Ahura's telling of her and her brother Anra's story, but I applaud the choice: Leiber so often fleshes out his female characters with an intuitive understanding so lacking in other sword and sorcery writers of his era and before him. Their mother is presented as a Persian figure of tragedy among Greeks; Leiber hits some high notes in the story within the story, based loosely (as he implies at least twice) on the story of Hermaphroditus and Salmacis.As ever, Fafhrd and The Mouser deliver comic and hair-raising thrills as they become entangled in a deeper web of evil design than they expect."},{"Title":"Swords In The Mist (The Third Book of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser)","review":"All due respect to the late Fritz Leiber, but over-all, this book was weak. The first story, \\"Cloud of Hate\\" was good. Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser unwittingly take-on Hate embodied in a noxious mist that turns already shady characters into rampaging serial killers. The next one, \\"Lean Times in Lankhmar\\", starts out interesting as the life-long friends go their separates ways, but goes flat. \\"Their Mistress, the Sea\\" builds-up well but the ending seemed to be missing something. The rest of the book brings Farhrd and Gray Mouser to our world's ancient history. Which should've made for a great read, but contradictions concerning their memory (they supposedly lost all knowledge of their previous life in the world of Newhorn, but make references to it), adventures told as second-hand accounts, and a prose that seems meant to be humorous and clever, only made the story confusing and monotonous. I got the impression these stories are a satire, maybe of something going-on either in literature or in society at the time they were written, but I didn't get it.I'm a big fan of Farfhrd and The Gray Mouser, or at least of their first two books. But if \\"Swords in the Mist\\" had been my first Lankhmar book, I don't think I'd have read any more of them. Fritz Leiber is rightfully considered one of the original masters of fantasy. His writing spans over 50 years. So it's only natural that he's produced at least a few clunkers."},{"Title":"Swords In The Mist (The Third Book of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser)","review":"This volume is a tad more interesting than the last because some of the stories now focus on the friendship between Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser.

This clever little book's one-line descriptive phrases (or \`tags') are designed to help create chest-heaving scenes of passion, but can easily be adapted for any type of fiction.Over 3,000 descriptions are divided into sections like physical characteristics, body movement, facial expression, emotions and voices, and then subdivided again. For example, the chapter on emotions breaks down into categories such as happiness, determination, surprise, fear and embarrassment.Most writers will find some of the tags too over-the-top for comfort. Imagine using \`all of her loneliness and confusion welded together in one upsurge of devouring yearning'! More useful are expressions like 'he had depthless, jet-black eyes' and 'she flicked an imaginary speck of dirt from her dress'.The beauty of the book, however, is the inspiration it provides when you're scratching your head over how to express a character's reaction.

Nothing more, nothing less. If you are writing and get stuck for a descriptive phrase for a color, a body movement, or if you just need something to help you vary up the way you're trying to describe an emotion, this really is a handy book to have. You don't have to copy the phrases word for word, I'm sure most people wouldn't, and in that respect, I wouldn't recommend doing so. But I do think most writers could definitely gleen something useful from the book.I will admit some of the phrases are outdated, and some are just plain bad. Romance writing has tightened up considerably over the years, and some of phrases listed overuse the word \\"as\\"--a grammatical no-no these days. But otherwise, they're good for a general idea if needed. Just don't expect these phrases to create a book for you.In my opinion, the book is well worth it for the price. Too, I would also like to note this book is on the list of recommended reading material for writers at The Passionate Pen website: http://www.passionatepen.com/"},{"Title":"Romance Writer's Phrase Book (Perigee)","review":"The writers of this book state it, this is a source for getting you -started- about thinking what phrases you may wish to use with writing a romantic scene. Not the book, not the chapter, but a scene. Its by far the best book out there for helping someone writing a sex scene. Any erotic romance writer's book only deals with one's attitude, to free oneself from guilt and just write it. Then they typically (4 out of 4 books so far) just say 'research it'. Here is one source you can use to help with the actual scene instead of a book that says just research it. It's approach to description of a character is good for simple minimizing lines. Good to sprinkle in what you write, but again, as the authors write, it is something to get you started. Give a hint, and then you will develope your own way to present your scene in a book."},{"Title":"Romance Writer's Phrase Book (Perigee)","review":"Even if I didn't find an exact phrase (and often I did) it got the grey matter working in the right direction.

Again, that's why I recommend taking a highlighter pen to certain words in this book. If you actually borrowed the phrases in their entirety, you would turn out a lame book with a hint of 70s and 80s dime-store novel cliches; no creativity whatsoever.

Use that vastly creative imagination of yours to take a phrase from this book and reword it so that it suits your current story. The book is really meant only for inspiration, anyway.I have owned this book for 10 years, and I have found it extremely useful in writing erotic fan fiction. My fan fiction is among the most popular of all three fandoms for which I write. I rarely use these phrases quoted verbatim. I almost always rephrase them.

I'm a writer but not specifically a 'romance' writer and i have to say that the phrases in this book are VERY useful. Any semi-practiced writer would be able to turn and twist many of the phrases in this book into something they could use for description, dialogue tags and practically anything else they put their mind to. It contains more than just phrases, such as tables of descriptions like it will list a color such as brown and then underneath there will be about 20 different way to bring that color into your book without using just 'brown'. I agree with one of the reviews that alot of the phrases are kind of corney but it's not a big deal unless you are someone who like to tell everyone you know you're writing a book but don't actually want to put in the long hours of effort to hone your craft. A good writer can use this book for reference while a bad one will only use it to 'cut,copy,paste, and won't get much benefit if they don't use their imagination. I'm sure that someone who gives this book a bad review is also someone who is looking for that magic 'something' to make their writing easier.

Well, it doesn't quite write itself, and this book doesn't exactly give you everything you need--but where's the fun in writing if you take it all from somewhere else? Sometimes I felt like I was cheating--sneaking a look at the answers before writing something myself. But this isn't cheating. It's inspiration, a nudge in the direction you want to go. It's a companion book, but not something you can't live without.It is exactly what it claims to be--a romance phrase book. It covers looks, feelings, facial expressions, voices, and, of course, sex. This last category I found the most lacking. The sex is the most important part of a romance novel--it's why most people read the books. I felt that the phrases used here were a bit... reserved. They skirted around the lovemaking and didn't get around to the nitty-gritty of it. We get phrases like \\"love flowed in her like warm honey\\" and \\"gusts of desire shook her,\\" but not much that actually gets down to describing the act of intercourse. I guess this is what I have to come up with on my own.Something I was hoping to find in a book like this is more words for anatomy. There is a section on physical appearance--both male and female--but they're the shortest sections in the book. Again, I found this book a little reserved. Where are the euphemisms for that certain part of the male anatomy? There are plenty of words to use, but it's difficult to know which to use when... and this book helps none at all with that. Again, this is one of the most important parts of a romance novel. You'd think that they could at least include something as simple as this--I don't want to have to use \\"manhood\\" for the rest of my romance writing career.Other than that, though, this book is rather good. It's a good way to spark the imagination. If you're having trouble in your writing, pick up this and get a little hint. Sometimes that's all it takes."},{"Title":"Romance Writer's Phrase Book (Perigee)","review":"Oh, but this book is awful! Its authors have taken all the very worst, most revolting, most overused phrases found in romance books (those same hackneyed phrases that make romance book editors swear they'll scream if they have to read them one more time) and organised them into one tome, all in neat little chapters. This book is like a tombstone on the grave of creative writing, and my advice to any aspiring romance writers is to follow your heart and your head in your writing, not the sickeningly bad examples shown in this book. Frankly, while this book's terminology is supposed to be rather sexy and sensual in content, it is actually only about as much of a turn on as getting a pap smear. In fact, I've read tractor magazines that were hotter and spicier than this.And yet, in spite of all that, this book is nonetheless still quite a fun read, so long as you don't take it too seriously. Honestly, most of the phrases listed in it are downright hilarious! Read them out with your friends while you're drinking margheritas. Test how long you can keep a straight face before you have to laugh at how ridiculous they are.My advice to you is that if you want a good laugh, then go ahead and purchase this book. However, if you're looking to buy it because you need advice on how to write a good, original romance book and be taken seriously as an author, then look elsewhere. Elizabeth Benedict's book, 'The Joy of Writing Sex' is an excellent alternative. Or try a simple, old fashioned thesaurus.

So when I read the reader comments below, I had to post a different take on this book.Yes, the book was written back in the 80sm so yes, the verbiage and trends in \\"how\\" you say things has changed. Any reference books can become out of date. However, the overall message and purpose of the book seems to have been overlooked. The Romance Writers' Phrase Book is a guide that's meant to inspire an author and get a writer to understand the importance and the role of the \\"descriptive tag/phrase\\" when it comes to the overall art of writing as a whole.Romance fiction in particular relies a great deal on emotion and internal conflict. Neglecting the little details, those descriptive phrases, can make or break a story. When I open this book, I'm not looking for a word-for-word phrasing I can simply cut and paste into my manuscript. Romance writing (heck, any writing) is never that simple or that formulaic. For me, the phrase book is a good starting point when I'm stumped on a gesture or where to start on how I want to describe an action or a particular emotion.The Romance Writers' Phrase Book has everything from describing facial features like eyes, noses, lips, and foreheads to common actions like sitting, standing, and shrugging. It covers positive gestures like smiling, to negative gestures, expanding the basic frown to include visual cues like the eyebrows and eyes. The book covers a wide range of \\"emotion\\" tags/phrases as well.The Phrase Book isn't meant to be a verbatim dictionary of tags and phrases to copy, it's meant to help teach a writer how to develop their own, to show them the difference between writing:He reached out and touched her arm.ANDA tingling of excitement raced through her as his fingers trailed sensuously down her arm.While some of the phrasing might seem out of date, the message and lesson of the book will never age, and the inspiration a writer can gain from its pages is priceless. That's why this book is never far from reach and is a staple on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Romance Writer's Phrase Book (Perigee)","review":"Okay, I know that there is a lot of bad romance writing out there full of embarrassingly melodramatic descriptions and cheesy metaphors.

I don't use it to copy the phrases. I use it to spark my own imagination, to help me come up with my own phrases.So often only cliches come to mind when I try to write a sex scene, or even a passionate kiss. This phrasebook offers such a wonderful variety of descriptions for that kind of thing. It reminds me that the English language is much more interesting than my day to day vocabulary.I might use a verb from one phrase, combine it with a noun on the next page, then maybe add a cool metaphor of my own that I wouldn't have thought of if I hadn't been inspired by something from the phrase book.I highly recommend this book to writers of fiction, whatever the genre.

Moreover, I think this assortment of narrative \\"tags\\" would be beneficial for any fiction story, especially one containing much dialogue. Some entries are simply gestures, such as, &quot;she closed her hand over his,&quot; but others are clearly meant to be used with dialogue, such as, &quot;he ripped out the words impatiently.&quot; This book is full of short, one-liners, called tags, that are frequently used in dialogue and narrative with the reader almost oblivious to them. However, they add so much to the &quot;showing, not telling&quot; of a story. No two people stand and talk without facial expressions, gestures and eye contact. This book gives you the wording you need to make your otherwise \\"cardboard\\" people come alive and seem real. To move from a book of cold, hard facts to one with moving, exciting scenes one would benefit from the Phrase Book. The over 3,000 descriptive tags are arranged under topics, such as emotions, facial expressions, and body movements, making it easier to find the perfect phrase to add life to your story. Unfortunately, the topics are not alphabetized and it could use an index (I made my own to use alongside it), but being it's a small, soft-cover book, it's not hard to flip through as you are creating your story. I agree that it is not the most recent (1984 edition) and a revision is greatly needed, but I found it very handy. There are enough phrases I can use, I can certainly afford to throw out the others that are out of date. I would say that by the condition of my rather dog-eared book, I consider it very helpful and my almost constant companion while working.

Here is a catalog of the most tritely expressed emotions and moods, hackneyed bodily gestures and physical descriptions; purple sentiments one after another, all laid out with mechanical precision.Is it boring enough to succeed in conceptually surmounting its value as text? Probably if you keep reading page after page. Right off the bat however it provides a laugh. Flip around and you'll be amused. But you'll probably want to stop there and start thinking about what it means to have this book in your hands, in a way that will make you question a whole lot more than prolonged transcriptions of radio weather reports or sports updates.I'd like to say that the book was also a profound exercise in uncreative writing; after all it might be garnered from numberless romance novels dutifully combed through by the editors (if I read the introduction maybe I'd know!). On the other hand, they may have come up with a few phrases of their own. After all, they probably decided to turn to conceptual poetry after failing to write the top-selling romances that they'd always dreamed of creating. However I don't think either case would detract much from the powerful effect of this work.I'll hazard a prediction too that this book really points to the future of conceptual poetry - not lying in the hands of an academically-minded coterie, but already around us and even more strange than we could have imagined."},{"Title":"Romance Writer's Phrase Book (Perigee)","review":"I'm an avid romance reader and am looking into trying my hand at writing romance.

Karlene Faith met famous Manson murderess Leslie Van Houten almost thirty years ago, and has proven an effective advocate for her eventual release. The relationship between the teacher and the reformed cult member is touching and very real, but it undermines this book as a chronicle of a criminal's transformation from delusional disciple to remorseful, decent soul.Rather than focus on Van Houten's thoughts and feelings during her three decades behind bars, Faith uses the book as an apologia and rationalization for the prisoner's choices and behavior when a very young woman. The author seems to have only a vague realization of the monstrousness of the crimes committed, and lays the blame squarely on the mastermind, exonerating her subject and casting her as a victim in the same mold as those who lost their lives. Van Houten herself seems to have a clearer view of her own culpability, and it would have been interesting to hear more about this from her own mouth.The book does cast a disturbing light on the inequity and gross politicization of the justice system. Van Houten's crimes, and her admitted participation in them, should allow for the imposition of a true life term, and so far the system seems intent on doing so. It's shocking to read, then, that all of the other prisoners on death row with Van Houten when the death penalty was suspended were released from prison within a few years. It seems that when no one is watching, the justice system plays by some very inept and unfair rules. Certainly Van Houten poses no further threat to society, while the prison system routinely ejects predators with murderous histories and no sign of reformation.Though thick with pages full of psychobabble and research into cult psychology, there are enough anecdotes in the book to humanize the subject and make it an interesting read. Van Houten does come across as an obvious candidate for legitimate parole. But Karelene Faith's blind approach to this polarizing subject may be the last thing Van Houten needs."},{"Title":"The Long Prison Journey of Leslie van Houten: Life Beyond the Cult (Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime, and Law)","review":"I was pretty disappointed in this book. Karlene Faith relies on an overabundance of clich&eacute;s and a meager sprinkling of insight into the character of Leslie Van Houten and Van Houten's involvement in the Manson murders. Although published in 2001, the book reads as if it might have been written thirty years ago, at the beginning of the feminist movement. Leslie and her fellow murderesses are given every consideration: they were victims of \\"cultivated femininity\\", they \\"never lost their innocence\\", they were so brainwashed they relinquished all control and thought; however, Faith contradicts herself when excusing Leslie's involvement in the Manson Family as, \\"...Although part of his inner circle, Leslie was never part of Manson's inner, INNER circle. She would lapse into thinking for herself...\\". So in one fell swoop, the author denies Leslie's culpability and recognizes it.In spite of that, one gets the feeling that Leslie herself has taken on more responsibility for her involvement than the author gives credit for. What Leslie seems to recognize, which the author does not, is that the Manson murders branded themselves on the American psyche, and society demands a price be paid. The author becomes downright offensive when she coyly alludes to other murders and murderers since then who have not received the notoriety of the Manson girls, suggesting perhaps that we are being a tad unfair in having the audacity to remember the shock and horror of the Tate-LaBianca deaths.The author spends much time on Charles Manson and his responsibility as leader of the \\"cult.\\" What she forgets is that members were free to come and go, and various people DID walk away from Manson and his personality. Faith also takes pains to mark how the Manson girls are exceptional in their good behavior in prison, apparently without noting the irony that they were exceptional members of Manson's inner circle, and before that Van Houten was an exceptional student and twice prom queen. It makes me wonder if these women's ability to get along in the unnatural atmosphere of prison is linked to their ability to have gotten along in the bizarre world of Manson's philosophy...and just how well they would be able to integrate themselves outside of the rigidly controlled environment of prison should any of them meet another guru.In the end, this book gives more insight into the author's embrace of victim ideology, and quite a bit less into the mindset and maturity of a major participant in the crime of the century. I cannot imagine this book helped Leslie Van Houten's case for parole."},{"Title":"The Long Prison Journey of Leslie van Houten: Life Beyond the Cult (Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime, and Law)","review":"Two themes not touched on in the book: justice and individual responsibility.\\"The parole board has shown a clear unwillingness to move beyond the crimes (Van Houten stabbed Mrs. La Bianca 14 times--feeling like a 'shark with it prey')\\" of Ms. Van Houten is the typical, absurd refrain throughout the book. The author, Ms. Faith, wonders if Van Houten \\"had actually been involved in the murders at all.\\" She asserts that Van Houten is a \\"friend\\" (at one point Ms. Faith brings banana splits to the \\"charming\\" convicted murderers.) She goes on to state that the Manson girls were \\"generous gift givers: 'I was the recipient of the complete collection of Charles Manson's song lyrics.'\\" According to this book, what happened to Leslie Van Houten \\"could have happened to any trusting young woman.\\" I could go on, but you get the idea.A further absurdity in the book is the author's typical refrain that the real causes of crime are \\"poverty, racism and low wages\\" while (unwittingly?) stressing the nurturing, supportive, middle class background of all the killers involved."},{"Title":"The Long Prison Journey of Leslie van Houten: Life Beyond the Cult (Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime, and Law)","review":"I found Ms. Faith's book quite interesting. I have worked in law enforcement and corrections at both the state and federal levels.I do find some fault with Ms. Faith's application of feminist ideology to the case; the main theme of the book seems to be that Leslie and her co-defendants committed their crimes because they had been socialized by the culture to behave in a \\"feminine\\" manner, thereby making the girls prime candidates for Manson's diabolical brainwashing techniques. Although the girls were certainly indoctrinated, it seems evident to me that they joined the cult for the same reasons that many join young men and women continue to join cults and gangs-to find a surrogate family and acceptance.The book raises the very important issues of justice and rehabilitation as they pertain to those who commit heinous crimes. Certainly, Leslie and most of the other Manson followers seem to have changed their lives in prison (I am including Atkins, Krenwinkel, Watson and Davis), but their crimes are so severe that justice seems to demand that they spend the rest of their lives in prison. If any of the defendants deserve release, it is Leslie (she was 19 at the time of the crimes and had a relatively minor role as compared to the others). Given the publicity and political climate, I do not believe that Leslie will be released during her natural life. Manson and his followers were such a bizarre and frightening cast of characters that any parole board or Governor (who must ultimately agree to parole in CA) would face severe repercussions and ridicule if they released anyone connected with these crimes back into society.Ms. Faith has an important story to tell and I recommend her book to anyone interested in how our society deals attempts to balance the issues of rehabitation and justice for high profile offenders in the information age."},{"Title":"The Long Prison Journey of Leslie van Houten: Life Beyond the Cult (Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime, and Law)","review":"For those interested in an unbiased, straight forward look at The Manson Women, with ACCURATE facts, this is not the book. Karlene Faith is a personal friend of the female Tate-LaBianca murderers &amp; therefore, is NOT a fair observer. She does not have the capacity to stand back &amp; view them, Miss Van Houten in particular, in an unbaised light. Besides, getting some of the facts wrong, she paints the murderers as the victims, minimizing their horrific crimes. She minimizes the pain these women inflicted on the victims &amp; their families. By putting the majority of the blame on Manson himself, who technically did not participate in the hand's on killing, she has presented the women as mere observers. She fervently believes that their time of incarceration has far-surpassed the maliciousness of their crimes. She believes they have been punished more than they deserve, as if slaughtering seven people (one eight and one half months pregnant) was no more severe than stealing a loaf of bread. &quot;The Manson Women&quot; by Dr. Clara Livsey is a far more accurate account of these women's true natures."},{"Title":"The Long Prison Journey of Leslie van Houten: Life Beyond the Cult (Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime, and Law)","review":"Well researched and informative, and definitely worth reading. A brief reading of all the reviews quickly reveals that those who think that L.V.H. should never be released simply hate the book, and those that are willing to consider K. Faith's perspective typically liked it.I don't think that K. Faith's perspective is completely objective, but it does raise some very interesting points: Should we be open to the notion that people can change and that prisons should serve not just to punish criminals (at a tremendous cost to society) but also to rehabilitate? Perhaps one of the most interesting questions is \\"should taxpayers continue to keep someone behind bars when they clearly are no longer a threat to society? Regardless of my opinions, Faith did a good job of getting me to think about these basic questions."},{"Title":"The Long Prison Journey of Leslie van Houten: Life Beyond the Cult (Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime, and Law)","review":"I read this book, as well as the other reviews by other customers, and I am appalled that anyone with any amount of reasonable intelligence believes that Leslie Van Houten deserves to be paroled! The Tate-LaBianca murders are perhaps the most horrible murders ever committed in the recorded annals of crime. Seven innocent people were savagely slaughtered over one weekend in August, 1969 for no reason at all by a bunch of depraved, drug-addicted misfits of society on the orders of their demented leader, Charles Manson. Let's look at the facts and see whether Leslie Van Houten truly deserves parole or not:1. Leslie admits that she WANTED to go along on the second night of murder and that she believed in what Charles Manson said needed to be done to bring about his warped version of a race war to be ignited as \\"Helter Skelter\\". She knew full well and has said in interviews \\"I knew there would be killing\\".2. She unlawfully entered the home of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca along with Charles \\"Tex\\" Watson and Patricia Krenwinkle on orders from Charles Manson to \\"don't let them know you're going to kill them\\".3. Leslie admits that she held a screaming Rosemary LaBianca down so Patricia Krenwinkel and Tex Watson could stab her to death. She then was given the knife and told by Tex to \\"do something\\". By her own admission, she stabbed Rosemary LaBianca 16 times in the lower back and buttocks. The coroner concluded that 13 of these stab wounds were post-mortem and that one of the wounds to the lower back was in and itself fatal. So Leslie's argument that she stabbed a woman who was already dead is a crock. She also admitted that she wiped the house down for fingerprints, took a shower with the other murderers and helped herself to food from the LaBianca's refridgerator.4. She bragged to other family members that she took part in the slaughter of the LaBianca's and \\"the more you stab the more fun it is\\".5. During the trial she testified that she did indeed stab Rosemary LaBianca and that she had no remorse for what she had done.She was found guilty of 2 counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to death for what she so willingly did. When her death sentence was overturned a year later she received a gift that the LaBiancas never will.I agree with most of the other reviewers of this book - the bottom line is that this women deserves to spend the rest of her life behind bars for mercilessly slaughtering two innocent people!"},{"Title":"The Long Prison Journey of Leslie van Houten: Life Beyond the Cult (Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime, and Law)","review":"A few things about this book 1) Its tiresome. The author goes on and on and on (and on) about how wonderful of a person Leslie Van Houten has become. In fact, Ms. Van Houten does sound like a fine person, but the author's reverence towards her is hard to stomach and it makes the book hard to take seriously. 2) The political yammerings are also offputting. The author makes it sound as if all of society is corrupt, chaotic, and illogical..."},{"Title":"The Long Prison Journey of Leslie van Houten: Life Beyond the Cult (Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime, and Law)","review":"Looks like the naive Ms. Faith got taken in by the Manson game herself. This book is so preposterous, I don't know where to begin. (I could start with that dewey, Frances Farmer-esque &amp;amp;quot;Will There Really Be a Morning&amp;amp;quot; cover photo of the killer; oh, brother.) In 1969, Van Houten et al were young and had their troubles; however, they had options. They chose their path, disregarding plenty of warning signs along the way. They were intelligent enough to know that what they were doing is wrong, and they deserve to be held accountable for the rest of their lives. Life imprisonment without parole is not at all a cruel and unusual punishment in this case. It's a small price to pay considering the unbelievably callous brutality of what they did, and the innocent lives they ruined. All their good behavior, degrees and AA memberships achieved within the penal system, while admirable, will never change those aspects of this crime.In some ways, Van Houten perhaps should be judged with more severity because there appears to be no reason whatsoever for her to have turned to a life of crime other than personal choice. For example, while Charles Manson's unfortunate childhood circumstances should never excuse his crimes, they at least offer some insight and understanding of how he came to be involved in such atrocities. Van Houten grew up knowing nothing but privilege and a life of ease. One can only imagine the monster that may have resulted had she grown up facing even a fraction of the abuse and lack of care that Manson dealt with on a regular basis.These defendants all deserve to remain in prison, not only for the severity of their crimes, but also because of the fact that they so easily turned from everything they had known to butcher and slaughter innocent people -- all because someone told them to do it. How could we ever trust them again? Why should we?If Ms. Van Houten is truly remorseful, takes responsibility for her atrocities and wishes to make some sort of amends, the best she can do for our society is exactly what she apparently has been doing for years, according to her record -- being a model prisoner and helping fellow inmates. This gives her the opportunity to serve society in a positive way while being kept in a controlled environment, to completely eliminate the most remote possibility of anything like this ever happening again. This, to me, is an excellent use of tax dollars and the optimal way for her to pay back. I doubt that she would be as beneficial to society on the outside; as a matter of fact, I fear that she could become dangerous again.Denying her parole also is the best message the system can present to our society -- and the very least that can be done to help the victims' families achieve and maintain some semblance of closure. With so few good reasons to release this unpredictable long-term inmate, and so many practical, beneficial reasons to keep her in, parole denial seems like a foregone conclusion.Van Houten is up for parole again 08/25/04. I urge everyone who wants to see her remain incarcerated to write to the parole board:Margarita PerezCalifornia Board of Prison Terms1515 K Street, Suite 600Sacramento, CA 95814"},{"Title":"The Long Prison Journey of Leslie van Houten: Life Beyond the Cult (Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime, and Law)","review":"This is criminologist Karlene Faith's argument for granting parole to \\"Manson Girl\\" Leslie Van Houten. If that possibility is repugnant to you under all circumstances, then there's no point in reading either the book or this review. One thing's for certain, though. This work does not, on its merits, warrant the kind of invective being spewed at it on this web page.Faith, a friend of Van Houten's for many years, unapologetically advocates for her release. She uses this vehicle to make her case. There's nothing sinister or particularly unusual about doing so, by the way. So, the relevant questions become, first,whether her position has merit; and second, whether it's well written.On the first point, an objective observer could reasonably be persuaded. Van Houten has spent over 30 years in prison andappears to be, by all accounts, contrite about her crime,emotionally sound (to the extent possible), and whollyrehabilitated. There seems to be no rational argument for her being a continuing threat to society.And she is eligible, under the law, for parole. So the issue is, in a society that purports to consider rehabilitation, and not just retribution, as one of the legitimate objectives of its criminal justice system, why wouldn't Van Houten be given therare opportunity to try and re-assimilate into free society?It's certainly a thought provoking idea that stays with the reader for a while. Even among those of us familiar with the horrendous details of the crimes who might not have, before, seriously considered the propriety of freeing one of the people convicted of participating in them.On the second question, the book moves quickly and keeps the reader's interest. It is obviously well researched. It would be easy to criticize the author for trying to do too much, skipping around a bit and giving short shrift to a number of relevant or (perhaps) irrelevant subjects. Her fervent efforts to emphasize the \\"cult\\" influence of Manson on Van Houten and consequently place blame primarily with him will put off some readers as minimizing the horror of the crimes or Van Houten's role in them. Also, her attempts to analyze legal issues and the motives of participants in purely social science terms strike me, as a lawyer, as indicative of a failure to really understand the adversary system or even as naive.Parenthetically, it is impressive that Van Houten is able to inspire this level of friendship, over this period of time, in Faith.This book offers a unique slant on a subject that still fascinates a nation. On balance, it is a good read, and wholly worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Long Prison Journey of Leslie van Houten: Life Beyond the Cult (Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime, and Law)","review":"I do not fear Leslie Van Houten. I believe she has more than likely become a better human being over the decades, and has done much good work to try and atone for her participation in the horrific murders of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. REGARDLESS: she is lucky to be ALIVE.Leno and Rosemary LaBianca are gone from this earth, FOREVER. It makes no difference wether or not Leslie stabbed Rosemary AFTER she was dead, or BEFORE. She STABBED her, over and over...and over again! Even if she had NOT weilded a knife, she helped detain the woman, and her husband, so that others COULD kill them! She knew FULL WELL of the murders at Cielo Drive the evening prior. Her knowledge of the violent, heart breaking killing of the pregnant Sharon Tate alone, should have sent her running for her own life! And what about the four other good people who were so gruesomely slaughtered?! She wasn't at Cielo, but she KNEW!She knew FULL WELL what she would be expected to do, when she unlawfully entered the LaBianca home that night! A pillowcase was placed over Rosemary's head, and secured with a lamp cord! When the poor woman relized that her husband was being murdered in the next room, she desperately fought for their lives, and was thwarted...in part by Van Houten! And WHY?! These people had never done any of them the slightest harm!Have you SEEN the morgue pictures of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca? Have you seen their bodies peppered with the painful stab wounds that this woman took part in delivering? Take a good look courtesy of Crime Shots, and then tell me that anyone who participated in that blood bath deserves to be set free! You can actually SEE some of the places where Van Houten's knife struck! As noted, some of the wounds Rosemary suffered to her back and buttocks were administered BEFORE she died. But even if she was dead a SPLIT SECOND before Leslie first raised her blade, Van Houten is still equally responsible for every last moment of TERROR and AGONY that innocent couple experienced!The argument that Van Houten is somehow LESS guilty than Charles Watson and Patricia Krenwinkel, is based on garbage reasoning. People will also try to tell you that Charles Manson is INNOCENT because all he did was tie the LaBianca's up (and then left the scene). \\"Hey man, I said to rob them, not kill them\\". RIGHT...!I'm VERY sorry that Van Houten made the exceedingly poor choices that she made in 1969, whatever the circumstances. She has the ability to acheive personal goals in her prison life, that Leno and Rosemary will forever be denied. AGAIN...it doesn't matter at all that she never raised her knife to Leno. The man's death is just as much her doing, as that of the people who actually stabbed him. She KNEW what she was taking part in! She could have refused...she did not. She could have gone for help...she did not. She could have stayed at the DAMN ranch...she did not.Her death sentence was mercifully overturned. She has experienced a reprieve that she did NOT grant the LaBianca's. Her sentence was commuted to LIFE in prison. It matters not how many others have been released and paroled over the years...let JUSTICE be done, HERE.It may seem odd to say, but I do feel compassion for Leslie and Patricia, because I think they truly do realise the horror of what they did, and feel genuine remorse (I would not say the same for Watson and Susan Atkins). I cannot damn the Manson killers to hell, as some people so freely do. I can't even wish pain on them for the brutal, savage crimes they committed 35 years ago. I CAN, however, demand that they be held behind bars untill their natural deaths, as punishment for taking lives that they can never give back. The VICTIMS of these crimes will never see parole, so WHY should the KILLERS ever walk free? Because they are really nice people now?! Well, perhaps they are, but SO WHAT?! Let them continue to atone, in the confines of prison walls.Leslie Van Houten is exactly where she deserves to be...and is LUCKY to be there, at all!"},{"Title":"The Long Prison Journey of Leslie van Houten: Life Beyond the Cult (Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime, and Law)","review":"Having recently read the book &quot;The Long Prison Journey of Leslie Van Houten&quot;, I must say it is unbelieveable how biased Karlene Faith is in her attempt to help Van Houten gain her release from prison. She portrays Van Houten as being a helpless &quot;victim&quot; of Charles Manson and leads the reader to believe that &quot;poor little Leslie&quot; had absolutely no control over her role in the senseless slaughter of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. What a crock! Faith seems to forget that after brutally murdering the LaBiancas, Leslie and the other heartless killers went into the LaBianca's kitchen and helped themselves to a snack!! Murdering two innocent people whom she didn't even know certainly didn't make poor little Leslie lose her appetite! The woman didn't have a heart or soul then, and she still doesn't.She should be paroled from prison when the murder victims are paroled from their graves.

Now Ms. Van Houten is in her 50s. She has spent almost twice as much time in prison than out of prison. While she has been in prison, she has been the ideal prisoner. She has received both a BA and Masters degree. She has helped younger inmates try to get their lives together. If there ever was a person that has attempted to redeem themselves behind bars, it is her. However, all of this seems meaningless to most. Because Van Houten will always be grouped with Manson and the horrific murders of 1969. What people fail to realize, is that under California law, prisoners that do what Van Houten has done in prison, are due parole. It is state law. However, she continues to be ignored along with the law. This book might be bias, but I also have some other knowledge about this case and I feel it is a shame. Leslie Van Houten made a mistake a long time ago and she has gone about making up for that. Forgiveness and contrition are due here.

How do we know Mrs. Labianca was already dead when Leslie stabbed her SEVERAL times in the back? Had a DOCTOR pronounced her dead before Leslie so willingly stabbed her? The autopsy of Mrs. Labianca showed some of the stab wounds to her back were NOT post-mortum.Have some people forgotten that Leslie was sentenced to DEATH for her participation in this senseless crime? Her sentence was commuted to life when the California Supreme Court briefly abolished the death penalty in the early 70's. So yes, this makes her eligable for parole, but it certainly doesn't mean she should get it! Some say if this had not been such a \\"high-profile\\" crime, she would have already been paroled. But let's not forget that the whole purpose of these crimes was that these heartless murderers wanted to do something to \\"shock the world\\". Clearly, they succeeded in doing that. Now they must pay the price. The great majority of people, including me, think this means: Life without ever being granted parole."},{"Title":"The Long Prison Journey of Leslie van Houten: Life Beyond the Cult (Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime, and Law)","review":"Fascinating and informative account of the misjustice against Leslie Van Houten ...

They can't change their spots.I'm so sick of Leslie Van Houten et al, and I'm sick of the media giving these people (and I use that word very loosely) unwarranted attention and celebrity when they butchered people they didn't even know who had done nothing to them. Leslie van Houten went along with the others that night knowing full well what was going to happen and what the deal was. She even said in a 1994 TV interview \\"I knew there would be killing involved. I knew that people would die.\\"She made terrible choices in her life and has to live with the consequences.

Leslie was at the LaBianca house, not the Tate house. She did not kill Mrs. LaBianca, Krenwinkle did. But, Charles Manson had told Tex to make sure everyone got their hands dirty, so Tex told Leslie to go do something. Leslie stabbed Mrs. LaBianca AFTER she was dead.Sure, Leslie was unrepentent at first. But for years now, she has seen the error of her ways, turned her back on Manson and his followers, and been completely rehabilitated. Sure they were horrible crimes, but ask yourself this: If Leslie were not associated with someone named Charles Manson, do you think she would have been paroled by now?I hope Leslie makes parole one of these days, but she is the only one of the Manson \\"killers\\" I want to get out. I won't fear her on the streets."},{"Title":"The Long Prison Journey of Leslie van Houten: Life Beyond the Cult (Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime, and Law)","review":"It appears most of the \\"reviews\\" of this book are not reviews at all but merely diatribes against Ms. Van Houten (some of which are grossly factually incorrect). This is unfortunate.Ms. Faith has tried to produced a book which addresses the cultural and social issues which created the backdrop to these terrible events and which have been almost entirely unexplored previously. To this extent she has succeeded. The crimes for which Ms. Van Houten is incarcerated have become cultural myths - the very definition of crazy, unexplainable pathology. Because of this our society has stopped even trying to understand what factors may have precipitated them. And yet an understanding of the social dynamics and pressures which contributed to this tragedy may form the basis of a better understanding of how people in our society can get so dissociated that these types of tragedies continue to haunt us (i.e. Jonestown, Waco Texas, Columbine).Unfortunately the very bitterness of some of the reviews of this work show just how strong the predominant perception of this crime is in our culture.The truth is that it is possible to acknowledge the social and cultural dynamics that contributed to these crimes without lessening one's appreciation of their true terrible impact. Ms. Faith confronts a facet of this crime that has rarely if ever been acknowledged let alone explored. She should be applauded for this if for nothing else, and not shouted down for trying to address this issue in a manner other than the culturally accepted notion that this crime is unexplainably evil.Having said all that, some may feel this book is somewhat \\"dry\\" in tone. This may simply be a reflection of Ms. Faith's clinical background, or it could be she felt a more analytical approach was more appropriate in light of the nature of the subject and respect for those who lost their lives. People who are not interested in women's studies or the cultural factors that led to these crimes, or who simply want a more sensational or explicit description of the crimes may not find this book satisfying."},{"Title":"The Long Prison Journey of Leslie van Houten: Life Beyond the Cult (Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime, and Law)","review":"How much does a human life cost? 30 Years? 32 years? What does your life cost? Your mother's life? Your daughter's life? Leslie Van Houten is serving an extended prison term for taking the life of a human being. She has paid thrity-two years so far, and it is yet to be determined how much that life will eventually cost her. She was sentenced to death, and beat the gas chamber along with the other convicted murderers from the Manson Family. Many have married, have children, &quot;got religion&quot; and become preachers. Shut off from society, they haven't done too badly for themselves. This book has been rated as close to zero as possible not for it's style or writing or subject matter as much as the nature of it's content (can any of this be separated?). This book is another attempt to short-change society. It says Leslie Van Houten, convicted killer, has paid 32 years for the life she more than willing assisted in taking (in fact, was thrilled with the killing), and as far as her &quot;Boswell&quot; and this killer are concenred, Van Houten has paid enough. The life taken was only worth 32 years. Ponderous tomes can be penned (as this one is), whining into infinitude about the unfairness to killers and criminals and that the cages to be opened. These Mansonites blame Manson (as brought out in another book, Manson: the Unholy Trail of Charlie &amp; the Family, by John Gilmore, a far more realistic approach to these crimes). Through Karlene Faith, Van Houten is saying Hitler is to be blamed for Nazi crimes, not the bigwig SS men and women who did the butchering. They were beguiled--mislead; under the evilinfluence of Hitler himself. I'm afraid Hilter had more than willing underlings, as did Charlie Manson. Manson's H&quot;SS&quot; woman Van Houten, a convicted killer, managed to escape the death penalty herself. Her victim did not. There is a spectrum of society that desires to turn the other cheek. There is a greater specturm that says the life this woman willfully took cannot be measured in years.This book is a wimpy, intellectuzing of a very basic fact: MURDER is irreversible. Death is death. You don't come back for the applause when the curtain falls. Now, like so many other caged killers, Leslie Van Houten, through her mentor Karlene Faith, has made the headlines again. A different face this time, new makeup, hairdo, even religious blabberings, but the same person that wielded the knife blade that stole a life far superior to her own."},{"Title":"The Long Prison Journey of Leslie van Houten: Life Beyond the Cult (Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime, and Law)","review":"There is no shame in Leslie Van Houten's game.It's bad enough she saw freedom during her retrial in 1978 (due to her lawyer being murdered near the very end of her original trial in 1970 and 71) but it's really pathetic how she absolutely refuses to take any responsibility for her part in the La Bianca murders of August 10, 1969, reducing her contribution to stabbing Rosemary *after* her death (which prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi completely debunked during the original trial).Bottom line: Mrs. La Bianca is still dead and Leslie Van Houten is, unfortunately, still alive - getting college degrees on the backs of hard-working taxpayers (who may want to go back to school but can't afford it) and playing the part of the victim when she's anything but.Bottom line: Rosemary La Bianca was a hard-working woman. Her background was a mystery, being adopted as a baby. She endured a tough first marriage, had to support two kids after her divorce, and met Leno La Bianca while working as a carhop at a Los Feliz restaurant. She married him in the late-1950's and, in due time, saved enough to start her own business - a high-end womens' clothing boutique on North Figueroa Street in L.A. When Rosemary's estate was probated in 1969, she had more money than coffee heiress Abigail Folger.The reason why I mention all that is because it's high time to remember the victims of those two horrible nights of atrocity in August 1969 (three, including the murder of music teacher Gary Hinman on July 31, 1969, which Van Houten didn't partake in) as the people that they were instead of being treated as an afterthought (and sometimes not even that!).Screw Leslie Van Houten.

And clearly, the author is extremely biased towards Van Houten. I know this IS a BOOK REVIEW, but I feel compelled to express my opinion about the subject matter. Leslie Van Houten made conscious and sane decisions back in 1969. One of those decisions was to join the Manson family. Another was to participate in the murders of the LaBiancas. Whether she stabbed Mrs LaBianca after she was already dead or not is moot. As for her reform in prison, SO WHAT. She should feel lucky she avoided the Death Penalty. I hope that she never, ever gets out.

It's not worth the paper that it's written on.I bought this book to get a glimpse of Van Houten. I didn't \\"see\\" the things I was supposed to \\"see\\".Van Houten wants out, so Van Houten will do whatever she can to get out. She claims she didn't stab Rosemary LaBianca until she was dead. She claims she stabbed her 16 times. LaBianca was only stabbed 13 times AFTER death. But all that is a moot point. She was INVOLVED in a brutal killing. She was INVOLVED in the Tate murder as an accessory both before and after the fact. She was INVOVLED in a murder that took place during a burglary. She was convicted and sentenced to death. This woman should be thrilled that she is still alive. She does not deserve to be paroled. She does not deserve to be free. She did not give that consideration to her victim(s) so she then should not be given that consideration.Van Houten says she's a model prisoner and deserves to be free. She was also a model high school student and homecoming princess. So right after being a model high school student she became a murderer. How do we know that after being a model prisoner she will not go right back to being a murderer?She has proven herself to be a cold blooded murderer. At her parole hearings she won't look at the family, she won't apologize to the family. She might be saying the right things, but she doesn't mean them.Also, she claims that since she wasn't as devoted a Manson family member as the others she could be rehabilitated. Well, damn, not as brainwashed and yet she STILL committed the crime? Interesting prospective. Less culpable for the crime? No. More deserving of parole? NO.

It is we whom she invites to an epiphany. In chronicling the profound transformation of Leslie Van Houten from convicted criminal to not merely a model prisoner, but to an exceptionally kind and decent person, who cultivates her intellect, tutors and counsels the disadvantaged, and, most importantly, weeps for her victims, Ms. Faith challenges us to deeper thought on the occurrence and meaning of evilness in the human experience when it can happen in the life of a woman whose natural self is far removed from who she was during the dark night of her soul.Any honest observer of Ms. Van Houten knows she has become in her maturity the exceptional person we, rightly or wrongly, tend to expect of a woman who in early youth, as the all-American girl, was kind, intelligent, and attractive. We as a society can endlessly debate questions on proper criminal punishment. We can deny the reality of personal remorse, and the sacred meaning of repentance. We can continue to create our belief systems in such a manner as to associate tendencies towards evilness as the exclusive province of people we prefer to think of as being radically different from ourselves, as if God created a dichotomy in the human race. But we cannot escape dealing with the relevant question: if an essentially good woman can drift away in a riptide early in life, what does it suggest about us? Do we capitulate to evil in ways that are simply more subtle, more collectively and systematically rationalized, and more effectively spread out over a lifetime rather than focused in one era?As poignant as Ms. Faith can be describing the life of her friend, she is ultimately disappointing in answering her own implied questions on the origins of evil. She doesn't hesitate to invoke the usual liberal assumptions on systemic evil like pollution and corporate greed. And like many moderate leftists, Ms. Faith can be a bit ambivalent about religion. She respects Ms. Van Houten's quiet faith, her spiritual remorse, and is happy for the solace Ms. Van Houten has found, but she can also demonstrate a reductionist attitude towards the religious conversions of other former Manson Family members, grudgingly conceding that they have at least risen to the level of a more benign blind obedience. Trillions of words have been written by brilliant minds defending religion against ideologies of carnage, yet orthodox progressivism will not hesitate to trivialize it as little more than &quot;blind obedience.&quot; One suspects Ms. Faith, like most of us, may be undergoing her own spiritual struggles.Ironically, Ms. Faith can be eloquent when she appeals for a traditionally religious understanding that sees the tragic potential for the whole spectrum of evil in every individual. But needing to find an explanation for its origins that will not betray her leftist bias, it is with a rhetorical straight face that she interprets Manson's adolescent, crypto-Marxist/fascist/Maoist denial that life has intrinsic value, his belief that it is purely instrumental to an organic, utilitarian purpose, that the individual must sacrifice oneself to a greater good as some sort of positive, idealistic &quot;affirmation to the connectedness of all life,&quot; which was only betrayed &quot;when Manson created his war plan.&quot; She actually doesn't seem to understand that an ideology that denies the sacredness of the human individual is a war plan and that reverence for life does not mean reducing it to a commodity of collectivist convenience. Evilness exists in the world because human individuals, atheist intellectuals included, sin, not because we haven't sacrificed enough to collectivist thought.There are limits to how private the implications of religious faith can be. The fact that there have been and are demagogic religionists does not mean that turning to demagogic, mass-murdering secularists comprises a solution. Ms. Faith is too kind to fully assent to the progressivist spirit, but progressivists often are what they are because they simultaneously desire the esteem presumed to be inherent in recognizing imaginary human genius, an elite with whom they identify, and yet ignore the fact of human limitation because they have rejected or lost (or never acquired) the moral, philosophical, and religious ways of knowing that make limitation bearable and humility meaningful. They cannot accept the imperfectability of the human condition or the relative smallness of our own place in history. They cannot accept the anonymity of altruism.Non-liberals, i.e. conservatives reject all ideology as vanity because they know we cannot reinvent ourselves. We cannot create utopia, and the boneheaps, gulags, and the episodes of exterminating inconvenient life in the twentieth century, even when promoted by more capable minds than Charles Manson, prove it. God placed limitations on our intelligence, none on our stupidity and vileness.The Parole Board's resistance to Ms. Van Houten's decades old fitness for release is not based on a lack of progressivist consciousness. Rather it is based on the social need to create the illusion that our civilization holds life to be sacred, a proper instinct, made all the more acute because our civilization doesn't practice it. If we can ignore Ms. Van Houten's human pain and preserve her as a symbol of our concern for life by unjustly extending her sentence, we can more easily avoid facing the myriad ways we deny our cooperation with social horrors through our passivity or our expansion of social horrors by our willingness to uncritically assent to revolutionaries.If Ms. Faith would allow herself to consider that it was a punk but philosophically accurate variation of progressivist foolhardiness that nearly destroyed Ms. Van Houten's life in the first place and stick to emphasizing how Ms. Van Houten's virtue, enormous dignity, and simultaneous humility has given song to the angels, she would be a better advocate for her very worthy friend."},{"Title":"The Long Prison Journey of Leslie van Houten: Life Beyond the Cult (Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime, and Law)","review":"From beginning to end, it is a worthless book.

I dedicated quite a lot of time to evaluating my options, and ended up deciding that this Atlas was likely to be a good choice, basing my decision on the sample pages that Amazon offers. Fortunately, when I received my purchase, I discovered that I had made the right decision :)I guess I was lucky. I thought that this Atlas was probably good, so I took the chance and bought it... However, I could have been wrong. The problem is that this Atlas had no customer reviews, and I generally make my decisions regarding what to buy in Amazon based on the experiences of others who have already purchased the item I want. The reason for that is that an editorial review can be inaccurate, and the back cover can (sometimes) provide inexact information, but other customers generally tell the truth...Now, I'd like to correct the lack of reviews on this Atlas by writing one. I really don't need to say too much, basically that all that the back cover says is true. You can read that back cover in the sample pages, and you can also read the table of contents and an excerpt. Anyway, if you don't want to spend time doing that, I can repeat to you some of the facts you could read there :)First of all, I want to highlight the fact that there are 90 detailed and colorful maps. Those maps include physical and political maps, maps about climate and precipitation, and about population. In addition to that, the maps are separated in different sections, and at the end of each section there is a chapter that centers on a particular problem. For example, at the end of the section dedicated to North America, the focus is on natural hazards, and in the section dedicated to South America the focus is on the Amazon Rain Forest. There are other chapters that focus on special themes in the sections regarding Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and Oceania, and Antarctica.As if that were not enough, you can find many charts and graphs alongside the maps. What is more, the organization of the information that accompanies them is clear and didactical. You will also be able to find country flags and facts, and some web sites where you will be able to find updated information, even after buying this Atlas. There is also a Glossary that defines some terms the average reader might not be familiar with, and a thematic Index.On the whole, my opinion is that this Atlas is great. It probably isn't the finest Geographic Atlasyou can buy, but I think that it is likely to be the best you can buy at this highly reasonable price. I strongly recommend it, if you need an Atlas that is useful, not too big (so as to carry it with you) and specially not expensive. I think that you will enjoy reading it, and that you will learn a lot :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"National Geographic Student Atlas Of The World","review":"The only review of this item liked it very much.

Like another reviewer, I found that several of the characters reminded me in no small way of some of my own memorable relatives.The story centers around three women, living together on their own, whose lives are filled with familiar joys and sorrows, eccentric and strong-willed relatives and neighbors, hard work and rewards. Their personalities are distinctly different, and at times conflicting -- but they are bound together by their faith (expressed and experienced in different ways), values and deep love of family.Daughter Maggie, the main character and narrator, is ten years old as the book opens. One morning in Sunday school, she is gifted with a vision of God, accompanied by a simple message: &quot;Feed my sheep'. The fact that, in Maggie's vision, God appears as a woman, is met with an understated, natural acceptance by her, and by understandable skepticism and consternation by her family and others in the small North Carolina town of Canaan, where they live. After being rebuked and ridiculed for this aspect of her revelation, Maggie decides to keep the Heavenly gender to herself. From time to time, she experiences repetitions of the initial vision -- and feels herself being utilized as a conduit for healing energy, which of course brings more attention her way. These incidents cannot be called up by her at will -- to the dismay and scorn of those who would use her 'power' for their own purposes and profit. Her view of her 'gift', and all of its accompanying burdens, are refreshingly honest, straightforward and simple -- she knows that the power doesn't lie within her or belong to her, and she sees herself as someone fairly ordinary. She deals with all of this as she struggles against all of the barriers thrown up against a young woman in the South during this time who is trying to be independent, educate herself, and make her place in the world.Maggie grandmother is -- as one magazine article so aptly puts it -- 'a sturdy country woman of great faith'. She is necessarily tough, the unquestionable matriarch of her extended family -- with some members of which she occasionally butts heads -- but she is filled with the power that unconditional love instills in a person. She is fond of quoting scripture, and she has a knack for getting right to the heart of any matter -- the tools of faith, strength and love serve her well.Lily, Maggie's mother, is quite the free spirit. Much of her family views her as an aberration, and with some degree of disdain and disrespect -- but in her own way, she is just as strong-willed, just as pure-hearted as her mother. Jernigan skillfully develops her character as the story progresses to allow the reader to come to realize this.The author's character-building skills are one of the most rewarding things about this novel -- coupled with her talent for translating what surely must be first-hand observations of growing up in the 60s South into readable, relevant and entertaining prose make this book a joyful, moving experience.In addition, the book is valuable in gently allowing us to consider the ways in which God is revealed -- or not -- to each one of us. Those who cling so tightly to irrelevancies such as gender and skin color -- things of the flesh, not of the spirit -- are in danger of missing the deeper universality of the spiritual experience. A couple of observations from 'outside' Christianity come to mind. Ramakrishna, a great saint who lived in India during the late 19th century, spoke often about the unifying beliefs of the world's great religions. He likened the varying presentations of the word of God as different meals, prepared by a loving mother to suit the tastes of her children. I also recently saw a quote from Mahatma Ghandi that said (approximately) 'There are some people in the world who are so hungry that God can only appear to them as a loaf of bread'. Our needs are as varied as we are as human beings -- why is it that our vision and understanding of God's nature should not be varied as well?This book is a coming-of-age tale, a love story, a social document, and simply a well-written, rewarding read -- whether you grew up in the South, or anywhere. This is a story and a group of characters that you will not soon forget."},{"Title":"Every Good and Perfect Gift: A Novel","review":"Reading this book brought back memories of growing up with my own Southern family and all its characters.

She blurts this out to anyone who will listen, which quickly earns her the label of liar and kook. So she decides to keep her visions to herself after that. She can't summon the appearances of God, nor does she have any control over her healing powers, but her reputation spreads quickly throughout the small town of Canaan, North Carolina. Maggie bears her notoriety with grace and tolerance, but is always aware of how different she is from other people.Maggie is being raised by her mother and grandmother, both strong, unique women. Granny is running the tobacco farm, and Maggie helps out when she's not in school. Her alcoholic father took off years ago, but shows up to borrow some money from Maggie when he learns of her famous gift. In fact, most of the men in this book are weak or flawed in some way. Granny is a delightful character, down-to-earth, warm hearted and practical, constantly spouting down home wisdoms.Alex Barrons, a Princeton seminary student, shows up one summer when Maggie is in college, intent on interviewing Maggie as part of his summer research project on modern day mystics and visionaries. Maggie agrees to talk to him, and they become friends as the summer progresses. But when it's time for Alex to return to college, he admits that he has fallen in love with her. Maggie feels that she won't fit into his world, and feels violated when he reveals that he told someone else about her secret belief that God is a woman. Maggie refuses to read any of his letters while he is away, but her heart is broken and she can't forget about him and the bond they shared.The book was a delightful study of small town folks, good people doing good deeds, misguided people doing harm to each other, religious fervor, the power of God's love, and the power of faith and forgiveness. Sit down with this book for an afternoon, and you'll feel a renewal of your own faith and love."},{"Title":"Every Good and Perfect Gift: A Novel","review":"I really liked reading this book.

When this does not happen, Maggie rejects her faith, in herself and in God. As well, Maggie rejects Alex and he leaves her, swearing to return when she will finally believe in their love. I kept turning the pages to see if Maggie and Alex can recapture their love...and the ending fits the story.This story is a soulful journey, with strong female characters, especially Maggie who is our portal to God's love. A rich tale, worthy of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Every Good and Perfect Gift: A Novel","review":"I really loved this book; reminded me of fiction by Kaye Gibbons and Lee Smith.

It is quite easy to read and very engaging considering the subject matter, which is probably the most important issue the world faces. The writing is clear and appears to be well researched with lots of quotes and footnotes. The references are from both print media and the Internet, so at least some of the sources are easily available if you want to read them. The quotes by politicians and energy experts accompanying the main text were particularly interesting.The book starts by examining the world's dependence on fossil fuels and other nonrenewable energy. The picture painted is complementary to but broader than that found in &quot;Hubbert's Peak&quot; by Ken Deffeyes (another excellent book I read recently).&quot;Turning the Corner: Energy Solutions for the 21st Century&quot; discusses oil, coal, natural gas, and nuclear power and shows that these resources are quite limited and will need to be replaced for economic stability. Then the topic moves to renewable energy and covers solar, wind, hydropower, tidal power and more. The book stresses that these clean energy systems are critical to changing away from nonrenewable power. Probably the most controversial part of the book is the third part, which talks about the broad field of research into exotic forms of energy such as cold fusion, electrogravitics and NASA's research into new forms of propulsion. The final section is focused on transition from nonrenewable energy and the problems associated with this transition. The final chapter lists things that need be done to help ensure that our children and grandchildren have the energy available to live their lives in full.All in all, I think this an important book that everyone should read who cares about where our energy comes from and how it makes America vulnerable to Persian Gulf oil suppliers, what it does to our geopolitics, and ultimately, where do we go from here."},{"Title":"Turning the Corner: Energy Solutions for the 21st Century","review":"For the first time a book has been published on the subject of energy that honestly shows the public what really is available for the future. Section III is my favorite. It has a balanced review of cold fusion, zero point energy, electrogravitics and space propulsion, as well as new energy. This book also contains lots of annotated references at the end of each chapter for further information. It is a great book on a difficult subject with a fresh viewpoint unavailble elsewhere."},{"Title":"Turning the Corner: Energy Solutions for the 21st Century","review":"At last a book that responsibly tackles the issue of finding alternative energy sources. I require my students at San Jose State to use this well researched text to develop arguments for their debates on energy. Turning the Corner offers a balanced, no nonsense view of what we can do to alter the world's dependency on fossil fuels. My colleagues agree, this text does more to explain our current dilemma and ways to solve it than other books that only offer a one-sided view of the subject."},{"Title":"Turning the Corner: Energy Solutions for the 21st Century","review":"Sigh. On page 190 the sidebar quote says: \\"Science is about knowing. It's not about believing\\". If only life were that simple. As the authors demonstrate quite well enviroscience is also about manipulation, halftruths, and outright lies. It is sad to see other reviewers fooled by these manipulations. The issues are too many to recite, but here is a sampling of the style in which the authors present \\"facts\\":On page 27 they state: \\"In Germany, acid rain is destroying the forests\\" without a reference (not even to the otherwise heavily quoted bastion of scientific information the Sacramento Bee). Acid rain as the cause of large-scale forest destruction was shown to be erroneous fairly shortly after it was announced with doomsday headlines in the 1980s. But it is a good example of how at least $500 million was spent by the US alone to solve a problem before it was really demonstrated to be a problem.Footnote 11 on page 41 relating to the book \\"Climate of fear\\" tells us \\"the book offers a one-sided optimistic outlook on the prospects of global warming\\" and that it \\"should be read cautiously\\". Sounds like daddy is telling me that I am not allowed to agree with any of it if I read it. It is also symptomatic of a real problem that the word \\"optimistic\\" is used as a negative! Wow, I must immediately learn to become more pessimistic.Later they launch into lengthy chapters on supposed future energy sources. Among the information and gibberish we find things like this sidebar quote on page 218:\\"As a self-organization system with energy and matter exchanging externally, excess energy can be generated due to torsion coherent with zero-point energy in the vortex state on the tips of electrodes\\". I have a Ph.D. in Physics and I have absolutely no clue what this means. I doubt that any reader will have any clue what it means. As a matter of fact I doubt that the authors themselves have any clue what this means, because it is not the sort of thing anybody writes to clarify a topic. It is meant to intimidate readers into believing that lots of fancy words strung together will show how stupid they are and hence how smart the authors must be.Environmental issues are important. There is enough misinformation out there. If you want a read by people clearly on the \\"left\\" side of the debate, here it is. Just don't believe for a second that the information is somehow balanced."},{"Title":"Bearing the Big H: A Hormonal Journey on the Hysterectomy Highway","review":"THE AUTHOR GIVES SOUND ADVICE ON WHAT IT'S LIKE TO EXPERIENCE &quot;THE BIG H.&quot; BUT SHE HAS SUCH A TALENT IN THE THE WAY SHE DESCRIBES EVERYDAY SITUATIONS THAT YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF LAUGHING OUT LOUD AT WHAT SHE SHARES.

Reading this book is like having an understanding and very funny girlfriend in the room with you who's been there.I read this book in about three days and found myself laughing out loud-- sometimes because I could relate to the author, and other times because the way she described even the most horrendous and embarrassing situations, was just downright funny!Although I have not had this traumatic surgery (thank God), I could relate to Pfeiffer through her anecdotes about marriage, weight, and womanly woes. She's a very witty writer-even the titles of the chapters crack me up... \\"I am Woman, Hear Me Groan,\\" \\"Hystery in the Making,\\" and \\"The Long Gurney Home,\\" are some of the better ones.Yes, Pfeiffer's gifted with humor, but she also writes straight from the soul. In her chapter, \\"No Laughing Matter,\\" she recounts the acute pain that follows post-surgery laughter and grieves the length of time it takes for this side-effect to improve. She laments: \\"Life without laughter is merely an existence.\\"Pfeiffer bares all in this personal account, which is immensely helpful to a woman planning a hysterectomy. All those questions you might have and were afraid to ask and some you didn't even know to ask(!) will be revealed.She tells you how she dealt with the recovery, as well as the mistakes she made along the way, so that you, a fellow traveler on the hysterectomy highway can learn from her experiences.And in the end, the author did learn...\\"Recovery gave me the chance to catch my breath, to see my life in another light...This was not an end, but a new beginning for me and mine.

For Goodis it is all about obsession and failed redemption. And Cassidy's Girl stands alongside THE STREET of NO RETURN and THE BLONDE on the STREET CORNER as one of his masterpieces. David Cassidy is caught between two women. One woman, an alcoholic lost soul emanating good represents a second shot at former greatness. The other woman, voluptuous and iron willed drives his dark lusts, offers him bodily bliss and inevitable doom. Of course, the usual array of bums, losers, rummy philosophers and tender-hearted whores populate this work, giving the book that dreary, broken bottle, rainy sky, desolate and realistic feel of forlorn hope. Goodis is to NOIR what Poe was to horror, that is to say that Goodis transcends genre, concerning himself less with plot and stereotypes of stupid cops, sadistic killers and tough guy PIs but more about revealing the alchemy of the dark desires that drive the human spirit away from happiness and towards self-destruction."},{"Title":"Cassidy's Girl","review":"Jim Cassidy is a bus driver by day and a drunk by night. He becomes convinced that if he leaves his voluptuous tramp of a wife, Mildred, and takes up with the waif-like, angelic Doris, he will at long last be able to escape his hellish existence. But he soon discovers that redemption is not that simple.Cassidy's Girl is about the dark, depressing lives of a group of alcoholics inhabiting a rundown neighborhood bordering the Philadelphia waterfront. It is a no holds barred study of people whose lives are simultaneously fueled and poisoned by alcohol. Goodis describes how this community, of sorts, functions. Acts of friendship alternate with acts of violence. Love and affection coexist side by side with hate and betrayal.Goodis' portrayal of the frustratingly hopeless environment in which the characters find themselves is vivid and expertly drawn. The plot, however, is not as compelling as it might have been. Instead of flowing smoothly, the narrative has a herky-jerky quality with events occurring seemingly at random. That is to say the motivation behind the actions of key characters is many times unclear.Cassidy's plan to rescue Doris and himself is, as you would expect, eventually ruined. But the cause of this ruination is not just fate or inevitability. Cassidy himself makes conscious choices which directly lead to his own defeat.Cassidy's Girl is classic noir. Unapologetically downbeat, it fearlessly explores the ugly, hopeless side of life. Proceed at your own risk."},{"Title":"Cassidy's Girl","review":"This one is easily worth the price of admission. Another pulp classic by David Goodis, one of the few writers who can transcend the mundane and make tales of ordinary fallen heroes seem so intense, so poignant, that you are immediately taken in by their story and made a part of their lives. Acclaimed noir photographer and director Ed Holub (holubfilm@gmail.com) is planning to make a film of this novel, and it's easy to see why--startling opening, astonishing characterizations, and the familiar Goodis touch of angst, eerily appealing violence, and poetic narrative to bring you in and never let go. Buy this book."},{"Title":"Cassidy's Girl","review":"David Goodis' novel, \\"Cassidy's Girl\\" offers a portrayal of lost people in forgotten streets of Philadelphia in the years following WW II. The characters in the story are tormented and fallen. They struggle with alcohol and with their own demons. Goodis portrays them rawly yet with sympathy. The book is as much about atmosphere as about character. The story is set in the bars, tenements, narrow streets of the old Delaware River harbor and waterfront. I am familiar with parts of the Philadelphia that Goodis describes from the time I lived in the city years ago. But many of the places and scenes described in the book had already been lost.The primary character of the book Jim Cassidy, 36, drives a bus between Philadelphia and Easton for a cut-rate company with headquarters on Arch Street. Here is how Goodis introduces Cassidy and the theme of the book at the outset of the novel.\\"The bus made a turn of Market Street, went up through the slashing rain to Arch, went into the depot. Cassidy climbed out, opened the door,stood there to help them down from the bus. He had the habit of studying their faces as they emerged, wondering what their thoughts were, and what their lives were made of. The old women and the girls, the frowning stout men with loose flesh hanging from their jaws, and the young men who gazed dully ahead as though seeing nothing. Cassidy looked at their faces and had an idea he could see the root of their trouble. It was the fact that they were ordinary people and they didn't know what real trouble was. He could tell them. He could damn well tell them.\\"Cassidy spends his evening fighting with his voluptuous but shrewish wife Mildred and drinking at a cheap establishment called Lundy's Place. Earlier in his life, Cassidy had flown planes in WW II and then commercially. When he was blamed falsely for a plane accident, Cassidy's life deteriorated. He squandered his money and ultimately found himself in the Philadelphia tenderloin. When he secures the job as a bus driver, Cassidy gains a small sense of purpose and control that he does not feel otherwise.After a particularly harsh fight with his Mildred, Cassidy learns that she is interested in another patron of Lundy's Place, Haney Kendick. In his turn, Cassidy becomes involved with a young woman, Doris, 27, who is slender and withdrawn and an irredemable alcoholic. As the story develops, Goodis explores which of these women, Mildred or Doris, consitutes \\"Cassidy's Girl\\".The book includes many scenes of violence, heavy drinking, sex, and tragedy. It is also highly introspective as each of the down and out characters has his or her own story. Cassidy is forced to flee when he is accused of causing an accident in driving the bus eerily similar to the accident years earlier with the plane. For all the rage and hopelessness of the characters and the setting, the book comes to a resolution that is slightly less hopeless than is the case in some of Goodis' later novels.Beginning in 1951, Goodis (1917 -- 1967) published a number of paperback noir novels most of which are set in his native Philadelphia. The novels offer a noir portrayal of the city and of the loneliness of urban life. \\"Cassidy's Girl\\" sold over a million copies when it was published in 1951 but was soon forgotten. With the Library of America's recent publications of \\"Down There\\" (Shoot the Piano Player)Crime Novels: American Noir of the 1950s: The Killer Inside Me / The Talented Mr. Ripley / Pick-up / Down There / The Real Cool Killers (Library of America) (Vol 2)followed by its publication of a volume of five Goodis novels,David Goodis: Five Noir Novels of the 1940s and 50s (Library of America), Goodis dark world has achieved a place in American literature. Readers who come to Goodis through the Library of America volumes will enjoy exploring his other novels, including \\"Cassidy's Girl\\".Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Cassidy's Girl","review":"Goodis novels for $0.99 each on Kindle are a bargain and a much better value than the recent Library of America volume. I read a study years ago that correlated various authors' alcoholism with the drinking habit of their characters. Goodis must have had well-used elbows by the time he wrote this one. It's a good, quick read set in a world where no one is sober for long. The characters are vivid and you know there isn't going to be much in the way of happy endings for them."},{"Title":"Cassidy's Girl","review":"Good prose. Amusing story. This fellow Goodis clearly knew what the battle with demon rum is all about. Likely he or a loved one endured the struggle and faced the bleakness."},{"Title":"Cassidy's Girl","review":"This book is a tough call for me. On the one hand, the plot depends on a 1 in 1 million event that occurs twice (with slight variation). That's a bit much for me to swallow, especially in a genre where a big part of the illusion is the gritty \\"realism\\" of the story. On the other hand, I happen to like this kind of writing:\\"He could see the bottle rising to her lips, and then her lips meeting the lips of the bottle, as though the bottle were something alive, making love to her. . . he saw the bottle as a loathsome, grotesque creature that had lured Doris and captured her and pleasured itself with her, draining the sweet life from her body as it poured its rottenness into her.\\"If this kind of writing is not quite your style, then this is a book to skip. If this leaves you wanting more, then the improbability of the plot should not stop you from diving in."},{"Title":"Leon's story","review":"Leon's Story is an awesome book.

Black people have to enter through the back and order something to eat. When black people go back there, there is a white person who waits on them. Leon said that if they want to wait on you they will come. There is no bell or anything like that. Leon will just wait to get waited on and he will order something.

Indeed, there is hardly a page of information that does not have a mistake or misinterpretation. As one of the Shakers said of the work, &quot;The errors are outstanding, glaring, and more numerous than any fact.&quot;Actually, this type of reference work has long been needed to supercede and supplement two excellent reference works: INTRODUCING THE SHAKERS by Diana Van Kolken and SHAKER HERITAGE GUIDEBOOK by Stuart Murray. Unfortunately, however good the intentions might have been which inspired the writing of HISTORICAL DICTIONARY OF THE SHAKERS, the outcome was dismal at best.For example, any serious student of Shakerism must ask why so many question marks are used in place of the birth and death dates for the majority of the Shakers listed, especially famous ones like Emma Neal. This information has been available since 1915 from the Western Reserve Historical Society. Most good university libraries have copies of the microfilm of this Shaker collecion and an index of names is included. In addition, Magda Gabor-Hotchkiss, former assistant librarian at Hancock Shaker Village, when revising THE SHAKER IMAGE in 1993, took great care to provide extensive biographical sketches of all the most prominent Shakers from 1860-1920, including dates. This revision of THE SHAKER IMAGE can be found in Shaker libraies. As for the birth dates of present day Shakers, thousands of brochures were produced in conjunction with the exhibition, &quot;The Quiet in the Land,&quot; in 1996 and these have been distributed throughout the Shaker library and museum world as well as at opening of this exhibit in major cities.Such omissions cause the thoughtful reader to wonder just how familiar the author is with Shaker research. It would appear that a superficial knowledge of Shakerism gained from secondary sources has been sed to ake inferences. The &quot;facts&quot; thus presented are quite the contrary. For instance, the term &quot;Lead Ministry&quot; is used constantly, but this was never used by the Shakers. Lead for the Shakers was a noun not an adjective. The Shakers spoke of their &quot;Lead&quot; or Ministry, but never put the words together. This often appears in works about the Shakers, but not by the Shakers. Seemingly this has caused the author to make up a new phrase &quot;Lead Elder&quot; and this is his unique contribution to Shaker vocabulary. A similar fault can be found with the population figures he cites. In the past 20 years various scholars in COMMUNAL STUDIES and other highly esteemed publication, have carefully shown that the Shakers never exceed 4000 in membership. This revision seems to be ignored and population figures given in older, secondary sources are used. The same can be said for the author's inclusion of some of the Millennial Laws of 1845. When Edward D. Andrews did this at the conclusion of THE PEOPLE CALLED SHAKERS (1953) it became so trendy to use these laws, that it was 20 years before scholars realized that these 1845 laws had little force and were largely ignored outside of the Taconic-Berkshire Shaker communities, and that the laws were almost totally revised in 1860, taking out the extreme measures. Well, it appears that once again we have the 1845 laws at the end of a book. It is hoped that contemporary users will realize what a very limited scope these laws had and how they certainly did not in any way govern most Shakers, then or now.Perhaps the most serious fault of the book, however, is his treatment of present day Shakers. The author states that the &quot;Lead Ministry&quot; closed membership in 1965 (though at least once he says it was 1957). It would be interesting to read the source of this information because such a thing did not ever happen, though the author constantly mentions it as a fact. As Shaker Brother Arnold Hadd pointed out in the 1996 edition of the SHAKER QUARTERLY, the covenant cannot be closed because, first of all there is not just one covenant, but one for each individual family in Shakerism. The Ministry does not have the authority to close a covenant for a Shaker family without that family's consent. In spite of this, the so-called closure of the covenant in 1965, has been one of the most widely reported rumors in the Shaker world. Rumors, however, should not be reported as facts. The author then goes on to say that the newer members at Sabbathday Lake have therefore not signed the covenant. This is not true. All members at Sabbathday Lake who have been there more than 5 years have signed and this is well-known.Many more pages could be filled, pointing out scores of misinterpretations, the reliance on questionable secondary sources, misspellings, etc. but it is sufficient to say that the reader must exercise extreme caution using this work. This is terribly ironic because the author, himself, states on page 138 that the usefulness of SHAKERISM: ITS MEANING AND MESSAGE (1905), a history written by two Shakers, &quot;suffers from its lack of proper documentation.&quot; No truer words can be applied to the HISTORICAL DICTIONARY OF THE SHAKERS. Perhaps in the future, a usable, reliable, and factual guide will be produced that will provide researchers with information in a dictionary format on the Shakers. It is disappointing that this has yet to be done.Stephen Paterwic, East Longmeadow, MA"},{"Title":"Batman Green Arrow: The Poison Tomorrow","review":"Michael Netzer's art is very good, particularly in his depictions of Green Arrow and Poison Ivy. The story, by Dennis O'Neil, is solid and stands comfortably outside any of the usual Batman, Green Arrow and Justice League monthly titles. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Batman Green Arrow: The Poison Tomorrow","review":"I looked up this book to judge Oneil's take on the Dark Knight &amp; to read a rare team-up involving two of my favourite heroes, Batman &amp; the Green Arrow. Both crusaders share the fact that they have no super powers but rely on wits &amp; detective work to solve their mysteries...The story respects that. The plot is coherent &amp; the atmosphere is deadly serious &amp; the characters are well drawn. You feel that Green Arrow has more to say to his dark friend but your desire for the stars to interact is left unfullfilled.That was a good read, all in all, and could serve a primer for those two fine characters to meet up again &amp; defy evil. Whether you get the full comraderie thing out of it is not certain...but the ending is dark &amp; well deserved.Here's for seeing them together again..."},{"Title":"Batman Green Arrow: The Poison Tomorrow","review":"This is not a truly bad book, but one which is difficult to praise highly. It might have worked as the monthly issue of an ongoing series, but readers of a prestige format book hope to get more than this. Although it is is billed as a Batman/Green Arrow team-up, the latter's role is not that important: he's mainly here to evoke the 'socially-conscious' comics he appeared in during the 70s (this is at least what generally transpires from this work), comics which were also written by Denny O'Neil. The other half of that team, Neal Adams, opted not to rejoin his ex-partner on this book after having read the script, and one can understand why. In many ways, 'The Poison Tomorrow' feels more like the straight retelling of an existing story than a new tale in itself - its events progress predictably, with few surprises along the way and not many levels of interpretation; it also doesn't bring much to either the heroes or villain (Poison Ivy has limitations as a character, but she's been used more interestingly elsewhere). The conclusion is as solid as it could have been, the art is nice and sober, and the book does achieve most of its goals; but these might have been too modest..."},{"Title":"Batman Green Arrow: The Poison Tomorrow","review":"What a boring read!The artwork is awful!

If you're into AFV's, you can't live without this wonderful resource. Containing over 900 different AFV's from 1915 to current vehicles, they are smartly seperated by country of origin. I was surprised to see the numerous weapons systems that are currently in development. Very contemporary and in touch with the world of AFVs. I would highly recommend this book to fans of Military History, Fighting Vehicles, and scale modelling."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Tanks and Armored Fighting Vehicles","review":"I'm a big fan of anything Chris Foss writes, publishes or edits. His facts aren't always spot on - his deadlines for publication obviously have him rush and cut corners. I purchased this book in December 2003 and have spent many hours flipping the pages. Overall - I enjoy owning and reading this book.If you are a hobbiest, enthusiast or historian of armored vehicles - this book is a lot of fun - filled with enough data of historical development and progression of armored vehicles - from every country imaginable - that you can lose many hours turning the pages.I do not keep this book at work. As a defense contractor, historical data more than 40 years old is useless to combat simulation modeling (unless we're looking sub-Sahara Africa or Central Asia). There are many other unclassified pocket guides, and books that are more handy to use to identify and collect performance data - and to do my real world computer modeling.Overall - I enjoy this book for it's historical data - it's a pleasure to read - and \\"re-discover\\" obsolete vehicles I used to operate - or commanded units of. Looking back across the years - one wonders what would have happened if I would have met my Soviet counterparts with their T-54/55 and T-62, T-64 or T-72's - with my M-48A3/5s, M-60A1 and M60A3 models.Buy the book to enjoy and learn the history of every country's armored vehicle development programs. The historical prospective given by this encyclopedia gives one data to strike up conversations with military veterans and counterparts of all nations and compare data. Gives a good foundation to understand the combat results each of these vehicles gave the countries that utilized them in war!A great (big) book better suited for the coffee table at home than the bookshelf at work."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Tanks and Armored Fighting Vehicles","review":"As was indicated in a previous review, if you need up-to-the-minute data on modern Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFVs), this is not the book for you. However, that is just about its only weakness.This superb volume is ideal for everyone from the casual 'military historian' to avid model builders and those who just want solid information on AFVs of all types from all nations.Written in a no-nonsense style meant for the layperson, the text is informative and authoritative without being boring or overwhelming. Major design improvements are carefully pointed out, as well as models that fell flat on their tracks (or wheels).The book is presented in encyclopedia format, with the largest division being country of origin. The AFV designs are then sub-divided into Armored Cars, Tanks, Armored Personnel Carriers and Self-propelled Guns. Each entry includes important data such as armament, weight, speed, crew, year of introduction and major variations. The vast majority of entries include at least one photograph.As of the writing of this review, I have owned my copy of The Encyclopedia of Tanks and Armored Fighting Vehicles for slightly less than two years. I need a new one, because this one is worn out.Whatever the reason behind your interest in AFVs, this book will entrall you. I cannot recommend it highly enough. A must-have for students of World War I and II tanks."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Tanks and Armored Fighting Vehicles","review":"After having purchased hundreds of reference books on AFV's over the years, this is the book I keep going back to the most. From WWI up through modern, the sheer amount of information included is staggering, especially considering it features many designs you will not find in even more focused collections.As an all-around resource on the subject, it simply can't be beat, if you can locate a copy, grab it while you can, as they are getting harder to find."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Tanks and Armored Fighting Vehicles","review":"Outstanding book.

It is clear that the editing could have been more rigorous. I have found both technical errors (some of them painfully obvious) and typos in the text.

This is the first book I've read (and I've read quite a few) to show him for what he is: a young man trying to not only figure out who he is but also trying to accept WHAT he is as well, and where he will fit in to the world. It also offers a more realistic picture of what his relationship with his mother was like. I never really bought that whole she was the center of his universe story, and now I see why....it was never that realistic. It had to be more complicated then that. Any teenager will tell you that their relationship with their parents is one that's constantly blowing hot and cold....especially at the age he was when Diana died. I was always worried about how this boy was going to break out of his mother's shadow...especially because he looks so much like her.

I was unprepared for methods which I consider primitive (i.e. giving children suppositories to loosen their stool (which my pediatrician says is invasive and unhealthy); or having young children change their own soiled sheets AND waking them every few minutes for extended periods throughout the night).Gee whiz, I wouldn't want this done to me. It sounds a bit more like brain-washing than toilet training. Just because something works, does not make it civil.

In these types of books, nature hates you, and your death will be described in all its realistically graphic and gory detail. Cool.Like all of Lewis's books that I've read so far, \\"Spiders\\" starts off with a bloody death. In this case it's the retired Dan Mason, who is fixing up his new cottage in Kent, and is dreaming of his future garden and his life after a long productive career. It is not to be however, while gardening he uncovers a new type of spider, as his house is right over their nest. His nasty death starts a chain of events that will almost destroy Great Brittan.The spiders are mobile eating and killing machines, and they are killing all that stands before them as they swarm across the landscape towards London. And as they swarm, we are introduced to spider expert Alan Mason, the novel's protagonist who is the son of Dan.As usual, one of Lewis trademarks is having a two tiered storyline. The first is having the novel's protagonist on the search to identify the novel's problem, and trying to find an answer to fight it. In this pursuit this time around, Mason is joined by his wife Louise, fellow scientist Peter Whitley, and police inspector Neil Bradshaw. The other part of his trademark is that Lewis interspaces his storyline with a never ending series of character vignettes involving the novel's victims. And while there aren't as many vignettes here, Lewis does well with the few that he does do. A particularly good example is the young Grant family, which is caught in the line of fire by the spiders.Richard Lewis was the pseudonym of British thriller writer Alan Radnor, of which I know nothing, but he is not related to the current Richard Lewis that has recently wrote a number of recent young adult novels. I don't know what Radnor originally did for a living, but he has the eye of a good newspaperman when it comes to creating people, especially in his vignettes, as his people really come alive. These novels were written for a buck, but they were excellent thrillers anyway, and we are lucky to have them.Lewis continues with his, at times annoying, \\"foreboding of imminent doom\\" type of writing ( \\". . . he was doing this or that, but soon it wouldn't matter, he would be dead.\\") that seems to appear in all of his books, at least the ones that I have read so far.Having lived through several world wars and suffering through some very bad times, foreign authors have a tendency to not candy coat the effects of a bad situation. So, when people, of all ages die in Lewis' horror novels, it's never an easy death.On the other hand, the British cover sux, the American cover for the Signet version doesn't. This was a very good example of the pre-computer age horror, and it did well enough to spawn a sequel calledWeb, Thewhich would also have Alan Mason in it, but as a minor character.

However, certain selections for his ever famous Song of Myself show that he can sure describe those bodily actions that he seems to love so much.

Yet, his self-absorption overshadows his talent. Whitman's poem, \\"Song of Myself\\" takes up a significant portion of the book, Leaves of Grass. Here, Whitman keeps no points in reserve, but spends 52 sections \\"celebrating\\" himself. He feels he, as man, is the great panacea. He suckles at its mercy until it fills not only his subject matter, but influences his technique and his structure as well.

Regarded as America's poet, Whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the \\"Manifest Destiny\\" ideology of the pre-war, through the Reconstruction period of US History.The poems are diverse and upbeat. The language, for the most part, is clear and easy. Nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines. Very few poetic devises are used.One may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry. But, in comparison to rhyhming verse by Longfellow, Frost, Byron, Browning, or Shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.Although a classic, \\"Leaves of Grass\\" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology. None of his poems are memorable. Not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.I give two stars to the work, simply because I must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation.

But Walt Whitman was and still is one of the most influential poets I have ever read. He began life on a farm on Long Island, but times got bad and his family uprooted itself and moved to Brooklyn. Brooklyn at that time was a growing city unto itself and trades were needed. Thus Whitman learned the trade of printer. But his soul led him to a higher calling. He became a jounrnalist and wrote poetry. His early efforts did not amount to anything major. Yet sometimes the unimaginable happens in a man's life. A sudden thrust of inspiration strikes one like a bolt of lightning. Then something new and unique is born out of this inception - a new form of poetry - what is today referred to as free verse. Yes, Whitman is the father of the form, and perhaps one of its greatest practitioners. The beat poets who were to follow in his footsteps never really rose to his great height of mystic revelation. I think that's what the other reviewers are talking about when they refer to Whitman's religiosity. For Whitman was the poet of a new world, a new nation, a growing entity that would go on to fulfill an old dream of mankind. That is, the dream of a thoroughly new man, a man who was free from the past, a man who could find his soul was one with the fathomless cosmos. Hence, &quot;Walt Whitman, a cosmos&quot; is a very telling way Whitman has of describing himself to his reader.My favorite poem by Walt Whitman is his &quot;Song of Myself.&quot; It contains the seed of everything he had lived as a human being and every vision he would realize as a mystic of epic proportions. After that, I believe his next great poem was &quot;I Sing The Body Electric.&quot; &quot;Drum Taps&quot; was also quite an interesting addition to &quot;Leaves of Grass.&quot; Also, &quot;When Lilacs Last In The Dooryard Bloomed&quot; is Whitman at his poetic best.So it is without any reservation that I am highly recommending &quot;Leaves Of Grass&quot; to all and sundry as a must read. Especially now, in the wake of 9/11 we need to reaffirm what it means to be American, and I know of no better American Visionary to help in this cause then Walt Whitman."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"I love poetry and Walt Whitman is one of my all time favorites. This volume is chock full of his poems, so grab a cup of coffee, curl up in the armchair, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"Whitman wrote as if to me personally. He picked me out as someone many years hence from his perspective, in order to share his world in sufficient detail for me to insert myself into his skin. Through what he put down he came forward more than a hundred years. He is sauntering, noticing the sounds, sights, smells, how he lit up with joy, bittersweetness, fear, self doubt and at times loneliness. He carried me along the river bank at any pace I wanted to go. He would not miss a stride as he adapted to my pace. He taught me how to recline in the summer grass in the cemetery not much more than a stone's throw from where I live, and meditate on his leaf of green summer grass, inviting my soul to enter our picture. I am writing this as a message, an invitation for you, my reader, to get to know Walt Whitman. Don't join the crowd of hate and be put off by the fact that he was gay.I am learning much about making healthy connections, being myself one of the dots I am connecting. I do a little Lazarus raising activity in the cemetery two or three times a week, as I bring back to life my parents, my mother's parents, and her mother's mothers parents. They are in my mind, what I remember and imagine of them, increasingly clearly. There is so much more good will, mutual respect and intimacy aware to me now. I even have group therapy with them.I learned a lot about how to do this from carrying on with Walt Whitman!"},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"More as a point of clarification than review: the Oxford World's Classics edition is not the 1855 edition.

I returned mine and for another $2.00 bought the Floating Wolf Quarterly edition which is perfect for an ebook and I give FIVE stars.One other note to the publishers and to Amazon. One buys a book for two reasons. One is for the content, the story or facts that it contains and for that it could be handwritten on construction paper or kleenex. But the second reason is feel, ease of use, convenience and a certain unsayable aesthetic quality. These ebook editions lack severely in the aesthetic area but are wonderful in the convenience category. So, I wish the publishers would spend a little more time perfecting the convenience areas, even in the 99 cent versions.

The editor has highlighted certain passages in green, and added commentary and exercises at the end of each poem. I suspect lots of folks won't mind this. For me it's cause enough to return the book.I pre-ordered this item because I was intent on finding an edition with the 1855 preface, but without some new person's additions to the classic work. I very much would like to read the work as Whitman presented it, without interjections from an editor or some other new person whose voice for me is an interruption.This editor presents this work as a means for writers to find inspiration for their own work, and attempts to guide or at least aid the reader in that project. For someone like me, for whom writing (and reading) is intensely personal, and who prefers to work directly with the text, without intervention, this is just not the right book."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"Walt Whitman is one of the most famous, widely read, and influential poets - one of the few who can truly be said to have revolutionized poetry. Free verse's true originator, he broke free of formal shackles way back in 1855, nearly three quarters of a century before it became standard. He proved that great poetry could be written without traditional trappings - and it has never been the same. Many, including me, think it has gone too far in the other direction, but this is not Whitman's fault; his work is undeniably great, and we have in many was long since suffered weak imitations. There is simply no equaling him, much less replacing him; his work is as essential a part of American literature as Mark Twain's. He is indeed the Twain of verse, to be anachronistic - as monumental, all-important, and epoch-forming as Twain was in prose. Technicalities aside, this had almost as much to do with subject matter; Whitman famously self-proclaimed \\"America has a bard at last!\\" - and so it did. He freed American poetry from European heritage, making truly national art that both defined its era and instantly became timeless, speaking to the heart of all that America and Americans stood and stand for. The great poet of democracy, he preached the gospel of westward expansion, celebrated America's natural beauty, extolled its unique history and exciting new status, championed its values, chronicled the Civil War, dramatized the struggle over slavery and other national debates, and generally held forth about the country's unmatched cosmopolitanism in all areas from ethnicity to landscapes. He also somehow managed to write about sexuality with unprecedented openness and vigor, striking a blow against Victorian prudery that would eventually prove fatal and even laying the foundations for non-heterosexual identity. Accomplishing even one of these deeds would have been truly remarkable; Whitman did them all.Yet he published only one poetry book - 1855's Leaves of Grass, which went through several updates through his 1892 death. He not only continuously added poems but extensively revised older ones, sometimes dropping some and moving others. For example, the original and final versions of his masterpiece Song of Myself are substantially different. Many key poems were there from the start, but some of the most famous and best - including the Civil War and associated Abraham Lincoln ones - came later. None of the many poems added late in life were nearly on par with prior masterpieces, but nearly all were worthwhile. Whitman wanted the 1892 edition to supersede the rest, and editors have nearly always complied; it is by far the most popular and widely available and the one that nearly all readers will want.And what a version it is! - hundreds of poems plus several prose prefaces and a prose afterword over nearly five hundred pages. To have so much greatness in one book - especially from one person - is near-unbelievable; the depth of Whitman's achievement simply staggers. Nearly all the poems are worthy, and many are great; quite a few are pure masterpieces. Included are some of the all-time great poems like \\"Song of Myself,\\" \\"I Sing the Body Electric,\\" \\"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,\\" \\"Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,\\" \\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd,\\" \\"By Blue Ontario's Shore,\\" and \\"Passage to India,\\" plus many superb short poems. Anyone even remotely interested in poetry must be familiar with these; there have always been some for whom Whitman just does not click, but even they must be prepared to deal with him, so great is his influence.Great as the 1892 Edition is, it is possible for both hard-cores and casuals to complain. Many of the latter will say that it is simply too imposing - too many poems, too many pages. I certainly would not advise anyone who has read very little or no Whitman to jump right in; it is definitely a lot to take in at once, and the poems are by no means of equal quality or importance. One would be far better off reading a selected edition first, but everyone should come here eventually; indeed, nearly all will want to after the first tantalizing taste. Conversely, diehards have always complained about various aspects, from poems it leaves out to various changes made to included ones. The most important omission in my view is Whitman's original prose introduction, which served as his poetic manifesto. The dedicated will of course want to seek out this and every version of every poem, but their complaints are of interest to very few. The 1892 Edition will satisfy nearly everyone.This is not the most deluxe version; one can find various critical editions with extensive commentary, notes, etc. as well as variorum versions. However, this is one of the most widely available and is very affordable. Taking this into account, it has fairly generous supplemental material: a good basic Introduction, a short glossary and bibliography, and an index of titles and first lines with original and final publication dates. This is the ideal Leaves of Grass for most, but everyone should have it in some form. It is one of very few books truly essential for all. Even those who do not like poetry may well like Whitman, and anyone even remotely interested in American literature, history, or culture must be acquainted Leaves, so thoroughly has it penetrated popular culture and entered the American consciousness. Bookshelves missing this might almost as well be empty."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"Choosing the fullest, most complete version of Whitman's text, before the final editing of the deathbed edition, but following the additions made after the Civil War, the Norton Critical is a must have for students of poetry, or literature, and of nature. The wild, ecstatic hunger for the world, the ravishment of the senses, as Norman Mailer put it (though not about Whitman), the mysticism of the flesh, Whitman is, arguably, the most accomplished poet of American letters.A must read for poets, students, and pagans (Whitman as spirit of the Green Man himself!)."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"If you read only one peice of American literature this should be it.

It is a beautiful celebration of the passions in life, awakening and tantilizing the reader as no other book of poetry has ever done (for me). I look forward to passing this beautiful book and its passion for life on to my children."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; is a collection of some of the finest American free-verse poetry ever written. Outward from his home on Brooklyn, Whitman soars out over our great nation, painting a sweeping portrait of mid-nineteenth century America and its diverse inhabitants. Whitman covers a panorama of ideas and themes, from lofty, aloof musings on the nature of man, to piercing depictions of the horrors of war. Gems of wisdom hang from Whitman's web of of verse like dew drops - easy to see but hard to grasp. This is a powerful work, and a never-ending source of beauty. Unfortunately for me, I am not a big fan of free verse, making this work harder for me to enjoy than I had hoped.Which edition do I recommend? That really depends on what you are looking for. If you are just interested in getting a taste of Whitman, I would recommend some of the abridged versions. I don't feel that reading all 700+ pages of Whitman's poetry is necessary for anyone but his biggest fans and students. For a complete version, I found the Modern Library edition acceptable, but nothing spectacular. This work has a multitude of editions, and I would recommend actually holding them in your hand before making a decision on which best suits your needs."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"Although the poems are beautiful... and I certainly don't mean to bash Whitman with this 2-star rating... it's the wrong book. NOT AS ADVERTISED. This was supposed to be the original 1855 edition. That's what I expected, and therefore (in my mind) what I was paying for. The original 1855 edition, according to modern literary analysis, was the \\"strongest/purest\\" version. It was the true starting point of Whitman's own (and consequently America's) poetic awakening. Consisting of just 12 \\"perfect\\" poems, it was THAT edition which Emerson praised so highly.Whitman never put out another book... just revision after revision, addition after addition, and edition after edition of Leaves Of Grass... until you wind up with \\"the deathbed edition\\" which is a severely bloated and different work from the original.I was very much looking forward to a slender volume of the original edition. Which is what the item description says this is. It's not. Be forewarned... it's the Deathbed Edition of 1892... nearly 500 pages. And frankly, there are MUCH better versions of the deathbed edition. Sturdier versions with nicer pages exist (this is a pretty weak paperback, printed on pulp pages), with better footnotes and more authoritive introductions. Shop around.To sum up... the 2 star rating is because lying about which edition this is, is a terrible way to sell the book. Whitman was fantastic and the poetry contained in the book itself is first rate. It just would have been nice to get what I paid for. The \\"true\\" editon, written by a YOUNG Whitman at the height of his powers..."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"Words cannot describe the complexity of Leaves of Grass. I am constantly amazed at how well Walt Whitman holds it all together, keeping is hand on one object while amorously praising another. Everything works in perfect cohesion...An unabashed love of self, of nature, of all that is divine and not divine. Leaves of Grass is a truly inspired work...its words are boundless and fluent, rising in an intoxicating crescendo of naked emotion. \\"I am the poet of the Body; and I am the poet of the Soul.&quot; Throughout Leaves of Grass there is an overwhelming theme of unity...unity of man and nature, of man and man, of man and God. Excitable sputterings of ageless wisdom become scattered, but somehow stay anchored to the intricate framework of the book. This sounds contradicting, and it is reminiscent of a line from the book --&quot;Do I contradict myself? Very well, then, I contradict myself; (I am large-I contain multitudes.) After reading this book, you will delight in how large Walt Whitman is."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"It's difficult to think of something appropriate to say about a man who spent his life trying to express the panorama of humanity through the lense of his own heart. From a drop of blood to the grandeur of a shipyard or a continent, he takes all readers on a journey wild with raving, raging, sorrow, longing, humbleness and pride. At once he is totally modern and yet rife with history.For readers new to poetry, Walt Whitman is wonderfully accessible. One can pick up Leaves of Grass and virtually start and stop anywhere and pick up something wonderful every time.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"The original edition of 'Leaves of Grass' published in 1855 contained twelve poems only. The subsequent editions beginning in 1856 were to greatly expand the work. Thus I would recommed that anyone who wishes to know the true range of Whitman's work find another selection of his work of which there is a larger share of his great work.Whitman is the poet who Emerson prophesied, the American visionary poet who sang of the complex greatness of the society, and connected his own soul with its expansive facts of life."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"The 1855 edition of Leaves of Grass was the first and the best.When I was young I bought the big deathbed edition, not knowing about the 1855 one. I became a Whitman disciple. Either version is a good place to start, but the 1855 is the best version of the early poems and a fine introduction to W.W.The 1855 version was ignored for quite a long time in Whitman studies, but started recieving critical attention after Malcolm Cowley worked to revive it in the 1950's. It was his version that used to be available, until recently, as a Penguin Classic.So whats the difference between 1855 and the Deathbed one?Throughout his lifetime, Whitman not only expanded LOG, his only book, with gobs of inferior-- and sometimes truly awful-- poems (especially when he was older) but he also revised many of his early poems for later editions-- revising them almost always for the worse.The 1855 edition is realtively short and reflects the diminutive, obscure quality of the original. The poems are full of Whitman's original fire before he tinkered with them.Bloom, the author of the introduction, is in the estimation of many America's best living literary critic. He profoundly knows and adores Walt Whitman.If you have the slightest interest in reading American Poetry,drop whatever you are reading (unless it is perhaps Dickinson or Emerson) and get this book. It's still America's best. Nothing since has been (and nothing will ever be) better. The only American poets after Whitman who mattered were deep readers of LOG: Hart Crane, Wallace Stevens, TS Eliot, John Ashbury. (A Ginsberg, C. Sandberg, and O. Paz resemble him superficially but they are are wonks.)If you are interested later in getting all of Whitman's poems, skip all the in-between editions and get the 'Deathbed' Version, which has many good and important poems like 'When Lilacs Last in The Dooryard Bloomed' and 'As I Ebbed with the Ocean of Life'-- as well as many bad ones, to go with your 1855.The Deathbed Version (Whitman approved it as the final Version of his one book as he lay dying) is probably close to ten times as long as the 1855 edition.But Whitman got it right in 1855."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"Giving Walt Whitman only five stars out of five does him an injustice. Walt Whitman is perhaps the finest American poet ever as well as the most quintessentially American poet. His poetry never dates itself. It is as contemporary as if he just wrote it last week. Walt Whitman's poems overflow with life and energy, pulsate with excitement, and contain deep though simply-told truths that rival those of any wise man in history. Much maligned during life and after for the eroticism of his writing, he never let his inhibitions hold back his writing and thus it sparkles with honesty. Walt Whitman was also a great patriot, who loved America in a way modern Americans would do well to emulate. He sought it out on its own terms and recorded what he saw in his poetry. His war poems, written during the American Civil War, are some of the best war poems existing in literature. Whitman knew his subject, having spent much time caring for the wounded soldiers in the hospitals and visiting battlefields. His poems create vivid pictures, richly textured, as real as you read them as if you were seeing the scene yourself. And the dialog he carries on with the reader makes the reader feel that Whitman, if he were still alive, would like nothing more than to sit down and discuss life. He is one of the few poets who manages to establish a rapport with his reader, to anticipate his reader's reactions and talk to each one through the poem. Walt Whitman should be read by any and every literate American. 'Leaves of Grass' will change anyone who dares to read it."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"The best way to appreciate Whitman is to read him aloud as you walk down a street or the country side.You'd feel electricity stirring within you and all else would change too.Even the inanimate would seeth with life and vitality amidst the gentle choreography of nature.Thats what happens to me when I read &quot;The Song Of the Open Road&quot;.It's amazing that Whitman could capture the deep inherent things we feel inside,things that stir us inside out and yet find it difficult to express.A timeless clasic that will stir people from generation to generation.Nothing like it."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"Do yourself a favor and buy this book.

Being a native of Brooklyn myself I feel a deep connection to him. When I read his work I am instantly transported into his universe, a universe which is the domain of every man. For Walt Whitman was possibly the greatest democrat who ever lived.In his great poem, Song of Myself, his opening lines are: &quot;I celebrate myself, and what I assume you shall assume, for every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.&quot; This is not only good old American horse sense, it's good science. For everything comes forth from that great source of life the sun, and none can be better for it, only different.Walt was a born visionary. And I surmise that he must have had quite a few mystical experiences before he set out to write his great poems. You can really get a sense of his mystical connection when you read poems like When I Heard The Learned Astronomer or even in Song of Myself when he proclaims: &quot;There was never any more inception than there is now, nor any more youth or age than there is now; and will never be any more perfection than there is now, nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.&quot; Notice the emphasis on the word now. Mystics through the ages have said that God is beyond time, that God is the eternal presence, and that he exists in a timeless eternity sometimes referred to as the eternal now. I believe that's what Walt Whitman is telling us.I could go on and on singing the praises of Walt Whitman. His work is inexhaustable and profound and wise beyond measure. But there are innumerable books written about him. However, I believe to catch the essence of the man you have to read his poems.

Then I had an English teacher that introduced me to what I can only characterize as adult poetry. No more, Joyce Kilmer. Here was something that challenged me intellectually. High on the list of my favorites was Whitman and \\"Leaves of Grass\\".Now, in my 50's I decided to see if I would bring away something different, so I revisited this classic. I can testify that there is much still there; although my tastes in poetry have matured quite a bit. I don't find Whitman quite as \\"shocking\\" in light of the social changes that I've seen since my youth.Still, there is a certain nostalgia that makes Whitman eminantly readable.

The poetry speaks of Walt Whitman's connection to his fellow man, nature, and to God. It is not to be missed.Leaves of Grass speaks to the turbulent times in which Whitman lived, being the Civil War era. He speaks out against the horror of war and he embraces the spirit of compassion for his comrades. Yet the book is also a reflection on matters relating largely to uplifting themes. His poetry has evoked thoughts about what is of value within my life. Even though it is the product of another era, it speaks to the timeless values of humankind.As the author of a spiritually-themed novel entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" I look for books that provide food for my soul. This is one that certainly hit home for me. It is also a book written by a gay man. Since I am gay myself, I appreciated the affirming nature of Whitman who embraced his sexuality with little judgment. This was a remarkable example which reflected his inner peace during a time when being a homosexual was not accepted.Whether or not you are a man, woman, gay, or otherwise, this book will speak to you. It will help you to embrace humanity, your spirit, and all of creationDavis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"One of the greatest pieces of work from the Heritage Press and, arguably, one of the more important reprints of the 20th century.The famous pairing of Rockwell Kent illustrations with Walt Whitman's poetry was first released by Heritage in 1937.

Not really sure it it's the original 1855 edition but I presume it is."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"I was familiar with the well-known poems and wanted to own \\"Leaves of Grass.\\" I'm not going to review the poetry, but describe, hopefully to help others figure out what took me some research, its various editions.In 1855 Whitman self-published \\"Leaves of Grass\\" as a 12-poem book. Up to 1892, he added poems and revised the original twelve poems -- books also published under the same title, \\"Leaves of Grass.\\" In 1892, Whitman published (by then, recognized, not self-published) its final version, the edition he wanted to be thought the definitive \\"Leaves of Grass.\\" This is the commonly called \\"Deathbed Edition.\\" It contains over 300 poems. It does contain the original twelve, though not in their original or other previously-published forms. By then, they'd been many-times revised over the years, and released within other publications between the first and the last. In essence, \\"Leaves of Grass\\" was a nearly 40-year evolving work, under the same title, each edition containing the prior editions' poems further revised, plus additional poems.I wanted to read the original poems. I also wanted to see their final versions, and was curious to see their evolution. I noticed that some books include so many evolutions of the poems/book, they fill at least two volumes. I wanted to own \\"Leaves of Grass\\" but I didn't need to become a scholar of it; I wanted to read the book. However, I didn't want only the Deathbed Edition -- I was both curious about the original and wanted to see more than 12 poems.I decided to buy an edition of the book that contains the entire Deathbed Edition, plus a few of the poems in their original form, and some commentary. I believe, after researching, I found the best I could. That would be my recommendation: if this is your first purchase of \\"Leaves of Grass\\" make sure to see some poetry from 1855, some poetry from the Deathbed Edition, and some poetry in between. That is, if what you want to read is the poetry and not own a collector's item or only the \\"definitive edition,\\" as Whitman viewed it (Deathbed). To me, seeing only the final version detracts something from its core -- and after reading the poems and comparing them, I feel this even more -- so in that sense I disagree with Whitman; he chose to make public many books over 40 years, yet wanted only the last to be considered the true version.As a reader, I find it unfortunate that this is a work that evolved over a lifetime under the same title; it renders each addition of poems to the book not books of their own, and also difficult to find on their own. So, for me, the compromise was to choose a book that includes the Deathbed Edition and part of the original, without having to read multiple books, or 1,000 pages, or a scholarly journal (though I would love to see the full original 12 poems).I understand a book will be released soon that includes both the full original (12 poems) and the full Deathbed Editions. I don't have it, so I don't know what else will be included."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"Having read only tid bits, here and there, from Leaves of Grass, I found that it was full of truly unique American poetry. Whitman definitely achieved his goal of becoming a truly innovative poet. The fact that he rarely uses any type of meter, rhyme scheme, or exaggerated rhetorical devices almost says that he has mastered the basic fundamentals of poetry and surpassed his peers. He is so far above the simple and frequently used methods that he must create his own fresh and new style of writing. I found Leaves of Grass to be a lot to grapple with as a high school student, especially his philosophy pertaining to Deism, and yet, it was most intriguing and made me want to simply delve deeper into it. I look forward to completing Leaves of Grass and recommend it to anyone looking for truly original forms of American poetry."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"I carry a copy of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass with me where ever I go.

He shares his limitless love for all Americans, including, of course, himself. I particularly enjoy his frequent usage of listing without commas, which I find livens his excitement for life even more. Whitman, although he may come off as a bit over eager to some, truly makes you realize how blessed you are and how lucky you are to live in this beautiful place, and he reminds us all that we should not take any of these blessings for granted.

Walt was a true American. It is incredible that Walt Whitman can make accurate references in his poems to just about every facit of American life. It doesn't take very many pages before you feel as if Walt has been in your shoes, seen things through your eyes, thought the things you have thought and felt the feelings you have felt.

His song is not only of himself but of the American realities he meets and catalogues in his long cadenced lines. Whitman sings the song of America as yes in a way no one had before and no one will since. He is the American poet who captured the most of American reality in his lines . And he is the one who too speaks of it at the moment of its great outward expansion and hope, as a historical progress of ever rising ever more sweepingly inclusive cosmic concentrical circles. He is a writer who touches the stars, and above all reaches the sense of the light within us (When I heard the learned Astronomer) He touches upon American tragedy ( O Captain my Captain) and most deeply expresses it ( Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking) He is the one who takes all America as an adventure and feast for his eyes and lines.

It is, alongside the poems of Hart Crane, Rimbaud, Lautreamont, Blake, Lawrence, Emily Dickinson and St John Perse, a totally singular experience. I have never read anything like \\"Song Of Myself\\" and \\"The Sleepers\\", and I am certain that you will love them just as much.I do, however, have certain reservations about Malcolm Cowley's introduction. It is well-intentioned enough, but I would like to issue a few words of warning, as it is certainly a very confused affair, one that will no doubt perplex many Whitman neophytes. For Cowley, the task of Whitman interpretation couldn't be simpler, one need only look towards Indian Vedic philosophy and Buddhist scripture for an all-purpose key. While this certainly seems attractive and convenient- a lazy expedient for phlegmatic types- Cowley himself realizes that it is totally incongruous with certain aspects of Whitman:\\"Most of Whitman's doctrines, though by no means all of them, belong to the mainstream of Indian philosophy. In some respects he went against the stream. Unlike most of the Indian sages, for example, he was not a thoroughgoing idealist. He did not believe that the whole world of the senses, of desires, of birth and death, was only maya, illusion, nor did he hold that it was a sort of purgatory; instead he praised the world as real and joyful. He did not despise the body, but proclaimed that it was as miraculous as the soul.\\"Having meandered into a cul-de-sac, Cowley's attempt at escape is characteristically sloppy:\\"...it must be remembered that Indian philosophy or theology is not such a unified structure as it appears to us from a distance. Whitman might have found Indian sages or gurus and even whole sects that agreed with one or another of his heterodoxies (perhaps excepting his belief in material progress). One is tempted to say that instead of being a Christian heretic, he was an Indian rebel and sectarian. Sometimes he seems to be a Mahayana Buddhist...\\"Pedants are like spiders- they love cocooning themselves in their own contradictions. All of the difficulties that Cowley encounters here stem from his insufferable compulsion to categorise, and hence domesticate, Whitman. I take issue with this preposterous statement:\\"One is tempted to say...\\"No, Mr Cowley, YOU are tempted to make these conclusions, any sober reader is willing to meet Whitman on his own terms, to delight in his incomparable vigor. Further on, we find the following:\\"Since the Indian mystical philosophies are elaborate structures, based on conceptions that have been shaped and defined by centuries of discussion, they help to explain Whitman's ideas at points in the first edition whre he seems at first glance to be vague or self-contradictory. There is, for example, his UNUSUAL combination of realism- sometimes brutal realism- and serene optimism.\\"Unusual, perhaps, if you insist on translating the poem into Vedic terms. It is a little depressing that scholars are so blind to the revelatory miracles of Leaves Of Grass. Here was a poet attempting to forge new forms of expression commensurate to his time, a capacious, all-enveloping style that would sing the songs of democracy. To thank him for his troubles, scholars do the only thing they are capable of, dragging Whitman into the malodorous mire of comparison. This line is redolent of Plato, this one reeks of Vimalakirti, this shadowy section can be illuminated with the torch of the Gita, all of it is regurgitated thought, relics coated in new varnish.What makes matters worse is Cowley's admission that Whitman had read none of the cited works in 1852. Yet, the empirical evidence admits no contestation- the symptoms of Whitman's mystical paroxysm are largely identical with prior examples. \\"Leaves Of Grass\\", we are told, is another manifestation of the 'perennial philosophy'- for all of its ornate embellishments and flourishes, it is, in fact, not very revolutionary at all. Once you master the rudiments of said philosophy, the swelling surge of Whitman's writing is easily navigable. Here we see Cowley defeated by his own epistemological suppositions. Cowley's method, after all, is that of a good Platonist. Poetry, for him, marks a poet's gradual emergence from anamnesia, a rapturous remembrance of eternal truths.In actuality, the introduction is not really about \\"Leaves Of Grass\\" at all. It is about the scholar's will to power, his inexorable urge to subordinate every literary text to precedent. In reducing \\"Song Of Myself\\" to yet another incarnation of Hindu absorption, Cowley does a severe injustice to a great American poem. He would have us believe that \\"Song Of Myself\\" is little better than a journal entry in verse, a haphazard approximation of a subjective mystical experience that has been repeated throughout history. To further substantiate his claim, Cowley compares a stanza in \\"Leaves Of Grass\\" to a Vedic text, noting their thematic and stylistic similarities. Does this not consolidate Whitman's unflinching faith in metempsychosis? In \\"Song Of Myself\\", Whitman effects the transmigration of souls, channelling the voice of the Vedas. The complacence and self-contentment of Cowley is, for this reader at least, truly vulgar.I am not disputing the notion that Whitman has a consistent doctrine beneath all of his creative output, but the system must be sought WITHIN his texts and NOT without. This is the thought that courses throughout all of Whitman's writing, that of pure immanence. To those approaching Whitman for the first time, I hope you have the good sense to treat Cowley's introduction with the bemusement that it deserves."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"One of the greatest pieces of work from the Heritage Press and, arguably, one of the more important reprints of the 20th century.The famous pairing of Rockwell Kent illustrations with Walt Whitman's poetry was first released by Heritage in 1937.

Over the years Whitman added poems and changed some of these so you'd be reading the first draft of some things, so to speak. This is the best edition, in my opinion.

He takes what seems like existential ramblings, and turns them into beautiful and self-reflective pieces of art. This is not just poetry, it's literally a thesis on life, a philosophical treasure, a song that celebrates being alive, a picture depicting the cycles of life, an ode to the SOUL - simple thoughts, taken to extraordinary levels by an extraordinary man.Although to some, the poems may be too open-ended, long, tedious or verbose to appear enjoyable - but, when you lay bare the meaning behind Whitman's words, you cannot help but feel empowered, aware, introspective, a believer in life, the lover of a human body, and a worshiper of the human soul.

This is the original 1855 version. Whitman added to the collection throughout his life, ending up with an overstuffed and very uneven \\"deathbed\\" version, which is better known. There are some good poems in it which aren't in the original, such as When Lilacs Last in the Door-yard Bloom'd, but there's a lot of pretty weak stuff, too. The 1855 has a small number of pretty consistently excellent poems which are highly original and loosely but definitely connected. Reading it is a very different experience from wading through the bloated, inconsistent final version - there's something Whitmanesque (i.e., at it's best) about the original collection as a unit.

He wrote about life. He wrote about the mundane world, and made it look so beautiful. He admired the human form, and praised the wonderful design of the body. His comments on life in America during the middle of the 19th century really carry a romantic outlook. He was passionate about himself, life, and the world around him.

Whitman was a man ahead of his time."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"While I agree with most of the reviews written here, I must take issue with them somewhat. First, I also believe that Walt Whitman is one of the finest poets that ever lived and certainly the finest when it comes to being a proud American. Although, he comes from a time in America that was like that of Socrates and Plato in the past, a time when the most important thing in life was not work, or success or career, but the exploration of one's inner thoughts. Were we living in a time when such a thing was permitable rather than the constant search for the almighty dollar, we might see more such poets. But he and his era are long gone. The art of the word is certainly Walt's. I ask you to also purchase a dictionary when you purchase this or any of his volumes, not because it is difficult to read, but because Whitman doesn't always use a word for it's main meaning, often burying a meaning of a word or line in the third or fourth meaning, completely changing the meaning of the poem. It is such fun and exactly what I believe Walt Whitman is meant to be, a journey and a trip to the celebration of life. A celebration that also includes a look at the worst that is us and the best that is us. When the reviewer wrote that his work is a study of a narcissist, I have to disagree. Yes, it begins his work with Song of Myself and it is an epic poem. But while he celebrates Walt, he is truly celebrating all of us as amazing creatures in nature. He celebrates every molecule of us, the amazing capabilities, perfumes and evilness of us. He studies us as though someone would study the amazing ability of a tree to grow or a flower to bloom. We are nature and he recognizes that and it is amazing to him. Clearly, he had bravado and self-love, but in the most non-imposing way. We wishes all of us to realize the miracle that is us. To believe that he is only about himself is to miss the point of Walt. Also, it is important to read the various editions of this volume. He wrote and rewrote Leaves of Grass continuously throughout his life adding and deleting poems as he saw them. The best way to see his journey is to read the first edition (complete with his swaggering picture), where he was not listed as the author to the final \\"deathbed edition\\" that is truly a masterpiece and you can see what he learns, what he tries to teach you and how deeply you will be moved by him. One last hint - read \\"Song of Myself\\" outloud. It becomes truly a song about life and read outloud can certainly stir your soul."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"What more can be said about Walt Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;? This 19th century work is more than just a poetic masterpiece; it is a pivotal landmark in the history of world literature. Read &quot;Leaves&quot; and you will understand why Whitman is hailed as a poetic ancestor by poets, both male and female, of many different ethnic and national backgrounds. His is truly a universal voice.Whitman published the first edition of &quot;Leaves&quot; in 1855, and continued to revise and expand the book until it had grown into the monumental final version. While the &quot;deathbed&quot; edition is an essential text, I'd like to put in a plug for the much smaller 1855 edition, which has been reprinted with an introduction by Malcolm Cowley. The &quot;deathbed&quot; edition may be too large and intimidating a literary tapestry for Whitman &quot;virgins&quot;; the reprinted 1855 edition may thus be a good way to begin exploring the bounteous poetic talent and vision of this giant.The Cowley-introduced edition also includes Whitman's original prose introduction, which is itself a remarkable piece of literature. While the 1855 &quot;Leaves&quot; is missing vast sections of the deathbed version, it is still a stunning work of art that succeeds as a self-sufficient piece of literature and philosophy. In this &quot;embryonic&quot; version of the soon-to-evolve masterpiece, we already discover Whitman's pungent eroticism, his embrace of paradox, and his playful theological exploration. His language is sensuous, outrageous, tender, and amazing, and is full of compassion for all living beings.Whitman is more than just a great poet; his work is a sort of prophecy for both the secular and multifaith worlds. So read &quot;Leaves&quot; in either the embryonic version or the ultimate version, and embark on an unforgettable poetic journey."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"Is this FREE edition abridged?

This is poetry at its most raw. It does for the written word what Stravinsky did with music. It doesn't need dressing up and it utterly rejects the falsity of good manners.

Read it and then choose the right moment to sound your own barbaric yawp!"},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"What a lover?! I have fallen in love with Walt Whitman. One such as this writing such passionate things in those times or these...and with such candor. I am so thankful to have read this book. Beautiful."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"If you care for literature at all, even if your interest in it exceeds no further than reading the morning paper, Walt Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass,&quot; is a must read. He is truly one of the greatest poets, revolutionaries, historians, and Americans to ever live. As a poet, Whitman lures his reader in with work exploding with passion and inexhaustable energy. As a revolutionist, he baisically tore up any rule book to writing, stripping away any limitations, and paving the path for further free, independent thinkers. He was unaffraid to rebel against the narrow-mindedness of his time, making himself a leader as one of the very first poets to ever use &quot;free verse,&quot; a technique rellious on its own. In doing so, this great leader was criticized and looked on disapprovingly for his work during much of his life time, and like many other artists who dare to be unique, his true genius was never fully recognized until after his death. As a historian and as an American, Whitman has taken these works of his and has combined them into the nations most patriotic yet brutally honest text book.It is in writing of himself and his own personal experiences that Whitman imbeds the history of this country, both dark and nationalistic. Through his time working as a volunteer nurse to the wounded and dying soldiers during the Civil War, Whitman writes often of the terror of war, making it one of his most recognizable themes throughout much of his work. He also brings us back to a time in history in which those who believed in equal rights for all, including persons of every race a gender, was considered rebellious; for in such beliefs, Whitman took religions that placed severe restrictions over such things as sexuality, and attacked them. The reason I am so confident in recommending this book to any reader, is that you are given a selection of editions to choose from; the edition you choose for yourself, fitted to your familiarity with the poet. I cannot promise that will fall absolutely in love with this book, every person has their own tastes, however, I can promise that if nothing else, you will walk away from this book with appreciation and understanding the value in reading it."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass is an exemplary representation of both transcendentalism and realism. Walt Whitman was one of the few writers to bridge the gap between these literary movements and Leaves of Grass was, in essence, his opus. It represented the author himself and was often condemned in Whitman's time for it's blatant descriptions and incorporations of sexuality and homosexuality. However, years later it came to be appreciated for what it is truly worth as an exquisite culmination of people, emotions, and the democratic spirit.Of the many themes covered throughout the 438 pages in the ninth edition of Whitman's masterpiece, symbolism was often used to represent allegory ideas and situations. In \\"O Captain! My Captain!\\" the captain symbolizes Abraham Lincoln and America is ship. In the captain's death, Whitman is alluding to the fact that in the absence of strong leadership guiding the \\"ship,\\" there will be a lack of order and chaos. \\"Song of Myself\\" was, on the other hand, explicit in the ideal it depicted. All fifty-two sections discuss intricacies of semi-specific people or types of people; they come together as one poem and are all part of something larger. Whitman believed not only in the individual being but also in a larger being that everyone and everything was a part of, in other words the oversoul. \\"Song of Myself\\" is truly filler in the gap between the literary movements because it is so thoroughly transcendental in meaning, yet so precise in describing reality.Emerson's was completely justified in praising Walt Whitman's work because it is still today very profound and extremely important in respect American literature overall. Unfortunately a fairly high mentality is required to take in his poetry for all its meaning and worth. Maturity and openness is key because often criticism of Leaves of Grass spurns from prudish and thoroughly conservative readers."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass","review":"Since there was some confusion in the comments section as to what volumes were or were not truly the \\"First Edition,\\" I though I'd confirm that the Penguin Classics version entitled \\"Leaves of Grass: The First (1855) Edition\\" is in fact the first, slim, volume of \\"Leaves of Grass\\" published in 1855.

Perhaps a caveat to the story more than words on the pages but still part of the story and of interest to the reader.When Allison Kiessling of Waking Media contacted me to inform me that they were republishing her grandfather William C. Anderson's books into e-book format, I was absolutely \\"blown away\\" to find out that BAT 21 was one of them. Ms. Kiessling contacted me as an aviation writer and book reviewer to review BAT 21. She did not know that I had a personal connection to the story. I accepted, after explaining my connection. My childhood best friend had also been on that same aircraft as Colonel Gene Hambleton the only survivor (BAT 21). Captain Robin Gatwood, USAF (also aboard BAT 21 EB 66) of Hickory North Carolina, we salute you and miss you always pal! Sadly, no other names of crew members were in the story.Indeed, I first read the book authored by Colonel William C. Anderson, himself a Vietnam Air Force pilot and therefore very much \\"in the know\\" about the complexities of search-and-rescue operations. This in my opinion gives enormous credibility to the technical side of the book, from the start.I actually did a lengthy phone interview with Gene Hambleton in 1989 from his home in Arizona. So I can compare some facts that others seem to have missed along the line. Others are not worth mentioning, therefore I won't. For example, the SAM hit just aft of the right wing-root, that happen to be exactly where Robin Gatwood, Electronic Warfare Officer (E.W.O.) was. He was the one who would have announced, \\"SAM launched\\" and his station was just aft of the right wing-root.It started Easter weekend 1972. All hell broke loose when thousands of North Vietnamese regulars streamed southward through the DMZ over running fire bases and continuing south. Sunday morning, April 2, 1972, Iceal E. Hambleton, E.W.O. was aboard an EB-66 searching for SAM sites (surface to air missile launch sites) to electronically jam their guidance radar to protect the incoming flight of B-52 carpet bombers from Clark AFB in the Philippines.The EB-66 aircraft exploded and Colonel Hambleton found himself the lone survivor on a parachute floating downward targeting into the middle of a forward air controller orbit. The FAC were slow light aircraft which controlled inbound air support strike forces against the enemy. Hambleton was landing in the middle of thousands of North Vietnamese regular invading troops.Colonel Hambleton, being an avid golfer was able to evade enemy troops, guided by air support and an imaginary game of golf. Hambleton's superb memory of the golf courses he had played, each stroke orchestrated by the air controller above who was watching where the enemy was located. Each stroke hopefully would take him closer to his intended rescue and avoiding the traps (enemy and sure capture and probable death).This story is about the longest, the largest, and the most difficult search rescue behind enemy lines of anyone during the Vietnam War. During the operation, there were over a half-dozen aircrafts shot down and severely damaged, and the air rescue was finally called off. However, after eleven days.Reading BAT 21, perhaps, plants a question in the reader's mind, as it has in my own, exactly why the upper echelon of military would let a \\"ballistic missile expert with a top secret clearance\\" one who helped develop the secret \\"wild weasel\\" program go on missions where there was a possibility of capture?This book was well-written and showcases the strengths and courage of some magnificent extraordinary men in a time of war. However, only those who have witnessed the horrors of Vietnam can fully appreciate the value of this book. The impact is to valid to a certain extent and it is still a good read for those who have not experienced war, however.William C. Anderson brings home the gut-wrenching horrors of war and one can almost taste the fear that Gene Hambleton must have felt during those days running for his life, not knowing if he was going to live or die! Gene told me he never got over the fear he felt the minute he came eyeball to eyeball with the enemy soldier.I recommend BAT 21, was a good read all three times I've read it...JR Hafer, Aviation Writer"},{"Title":"Bat-21","review":"Allow me to quote the author, William C. Anderson, from Contemporary Authors NR - &quot;To paraphrase Mark Twain, truth is a very rare commodity and should be used sparingly. I subscribe totally to this view, and have seldom been accused of letting the facts interfere with a good story.&quot;The author does tells the reader in the afterword that the book is based on the true story in 'spirit'. However the words &quot;Based on the True Story...&quot; usually mean a high degree of fact. If you're looking for an entertaining story written by a close friend of the main character, you've found the right book."},{"Title":"Bat-21","review":"This book is a really good read and gave a good sense of what it was like to beshot down in a conventional warfare situation."},{"Title":"The Seventeenth Degree: How It Went, Vietnam, Hanoi, Medina, Sons of the Morning","review":"Mary McCarthy was an early opponent of the Vietnam War, but couldn't figure out what to do at first.Finally she decided to go, several times, at length even to Hanoi, which was being bombed by US planes.She wrote 5 short books--\\"pamphlets,\\" she called them--and together they make up \\"Seventeenth Degree.\\"She tells of her initial doubts and difficulties (one of which was that going to Vietnam might cost her husband his job with the State Department).Then she describes, in vivid and excruciating detail, what she saw in the country--the people, the damage, the corruption, the idiocy.What she saw resembles nothing so much as our current fiasco in Iraq--the ruthless devastation, the forced migrations, the fatcats, the corruption (Halliburton, anyone?), the hapless soldiers who don't know why they're there, the mendacious \\"officials\\" whose rationales and lies keep shifting, the torture, the horrors that keep getting \\"spun\\" into something palatable.Then, as now, the US government can't understand why people are not overjoyed to have their country bombed and invaded.But an overwhelming difference is that in Vietnam reporters were free, like McCarthy, to roam and report at will.The US army learned its lesson. The lesson was NOT \\"don't do it,\\" but \\"don't let them SEE you do it.\\"Granted, Iraq is more dangerous now for reporters than Vietnam was (though Vietnam was no picnic). But it's a shame there aren't more un-embedded reporters up to the task. (There are a few, like Robert Fisk, in Iraq.)A major reason Vietnam was brought to a close was the daily dinnertime TV news-images of napalmed babies, burned villages, dead soldiers. The war in Iraq is more sanitized, so we won't revolt at the horror.A sad, chilling, eye-opening, brilliantly-written book."},{"Title":"The Seventeenth Degree: How It Went, Vietnam, Hanoi, Medina, Sons of the Morning","review":"This collection is a monument to its pieces, smaller works of which Mary McCarthy herself could rightly complain, &quot;One of my friends tried to get it that summer when she was in Idaho (the home state of war critic Senator Frank Church) visiting relations ~ no luck. When she passed through New York in the fall, same story.&quot; On a personal level, this is a complaint by someone of immense popularity that her own views on the war wouldn't sell, or weren't being sold. The highest irony of this book is its final sentence, at the end of a review of a very explicit book by David Halberstam, &quot;In career terms, which in my view interest Halberstam excessively, how dead is 'dead'?&quot; Please be assured that I feel the same way whenever a representative of my government calls me and asks where I am working, and then wonders why I would mention Richard Nixon. I only mention this book the way dubious achievements might be associated with Nixon and the question, &quot;Why is this dead man laughing?&quot; I promise that this book is easier to understand than the death of Homer, a famous Greek poet who was so blind he couldn't tell what two boys were doing when they said, &quot;That which we see and catch, we leave behind, but what we neither see nor catch, we carry with us.&quot; McCarthy mentions Homer on page 235 to support the idea that &quot;at the front, war itself appears senseless, a confused butchery that only the gods can understand.&quot; On page 268, she is more explicitly into Homeric epithets, comparing his use of the godly phrase &quot;cloud-gathering Zeus&quot; to &quot;the air pirates,&quot; (one of &quot;the set phrases of North Vietnamese diction.&quot;) Never again should we try to go to war without our Homer, whoever that might be. My vote for the Homer of Nam would be Bernard Fall, a smiling fellow in the picture of the author on the back of the jacket for this book. The picture might be more famous than the book. The caption under the picture says, &quot;Mary McCarthy in Vietnam with Bernard Fall, February, 1967 (Fall was killed under fire shortly afterward.) Newsweek, Francoise Sully copyright 1967.&quot; It is a bit late to read this book now, but the calculation of the number of people who haven't read this book can only go one way, up, and it is going to do that forever, as sure as Homer is dead."},{"Title":"Alternative Scriptwriting: Successfully Breaking the Rules, Third Edition","review":"If you have already read the &quot;how-to&quot; books from Syd Field, Linda Seger, and others, then you must know that the three most important things you should be doing to enhance your craft are: reading screenplays, watching movies, and writing screenplays.

These authors take their task very seiously, including taking to heart comments they'd received about the first edition, and making sweeping and important changes for this new version. Buy this book.

I thought it was worth my time, because it put into words a great many concepts that my mind has seen and comprehended so many times. It talks about the relationship of the main character to the secondary characters, how to flatten the acts of your story to pack a bigger punch later on, and it makes good use of scripts, both well-known and otherwise. It also has a chapter that explains WHY scripts are formatted the way they are. It's easy to just say, \\"This is how it is. We can't say why, but we can tell you how to copy it.\\" But these authors explain in detail why certain terms are used and why certain formats make more sense than others.

If you are tired of the typical three-act structure screenplay based on Act 1 being set up, Act 2 being the confrontation and Act 3 the resolution this book is for you. Before jumping to conclusions Alt. Scriptwriting will not provide you a format ahem template for creating unorthodox screenplays. This is exactly what Alt. Scriptwriting is about, getting away from these rules that bogged down many great aspiring and established screenwriters with details, plot points, reversals, camera angles etc etc...Not to say that such details are not unimportant to creating a screenplay they are very important to say the least but oftentimes more attention is given to them than to what is the most important aspect of a creating a screenplay and that is the writing. Seems simple, but it often the most overlook aspect of creating a screenplay. So in Alt. Scriptwriting Dancyger and Rush take you on refreshers course in traditional three act screenplay structure, remember know the rules before you break them. After touching on the usual suspects plot, exposition, point of view and concept Dancyger and Rush get down to business. Explaining the pro and cons of a two act or even an one-act screenplay. Tarantino would be proud! From there much emphasis is given in explaining screenwriting structures of other cultures Europe, Asian and Australian.Dancyger and Rush with great care explain the subtleties of mixing genres citing Wolf and Blade Runner as excellent examples. Word of note this is very important section of the book in our age of globalization, world economies, international conglomerates and of course the ability to almost customize anything we want learning how to blend genres is an important skill to possess.Which leads to the most important aspect of the book to me and that is screenwriting in the digital age. The digital revolution has taken filmmaking by storm by empowering the ever growing independent movement and the often overlook niche filmmaking that is emerging. This is where Alt. Scriptwriting takes off by delving into the differences in creating a screenplay with a dramatic voice or narrative voice, the importance of creating believable characters, creating a screenplay based on a real events and of course making your screenplay believable to a reader.Alt. Scriptwriting is definitely the book to have for all independent filmmakers or aspiring filmmakers who are thinking about writing as well as directing their own movies. Now for the novice screenwriter Alt. Scripting may not be the book for you and if you give a try you may want to read from to back to front. However, once you understand the concept of creating a screenplay or you have already written a few screenplays, attending workshops, purchased screenwriting help books and screenplays this book is a must have. It will provide you with a different outlook on screenwriting yes an alternative..."},{"Title":"Alternative Scriptwriting: Successfully Breaking the Rules, Third Edition","review":"I like reading books on screenwriting as they teach you how to install the skeleton of story...have three acts, a clear premise based on conflict for the main character, someone or thing to fight against and you are away once you have chosen the genre. So in a western it's the lone flawed hero against the cattle baron struggling to find his place between the call of the wild and the lure of the town as he fights his way to the big showdown before riding off in the sunset. Or in a horror film, it's the lone victim and her family/friends trapped in the house on the hill fighting against evil sub-human monster who kills indiscriminately until finally defeat as the dawn of a new day breaks.What Alternative Scriptwriting by Ken Dancyger and Jeff Rush does is to show the rules so you can break them. They give a detailed breakdown of 14 genres and how they use the individual building blocks before discussing such things as how to:* mix and match genres and what works and what doesn't;* change structures so 4 Act or two Act stories;* reframe the roles of passive/ active characters; and* use tone or narrative voice.Its not done in a dry way as the discussion is linked to case studies or comparisons of different Directors and international styles but it does help if you have seen the films or have them on DVD! The important thing is that they argue that screenwriting is part of the tradition of storytelling/writing and so need to draw on the full range. Its not a book to read if you want a how to layout a film script but it is one if you want to explore the narrative force of a book.An interesting alternative take on genres and the film narrative is The Writers Journey by Christopher Vogler. He explores how the mythic Hero's journey shapes plots and characterisation and so genres are merely different aspects of the journey. Again the rule is know the rules to break them.So read both and enjoy the Saturday movie more but also check why the book works or doesn't"},{"Title":"Alternative Scriptwriting: Successfully Breaking the Rules, Third Edition","review":"If you are already aquanited with basic screenwriting techniques regarding structure and character, then this is a must read.

The authors certainly know what they're talking about. You'll learn alot.BUT...My issue with this text is that it often becomes almost too professorial and theoretical in approach. This is not inherently negative, but sometimes more concise, brief, to the point explanations of how to subvert traditional screen writing is called for. Instead, the authors sometimes create an atmosphere that reminded me of being in a classroom, listening to an interesting but somewhat 2 Dimensional lecture. This is personal opinion, of course. But I know some out there would absorb the information better if it had been presented in a less wordy and more \\"doey\\" manner. Not enough balance in their approach to getting the reader to take in the info.With that said, to pass up this book would be a mistake, I think, if you want to create alternative screenplays. I've learned alot and it was worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Alternative Scriptwriting: Successfully Breaking the Rules, Third Edition","review":"First off, let me just say that Alternative Scriptwriting isn't a book for the novice screenwriter. It's not a how-to book, but more of a collection of suggestions and examples of how you can take your writing beyond the conventional approach put forth in most books on the subject. You'll get far more out of this book if you've already written a few screenplays and have the basics of story structure down.The problem I have with most screenwriting books is that the authors are too enamored with conventional three-act structure. They tend to praise movies that aren't that great (I cannot count how many times Tootsie is used as an example in various books, nor can I fathom why the late Blake Snyder loved Miss Congeniality so freaking much), or they try to shoehorn a movie into the old Syd Field paradigm. One book I read literally tried to restructure Memento so that it fit the template.What I liked about Alternative Scriptwriting was that the authors try to impart that nothing in storytelling is really written in stone. The characters don't have to be active, there doesn't have to be three acts, the genre conventions can be mixed and altered, etc. Even better, they show example after example of mainstream and arthouse films that pull off these convention-breaking ideas. For example, Full Metal Jacket's use of two acts and a passive main character, or Spike Lee's She's Gotta Have It using two acts so that the character reaffirms her ways instead of changing into something else.The only downside to the book is that it is written pretty dryly, as if it were intended for the college classroom. This makes sense, as authors Ken Dancyger and Jeff Rush are both university professors. While I wouldn't want the book to be written in the dumbed-down, super breezy style you find in the Dummies' Guide books, the text could use just a little personality. That being said, the dryness of the writing is a small detraction from a good book that shows writers that they don't have to be bogged down by the \\"rules\\" of conventional screenwriting.If you've written a few scripts and are looking at how to take your own writing to new levels, this is a book you must read."},{"Title":"Alternative Scriptwriting: Successfully Breaking the Rules, Third Edition","review":"Very clearly written.

It did provide a list of good films. nothing out of the ordinary but good films.I would hate to take a class from these dudes - sounds boring as heck.Since the author's dont have much insight or experience to offer, it would have been nice if they had the integrity and ambition to interview all or some the screenwriters that wrote the movies they list. then we could understand the actual insight that went into the story choices - rather than second or third rate conjecture.If you're looking for a book with top notch insight on some extra-ordinary films, I suggest \\"Film As A Subversive Art\\" by Amos Vogel.

The authors appear to want to curry favor with the their peers in the teachers lounge than educate students. Occasionally the writing is downright atrocious.

From time to time a picture of a biotope is included - sometimes with specifications as to the fishy inhabitants, sometimes with miscellaneous comments. The origin of these is quite unbalanced: while South America scores some 17 photos, lake Malawi makes do with 4 (though 2 are underwater ones - the only ones to be so!), lake Tanganyka with just one, Australia with 3 and Asia with 1. The rest go completely unrecorded. To make matters worse most of these are landscape pictures giving little information about the actual habitat of the fish or plants. Only in one picture can aquatic plants clearly be seen (apart from water lilies, that is) - no specific biotope information is given for plants at all.All in all this is, I believe, a great reference book on plants and fish. It shows many remarkable plants and fish, many of which are not even normally commercialised. Great for the terminally curious and those whose imagination runs ahead of their tanks' possibilities.

In essence what we witness is a man who will stop at absolutely nothing (and he goes through hell - believe me) in his bid to get his daughter back. I was starting to feel the effects of his struggle myself by the end of the book.From the beachfront of Coney Island in the heart of Russian mafiya territory and on up to Yonkers The Con Man's Daughter is set in the darker, more dangerous neighborhoods of New York. This is a brooding novel with violence only a matter of eye contact with the wrong person away. Ed Dee immerses us in the dark world controlled by the Russian mafiya, visits with Italian gangsters and reminisces through an ex-cop who gladly bent the law whenever it suited him.Eddie Dunne is 54 years old, an ex-cop, a father and a grandfather. Since leaving the force he has worked a variety of jobs but the most notable was as a chauffeur for Anatoly Lukin, a Russian businessman considered by the police to be a crime lord.When Eddie Dunne witnesses the kidnapping of his daughter he can only think of one person who could be responsible. Yuri Borodenko is the powerful head of a Russian mafiya family that is taking control of the area around Coney Island in New York. He is in direct competition with Anatoly Lukin, Eddie's former boss. Could it be that Borodenko is finally repaying some kind of vendetta from the days he was involved in mafiya business?Eddie uses all of his experience as an ex-cop and his connections with the underworld to try to get a handle on where his daughter is being held. He has added motivation to find his daughter apart from the obvious fact that she's his daughter and he loves her very much, and that motivation comes in the form of his six year old grad-daughter Grace. He must be ever mindful that the Russians could just as readily snatch Grace as they did Kate.When the days pass and no ransom demand or contact of any kind comes from the kidnappers, Eddie is forced to the conclusion that the kidnapping must be some sort of revenge against him for something he had done in the past. Important busts he made as a cop, criminals he once associated with, any number of things could be used as motivation against him. But which one is it? And how can he find out the answer?Rather than the more expected feeling of desperation that would normally be typical of a kidnapping case the pace of The Con Man's Daughter is more like the slow pacing of a caged tiger, filled with pent up energy and rage. His movements are controlled but rather than wait for instructions from the police or the FBI, he's just going to go ahead and solve this one on his own...in his own way.As Eddie gradually homes in on his daughter's captors you can sense that that energy that has slowly been leaking out is about to be unleashed in a terrible fury. Indeed, there is nothing subtle about Eddie's methods right from the start. He is not a believer in reasoning with someone when intimidation can be used just as effectively, or if that doesn't work then bribery may be used. Of course, he is not afraid to skip straight to the old \\"beat the information out of them\\" method.Ed Dee has mixed the dangerous world of the organized criminal with the close-knit law abiding family displaying a stark contrast between good and evil. But then he blurs that line through the persona of Eddie Dunne and the ramifications of his past that come back to haunt him. It's up to us to decide whether Eddie is a guilty man or a victim."},{"Title":"The Con Man's Daughter","review":"Dee, a retired NYPD Organized Crime lieutenant, sets aside his series cops, Anthony Ryan and Joe Gregory (\\"14 Peck Slip,\\" \\"Nightbird\\"), to deliver a taut, intense thriller featuring ex-cop, ex-boxer, ex-Russian mob courier, ex-drinker, and ex-brawler Eddie Dunne.\\"The sins of Eddie Dunne's past returned on a cold morning in April, more than four years after he'd turned his life around.\\" For those sins, someone snatches Eddie's daughter, Kate, while he's walking the delight of his life, his granddaughter, Grace, to school. Eddie knows it's got to have some connection to the Russian mob, but what?Not one to hang around thinking (a character trait that usually, but not always, works for him), he goes after his old Russian boss, who points him to the new boss, Borodenko. Eddie firebombs the man's car to get his attention and that night someone slings Eddie's crooked ex-partner's severed head at his front door.The feds jump into the mix, looking to trade for Russian mob secrets. Eddie will take any help he can get, but knows he's mostly on his own. Dee's Russians are truly, badly scary and the tangled plot material - Russian medicare fraud, gas tax schemes, car smuggling, money laundering and murder; FBI wiretaps and deals; crooked cops, and Italian mafiosi rip offs - feels as authentic as it is fascinating.But the engine powering this story is Eddie. Relentless Eddie proves unstoppable. Even he doesn't know what he might do next. With his keen intelligence, and deep, but not self-pitying, regrets, this fearless implacability makes him a rivetting protagonist.From Coney Island to the Dunne family Irish bar in Yonkers, Dee knows the sociopaths, con-artists, grimmer corners and old neighborhoods of New York. His characters, from 6-year-old Grace to the incomprehensible ruthless Russians, live and breathe on the page. A terrific read."},{"Title":"The Con Man's Daughter","review":"Ed Dee knows the cops and the crooks and the reader benefits.

To earn spending money, Eddie worked as a courier for Russian gangster Anatoly Lukin, which gave him insight into mob secrets that still remain genuine though he has been retired for a few years.Eddie's past resurfaces when someone kidnaps his mid thirties daughter Kate with no obvious motive for the snatch. Eddie believes the abduction is linked to his days working for the Brighton Beach Russian mob with indications that Lukin's rival crime lord Yuri Borodenko is responsible. Eddie reacts in his brawl like manner by firebombing Borodenko's Rolls Royce. Borodenko also prefers fists and bullets first and leaves the severed head of Paulie as a present by Eddie's front door. The battle between these two violent individuals has not quite turned nasty yet, but wait the novel is just beginning.Fans of gritty realistic violence or just Crime 101 will appreciate Ed Dee's wild tour of New York City where more than a tree grows in Brooklyn. The personal war between the antihero and the thug keeps getting hotter as each one ups the ante and the action. Insider criminal information is also handled for those readers who desire a discourse on a variety of sundry criminal activities (not sure of the social message that provides) which adds to the dark, dirty and seamier side of life on the mean streets of Mr. Dee's New York.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Con Man's Daughter","review":"I heard the retired NYC policeman and now novelist Ed Dee speak on a crime fiction panel and chatted with him briefly afterward. I worked my way through his first four books and found them all well-written, well-paced, gritty, and intriguing. They were a series featuring the same protagonist. THE CON MAN'S DAUGHTER, a standalone, is also up to par. Mr. Dee follows in the rich, vibrant ex-cop/writer tradition of Dorothy Uhnak who blurbed his first books."},{"Title":"The Con Man's Daughter","review":"Ed Dee is smokin' hot with The Con Man's Daughter.
