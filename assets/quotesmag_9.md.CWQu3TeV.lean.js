Tolkien creates one of the best. The land of Middle earth is filled with many creatures and settings. This story is centered around Bilbo Baggins, a simple living hobbit with a big appetite (sort of like a modern couch potato). One day he is visited by his friend Gandalf, the wizard. Gandalf brings an interesting twist to Bilbo's life: thirteen dwarves on a mission.Bilbo decides to join them on their quest as their \\"burglar\\". Thorin Oakenshield is the leading dwarf. He has strong doubts about Bilbo being a real burglar, but sucks it up and lets him come. Once they set out on their adventure complications start: Bilbo complains about the lack of food (considering hobbits usually eat six meals a day) and Gandalf's random comings and goings don't help either.Somewhere along the way Bilbo gets stuck in a cave...alone (very different than being home alone). As he tries to find his way out he finds a gold ring. He picks it up, being the burglar he is. He keeps venturing through the dark, damp cave. He comes upon a murky lake. This lake is inhabited by an-uh-a...thing named Gollum. Gollum, with his extreme split personality called Sm&eacute;agol, have a game of riddles (lame!). If Bilbo wins Gollum and Sm&eacute;agol will show him the way out. Bilbo is shown his way.\\"Adventure filled\\" doesn't cut the chase when describing this story. The action, complications, and escapes keep you reading. The songs may take up time, but they play an important part to the plot. Tolkien really keeps you on your toes.The Hobbit is the perfect beginning to the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. We learn to take opportunities and feed our since of adventure. Give poor Bilbo a chance: learn how it all began."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"still reading it...have it on my phone which is great because I can read a little at a time whenever I have time, wherever I am"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love the imagery Tokien sets up in this prequel to the LOTR series.

I downloaded this book on my Kindle for Mac because I hate having hard copies. They get damaged over time, are sometimes too bulky for my wrists to read for an extended period of time, etc. I did hesitate at first because I was not sure if the maps would be included in this digital version, but after downloading a sample, my question was answered. The digital version comes with all the maps and writings. Most importantly, the table of contents is pretty thorough that I could jump between chapters or go back to check the maps. The only problem with the Mac version is that I could not listen to the audio of Tolkien singing and narrating the chapters... That was a huge disappointment. I bought this particular version because of the promise of audio contents from Tolkien himself. Oh well, it was still less than $7.

I had always wanted to read the series, but just never found the time to do so. This announcement came as a wonderful way to get me to start it though, and I have to say that once I started reading, I just could not put the book down.I like a decent story just as much as anyone else, but this one had me positively hooked! I read this book, just as I later read &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and was constantly finding myself gritting my teeth, correcting my posture, and feeling my heart beat faster and faster and faster. There is just no way to accurately describe just how gripping this book really is. The only thing that could have brought me any closer to the story was actually being there and witnessing these things happen firsthand, for through much of the book, that is how I felt anyway.Traditionally, I have found my niche within the realm of contemporary fiction, but this may lead me away from that path. If you are not one who likes books about fantasy, magic, or even science fiction, you probably aren't here to read this review anyway. But if for some reason you are here reading this review and you still don't like those things, have no fear. Tolkien's mastery of detail in this truly dramatic and suspensful precursor to the Lord of the Rings trilogy will keep you on the edge of your seat.Further, if you enjoy this book, let me just add that the Lord of the Rings trilogy itself offers ten times as much excitement as is packed into &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; It is without a doubt, a book that should not be missed by anyone!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"[...]There are enough adjatives already said on the book (maybe I'll write a full review of it later) but for now lets talk about the comic (or as it is refered to the paperback version, click the link below, you'll like what you see.)It's a collection of three part comic book adaption of The Hobbit put out in three issues back in 1989. I considered it the best comic book adaption of anything I ever read and the passing of a decade, and a new cover for the trade paperback has done nothing to change my opinion.It should be said up front that 134 pages are just not enough to give the entire book its due. If you want the actual novel then read it. This is a comic book, it is a GREAT comic book and on my list of best ever, but it is a comic book.That doesn't mean avoid this this is a great adaption. The artwork is supurb, colorful, and \\"takes\\" you into the story quickly. David Wenzel does his job well. When I think of the characters in my mind. The faces I see are these drawings. And I've seen every cartoon adaption and the movie. He also did some very nice prints from this book.Charles Dixon adapts the story well. This was version I read to my children when they were six and eight and it was kept by my youngest son near his bed for easy access over the last two years.This will definately get your brood especially the younger members of it into the story and into reading as a consequence.A great addition to any person's collection of Hobbit or Tolklen stuff. Buy it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien is a book meant for those who have an imagination, or those who whish to enter the world of dragons, magic, treasure, goblins, gloomy figures, but most of all adventure.I thought a big reason that the book is great is that it's so great, is that its so vivid it feels like you are in the book, that you are seeing the characters right there, facing danger. The whole story of going to take back what is theirs even though they must face impossible odds, they themselves spoke that they wouldn't make it, the book is also written in some old English to make the characters seem older and mature. Though the book does a good job in letting one know what the characters are thinking and feeling, one cannot get a good grasp of what the characters are like. I believe the book lacks in this, because the characters are in such extreme emotional and physical conditions. I liked the message of I got from the book which was the underdog taking a stand, and not going out without a fight no matter the odds.This book makes you feel what the characters are because like I said it feels like you are right there in the middle of it all. It also does a good job of guessing you do not know whether something is going to pop out or where the must go next. It left me impressed with the way it was written; the vividness of the book is something one must read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien was an excellent book. I really like all imagination and creativity the author put into it. It is a book about a creature called a hobbit. The hobbit is named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo goes on an adventure with some elves to reclaim a stolen treasure. They must retrieve the treasure from the dragon namd Smaug who gaurds it. Along the way there are many adventures and exciting things the travelers encounter.This book is for young teens to young adults. It has a good theme that kids can relate to. Bilbo is different than everyone else and he doesn't think he is much of an adventuror or hero. In the end though he realizes that even though he may be small an different he can use those things to his advantage. All he needs is to believe he can do it and then he can. Kids can relate to that and realize that if they believe in themselves they can achieve anything.This book stirred many self motivating emotions. It made me feel courageous. If there was something I needed to do and I was scared of it, I should just be brave and face it. I'm sure it would make many younger kids feel the same way.I thought this book was a very interesting book. Some parts were less interesting and exciting than others but there were really exciting moments which made up for the dull ones. I would definetly recommend reading this book if you are looking for some action and adventure. I would also recommend it if you are looking for a book with a good plot, lots of fantasy, and a good message in it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The prologue to Lord of the Rings was an excellant novel filled w/ all the elements that a true fantasy reader loves and respects: magic, sword-play, dragons, treasure, and a variety of different characters ranging from hobbits and dwarves to orcs and goblins. However it takes a while for the book to actually pull you into it and become genuinely hooked. If you really enjoyed this novel then you should definately finish out the story w/ The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the remainder books on Middle-Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As a child, reading this book was a true pleasure.I can vividly recall the simple pleasures of Bilbo's life, how he liked his food and warmth. I can see even now how his world got turned upside down and what amazing adventures awaited him. He was the quintessential reluctant hero, who delivered grandly in the darkest hours. What an amazing story!What really tickled me later was to realize all the minor ways and passages that Tolkien created in this masterpiece were but gates that lead to entire worlds. Each of those little plot offshoots would yield millenia of history, entire sagas, in the later books.Back then who would have known, least of all I, how far and wide the world was. I don't think Tolkien himself knew, and the biographer's may agree with me.The Hobbit is forever enshrined as a classic children's book, but to me it carries a greater significance. It is essential reading to be weaned into the stupendous world Tolkien created, to journey through the agonies and bliss of The Lord of the Rings, and finally to flood the senses and overload the emotions in Silmarillion.But to begin the voyage, one must read the Hobbit.To not complete the voyage, one must forever wonder, to what depths and heights of genius did Tolkien's mind travel?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is about a band of dwarves, a wizard, and a hobbit. A hobbit is a creature that is half the size of a man, and grows leather soles on it's feet. The band wanders to the Lone Mountian, where an evil dragon resides. On the way the hobbit, Bilbo, finds the Ring of Power, which allows him to turn invisable. When they get to the dragon's lair, Bilbo leads the dragon to a city and an archer slays the dragon. The Hobbit is a true action/fantasy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read the Hobbit. It was an uplifting tale and I recommend this book for children, teenagers, and adults. It is a fun book to read and I also recomend that you continue reading it into the three part series. Lord of the Rings-The fellowship of the Ring(part one),The two towers(part two), and the Return of the King(part three). Each book is tied to one another in a continuous plot. These 3 books are page turners as well, filled with suspense and uncertainty. The charactrs are not your typical heroes also. One does not know what to expectfrom each, yet you undersand their own unique personalities. They are very human in nature, even the wise Gandalf. The three part series is more complex in plot also in comparison to the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"From the first to the last page, Tolkien creates the perfect picture of Middle Earth for the mind. The reader is lead on a journey with the group and visits enchanted and cursed lands that is described like no other. This book opened the door for modern fantasy and remains the standard by which others are measured."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Written By: J.R.R. TolkienIt is a Faiytale Adventure.It is a story of Bilbo baggins, who is a hobbit. One day he finds himself in an adventure with dwarf. After his adventure he realizes he barely excapes with his life and adventures are funner than he thought.In a way this is very much like, The Call of the Wild by Jack London, because Buck and Bilbo were both taken from there home and force to go were they did not want to go; but Bilbo made it back to his home and Buck didn't.If you don't like reading try reading this.I very much like the style that Tolkien wrote this book in, because it keeps you wanting to see what is going to happen to Bilbo. On page 17, when Bilbo said, &quot;Good morning&quot;. Gandalf asked him what he meant by the phrase &quot;good morning&quot;. Tolkien makes you think about what the characters say and do. If you have never been on an adventure yourself, you should try going with a Hobbit named Bilbo. Even though Tolkien is a great writer, there are some drawbacks to his style.

But its just the way the narrator and characters speak confused me whole time. It deserves stars for just being an ok book, but I would never read this of my own will."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Even with the understanding that 'The Hobbit' is a children's book (despite the views of those who want to lump everything Tolkien ever wrote into a single 'fantasy' category), 'The Hobbit's main problem is that it just isn't very exciting.There is certainly a lot of potential,but the story moves much too slowly, and seems twice as long as it actually is! There were some mildly entertaining scenes early on, but the endless descriptions of rather mundane activities(such as the dwarves' past, present, and future mealtime activities, and the various kitchen utensils they used)took up too much space! After a while, even the exciting parts of the journey began to blend together, and it all got very monotonous by the end.Even as children's literature, it's not very compelling. Maybe I'm just biased, since I'm not a big fan of this type of fantasy literature, and prefer having at least one 'Earth human' character along. Tolkien's rambling sentences, bad dwarf poetry, and the general 'smugness' of his narration (which seems to change from being a typical unseen, omniscient storyteller, to Tolkien himself making asides to his children)make 'The Hobbit' a chore to read. Where many people got sucked into the story, I just felt disconnected and boredIn fact, I didn't quite finish the book, skimming quite a bit of the middle, and not quite making it all the way through the last two chapters.I tried reading 'The Silmarillion' first, and found it too dense, then found this one to be a very simple story which the author made far too complicated because he didn't know when to embellish and when to keep it simple. I still plan on reading 'LOTR' someday, but for now, I need a break from talkin' about Tolkien!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love this book. Okay, so when I first read it at age seven i freaked, but i still love it. It's a nice little fantasy book, with a nice tidy ending that still does leave some strings hanging loose (the Ring being the most important). It's pretty simple (the plot, that is), and the adventures involved are fun to read, although the narration style occaisionally encroaches on this. It does contain fairy-tale-like characters and elements -- the dragon, the treasure, the elves (though they are not the typical fairytale elves), wizards, dwarves (who are also not-so-typical) -- but is half the adventure-quest sort of book. It's not the serious quest tale that The Lord of the Rings is, but it's certainly a necessary part of the story. Light, quick, and adventurous. A great book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit\\" is one of my favorite books ever.I think it is almost more enjoyable then LOTR because it is a little more light-hearted and such.I really like Bilbo, even if all he wants to do is be a coach potatoe.

That's kind of a shame now, because I missed getting my kids into this wonderful story earlier.Who doesn't want to go on an adventure?Okay. Most hobbits don't, but most children do.I would encourage everyone to read this book again before seeing the new movies. As visually spectacular as they are, they do deviate from the story in the book in odd and seemingly unnecessary ways.

You may wonder why I gave it a 4 instead of 5 well to tell you the truth I thought the ending definatly could have been better. The entire story is based on a quest to rid an ancient dwarve fortress from SMAUG an evil dragon well it turns out that the adventures dont kill smaug and he plays a minor part in the long run. But aside from that I recommend it to fantasy/adventure lovers alike."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Cute. This is a simple child's tale that serves as a nice springboard to the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy. It stands by itself as a nice story, yet is good enough to make you rush for the real McCoy- the next three books. The fertility of Tolkien's mind is amazing, and the places and creatures described in the Hobbit are such that it would have taken scores of other writers several lifetimes to conceive of them. Bilbo Baggins and his company are loveable characters, and my only criticism of the tale is that they seem to escape every jam they find themselves in, to the point that you stopped wondering whether or not they would make it with each new challenge that presented itself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book about 15 years ago &amp; didn't enjoy it much.

This book will fasinate people to all ages that are ready to read a long yet good book. It starts out in a small community of hobbits in a place called Bag End where Bilbo Baggins and other hobbits live. One morning while bilbo was smoking his pipe and making smoke rings, a wizard or enchanter named Gandalf came and talked to Mr. Baggins. Later that night a company of 13 dwarves arrived and had a feast in Mr. Baggins house in honor of the band they made up to go steal back some treasure from abig mean dragon named Smaug. Smaug had stollen a sacred treasure from the dwarves long ago and Thorin, the leader of the dwarves wanted to get it back. Their quest was a dangerous one, they had to battle through ravaging orcs, quick wolves, dangerous spiders, and the powerful elves. They also met some friends along the way including a giant man who could change into a giant bear. I think the ending is really spectacular, but your going to read it for yourself. I hoped i have convinced you to buy the book and if i didnt there are plenty of other reviews that are better than mine. Dont forget the other JRR Tolkien books, there also as good and interesting"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a classic tale of how a non-adventurous little hobbit turns into a legendary hero of sorts.

On thier journey, many problems arise in which Bilbo proves his worth countless times. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially thoe who love fantasy books.

Older readers and younger readers would both enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Just finished reading this to my son and it was just as good as I remember. I remember having this book read to me for the first time when I was nine by my Dad. He was a big fan of the Tolkien and felt it was time to share his love for these epic stories. I can still remember getting into bed while he sat in a metal office chair reading till I fell asleep.At the age of nine I was enthralled by this story with tales of Wizards, Goblins and Dwarves. It was all so fantastic I was transported to a different world and loved every minute of it. After this tale my Dad then read me the Lord of the rings trilogy and even though I am not a fan of Sci- Fi, I do love these stories and still get a thrill out of reading them over and over.All these years later I am a father now and wanted to share this with my son and possibly start a tradition that I hope he passes on to his children one day. My son is young and has no idea what is going on but he loves to hear my wife and I read to him. So I chose The Hobbit and she chose a different story, but I know when he is older I will reread this to him in hopes that his face lights up with wonderment and joy as mine did this time, and all those years ago."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I really enjoyed re-reading this book.

I read this book when I was 10 years old and could not put it down. The magic has returned! I wanted to read it again before I saw the movie, as I did before the Lord of the Rings, and it did not disappoint."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a fine example of an adventure novel. The entire movement of the fantasy genre in our modern day all come from this book. The story of the littlest creature in the universe making a difference, and making the other more powerful characters successful is one that resonates through all of time. The story also works well to introduce the ring into the lexicon of this universe.This story is so ubiquitous now that some see it as cliched. However, I like the book as an introduction into the fantasy genre. This book also brings into focus many of the races that become important in later areas such as dungeons and dragons. The quasi-pagan universe is one that builds as one goes through this story and also the installments of Lord of the Rings.I teach this book to Freshmen in High School English class. I think they enjoy it, and I like it as an intro into this new exciting world. Special thanks should go to Peter Jackson for making this book into a new film this year."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Great book I read in my youth and with the movie coming out soon needed to replace my missing copy. This book is perfectly compact, hardcover and written to the original text, including maps. Awesome gift for any Tolkein fan you know."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"One of the all time classics, now has a permanent place on our bookshelf for many years to come. We will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This has long been a favorite book of mine. These days, I mostly read Kindle books, but my oldest boy is about to turn 9 and he wanted to read the Hobbit before the new movies come out. We opted for a real book and I must say that this edition is exactly what I wanted. The book seems very well bound, the type set is crisp, and the jacket seems durable. It was cheap enough that I didn't mind giving it to a child knowing it might get destroyed (though he usually reads with us or has us read to him as Tolkien is a real challenge for him.) It is nice enough that he views the book as a prized possession worth caring for and keeping for years. I'm so glad I didn't cheap out and buy a trade paperback edition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I purchased this book for my infant son in hopes that it would survive until he was much older and it appears that it will. I've started reading it to him and, despite his best attempts, we have not had any ripped pages despite a thorough man handling. Beautiful presentation and artwork."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a great book. I remember reading it when I was younger but I still love it. A must for everyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"&#34;The Hobbit&#34; as a book, needs no review. It is too famous, and one of the more important works of fiction in recent decades. If you haven't read it, do so immediately.This Edition, however, is a charmer, that any true book lover will want on his shelf. Complete & unabridged, about the size of a hymnal, with a nice leatherette cover, gilded pages, and what seems to be acid-free paper, is is a joy to hold, to read from, and to look at on your shelf. If you love books, **as books**, you will prefer this adorable little volume above all others. Illustrated with pen & ink drawings by Tolkein himself, and with Tolkein's own maps as front & end pieces, I have never seen a better edition of &#34;The Hobbit&#34;.I **do wish** that the &#34;Lord Of The Rings&#34; would be issued in identically bound, complementary editions. I would snap up the set in a second, & treasure them.I **also** want to see more leatherette covered books in stores, as they are cheaper than hardcovers, and vastly nicer than paperbacks."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am not yet done reading &quot;The Hobbit&quot; but so far it is one of the best books I have ever read. To me it is one of the best books I have ever read. If you are looking for a fantasy adventure over the summer, join Bilbo Baggins and read it! This book you will not be able to put down."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The greatest book I have ever read(and I have read a lot). Tolkien gets you caught up in a book to the point where it changes the way you feel. If life is good in the book then my day is a little brighter. The only thing i have ever read that compares to the Hobbit is The Lord of the Rings by the same author. I read this entire series in two months time when I was in the Fifth Grade. If you are looking for a good book, this is one."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit,in my opinion is one of the greatest books of all time;not to mention the best fantasy.Tolkien's description of virtually everything is phenomenal.His characterization of Bilbo,Gandalf and Smaug are excellent. I started and couldn't put it down. After I finished it, I bought The Fellowship of the Ring, and went on to read the entire series.I have yet to read the Simarilion.All in all,I recomend this book to anyone who loves fantasy or just wants to read a great book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"One of the great works of childrens fiction this century, 'The Hobbit' is as fun and adventuresome to read as an adult as it was when I was a kid. Tolkien's sets his characters on a series of adventures, each more fantastic than the last, until finally reaching the thrilling climax. Dragons, wars, elves, deep forests, high mountains...all the elements are here. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This fantasy novel demonstrated an amount of description, that has not been seen in any other book I've read. I felt like I was there with Bilbo on is fantastic journey. Tolkien included all the mysticle creatures and all are fantises. A battle between good and evil with trolls, wizerds, magisc, and much, much more."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Do your self a favor, buy this book and be introduced to one of the greatest works of fiction of all time. From the man who introduced elves, Middle-Earth and so much more into the world, once you finish this you'll be hooked, and check back here to buy the Lord Of the Rings series!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have never writen an online review before but after looking at the discraseful reviews of this wonderful and magical book, I had to do it. First I must say this: If you do not like this book you are one of two things, a person who had no childhood or you have totally no imagination. The Hobbit brings curiosity and wonder to our everyday boring live, to think that there might be a world where a kind of adventure or life forse like this does exsist is something to live for. To be a child and think about fairies, goblins,magic,and wizards bring curiostiy to the mind. This book helps you get away for life to a world of wonder and wizardry and brings the joy of being a child to my heart."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you want something to get involved in ((I mean really involved in))then you should definitly read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; by J.R.R. Tolkien. He has captured a world none of us will ever see, and has brought it wonderfully to life. The on-going saga is wonderfully told in &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; the next three books dealing with Bilbo Baggins and his nephew Frodo. Read them! You'll fall in love them!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien, who invented 16 languages for &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, displays his brilliance throughout this wonderful book! Easier to read than &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a must for anyone considering reading THE trilogy. Tolkien's gift for storytelling is evident, and his imagination runs wild as he entertains generation after generation with his incredible penchant for fantasy and wonder!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"1. Lord of the Rings 1: Fellowship of the Ring 2. Lord of the Rings 2: The Two Towers 3. Lord of the Rings 3: Return of the King 4. The Hobbit 5. Fallen Angels (Walter Dean Myers) 6. King Solomon's Mines (classic) 7. Sphere (Michael Crichton) 8. Jurassic Park (Michael Crichton) 9. Star Wars Episode 7: Heir to the Empire 10. King Arthur (classic) Tolkein is a genius. If you're in the mood to delve into a whole new world and partake in an epic adventure, I strongly recommend The Hobbit/Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read The Hobbit as a school literature group assignment. Before reading it I had never read any other books written by J.R.R Tolkien. The Hobbit story is a wonderful story about a hobbit named Bilbo and a great adventure he has. The way Tolkien made the characters was amazing and how each and everyone is different in many ways. I will definitly read the other sequels to the lord of the rings story. If you like a great fantasy adventure book this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the first book I read that was by Tolkien. I thought it was fantastic. I got it for my late birthday present from my Dad. He suggested I get this one before The Lord of the Rings. I don't suggest anyone reading this if you are under your teenage years. It is a very difficult book to read if you are young (that is why they have cliff-notes for it) So this is what I say, if you like Fantasy and you like Tolkien, buy it, if you don't like Fantasy and you think Tolkien is a terrible writer (which I do not agree with), then don't buy it. I give this five stars because it is my favorite book of all time, because I think Fantasy is great."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbits has to be the greatest prelude ever written. It is filled with non-stop action, adventure, and comedy. It book has it all."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Do you like journeys and magic? Well than The Hobbit (by J.R.R. Tolkien) is just the book for you. The Hobbit takes place in a \\"Fantasy Land\\". It starts out in a hobbit hole and leads to different places (caves, caverns, towns and other mysterious locations). In case you didn't know, a hobbit is a small creature; smaller than your average dwarf. But unlike a dwarf, hobbits don't have beards. Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit and also the main character in the book. One day Bilbo was quietly sitting alone at home, when he meets a wizard named Gandalf. There are dwarves that help them too. On their mysterious and dangerous journey they work together to vanquish Smaug, an evil dragon feared by the whole countryside. What'll happen to Bilbo, Gandalf, and the 13 dwarves when they encounter giant spiders and other creatures?The Hobbit is a great book because it talks about magic and journeys. J.R.R. Tolkien describes elves, dwarves, giant creatures, and best of all, \\"Hobbits\\"!! You should read this book because it's magical and mysterious. The author uses exquisite invisible rings. The sequel to this book might be better though. The Lord of the Rings has hobbits, giants, rings, and other journeys too. So what are you doing reading this for, go get this great book!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The story was good and interesting. I could barely put it down. The large variety of creatures from hobbits to spiders and dwarfs to goblins expanded my imagination. It was an adventure to read and reread over again. the story kept me at the edge of my seat. It was never ending action there and back again."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot, It is a book that in my opinion every fan of fantasy should read. Being the prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy it explains a lot of story elements that might otherwise be difficult to understand. This is one of my favorite books it ranks right up there with the books in the trilogy. Tolkien is a master of descriptive writing, but at times he gets almost too in depth and the story loses some of its edge and excitement hence the rating of 4. The characters are all very well developed in this book. It was this style of writing that made it much easier for the people to make the lord of the rings of movie"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I refer to the Folio Edition version of this novel.I read this book with my eight year-old son just after reading the third of the Harry Potter books (I had read 'The Hobbit' many years before). With the immanent release of the movie version of 'Lord of the Rings' following the release of 'The Philosopher's Stone' I wondered if my son was ready for 'The Lord of the Rings'. I had read 'The Lord of the Rings' several times many years ago and my memory of it was that it was a bit gruelling for a young boy to appreciate. 'The Hobbit' seemed to be a more gentle approach to the mythology of Tolkien.I was also interested in how the older book compared with Harry Potter. I have no doubt that it is much superior despite the fact that some aspects of 'The Hobbit' have dated and are a bit local in their English feel. My son was quite engrossed and had no trouble refreshing the story each evening before we set off on a new chapter.We finished reading the novel at our holiday house by the beach over the Christmas break, and this meant that our younger son was exposed to the end of the story too (he's just 5). But he appreciated the story and both boys took to weaving Middle Earth stories about the adventures of their holiday.This is a great story for sharing."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the first fantasy book that I ever read. Some will call The Hobbit a children's book, and I suppose that it could be. But, at age 23, I really enjoyed it. Each chapter has it's own plot, complete with problem and resolution, and a hook at the end to keep you turning the pages. Although Tolkien has his long-winded moments in this book, as LOR readers should be familiar with, the plot is great. I have read The Fellowship of the Ring, and I (GASP!) think that this book is better, from the standpoint of not being bored with any of it. Of course, once you read it, you'll want to find out what happens next, and the LOR series will soon follow.I highly recommend this book. It's entertaining from start to finish, and it's a great book for people young and old."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book, The Hobbit was very much enjoyed by me and my companions on our journey across the mountains. Every night we would bond together when reading this amazing book. Thank you lord for having it written."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read this book and I loved it. It is good almost from the start. I prefer it over the Narnia series prelude 'The Magicians Nephew' which I've also read. The Hobbit is better than most of the books in the Narnia series. It should be required reading, tying in adventure and fantasy and making a pretty little bow.Plus, with Houghton Mifflin, the Original Publisher, you can't go wrong. Happy Reading."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book with my mom as a kid and enjoyed the adventure. I read it again as an adult and have enjoyed it on a whole new level. Tolkien's writing style isn't for everyone so I'd recommend trying a sample first. I'd also recommend reading it before you see the movie, as I've found it difficult to get through LOTR now that I can just watch the movies."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved this book in my childhood and it was the \\"one\\" (excuse the pun!) which set me to loving fantasy. I suppose you could say this is entry level, which then leads to the more mature Lord of the Rings Trilogy - just like the Harry Potter books seemed to get more and more complex as the series went on. Anyway, it's a great first step into the fantasy genre and will immediately make you aware of the pretenders out there; In fact, annoyingly so. I now spend my time looking for something as great, but still original. This has led me to the likes ofPerdido Street Station (New Crobuzon)by China Mi&eacute;ville,13 1/2 Lives of Captain Bluebearby Walter Moers and the excellentInto The Treesby J Alastair Nash. Just knowing those names has save you hours already!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Still as good as the first timeI read it - oh so long ago, when middle earth was young"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was amazing! I would recommend everyone to read it! Defiantly a book that i would love to read again. Such a page turner :)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved reading this again years after I first picked it up. I am now reading it again to my 8 yr old. The book has adventure, drama, and humor. This classic will always be a favorite in our family."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This and Lord of the Rings have long been in my favorites of all time. Now to drop it on the Kindle gives me a chance to re-read portions almost any time I want."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I really like this book - I read it again before I went to the movie. I enjoy both. thanks"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I will admit, I was supposed to read this book in high school but I didn't read it; and now I can't understand why not. Now that I'm a bit older, instead of watching the movie to avoid reading the book I have found myself reading the book in order to fully appreciate the movie. Amazing what a little maturity and perspective can do for you :)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I watched all of the Lord Of The Rings when I was 11-13 but never really thought of actually reading the series. I missed out for sure. For those who want to see The Hobbit in theaters, or perhaps are inspired to read it after seeing part 1, I highly recommend you do so. A few differences from the book and movie but overall it stayed pretty true to the book (thus far)."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book that started it all. And a classic of fantasy.For those who have never read it, most highly recommended.If you are familiar with the Lord of the rings, the hobbit merely sets the stage. On many levels it is a happier story: it's villains not as villainous as those in the Lord of the rings: bad rather than evil. A good introduction for a young reader to the world of middle earth.I've probably now read this three or four times and each time enjoy it more."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is obviously a classic. Everything in here that seems cliche is because other people took it from Tolkien. Nevertheless, it is hard to get past how clumsy the writing can be, and how simple the plot is -- a challenge appears and is solved in a few pages, usually by luck. Fans of R.A. Salvatore or Terry Brooks or any more modern fantasy writer will probably be disappointed. There is action, but it is scant. Where this book really shines is in the description of an amazingly fleshed out world. And while the plot is simple and straightforward, it is certainly extensive. It is easy to see how Peter Jackson decided to turn it into three movies."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Beginning of one of the most clssic trilogy's ever written. Great story line. Have read this book 4 or 5 times now. Still as good as the first time. Everyone should read this."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read The Lord of the Rings trilogy almost a decade ago and recently decided to read The Hobbit. The story was engaging and fun. I was disappointed that the story did not go more in depth regarding the elves, Beorn, and the lake people. I was also expecting the men of the north mentioned in The Lord of the Rings to make an appearance. I suppose this isn't a fair expectation because The Hobbit was written first, and I only hoped for these things because I read The Lord of the Rings first."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"JRR Tolkien is the author of all authors. I balk when people compare his series to Harry Potter or dare I even mention it...Twilight. JRR Tolkien has created a masterpiece with his world that he created for the Hobbit, LOTR, Children of Hurin, The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales etc.The amount of detail and historical chronologies are absolutely amazing. The stories aren't bad either. The Hobbit is probably one of his easiest reads."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A great read from a great author. I couldn't put it down. A must own for all fantasy epic aficionados."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a small book, but it's really a beautiful edition. With a leather cover and the gold edging on the pages, this volume is a book to keep and treasure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read Tolkien's books before and love his imaginationn and his characters. Now I am reading the Lord of the Rings. Also reccommended."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien is a \\"writer among writers\\". This was such a fascinating book and a surprisingly easy read. This is a MUST read! His attention to detail quite simply puts you in the story.GREAT book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is fast paced and fun. With a vocabulary a child could understand. I read the lord of the rings first, and though I enjoyed them they were a little long winded. Not so with the adventure of Bilbo Baggins. It's an easy and fun read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Plenty of other people have commented on the comforting joy that is The Hobbit. Reading this book was like a cherished homecoming to me. I saw the movie Monday, downloaded the book on Tuesday and I've finished it on Sunday.My comments are about the Kindle edition. All in all it is not bad - it contains the line-drawing illustrations through the book, which is lovely. But the maps are disappointing. The map of the Wilderlands is at the back (fine in a paper book but awkward in a Kindle) and I completely missed Thror's map at the front - for some reason when I downloaded this book it started me out in the Author's Notes section, so I didn't see the cover, table of contents, or map until after I finished and went looking for it. Maybe this was just a glitch on my Kindle but watch out for it.Both maps, sadly, are almost impossible to read on a small Kindle (can't comment on how they'd look on a Kindle Fire etc). You can't see any of the detail and you can hardly read most of the words. It's not like you can't follow the story without the maps, but part of the joy of Tolkien is poring of his maps.I would give the book itself 5 stars, but the Kindle edition gets 4. It is one of those classic books that you really must own in good old-fashioned paper form, and I have a copy of my own at home. Only buy the Kindle edition if, like me, you're on the road when you have a hankering to read it again."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I had recently saw the movie and was intrigued to find out how the story ends so I bought the book. I'm not a big reader and have never liked paperback size 4 font books and this was def an excellent choice for me.

The main characters were believable and down to earth, yet the story itself was epic.

I reread these stories at least every 2 years, and it never ceases to capture my interest and stimulate my imagination. If you've never read it, do so now. If you've tried it once and didn't like it, give it a try again. One thing this story requires is a little patience.

Many little things fall into place that would later tell the Lord of the Rings stories. This is the first appearance of Gollum. The scene with Bilbo and Gollum always stood out the most, that and Gandalf.There really was nothing I disliked. To come up with something I would have to compare to the new movie but I am not going to get into that.

I didn&#8217;t remember much about it except that I quite enjoyed it as a young child. This time I also enjoyed reading it, but to a lesser degree.Perhaps the best thing about The Hobbit is that it sets the stage of how Bilbo Baggins came to possess the Ring of Power, relating the necessary background for The Lord of the Rings. My main issue with The Hobbit is that it was, as opposed to The Lord of the Rings, specifically written for children. The plot is very predictable and told in a fairly childish manner, and lacks the more mature style of The Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"this book gives you the background for lord of the rings..I'm still reading but cant put it down (almost burned dinner)..I highly recommend it for lovers of fantasy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was the bees knees. I couldn't put it down.I recommend this book for everyone. Can't wait to watch the movie"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien displays a magnificent tale of a little person on a big adventure. The Hobbit tells about a hobbit that goes on an adventure with many perils. A hobbit is a creature that is about three feet tall. They don't wear shoes because the bottom of their feet is leathery. The top of their feet are covered in thick hair.Bilbo Baggins is the main character in the book. He goes on an adventure with twelve dwarves and a wizard. It all started when Bilbo was sitting outside of his house enjoying some tea when an old wizard walked up to his hobbit-hole, and asked if Bilbo would like to go on an adventure. Bilbo was taken aback and said he would never want to go on adventure. Then, Bilbo abruptly got up and ran inside his house and locked the door. Bilbo then firmly told the wizard to leave. The wizard just smirked and scratched a symbol on Bilbo's newly painted green door.The next day Bilbo heard a knock at his door, when he opened it he saw a dwarf standing there. The dwarf said, \\"Dwalin at your service!\\" Bilbo was shocked. He had never seen a dwarf before. Bilbo remembered his manners when he saw the dwarf and said, \\"Sorry to keep you waiting!\\" After a while, all of the dwarf's friends showed up. They all convinced Bilbo to go on their adventure with them. So he did. Bilbo was faced with many perils on the journey and overcame all of them.Overall, the book is excellent and full of heart-stopping danger. If you like books with swords, monsters, and treasure, then this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In the only unabridged recording of the text, the reader provides an excellent voice to the masterpiece. Highly recommmended."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is probably the most underrated of all Tolkien's writings and it is not hard to see why. Hobbit is written in the style of a book for children and consequently, many people set it aside after the first few chapters. What a mistake! For Hobbit may be childlike in its writing style (in fact, children enjoy reading it tremendously) but there is nothing childish about it. On the face of it, Hobbit is the tale of an adventurous treasure hunt, sprinkled with wizards, dwarves, elves, dragons and of course hobbits. In actuality however, slotted (chronology-wise) between the Silmarillion and the Lord of the Rings (LOTR), Hobbit sets the stage for the climactic struggle with Sauron in LOTR. In fact, Gandalf in LOTR refers to the events in the Hobbit, both the finding of the Ring of Power and the destruction of Smaug. As compared to LOTR, Hobbit is a sunnier book, with hints of troubled times, yet filled with humor and adventurous optimism; hence perhaps its appeal to children too. For fans of LOTR, Hobbit is a must. It answers a lot of questions that LOTR raises about prior events. Do not get put off by its apparent lightness and you will find it rewarding. Ideally, read Silmarillion first, then Hobbit and finally LOTR. But even if (as most people) you first read LOTR, Silmarillion and Hobbit will still delight you. The Leatherette edition is particularly good with quality binding, paper and illustrations and would make a great gift."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Adventure, great plot, and likeable characters are all key factors in making &quot;The Hobbit&quot; an entertaining piece of literature. Bilbo Baggins is a character of many possibilities, he grows throughout the entire novel, from a homebody to a well-known hero. To read any of J.R.R. Tolkien's works, is an adventure within itself, for each of his books are connected. His talent for story-telling along with his creative nature have pieced together &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, a story, later followed by &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; series.This 272 page novel tells an interesting tale of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, and a journey with his dwarven friends. Bilbo knows very little of the outside world, he has lived in the same area for over 50 years. As the reader should notice as the book progresses, Mr. Baggins is taking steps. Bilbo is slowly transforming from an quiet nobody, to a humble hero.I am rating this novel a 5 out of 5, because I found nothing that I disliked. The great plot, pleasant characters, and the fascinating adventure, each play their parts and keep the reader locked."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"honestly, havent finished the book yet... im halfway done but having read half of the work, i can already say how good the book is and i have already become a big fan of tolkien, and it encouraged me to read more of his works... so rare can one see a book as good as this..."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"During the course of our English Independent Reading Project, I have read the book, The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. It is a fantasy story about a group of dwarves, Thorin Oakenshield, and Bilbo Baggins that must journey to the Lonely Mountain to reclaim the land of the dwarves. The group must be very courageous to overcome the dangers of their trip as they encounter goblins, trolls, and giant spiders. It is the teamwork and courage that finally gets them to Smaug, the great golden-red fire dragon, who is terrorizing the entire countryside.In The Hobbit, Smaug is controlling the land of the dwarves, finally the dwarves decided to take back their land and restore their homeland. They needed a little help, Gandalf had decided Bilbo Baggins was the perfect hobbit for the job, he would be the thief. Bilbo Baggins was a quiet peaceful little hobbit. All he wanted was to be left alone to his beautiful hobbit hole where he could eat lots of meals and smoke his pipe. Bilbo heard a knock on the door and before long he had thirteen dwarves and one wizard sitting at his table and eating all his food, it was then, without a choice, that Bilbo was the final man for the trip. As the journey started it seemed so simple because the great wizard, Gandalf was along. As soon as they were left to travel alone, they got themselves in a bit of trouble. They worked together to find their way and save each other from dangers. They met trolls who wanted to eat them, goblins who ate their horses and wanted them dead. Giant spiders that wrapped them up in a web so fast that only Bilbo had enough courage to fight them off. It was also Bilbo alone that had to confront the great dragon Smaug, the terror of the countryside.As expected, there is a lot of action that goes on in The Hobbit-such as when giant spiders became very angry because they could not see Bilbo, due to the ring, but could hear him making fun of them, calling the spiders \\"attercops\\". Bilbo is fearful of these spiders but he still finds the courage to sing \\"Old fat spider spinning in a tree! Old fat spider can't see me! Attercop! Attercop! Won't you stop, stop you spinning and look for me?\\" Bilbo found himself running around being chased, singing songs to get the spiders away from the dwarves, who are hanging on a limb of a tree from a web, cutting down the webs that the spiders are wrapping around the trees to trap Bilbo in, and killing these spiders all at the same time. Practically all the spiders in the place came after him: some dropped to the ground, others raced along the branches, swung from tree to tree, or cast new ropes across dark spaces. Not only that, but as soon as Bilbo had managed to cut down one of the dwarves, who at this point is very weak, the dwarf uses the rest of his strength to help get the others and stop the spiders. The Hobbit uses great detail. J.R.R. Tolkien really knew how to explain action seens so that a person could visually imagine them, probably almost to what the author wanted them to be portrayed as. Tolkien, gets you right into the story in the first chapter, introducing main characters and explaining the conflict. Tolkien starts his action off simple, with a confrontation with trolls, and ends with big action, like the big fight with Smaug. I believe that while Tolkien is wrote these fantasies, he somewhat relates the ideas of these actions to his life, real life. The Hobbit is a book that really kept my attention, so much was always happening and I didn't want to put the book away.You can see as you read this book, Tolkien wanted the courage of man to stick out, that bravery can get you very far. Don't hold back even is the fear is killing you. Work as a team and never leave anyone behind. Bringing peace and security will be your ultimate reward."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a fascinating adventure tale about wizards, elves, dwarves, dragons, and many other fantasized creatures. Burrowed inside a hill, deep within Hobbiton, lives a particularly interestesting hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Being the jolly little hobbit that he is, Bilbo enjoys his peaceful life in the Shire until he is summoned by the old wizard, Gandalf, to go on an adventure across the lands. Bilbo accepts this adventure and sets out into the unknown on a quest for gold and riches. On his quest through the land, curious young Bilbo encounters many new things that are foreign to the Shire and life as he has known it. Traveling over the lands to strange towns, treacherous mountains, and dangerous forests the hobbit gains possession of a magic ring that he uses to his advantage on this journey for fortune.This novel has been acclaimed a classic through generations for over the past 60 years. The Hobbit is an adventurous book about strange lands from long ago in a time when things were very different than they are today. The book is sometimes a little hard to follow with its elfish dialect and some tongue twisting sentences, but it is nothing a couple of read-through's can't fix. You may hit some boring drawn-out scenes, but stick with it. Once you are into the heart of the story, you will find it hard to put down. If you have a vivid imagination and an interest in fantasy, than this book will become a classic favorite of yours too."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"You can not put this book down! For there is a lot of action and a favorite wizard Gandalf. You know from the movie &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot;Well I give The Hobbit four stars out of five. My reasoning for this is because some parts get dall and you can't wait untile it is over; but then agian some parts you can not put this book down because of all the action.The Hobbit is like a spin off of the book &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; because it has Bilbo Baggins going on this crazy adventure with the dwarfs to get reveng on a dragon. On the way to persue the dragon they have absocales to face in which caves to exploer and such. Well I enjoyed The Hobbitand if you pick it up and read it am sure you will like it too."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book called\\"The Hobbit,\\" is a well written mythical adventure story filled with amazing detail, but it may not be for everyone. It is definately for people who can get deep into fantasy and like to use their imagination. It is the stunning prequel to the Lord of the Ring trilogy and an excellent book that can be used as an introduction to the world of middle earth. This is the story where it all began. Mr. Bilbo Baggins strikes out with his dwarves companions on a mission to retrieve dwarvish gold from the evil dragon Smaug. Along the way, they encounter more than their fair share of adventure, which includes Beron the Bear-Man, Gandolf, elves, trolls and even giant spiders. Not only is this book by istelf a good book, it it will also help you understand the trilogy better. It helps to explain how a simple Hobbit is transformed from a shy non adventurous person to someone who fights goblis, trolls and dragons. It also helps to explain how this shy Hobbit comes in contact with the dreaded ring of power. If you are a lover of adventure, travel, mystery and magic, I strongly suggest that you read J.R.R. Tolkien's, \\"The Hobbit\\". You can go on many great adventures, cross mountains over the lush lands of Rivendell, and the dark forest of Mirkwood. J.R.R. Tolkien creates vivid pictures that make everything seem so real. You can imagine yourself anywhere the author puts you. If you have read the Lord of the Ring series, but haven't read \\"The Hobbit\\", I would strongly recommend this book. Even if you have only seen the movies, this book will help the whole series come to life."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a Hobbit . . .\\"To explore imaginary worlds and have adventures with the inhabitants, Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\", a novel filled with the author's imagination, is the one to read. Published in the 1930s, this novel is still loved by many readers and is known throughout the world, and its sequals, which are the Lord of the Rings trilogy, are famous as well. They were read during a time before \\"Harry Potter\\".Using his love of languages and cultures, John Ronald Ruel Tolkien created a world of his own, where the cultures of imaginary/mythical creatures, such as Dwarfs, Elves and Dragons, live in. In this book, we journey through the land of Middle Earth, and there, we are introduced to Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit, or, in other words, a halfling, a little man, smaller than Dwarfs and humans and lacking a complete beard.In the land of Middle Earth, the Dwarf, Thorin Oakenshield, is determined to recover his ancestor's treaures, which now lay in the hands of the Dragon, Smaug, a fearsome and evil creature. Yet Thorin is willing to go there. So he asks help from Gandalf the Grey wizard and the other Dwarfs, who venture into forests, fields, rivers, and mountains, getting caught by trolls and any other creepy creature. But Thorin is not the hero of this story . . .During the times of trouble in the book, there comes surprise help. During times of hardship, they learn patience and persistance. And on a mission like this, there comes the MOST unexpected idea for a hero!Filled with imagination and heart warming characters, The Hobbit is novel of epic proportions, and is one that your family will enjoy! With memorable scenes, you can laugh, especially when Bilbo picks on a troll's pocket. You can fell the humor as the as he faces Smaug, the action when the Elves battle the feared dragon, and in the end, you'll have sweet dreams after bedtime. As I said before, your whole family will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I bought this wonderful fancy edition of the Hobbit because I wanted a nice edition of the classic. I am fairly confident that this is the best edition ever printed. The actual book itself (without the dust cover) is clothbound in dark green and and has the title printed in gold on the spine. There is also a gold dragon outlined in gold on the bottom of the book (a really nice touch). It is very beautiful.The jacket is very beautiful as well. The jacket has gold everywhere and the golden color seems to catch and reflect light. The front cover has a picture of Smaug lying atop his hoard (hence all the gold). The back cover has a picture of the dwarves and Bilbo leaving Gandalf at the edge of Mirkwood. Spectacular. Overall, the jacket is very beautiful and makes the book shine.The story (as you may well know) is one of the best stories ever written. It remains (and always will remain) a classic. This book reflects the enchantment of the story. The thick, glossy pages and foolproof and durable binding are a testament to the quality of the story.The watercolor illustrations are another testament to the greatness of the story. Alan Lee dose a wonderful job replicating different events in the story. Alan Lee also drew gray pencil drawings taking up about a quarter of a page (those are done very well as well).Overall, the story is one of the best ever written and this edition of the story is probably the best version ever in print. The paper, print and binding quality is as good as you can get. Alan Lee also did a very good job on all his paintings and drawings. Almost every thing about this book is beautiful."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the book that started the whole Tolken series. Re reading from many years ago, still enjoyable.

A person finishing this book will have a very strong understanding of exactly what happened in the novel. I agree with other people that this would be a great way for a 7 year old to be introduced to the story.The only thing I would want to change about it is its size. It feels just a tad too small to comfortably fit all the text and panels that it crams into each of its pages. I also feel like the color palette is a bit too bright and cheery throughout. I think the whole thing would have felt more true to the spirit of the book if the saturation levels were pulled back a bit. It might even benefit from being printed on matte paper stock. As it is, the glossy paper and bright colors just don't feel quite right."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This excellent pillar of the fantasy genre is compelling to the bone. The adventure Bilbo embarks is one to envy.

A real treat to be enjoyed by kids and adults alike."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I enjoyed this 'story in itself' - although I felt it was aimed at a different age bracket than the Silmarillion.An epic tale of Bilbo Baggin and friends in the precursur to The Lord of the Rings.The Ring of Power comes into the most innocent of hands - and the strings of destiny are pulled together.Enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read The Hobbit when I was in High School, but I doubt that I had the cognitive ability to actually appreciate Tolkien and his amazing story. The Hobbit is a classic, a true gem in literature. The Hobbit was more amazing than I ever remembered and I loved revisiting this classic story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Since there are plenty of reviews on the story of The Hobbit and I could probably never do justice to J.R.R Tolkien's literary abilities, I will keep this review to the Alan Lee hard cover illustrated edition. If you've already fallen in love with the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien and are looking for a beautifully illustrated edition of the Hobbit, then look no further. The Alan Lee illustrated edition of The Hobbit is nothing less than wonderful. Upon removing the dust cover you will find green cloth binding with a beautiful gold dragon engraved in the lower right corner, non other than Smaug himself. The pages are crisp and bright white. The illustrations, some in color and others black and white, are scattered generously throughout and intermingle beautifully with the story. The detail in these illustrations definately added to my enjoyment of this timeless classic. It is my understanding that Mr. Lee was in charge of designing and constructing the set for the motion picture Lord of the Rings and I can see why. He has captured Tolkien's world better than I would have thought possible. Tolkien created his Middle Earth at a time when other feet were planted firmly in this world, and in so doing opened us to a whole new experience. What a wonderful joining of talents. Who could ask for more?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you are going to shell out heavy coin for a hardcover edition of this wonderful book I recommend you go with the version illustrated by Alan Lee. It is a beautiful book with wonderful illustrations and very readable print (no 7 pt grainy characters smeared across porous paper will be found here).As to content, little can be said that has not already been said. Be aware that much of the charm of The Hobbit is derived from the cheerful homeliness of hobbits. They sing songs, smoke pipes and tell stories. They are hardly candidates for action-adventure heroes, but when duty calls they rally to the challenge.So if your reading palate leans toward episodic Harry Potter tales where each chapter calls the characters to brave the gaping maw of death, or Steven King-esque cliff-hanger chapter endings that propel the reader into the next daring adventure, then this book will put a little needed variety into your diet. It contains action and adventure, but these things are tempered by a comfortable quietude.So give it a shot and I think you will find the slower parts of the book are as, if not more, enjoyable than those more adventurous portions."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a tale of gold, dragon, Elves and the wonder of it all. After reading the book for the third time, I must say it is still enjoyable. The book serves as a stand-alone novel or as a prelude to, &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; (LOTR)Tolkien crafts an interesting world peopled with Dwarves, Hobbits, Men, Elves and others. The Hobbits are a race of comfort-loving people about 2-4 feet in height. If there is one thing they like it is peace, quiet and good food. Adventure and travel to far-off places is something they would really rather avoid if they can.Bilbo Baggins is one such Hobbit and he had lived 50 years in good comfort and does not wish to change that. Then, Gandalf (a wizard) arrives and invites him on an adventure with a company of Dwarves. Bilbo is initially fearful and dismissive of the whole affair and then gradually become a leader of sorts of the company.The style is easy to follow and the story is straightforward with some twists. Of the two books, I must state my preference for LOTR. The complexity of the world in which the novels are placed (Middle-Earth) that is merely hinted at in, \\"The Hobbit,\\" is much more developed in LOTR.The book is good in the old-fashioned sense of good story telling; there are no political agendas here but rather simply courage and the virtues of old. It is refreshing to read a book of battle, heroism, good and evil in our times of moral confusion and weakness. \\"The Hobbit,\\" is good for children and adults; adults will probably appreciate LOTR more though."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is J.R.R. Toliken's book about a young hobbit whose name is Bilbo, goes on an exciting adventure that raises his love for exploration and adventure. Bilbo is someone who hates adventure and trips. He never has liked any excitement in his life other than peace and tranquility. He is also a perfectionist and never likes a mess. But deep down inside of him, he has an uncovered facet that is awakened when he goes on an exciting adventure that will completely change his life.Bilbo unexpectedly ecounters twelve dwarves that are embarking on a journey to reclaim their lost treasure from the evil dragon Smog, who lives in the Desolation of Smog on the other side of the land. On his journey Bilbo encounters dangerous goblins, elves, giants, and demons. He also encouners friendly bears and eagles that help him and his dwarf friends along the way. Use your imagination to solve riddles and find out what will happen next in the suspenseful story like Bilbo and his friends did. To find out more about this book, I suggest you read it.There are many mysterious characters in this wonderful story. Such characters are Gollum who is a scary fish monster who lives in a secluded cave in the mountain of the evil goblins. Gollum is always hungry and wants to eat Bilbo at first sight. But to save his skin, Bilbo pleads for his life and must answer five challenging riddles. With much luck and brain power, Bilbo solves them and makes a great escape from Gollum and from the dangerous goblins.I also would like to recommend this book to anyone who likes to read. It is full of suspense and adventure. It is fun and interesting and full magic. You won't want to put the book down until you read your quota of the day."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read The Hobbit many years ago, but now, reading it to my eight-year-old daughter, I've realized what a fine piece of literature this is. Unlike the Lord of the Rings trilogy (which are darker and more complicated), The Hobbit is suitable for most children of elementary school age (I'd say third grade and up, generally). While there is danger and adventure (and some very unsavory characters), there is not much violence or bloodshed. We have enjoyed the beautifully illustrated (by Michael Hague),large, softcover edition, published by Houghton Mifflin. If you can find this edition, buy it --- with the caveat that a couple of the illustrations are a bit scary, at least to younger siblings!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"How could I possibly fit every glorious thing there is about this series of books into 1000 words? Tolkien is a genius and there is no way to deny that. He has managed to create an entirely different world, every tree, every creature, every nuance of language, every folktale; everything is on these pages that might possibly exist in middle earth. That I believe is Tolkien's true genius, his ability to construct this world in his head and to let us visit it, completely and fully for four glorious books. However, maybe that is not the extent of his genius. Maybe not because Tolkien also tells a ripping good tale throughout these novels. The prelude with Bilbo being swept up by a band of dwarves and being sent against his will to battle a dragon takes about a night to read, despite the fact that it covers over 300 pages. And then you start the true trilogy, and the ring that Bilbo finds which seemed like a neat little trick in The Hobbit (it grants the wearer the benefit of invisibility) this ring is suddenly so much more than a very handy parlor trick. It is THE ring; crafted ages ago in elven halls with unspeakable power and unfightable draw. Men kill for it, dwarves kill for it, everyone would kill for it and suddenly you are swept off on another adventure with another unsuspecting hobbit that covers all of middle earth and includes the fate of the world...all over this little unassuming ring that must be destroyed. The journey you take in these books will not easily be forgotten, here I am getting chills thinking about the epic battles between good and evil that spring up like weeds around the path of this little ring and Frodo, the hobbit who is charged with destroying it. These books are just wonderous, I cannot say that enough."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book changed my life. I have only read two books in life, Jurassic Park, and Eyes of the Dragon. It took me a year to finish each of them and I didn't like either of them. Then one day, I was doing some web surfing at Apple Computer's QuickTime web site and saw a banner for The Lord of the Rings movie preview. I clicked it and saw the preview. When it ended, the only word that came to my mind was awesome. I then thought, &quot;Well if they are spending all this time and money on bring J.R.R. Tolkien's story to life, then hell the least I can do is read the books!&quot; I then picked up my brother's copy of The Hobbit (he has been reading The Lord of the Rings and the works of Tolkien for a year and half).I read the whole book in just two weeks! I couldn't put it down. One night I was having a hard time sleeping, so I got up at three in morning just to read The Hobbit. This was the first book I have ever enjoyed reading.Once I have kids and when they are old enough, I will read them The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Our 4th Grade thinks that this is one of those books that you should NOT go through life without either hearing or reading. We are doing both and we LOVE this story!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read this book last year when I was 12 and since then I've read it over 5 time's, This book takes you every where imaginible, from huge mountains filled with evil Goblins to huge woods filled with giant spiders to A battle with a Dragon, all the time following the story of a hobbit swept into an adventure he was not ready for with a wizard and 13 dwarfs. Beautifly done. Highly recommended for everybody. A Beautifull work of Litreature."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first had this story read to me by the school librarian when I was five (do librarians still read to classes, or is that too passe now?). It haunted me for years but I couldn't remember the title of the book. I finally found a copy by accident at another library and was hooked.I recommend reading this book to your children for bedtime (along with Wind in the Willows and Alice in Wonderland). Just don't lose your copy before they get to read it for themselves!Keep the magic alive."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a really exciting tale of a little hobbit and the huge adventure he goes through. I read that one of the reasons J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the book was for his own children to enjoy, but the intended audience of this book could be anywhere from 13 up to adults, as I know a 30 year old who claims to have read it 5 times and as recently as last year. Because of how well the book was written and the great characters, this is a great book for someone of any age to read.The only background information you need to know about this book is that it is a prequel to the Lord of The Rings series. I do not have many criterions to judge this book as it is the first one I have ever read from cover to cover. To summarize the book, Bilbo is convinced to go with a large pack of Dwarves as a thief to help them get their mountain back from an evil dragon called Smaug. Along the way they run into trolls, elves, spiders, goblins, eagles, and participate in a huge battle.I really enjoyed all of the books key elements. The plot really worked well for someone my age, it had a great reward at the end of all their hard work, and it had some amazing characters like Bilbo, Gandalf, and Thorin. It had sad parts too at the end where a main character learned a good life lesson. Knowing that this book was wrote before the Lord of The Rings I think it sets up that book really well. It already lets you meet a few of the main characters and makes you interested to see what happens to Bilbo and his ring. I haven't read any other books like this so it makes it hard to compare to books like it, but I know that I would be interested in reading more books like it if there any.The great characters and the adventure in this book really have made it an enjoyment to read. From the very beginning of being introduced to Bilbo and all his adventures with trying to escape being eaten by trolls, trying to get out of a goblin cave, being chased by wolves and spiders, and helping the dwarves escape from an Elvish prison along with trying to defeat a dragon and survive a war I really had a great time reading it. While I expected this project to be no fun at all, the book was so great it has made this little project turn into its own huge adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I enjoyed reading this book to my three sons and they in turn wanted their children to enjoy the same book.That's why I searched for this book long out of print."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the second time I've read The Hobbit.

It's one of his favorites and since the movie should be coming out soon, he wanted to read the book again before he saw the movie. Thanks!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was just about the most fun reading experience I have ever had. I'm not sure whether the effect stemmed from the great quality of the book or from my particular developmental stage when I read it. Probably a bit of both. It's really just the simple story of a bourgeosis everyman who is thrown into a world of dragons, goblins, wizards, and dwarves and is forced to discover the greatness within himself. The plot arch might be that of Beowulf, substituting a typical well-to-do Englishman for the mighty thewed hero of the legend. The splendor is in Tolkien's wizardly story-telling and poetic vision. The story is worked to a minute perfection on every single page, every single sentence, even. Each chapter is punctuated with songs, or poems, making the Hobbit a true prose romance, in the tradition of the earlier great fantasists, such as William Morris, Lewis Carrol, Kipling, or ER Eddison. And every song is good.The Hobbit evokes a sense of nostalgia in this particular reader, a nostalgia for a lost pre modern world of primordial Northern England and Europe. As CS Lewis wrote somewhere, no other writer is able to capture the feel of Norse mythology, its symbols and moods, and weave them into a story the way Tolkien does. Tolkien employs his own private mythology, later published as the Silmarillion, to give the setting a sense of historical depth. For example, at one point the heroes find swords \\"forged duing the goblin wars of Gondolin,\\" foreshadowing a subsequent encounter with goblins. Each encounter brims with invention and unique imagination seldom found in any other author, but at the same time invoking an homage to the other great heroic stories of the world. The eyrie of the giant eagles recalls the story of Sinbad in the rocs' nest. The riddle game with Golum, one of the most inventive scenes in any story, reminds one of the Sphinx from Greek mythology. And each riddle is brilliant.All Tolkien's works are incomparable, but the Hobbit is his greatest, I think, mainly for its simplicity. It lacks the Manichean overblownness of the Lord of the Rings or the Silmarillion. Here is not a cataclysmic war between absolute good and absolute evil, but a simple quest to get some loot from a dragon. The story is thusly more like real life, and closer to primeval mythologies of Europe in that there is no Zoroastrian conception of good and evil.The Hobbit has some real life relevance too, I suspect. I think there is a message in the Hobbit, about a cataclysmic world event, but to recognize it requires one to have an encompassing understanding of twentieth century history, a familiarity with Tolkien's own life (i.e. a sense of when the book was written), and penetrating awareness of the tropes of the fantasy genre. The story sort of picks up the thread started in the Worm Ouroboros, as pertaining to the allegory behind Gro and the ambassador. I've always wondered if any one else can answer the riddle of the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This really is a coffee table treasure. For reading convenience get a lightweight paperback, but for incredible, lush, artwork meshed perfectly with the text look no further."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is always a refreshing read for me, as Tolkien uses a simpler style of writing than he uses in the Silmarillion or in the Lord of the Rings. But even though the prose may be simpler, the underlying tale scratches the surface of Middle Earth, evoking many deep themes that are later unveiled in the later books.I like the Hobbit for its simplicity and its depth, and the beautiful illustrations by Alan Lee complement this edition handsomely."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It was the best book that I have read in ages. It talks about this hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. You see Hobbits hated adventures, so when the famous wizard Gandalf the Grey came by, the Bilbo was wary. When he found out that he was to go on an adventure, he practicully broke down. Then, 13 dwarves came to his house. All ready to go off to the land of their ancestors. Led by their leader Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror King under the Mountain. They started on a march to go and kill the great dragon, Smaug. Smaug had stole their treasure a long time ago and they had gone off to go kill Smaug and get back the rightful treasure. THis story was sad, humourous, and very real indeed. The author is a genius writer. I just wish that he had wrote what happened after all that happened. I recommend this book to all people."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"if you like fantasy you will love,love,love this book! if you like trolls,elves, hobbits,or anything you will love it.if you like such great pc games such as everquset, baliders gate all the races will be their.A must read! what are ya waiting for. go buy it now!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In every person's life there comes a time when they make the jump from children's books to real literature. It has been my experience that this jump is often caused by one book in particular. In my case this book was the Hobbit. It was fifth grade when I was first introduced to the Hobbit by my teacher who read the book to us in class. I was fascinated by the story and have read the story on my own at least five times as well as the subsequent trilogy. The Hobbit accomplishes something few books can. It draws into an entirely different world, full of advenure, magic,and wonder. The characters are so believable and authentic that we treat them as if they really exist and we are just reading accounts of there deeds as if the book were a newspaper. This world is also an improvement on our own in that this world has clear cut heroes and villains and the issues it addresses are not muddled, but are presented in black and white. The world of the Hobbit gives the reader a much nedded break from the real world and it's problems. It is a joy to read and an experience that I will treasure all the rest of my days."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This great fantasy is about one hobbit's journeys and adventures into the unknown.

I was suprised at how well the story was rounded, even though it had been translated into a cartoon. I had no idea, however, that the real magic of the story is told in the pages of Tolkien's masterpiece. When it was first published in 1937, the publisher and Tolkien had no idea that it would blossom and grow as it has (few authors think that their books will do as well as Tolkien's, and can only hope for the high mark which Mr. Tolkien has achieved.) Now, 62 years later, we find that it is perhaps THE most beloved book of the century.The well rounded plot and interesting, dynamic characters make &quot;The Hobbit&quot; the finist book in it's genre. Many other authors have tried to emulate Tolkien's masterful performance, but have all fallen utterly short of the high mark which Tolkien sites at. In my book, J.R.R. Tolkien will be one of the greatest authors in fantasy, and his wonderful and enchanting works will never lose their literary quality or magic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was one of the best books I've ever read.

It was the gateway to the likes of Donaldson, Eddings, Kerr, Feist and many others the sort of stuff which I specifically look for when I want to read something relaxing. Tolkien has managed to transport the reader to a completely different world populated with absolutely delightful characters. I have read it countless times in countless situations, in an airliner crossing the Atlantic, in the centre of Picadilly Square, on a bus, on the underground, in bed, by the campfire, during examination time, wether I'm exhausted or bristling with energy... this is stuff that anyone can enjoy at any time and in any surroundings or situation. This sort of literature is a good lesson for all of us to stop taking ourselves and our petty concerns too seriously. It teaches us to be children once again and to experience joy at simple things. Everyone should read it at least once, especially adults !"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"From the songs of the Hobbits, Dwarves, and Elves, to the evil poetry of Smaug, the Hobbit can catch you singing the songs before you know it.

Written for children, it is a wonderful piece of magical fiction that was loved by children and adults alike from the 1930s onwards. When Tolkien eventually wrote the more mature \\"Lord of the Rings\\" story, he went back and changed some parts of the Hobbit to tie in more closely with that story - and it was this revised version that I read.But this book works well on its own. Despite being written a long time ago now, it still reads well. It is exciting, hugely imaginative and with nearly all the classic story elements that make a good tale.Hobbits are a people who keep themselves to themselves, so a company of dwarves are confused as to why the wizard, Gandalf, chooses one Bilbo Baggins to be the company \\"burglar\\" in their quest to find and defeat the dragon Smaug. But before long Bilbo proves his worth.The final part of the book is amusing. I won't detail it to avoid spoilers - but it wraps up the grand adventure very nicely.The Hobbit is Tolkien's most accessible work. Many people skip it and go straight to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", but I think this is a mistake.

While The Hobbit obviously doesn't go as far in depth into the history of Middle-Earth as Lord of the Rings does, in many ways The Hobbit's simplicity is its charm. The book is quite simply the quintessential adventure tale. I love how the book begins quickly and follows with a series of short, ordered adventures. Tolkien handles the character of Bilbo brilliantly allowing him to become more adventurous, but also making sure that he doesn't lose his Hobbit roots. Best of all, Tolkien throws in a few twists that make the Hobbit far more interesting than most fantasy stories. The trouble doesn't end with the slaying of the dragon (for those few who haven't read the book yet, I won't spoil it). For readers wanting more than an adventure story, Tolkien also weaves a compelling commentary on the power of greed and the nature of adventures. No wonder this has become a classic.

As great as these books are, I believe that Tolkien's works rise far above.The Hobbit is a lighter adventure story, suitable for children, though even adults will find it a superb story. Tolkien's words paint a vivid picture of Middle Earth - of its beauty and its darkness. He does such an excellent job of portraying the characters that by the end of the book, you would be able to predict how any of them would react in a given situation. I believe that this is a book which would appeal even to people who think of fantasy literature as wierd and far-fetched. After you have read the Hobbit, which everyone capable of breathing should be required to do, run out and get Lord of the Rings and read it. This is a continuation of the story began by The Hobbit, and is a much darker tale. In L.O.T.R. we catch a glimpse of the deep and rich history of Middle Earth and its people. If you have not read any of these, then, by all means, stop what you're doing, order these books, shut yourself in a room, and don't come out until you've finished. You will be a better person because of it.Are you still reading this!? Weren't you listening? GO GET THESE BOOKS AND READ THEM NOW!!! You're only hurting yourself by delaying it, you know!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Okay, I think this is the 2nd best book in history! (The best being the lord of the rings). This thing says that you can read the lord of the rings without reading this. Untrue. The person who wrote that is a ben sova. I saw the cartoon movie at 6, and read the book all in 1 day when I was 7. Unbeliviable? I learned to read at the age of 2! The book was so good, I coulnd't stop reading. The book was rather short, compared to my lastest reading at that time: Ivanhoe! 556 pages! Rather good book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was perhaps the best book of all time second only to his other works. Tolkien is an absolute genius. His books take you to a far better and more exciting world you will never want to leave!! ANYONE WHO RATES THIS BOOK UNDER A TEN PLUS IS AN ABSOLUTE IDIOT!!!! tHEY DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT!!!!! IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS BOOK YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT LITERATURE AND WRITING!!! THREE CHEERS FOR TOLKIEN AND MIDDLE EARTH.!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I thought that The Hobbit was an excellent book. Although some people might think it is hard to read because of the older-fashioned writing, it was an excellent story. It had a great plot, and it seemed to me that a new surprise awaited you at every turn of the page. I thought the ending was sad, but, all in all, it is a must-read book, especially for younger adults,like teenagers."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"the Hobbit is a excellent book. If you like science fiction books you will like this book. This book is like a text version of Dungeons and Dragons."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first picked this book up at the school library. Later that day I started reading it in class, and found it extremely interesting.I liked the way J.R.R. Tolkien writes. He doesn't just simply tell the tale, he describes it and makes you feel like you are part of it. I felt like Bilbo Baggins from the beginning to the end, and even pretended I was there, solving the riddle(which I did try to do), talking to the dragon, and even climbing the mountains.I've often heard good reports and bad reports of this book. When I found it in the library, I thought what I thought every time I see a book I've heard of, &quot;Well, I'll give it a try.&quot; And through thinking that, I've probably read as many wonderful books as simply terrifying and horrid books. Through that also, I have found out what makes a book good, and what makes a book uninteresting to the reader...Since then, I've also noticed an improvement in my own books and novels. With every good author and good book I am encouraged more to write, since I suddenly pick up another technique of writing. Tolkien has taught me the most, and I never will forget that. All I hear is, &quot;Oh, I read that book when I was ten. It was okay.&quot; I am rather disappointed that was all they to say about a masterpiece of a book. I could encourage so greatly anyone to read and think about what they read here in this book, if they have read it yet. Above all the different types of books, I love fantasy the most. It gives me such an imagination, and also such a tale to think about or add to on boring days. My goal as a writer is to one day, become half as good as Tolkien is, for I think I could not become any better."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A cheery hobbit named Bilbo is confronted by a wandering wizard and a truckload of dwarves, then suddenly finds himself trekking across the wilderness in a search for a dragon's treasure! A classic if there ever was one. The ironic adventures and exciting creatures give this fairy tale a very enjoyable edge. One can never grow tired of reading this novel, and it is a great book for all ages. I salute Tolkien for his masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I find it rather funny, the reviewers who are compelled to recap this story in their reviews. If you don't know about the story of Bilbo Baggins yet, just buy the book and read it. You won't be disappointed. My mother read this story to me at bedtime one chapter at a time and it's been branded into my DNA ever since. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is fantastic, but my favorite story of the lot is this one. Just classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Great book, I forgot how good it was written, do yourself a favor and buy this book, when I had to read it as a kid I hated it, but now I really enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Wonderful book now in useful format.

The author's imagination was amazing & the story line never got boring. I am excited to start the Lord of the Rings books now."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"While the Hobbit is written in a very different style than the Lord of the Ring, Tolkien timeless classic, it is still a fun read. Written in a style and tone suited best to juvenile readers, it still has a great charm to it for the older reader. This was my first reread since the 70s but none of magic of the tale has diminished."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Read The Hobbit 35 years ago for the first time and many times since and throughout my life it has been a joy and a comfort. Knowing that Smaug will be defeated, that Gollum's ring will find it's way to safer pockets with brighter futures and that in the end the inhabitants of Middle Earth are not so different from ourselves. A children's book that grew into so much more. Professor Tolkien's written words are the true magic that the movies can never truely portray. Bought the Kindle version, my paperback is rather 'delicate' from being reread so many times, and illustrations and maps are clear and all included. Will continue on my quest to reread the Tolkien series on the Kindle, what better way to spend the afternoon than with old friends."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Read this first when I was 9 and fell in love with the genre from this point on... Reading it to my own child now... And he's spell bound and I'm thoroughly enjoying the wonderful tale Tolkien spins once again."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is an instant classic in your memory. It lies there with the other buried treasures of your childhood, no matter at what age you've read it.The situation is so elemental, whimsy and funny - it is impossible to put down or to forget. It will always be a great book in my mind."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read all three Lords books, and in fact I read them before watching any of the movies. I enjoyed all three books more than the movies. this book most probably will be the same also, as it entertained me; it was an easy read, with the same style as the trilogy books. If you want to read a book that will not tire your brain, like after work, at night before bed, and you like the Lord of the Rings storyline, then its a good idea to buy, enjoy yet another JRRTolkien book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love the Hobbit. I like it better then the Lord of the Rings, I can say that without any problem.I first read this in my Freshmen year of high school and have loved it ever since. It is one of my first fantasy novels and I recommend it to any one who has ever doubted fantasy novels.If you have seen the Lord of the Rings and are curious as to why Bilbo is so important. Then you really do need to read this book to understand his back story.It has well driven characters and it really rounds out Bilbo's character, and why he is considered strange to his family, and others around him. This book is really worth the time to read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Professor JRR Tolkien had made his mark as an authority on Anglo-Saxon language and mythology, by the time he wrote The Hobbit, in 1937, but the novel was his first great literary success, and of course what introduced many to it's majestic sequel, The Lord of the Rings.65 years later, it still enthralls millions of readers, both young and old. It is a wonderful story to captivate readers aged 10 to 110. It has inspired much creative work, including the theme of a popular computer game during the 1980's. In essence Tolkien was the father of the Sword and Sorcery genre of literature, which has provided the material for so many successful novels, movies and games.Lighter in tone than the Lord of the Rings, it nevertheless contains many references to things deeper and darker than on the surface, such as Gondolin, the last White Council, the Necromancer, and the ring.The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion provide a deeper journey into Tolkien's Middle Earth. But younger readers can also enjoy it, for it's own benefit.I first read the book, when I was twelve. It wet my appetite for all things Tolkien and led me to then read the Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion.The Hobbit is the story of the adventure of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit of the green and pleasant country of the Shire, recruited by the wizard Gandalf and a company of Dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield, to wrest the Dwarves inheritance from the Dragon Smaug under the Lonely Mountain. The company must first battle Trolls , Goblins , Wolves , and Giant Spiders , and comes into contact with Elves , Eagles , Men and other inhabitants of Tolkien's wonderful world."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the book that changed my mind about books. In high school we had to choose a book to report on, and a friend said The Hobbit was kind of interesting, so that's the one I chose.To say I was happy with my choice would be a gross understatement. From the first page my imagination seemed to mesh perfectly with Tolkien's world, and without the \\"speed of absorption\\" imposed by a movie, I was wonderfully soaking up all the detail that Tolkien includes in all his works. I was there.I could go on and on, but this is fantasy at its best. And, I feel, that reading it better readies you for the presently popular Lord of the Rings -- it makes the movies all the more clearer, richer, deeper.An excellent fantasy classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is about a hobbit (a race that are short and are generally very merry and have happy lives). Now this Hobbit's name was Bilbo and he had the average live of a hobbit (routine, organized, planning ahead, being very lazy, and eating half the time). He got a surprise knock on his door one day from his wizard friend Gandalf accompanied by thirteen dwarves. Bilbo and them eventually set out to the other side of Middle-Earth (Tolkein's world) towards the Lonely Mountains where the evil dragon Smaug lived and stole the dwarves mountain earlier. From there, Bilbo has become less lazy and brave and discovered many traits he never knew he had.This book is a prelude of the better Lord of the Ring trilogy. This is a must read for all who wants to read something new. Overall this book has an exciting storyline (kind of funny at some points) and the author has a unique writing style. It has excellent development of the main character that turns from a lazy bum to a brave soul who has wormed out of more than one tough situation"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There are many many different illustrated editions of this classic and except for Mr. Tolkiens original renderings this is by far the best illustrated rendition of the Hobbit.Michael Hauge is a master illustrator in the grand old style and truly makes the story come alive, his work is reminiscent or Arthur Rackham at times. Of all the illustrated versions on the market today (many of them very weak indeed) I find Mr. Hague's to be exceptional. He also did a wonderful job on another classic, the Wind in the Willows. Any book illustrated by him is worth looking into (literally).Very Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In my opinion, there is only one other book that surpasses The Hobbit, and that is The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (which Tolkien originally wrote as one book). J.R.R. Tolkien was without a doubt a true literary genius. The Hobbit sets the stage for the magnificent trilogy which follows, but it is a fine work which stands on its own. Tolkien's vivid imagination transports one to a land whose inhabitants include dwarfs, elves, trolls, dragons and other familiar fairy tale creatures, but these are not the elves and dwarfs of Grimm and Hans Christian Anderson. These are REAL beings which are believable. No tiny elves that flit about here; these are the ancient ones, the healers, the wise ones of Middle Earth, the immortals. They are tall, elegant and powerful beings to respect, and indeed sometimes fear.As for the wizards...Gandalf the Grey is no mere human, but a powerful being sent from above to help the inhabitants of Middle Earth, in this case a Hobbit, an unusual creature one cannot help but love from the start. Hobbits love life; they love to eat, love companionship and a warm hearth. They are the kind of folk one is drawn to, and relates to...a homey kind of people who till the soil and tend their gardens. One can almost smell the hot bread steaming fresh from the ovens.I found the Hobbit back in the mid-sixties and have been an avid Tolkien fan ever since. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes adventure, suspense, wit and humor. It is no mere childs tale...this one is for all ages to enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Literarily speaking, chapter one of The Hobbit is the best thing ever written for children in English. What follows is a series of increasingly improbable adventures, which arose naturally out of Tolkien's storytelling practice with his own children.While by no means proof against enjoyment by girls, it must be admitted that The Hobbit is very much a boy's book, its cozily domestic subtext serving to highlight its absence of female characters, its wilderness settings and grisly violence. Its saving grace is Tolkien's enchanting sense of humor, which continues to be consistently reassuring throughout.What it requires of its readers is not however boyhood, or even childhood: what it requires is a sense of adventure. Anybody with one of those is ill-advised to neglect reading this justly renowned neo-saga, which was legendary in character to begin with, and has since become legendary in nature as well.Its most distinctive features are the maps, the verses, and the medieval authenticity. There are two maps, one of which is used in the story repeatedly. The verses are in ballad measures, including dwarf and goblin as well as hobbit songs. The early section of the Old Norse Elder Edda (Dvergatal), from which Tolkien took the names of his dwarves and wizard, remains even now displaced in an appendix at the end of Hollander's standard translation.Initially published in 1937, The Hobbit's composition was contemporary with Tolkien's pioneering published lecture on Beowulf, which revitalized the scholarship on and initiated a modern criticism of that sternest of British works. Read for publication by Tolkien's future lifelong publisher Rayner Unwin at age 10, The Hobbit sold unexpectedly well in the United States in its slightly inferior first edition (later revised to conform with The Lord of the Rings) and produced an immediate demand for a sequel, which did not however appear until those who had read The Hobbit as children were beginning to have children of their own.Various protestations to the contrary, The Hobbit remains an indispensable prerequisite to The Lord of the Rings. The Fellowship of the Rings movie might have been better, if its producers had filmed The Hobbit first.I trust that it will eventually be confirmed, if it isn't known for a fact already, that the Los Angeles meteorologist, who coined our familiar term for urban air pollution, really did mean to name it after the dragon in The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was a little confused at first with all the names in the book, but after the second chapter I had everything undercontrol. I loved the great detail Tolkien put into his writing, it literally made me feel like I was walking along side Bilbo throughout his troubles. Whenever he ran into tough situation, I would stop and think of what I would have done in his place. Tolkien does a very good job of setting the right atmosphere for each scene to make the story even more intense. I was really impressed with how well each new character was described, it really helped me picture what they looked like and how they expressed themselves, no matter how unhuman they were. This is the best book I have read in several years, but from what I've heard best books are just ahead. I am hoping to jump right into the Lord of the Rings trilogy, hopefully they are just as good. I would definatelly recommement this book to anyone interested in going on a good adventure through caves, woods, mountains and giant spiders nests."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The HobbitThis novel, The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo has never been or had an adventure, until he gets a visit from some dwarves and a wizard named Gandalf. They convince him to come help them win their gold and treasure back from the dragon Smaug. On the way they meet goblins, trolls, wargs, giants, giant spiders, and of course Smaug the dragon. Bilbo shows the dwarves his worth and they grow to respect him.Bilbo Baggins is friendly and likeable, but also scared and confused. Most of the dwarves are strict and ready for anything, but some, like Bilbo, seem scared. The book starts off slow telling about hobbits, but after the first chapter it becomes a little interesting. The ending was very good, since the author goes on a little to tell what happened to Bilbo when he got back home.In the beginning the author gives too many details on hobbits. Some of the vocabulary is old fashioned. In some points of the book, like in between the adventures, the story gets a little slow and boring, but during the adventures it is very interesting. I think the book would be more liked by children ages 10-15. Overall the book is good. I give the book 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Welcome your kids to the land of magic and make-believe. The Hobbit is classic many would have been familiar with. In country like the Philippines, the book opens the eyes of young people to a whole new world, an entirely different culture. It's a far, far different world from the local tales of legend and magic.This particular edition is handsomely illustrated by the same artist that designed the illustrated centennial edition of LOTR and the movie. It's slightly bigger than the wider than the LOTR centennial. I just wished the publishers did not use matte coated paper for all the pages. The pages stick to each other after some time in a hot and humid environment like the Philippines. I wish only the full-pages of color illustrations were printed on coated paper.As for anyone living in the third world, this is a mighty big investment. But if you have a choice between this or the illustrated centennial edition of LOTR, pick LOTR. But if you can afford both, get them both. Nice books to display and tickle kids imaginations with."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Excellent read. Have been trying to find other authors who I like as much. Terry Goodkind is one but that is all so far."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is not only a book, but a key to open our imagination and let it flow freely. It is a modern fairy-tale, with no known fairies. They are there, but with changed names and concepts.It is a very orignal piece of art, however for as original as the story be it contains great influence of Nordic Mythology, which is never mentioned as a source for more information. Mr. Tolkien wrote a soberb story, giving room for the child everyone carries inside. Wasn't Bilbo quite persuaded to go by his &quot;dad&quot; Gandalf? And as problems appeared wasn't Gandalf the 1st to be thought of... Bilbo learnt all out the hard (and maybe best) way and that's why he became a hero!It's a book which brought a whole new Universe, continued on other ones, The Lord of the Rings (great), the Simallarion (I personally didn't read it, but I don't expect much either. The characters I'm interestd in are far out from the tale there...) and even games, which knows no bounds (Middle Eart Role Playing Game, D&amp;D...) . And now, finally one trilogy to rule them all!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Although this book starts off pretty slow it has an amazing story behind it. The book is based on a character named Mr. Baggins and as you can tell he is a hobbit. This little hobbit is on an adventure with goblins to regain stolen treasure from a ferocious dragon. Little does he know that he is also up against a heartless demon under the mountains and more. I think that all fiction lovers should read this book and the rest of the series that follows. I hope this review has helped, have fun."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Anybody can read this book and love it.It's just a story about Bilbo Baggins-the hobbit with no adventure in his life who one day gets into an adventure with Gandalf the wizard and 12 dwarves or is it 13 dwarves.Anyway, it's an awesome book you should read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I remember when I was a child, my father used to read me stories every night. Before I knew how to read, like every child, I liked to look at the pictures. Even as a child, I noticed that sometimes the story was better than the pictures, and sometimes the pictures were better than the story. Although there have been countless versions of The Hobbit, this version has the illustrations to match the wonderful and timeless story. The story is about a young hobbit who is rudely torn from his comfortable surroundings to embark on a heroic, sometimes horrific, sometimes hysterical adventure. The Hobbit started a fantasy tradition that has only gained momentum with time. Tokein's discriptions of the adventuring party's trials and tribulations are both heartwarming and at times gut-wrenching. The pictures in this version definitely do this classic justice. I especially enjoy the rich picture of the dragon Smaug hording his vast treasure and the evil swamp creature Gollum harrassing poor Bilbo the Hobbit. Of all the versions of The Hobbit, this one is the most richly illustrated and the one that is totally worth getting"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After reading the Harry Potter books, and countless reviews saying that they were no where near Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit series...I thought I would check it out. Tolkien is the master of fantasy, it has been determined, I decided to judge for myself. I had started reading the Hobbit a few times before, and enjoyed it, though I would always put it down for something slightly more riveting, interesting, or something that just came out :::cough Harry Potter book 4:::: and I had to read. When I finally picked it up again, determined to read it before I read the LOTR, and determined to read them before the movie, I was pushed gently at first and then given a sudden yet enthralling shove into the Middle Earth.The adventures of Bilbo Baggins are like no other. They are calm enough to make you feel cozy inside, yet interesting enough to make you keep reading. Tolkien's gift for writing, though celebrated many times, is never as strong as the first time you read the first page of the Hobbit. I lived through each moment, and found myself picking up the book subconciously and just reading it, as though I was thumbing through my life story, as oppose to that of Bilbo.Tolkien created one of the most subtle and real realities I have ever come across. He created a totally believable spiecies of creature (many, actually), a totally believable plot and a wonderfully magical tale that will leave you all warm inside, and wanting more! The perfect push-off point for the Lord of the Rings. Every time the LOTR got slightly boring, or slowed down, I just remembered how calmly I had been able to read the Hobbit, and it kept me from giving up altogether. Definitely a &quot;must-read&quot; to anyone who enjoys good literature, and a great starting point for people who are wary of fantasy.Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go sweep my hobbit-hole now."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I resisted reading this book for a long time. To be honest, I was biased against fantasy and science fiction; believing they were not &quot;real&quot; literature. If it hadn't been for the upcoming movie, I probably wouldn't have picked up &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; which a friend recommended I read before plunging into the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy.I'm glad I did. From the beginning I was enthralled with the characters as well as the tale, and soon found I was reading it while walking home from work, on the stairmaster at the gym, and at night when I should have been sleeping. Tolkien imagined an amazing world, and then popolated it with likable characters and creatures, with just enough adventure mixed in to keep the pages turning.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; got me hooked, and I'm already starting the trilogy that constitutes &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book got me started on the Tolkien books! If you thinking of reading this well do it it's worth your time!^.^ and when your done you should read The Lord of the Rings! So I'm telling you pick this book up!^.^"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien is without a doubt the greatest literary genius of our times, whatever the naysayers among the &quot;literati&quot; say. Tolkien was the ultimate &quot;philologist&quot; in both a literal, academic sense and in a broader, more general sense. That is to say, he was a true &quot;lover of words&quot; and no writer has ever &quot;sub-created&quot; a magical world on the basis of a deeper knowledge of, and love of, words. What is more, as any true philologist, he saw very clearly the power of myth and how language and myth interweave. The longer trilogy with followed allowed him to unfold all these aspects of his writing in a fuller, deeper way...and yet there is still something about the Hobbit, the antechamber of Middle Earth that draws one back to it again and again. It is eminently readable and approachable, for one thing. One can easily plow though it for a light evening's reading. Designed as a &quot;children's book&quot; (so many great works of literature were) it is utterly enjoyable for even young children and yet an inexhaustable mine of meaning for adults."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I picked up the Hobbit and read it as an adult merely because I like another one of the Inklings (a group of writers who met at the Oxford Pub &quot;the Eagle and the Child&quot; which included C.S. Lewis). I read this &quot;children's&quot; fantasy as an adult and immediately fell in love with Tolkien's writing. This is fantasy that has depth to it. Yes, there are goblins, and elves, and dwarves in the book but it is not just a fantasy that just throws out shallow fantasy characters. Tolkien makes you understand the characters and makes you want to be a part of their lives. Even though they are creatures of fantasy you will begin to fel for them just like you would the characters of any great book. Though some call this is a &quot;children's&quot; book it was well worth my time and I will begin to read the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; series simply because of how good &quot;the Hobbit&quot; was."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, who leaves his quiet life of many meals a day to join a treasure-seeking company of dwarves. He encounters trolls, elves, giant spiders and magic of every kind. He returns home in the end to find his comfortable life waiting for him. Though he now has riches and a magic ring of invisibility, Bilbo will never again rest comfortably.Tolkien wrote this book for his own children, and it has the chapter-by-chapter pacing of a tale to be told at bedtime to eager young ears. It is not mere childishness, however. While the magic is exciting, there is also an underlying system, a consistency to what magic will work and who it will work for and against. This encourages thoughtful questions and recognition of order in even a make-believe world.Tolkien's hero grows as he journeys through Middle-Earth and through the book's chapters. Early in his adventures, Bilbo is rescued by either Gandalf the Wizard or by the more experienced dwarves. As the story develops, Bilbo takes a trembling hand in defending his companions and solving their problems. By book's end, he acts independently and makes his own decisions about what is right. In this entertaining and light-seeming tale, Tolkien shows his young readers what it means to grow up, to become capable and confident.Having enjoyed the Hobbit's happy lessons of childhood, adult readers ofThe Lord of the Ringsface maturity's darker challenges. Bilbo's simple adventure is retold, with secrets laid bare and threatening implications revealed. Bilbo's magic ring is a consuming burden that cannot be easily destroyed. His homeland is safe only because others struggle to keep evil at bay. The most frightening monsters Bilbo has encountered, the goblins, are merely tortured offspring of a world-threatening evil that must be fought. This change of perspective is more than the shift from a children's book to one written for adults. It captures the jarring difference between what children know, and what adults must know to protect them.This book has the reviewer's highest recommendation. Read it to enjoy a delightful children's story, and to see a childlike hero grow toward adulthood. Also read it to appreciate more deeply the adult themes in Tolkien's books that follow it. Analytical readers may also enjoy the psychological insights offered by Timothy O'Neill inThe Individuated Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Funny, colorful, exciting story of someone who has an adventure and becomes all sorts of things he never expected to be--most of all a true leader."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This story has non stop action in every chapter.

It's a great tale of survival through untold hardships, when all seems to have failed, and yet, a little luck, and a little perseverance sees them through.The Hobbit is a great introduction into Tolkein's world and a great set up for the Lord Of The Rings.

Bilbo in the The Hobbit is someone we can relate to strongly, even though he is not human. The theme of The Hobbit is tha an ordinary person (or hobbit) can do extraordinary things.

The Hobbit has a more simple yet adventurous plot, but in many ways it's better than the other Tolken books, because in the Lord of the Rings trilogy that follows, there are so many places and names, it's easy to get tired of remembering everything (something that's less of a burden in the feature films too) you feel as though you have to take notes to keep along with the story, with The Hobbit, you won't feel it's unnecessarily convoluted with characters and places, and the novel is just as exciting as the others to read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I found this book quite by accident, while being at the library looking for something completely different. Having heard of this book before, I read a few pages, and I started to get hooked. The book is about a little hobbit known as Bilbo Baggins and it follows his adventures around Tolkien's magical world. Gandalf and some dwarves head out to fight goblins, trolls, spiders, and many other creatures, all for a chance at untold riches. However the treasure is guarded by a cruel dragon known as Smaug. I enjoy Tolkien's writing style and I especially love his humor. This is probably one of the finest books he has written. It is a shame how you can hear the cash register ring as every subsequent book was written. The Hobbit is not the easiest read however, and Tolkien's colorful use of words can be hard to follow at times. I would recommend this book to anyone who already enjoys Tolkien's works and to any fantasy lover. This book easily makes the 5 out of 5 mark for me."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is one of my favorite books of all time. Perhaps it is because I read it as a child, and it first introduced me to dwarves and elves in a way far different from their Disney counterparts. Perhaps it was the humanity of characters laid out for me to see. I am not sure exactly what it was, but after rereading it for the upteenth time, it still has not lost a smidgen of its charm.Sure, Lord of the Rings is the serious book, the more adultish, more classic quest fantasy to save the world from mortal peril sort of thing. The Hobbit is more of a quest to save Bilbo from living his life without a single thing happening that was unexpected. I think this central difference, combined with a younger target audience for this book, makes this book have a much more carefree attitude, and a generally much more merry tale.The pace of the Hobbit is pretty rapid, since really the journey of this story would have been of a similar length as Lord of the Rings, with a lot of detail simply missing from this book. The first leg of the journey was almost identical to Frodo's in route at least, yet it is over in a couple of chapters. Really, the lesser significance of this quest required a lot less development early on.What you really do see happen in the Hobbit, which is nearly absent in Lord of the Rings, is how a bit of a fussy homebody is changed into a daring and wise companion by means of the journey. Bilbo proved to be the lucky 'fourteenth' man on the quests of the dwarf Thorin to reclaim his homeland and treasure, and that was lucky for not only the dwarves, but for Bilbo himself. Even Gandalf discovered that there was more to Bilbo than meets the eye, as the hobbit proved himself useful in a lot of very different situations.It is a wonder to see a character develop like Bilbo during the course of a single novel. It is an exceedingly rare sight these days, to see something like this happen, and it is refreshing to see it again here.The songs in this book aren't the poet things from Lord of the Rings, but more like drinking songs with simple rhymes. This [songs] is not a favorite now a days, but I kinda like them. Trying to figure out a tune to go with each one is difficult at times, but it makes it that much better. You can always just skip them, like I did when I was a kid.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What made me want this particular version of the book, I wanted something nostalgic that felt official and this is exactly what I got.The book feels great to read and the gold touches make it that more special but what I love more is that it has J.R.R Tolkien's original drawings which also include the four color pieces he did.The cover box is also a neat touch, this is one my favorite books to read and now it's one of my best presented books.Recommended for all ages and a must have for any \\"Hobbit\\" or \\"Lord of the Rings\\" fan."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"what else could I say this is a great book and great version for the kindle app, if you havent read the book do it before the movie comes out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Amazing reading of The Hobbit!

A hobbit named Bilbo Baggins reluctantly embarks on a perilous quest to help dwarves recover their long lost treasure. They encounter trolls, goblins, elves, and others along their way to Lonely Mountain where the dwarves had their treasure stolen from them years ago by Smaug the Dragon.One strength that The Hobbit has is that there are many thrilling adventure points throughout the book. You are also able to get to know the key characters and feel the dilemmas that they go through. One weakness that I felt was that it takes a lot of time and pages to get to each of the thrilling spots of the book. Also, at some points it can feel like the plot is slow moving. But, it is an easy read in terms of use of language and plot and I recommend it to the youngest teenagers and adults alike. I truly enjoyed the casual writing style that J.R.R.

Although the book had many of the good qualities a book needs, the traveling sequences become long and boring.

That is were I stumbled into \\"The Hobbit\\" on amizon.com. I first read this book in eighth grade for a book report. I am now eighteen years old. The first time I read this book was five years ago and I still can remember every bit of it. This book is very exciting and imaginative. There is a new adventure for Bilbo Baggins, one of the main characters, on every page. The one thing that you must have is an imagination. J.R.R. Tolkien gives us a very detailed description of the characters, surroundings, and events the characters encounter.I remember when I read this book, I felt like I was apart of the adventure.The description in the book gave me the ability to see how the characters looked like, so as I was reading it I felt like I was able to see the characters speaking to each other. Like the time when Bilbo finds the ring and runs into the Gollum. Tolkien's description of the Gollum and of what Bilbo was felling made me feel like I was Bilbo hiding from the Gollum. If you read the book, you will now what I am trying to say.Another grate thing about this book is that it is easy to read. The chapters are very interesting, and you will never get bored from it. This book is great for all ages, especially for the people that liked the Lord of the Ring. If you were still wondering how Frodo's family gets the ring, this book would clear all that up for you.In my opinion, this book is a classic and will always be one. This book shows great descriptions, and keeps you wanting more. The Hobbit is filled with mystery and adventure. You will not be able to put the book down. If you are looking for an exciting book, look no further you found the perfect book. That is why I am planning on purchased The Hobbit (Leatherette Collector's Edition) and The Lord of the Rings (Leatherette Collector's Edition) for my younger brothers as a Christmas gift."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit: Is it Such a Small Adventure After All?Book Title: The HobbitHow would you feel if 13 dwarves just popped right into your house, called you a burglar, and whisked you away on some wild adventure that you have absolutely no interest in? And what's worse, your friend Gandalf the Grey has helped them. That's exactly what happened to Bilbo Baggins in the book, The Hobbit.The plot of the story is amazing. It follows a story line that is so imaginary, it almost isn't imaginable. The main hobbit in this story is Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is whisked away on a dangerous journey with 13 dwarves, determined with the task of recapturing the grand dwarf city. Thorin, the greatly respected dwarf king, is determined to be the King Under the Mountain, as his grandfather and great-grandfather once were. Smog the Dragon has captured the ancient dwarf city and has destroyed the once prosperous city of Dale, the mortal man's city. Thorin and Co.(Bilbo and the 13 dwarves) are determined to kill Smog (well, at least the dwarves are. Bilbo thinks this is all a wild goose chase!) and recover the lost treasures. But before they get to the mountain to destroy Smog and recover the lost treasure, they must get there. On the long way there, they drag themselves into mortal danger many times. Some of these dangers are hungry trolls, giant spiders, and an entire underground kingdom of goblins. There are many more, but it would take a full page to name them.This book was extremely good, especially if you like books with a lot of suspense in them. Tolkien uses intricate detail and vivid words. I could just imagine every part in the book as if I was there.Bilbo is a touching character that we all can relate to. Poor old Bilbo just wants to be left alone and wants to have everything just so expected and predictable. But on the other hand, he loves adventures (sometimes) and he loves suprises. But he alsc just wants a good pipe to smoke, a comfortable hobbit hole, and some good company. And surely we can all relate to that!!I recommend this book to children and adults of all ages. Some parts of the book are a little intense, such as when the Wargs try to eat the 14 travelers plus Gandalf in one part. Otherwise, this is a touching, loving, humorous book. Although, you might not like the book so much if you don't enjoy action/adventure books.In conclusion, this book is wonderful. I really loved it. If you decide to read the book, I think you'll really enjoy it too."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" is a great fantasy book written by the author J.R.R.

If you are looking for a good fantasy/adventure book to read then \\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a must read classic because of its deep story line and interesting characters. I would recommend it for readers over thirteen that are in to adventurous books. Readers might find it particularly interesting because the story The Hobbit precedes The Lord of the Rings. The book gives readers a little bit of back ground to the three Lord of the Rings movies.The story is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. One morning in his Hobbit hole he awoke to a loud banging on his round wooden door. In came a wizard and twelve dwarves for what Bilbo thought was breakfast. He was surprised to find that they were planning to take him along with them on a journey to reclaim their lost gold from a dragon in the depths of a distant mountain. The journey to the mountain makes for an interesting story. They encountered goblins, great wolves, eagles, wood elves, and of course the dragon. They have very high times and low times along the journey, coming to near death on several occasions. As I read this book I almost felt sorry for all the little things that Bilbo was dragged into. By the end Bilbo becomes the hero, which was pleasing to compare his hero status to how he started the journey.JRR Tolkien uses his knowledge of the rural environment and his imagination to create an enticing piece of writing. Tolkien uses foreshadowing countless times to make the reader find the book irresistible. He has an interesting way of talking to the reader about the story by using \\"you\\". It is almost as if he is telling his tail directly to the reader.I thought this book was very entertaining and well written. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good piece of literature. I rate it a nine out of ten."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book years ago, in junior high. I had heard about it before, and had been interested in reading it, but had not had a chance. I enjoyed the story immensley, even though it was below my reading level at that point, it was a great background when I read The Lord of the Rings later. If you plan on reading The Lord of the Rings, read The Hobbit first. You will understand a lot better where Bilbo got the ring, and how he knows Gandalf, the elfs, and the dwarfs.This edition of The Hobbit is one of the most beautifully published books I have ever seen. Every page is thick, high quality glossy paper with wide margins, and MANY MANY illustrations. In addition to occasional colour illustrations on their own pages, there are smaller, half page or so, grey illustrations scattered throughout the chapters. If you are a fan of Tolkien, this is the edition of The Hobbit to buy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Who would have known that J.R.R. Tolkien's dark, war-ravaged epic fantasy Lord of the Rings would have sprung from such an innocent, light-hearted adventure?When a peace-loving Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins has his humble home visited by the legendary wizard Gandalf the Grey and an entourage of 13 dwarves, Bilbo finds himself embarking on a quest that will take him all across the great lands of Middle Earth, meeting a host of characters and creatures both friendly and not, and stumbling across great treasures and wild predicaments.I truly feel sorry for anyone who would dismiss the Hobbit as a \\"children's book.\\" While it may have been intended that way, it hardly reads as so. The Hobbit is intelligent, gripping, sophisticated and wondrous. I found that I always had a smile on my face for the greater portion of the book. Tolkien's vivid and often times comedic approach to Bilbo's situations help convey an intriguing and entertaining story that can be enjoyed by anyone.The characters, for the most part, are very well developed. The main characters (Bilbo, Thorin, Gandalf) get the most attention, but Tolkien balances the 12 remaning Dwarves and other side characters quite well. Bilbo's encounter with Gollum is chilling and memorable, and the finding of the Ring seems so very insignificant in the grand scheme of things...yet who would've known that such an innocent discovery would have led to the tragic, dark and terribly evil events to follow in Tolkien's legendary Lord of the Rings?This book should definitely keep you enthralled and reading to the very end. Like I said earlier, though this may have been intended to be a children's book, it hardly reads like one at all. I don't ever remember reading any books way back when I was a kid that were this epic, descriptive or intelligent. All you need is an open mind with a little twinge of fantasy, and you'll definitely enjoy the Hobbit. You can't read the Lord of the Rings without reading the Hobbit out of principle. I don't know why I waited so long to read this book, but now that I have, I am very glad that I did. It's probably one of the best books i've ever read. I very highly recommend it to anyone remotely interested in fantasy. Most of the fantasy today is inspired by The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings.This Leatherette Collector's Edition of the book sports some illustrations inserted into key areas of the book,gold embossment on the cover of elvish 'moonletters' and runes, as well as a leather sheath for the book. Definitely worthwhile for any Tolkien fan! On a side note, if you REALLY want to add dimension and life to the characters, I suggest watching The Fellowship of the Ring and The The Towers either before or just after you read this book...Gandalf and Bilbo and company just have so much more personality afterwards!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien's deceptively simple story of the well to do hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who has adventure thrust upon him is a land mark book in the fantasy genre. Just about Every fantasy novel written since owes a debt in one form or another to Tolkien. I think part of the reason why Tolkien's work resonates strongly with so many people lies in Tolkien's reoccurring theme of the ordinary person thrust into extraordinary circumstances. Bilbo, like all of the Hobbits in Tolkien's Ring Trilogy, is at heart a simple fellow who shows great courage in the face of terrifying odds. Tolkien, a Medievalist and professor of Linguistics at Oxford University, took his vast knowledge of language and ancient myths and used them to create a world unlike anything we've ever seen before. Frank Herbert's Dune trilogy is the only series I can think of which has come close. The Hobbit has it all. Vast armies, an underdog hero, dragons, wizards, lost treasure, giant spiders, and magic rings. The Hobbit is my absolute all time favorite story.Preston McClear, MalibuBooks.com"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book called &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, is about a little ordinary Hobbit called Bilbo Baggins, who had an unexpected adventure. This adventure was filled with lost treasure, magical dwarves, mystical elves and fearsome dragons. Here, is Professor Tolkiens first book that takes place in Middle-Earth. Just the fact that such a small and &quot;un-adventurous&quot; little person like Mr.Baggins going on an adventure made this book a great page-turner. But with the addition of magical creatures, fierce warriors and Smaug the Dragon, I believe that this book should be recognized in the &quot;Authors hall of Fame&quot;.The detail in this book was magnificent, letting you picture the lush environment of Rivendell, the harsh, cold Mountain range of the Misty Mountains and the dark forest of Mirkwood, with its hidden eyes of darkness and spiders the size of elephants. The characters had complex personalities, family tree descriptions, and their appearances were, in my opinion, described perfectly.Smaug, the dragon who guarded the dwarves' treasure, was quite a funny character. Not comically funny, but in the way that he talks to burglars, and the nasty habit of exploding with fury, when so much as a single coin is missing from his stockpile of gold. All in all, this book was a work of literary art, and descriptive genius. On a scale of one to ten, I would give it a ten and a half, and I believe it is suitable for all ages.

And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but multidimensional and immensely interesting to read about.\\"The Hobbit\\" was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and continue reading. A timeless treasure and classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I never used to like Harry Potter- I had never read the book. I did and I wanted to read more more more. This is the same way.

It's about a peace-loving Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins is his name, who lives in a little Hobbit-hole, like all normal hobbits. What's a hobbit, you ask? A hobbit is (or was) a quiet, peace-loving creature who usaully lived on hills and disliked normal human, or, as they say, &quot;the big people.&quot; They didn't believe in modern technology and got most of their resources from nature. Well, on day, when Mr. Baggins was sitting upon his rockin' chair outside his little hole, the great and mighty &quot;Gandalf the Gray&quot; came and forced him to come upon his journey. Forced. From the on, the book features giant spiders, goblins, GOLLUM (what other reason do you need???) and many other mysterious creatures, but, sadly, no Black Riders.

J.R.R. Tolkien did. This book is a fantasy adventure about a band of dwarves, one wizard called Gandalf, and a hobbit called Bilbo Bagins. Together they embark on a journey to retrieve a lost treasure form a terrible dragon. On their journey they face Trolls, Goblins, and Wood Elves.This is one of my personal favorites. This is a fantasy adventure like no other. I would recommend this book to lovers of fantasy adventures. This book is a prelude to Lord of the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In this book, The Hobbit, or There and Back Again, by J.R.R. Tolkein, is a story of self discovery from the point of view of a hobbit who sometimes resents said \\"journey of self discovery\\". Throughout this book, you watch as the hobbit becomes a completely new hobbit. At the start, he was described as \\"a well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins,\\" by the end of the book though, he becomes Bilbo, Warrior against the Goblins, Peace-maker of Nations, Burglar of the Dwarves, and the owner of a very special yet suspicious ring. The plot of this story was very effective because it kept things very interesting. There were many various adventures that took place during one big overall adventure. Tolkien never let the story get too dry and always kept the reader interested with exciting events. I also greatly enjoyed the point of view being from Bilbo's perspective. I think that everyone can appreciate the story of an underdog. Bilbo was a rather uninteresting hobbit, and I think everyone can relate to that sort of unexciting life, but then suddenly he got to travel on a fantastic adventure! It almost gives the reader hope that maybe someday their life will take them on an unexpected journey. I somewhat agree with what bernie \\"webviator\\" said about how this is not a children's book. It most definitely is not a children's book, but I also have to point out that although the book itself may be too advanced for children just as ALice in Wonderland is, the story is still suitable for a child. Sometimes more a simpler mind can appreciate things much differently than a more advanced mind, but they would still appreciate it nonetheless. Tolkien's style of writing is very nicely illustrated in the line: \\"Upon his tomb the Elvenking then laid Orcrist,\\" the entire story has a magical and almost spooky tone, the author does this by creating many amazing creatures and magical objects throughout the story. I love this writing style because it successfully creates a completely alternate universe in which the story takes place, and it becomes an escape from the real world. I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to witness an adventure or would like to discover the \\"Tookishness\\" in themselves."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book that defined a generation of fantasy and fantasy clich&eacute;s, though deeply rooted in a rich literary history of heroic journeys, concerns the quest for treasure of a little Hobbit, 13 dwarves, and a wizard. Though it lacks the powerful poetry of Lord of the Rings, its prose is that of a charming bedtime story, but with all the cleverness and antiquity of Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia. Bilbo is a wonderful character, now a clich&eacute; of the genre, the unwilling, comedic, yet wise and brave hero. And, though Tolkien falls into flat characters based on race, many of his characters, particularly Thorin (a flawed, yet heroic, character), defy classification. Bilbo and Gollum, are in fact, very childlike; two sides of the child: the greedy, selfish child, and the selfless, adventuring, heroic child. One grows up through adventures; one horrifically stagnates. Many of the scenes, particularly the Riddles in the Dark and the final ending, are the quintessential Tolkien: thoroughly engaging, deceptively simple, and totally, utterly brilliant. A fairy tale, hero tale that is a classic for a reason, even if it is just a book to curl up with with a cup of tea and a quilt.

In the beginning of The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins hated the idea of adventure, but he could only do so much to stop this one when thirteen dwarves and one wizard came to his little hobbit-hole in the hill.The lot of them needed his services as a burglar to gain their treasure back from he dragon, Smaug. He hesitantly agreed to go, and on the way, the group found Bilbo to be very handy, noble, and adventurous. Though the one to actually kill the dragon was a warrior from Dale, Bilbo played a large part in the entirety of the greater peace found after Smaug's death in the lands around. I strongly recommend this book to adventure-lovers and those in need of some inspiration.One reason that I liked this book was that it had many points of great suspense, such as when Bilbo woke up to find a giant spider's eyes and legs tying his legs together to eat him. Bilbo luckily woke up in time to kill the spider. Also, when Bilbo and his friends had to fight off the trolls, it seemed possible that Bilbo would get his toes singed, or they would all get eaten. It was a point of great suspense when Bilbo darted invisibly from tree to tree, away from the spiders who were trying ton eat him and his friends, who were hanging from a web some way off.Another good part of this book was the mystery that loomed in the background, though sometimes it was unnoticed until it was directly brought up. For example, when Thorin was lost from the group, it was quite unknown where he had gone, and it wasn't brought up for quite a while. Also, it was a mystery how Bilbo would get into his barrel, which he didn't get to, because he didn't think of it, but ended up floating down the river on top of it. It was quite a mystery how they would get out of the trees surrounded by wargs and goblins, but were eventually saved by eagles.My favorite part of this book was the way it often made it seem impossible for the dwarves and Bilbo to go any further, like when they were in the Goblin's passages, in front of the Great Goblin, about to be eaten, or when they got caught in the forest with no idea of how to get out. The best example was when they got stuck in the elven-palace, guarded by elves and a spell-ridden gate.The Hobbit was a very satisfactory reads, full of suspense, adventure, and friendship. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good book that keeps you turning the pages through Bilbo's adventure.-K.Carson"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My review is of the collector's edition of The Hobbit.

Great book and a great edition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was pretty bad. Shame on all of the people who gave it 5 stars and encouraged me to read it. It was boring.

This is one of the most boring, over-rated, and tedious books I have ever read. What even possess a person to say it is the best book they have ever read is beyond me."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I almost worshipped JRR before I read The Hobbit! I am a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings not only because of the intricate plot and the plethora of characters but also the stylized writing and the \\"invention\\" of a \\"language\\" with its relevant syntax and the fantastic, garagantuan history of all the characters.Where LOTR has all this and more to offer, The Hobbit comes across as a badly written tale with no sense of pace or plot. It is the most abyssmal plodding reading possible! I can't imagine the audience for whom the book was written-is it children? ... because it is terribly juvenile and silly [but definitely not in an enjoyable way-mostly annoying and idiosyncratic]...but if the target audience IS children, the stylized writing and archaic use of English completely upsets that purpose! And it can most definitely not be for an adult audience for it has nothing to offer to the current generation of fantasy readers.If you haven't read it and are thinking of buying it-my suggestion would be that you don't!And btw the foreword and backpage comments from famous authors mention that it is an exercise in \\"escapism\\" which is what the fantasy genre was called back when the book was written...please spare yourself. If you have children, please buy them Artemis Fowl or Pendragon or any of the Issac Assimov books. If you read fasntasy for your own pleasure-ditto. But then again LOTR is an undisputed masterpiece. I apologize for this trenchant review...but I was horribly disappointed that someone of the stature of JRR can write something so unpalatable!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I could never seem to get into this book; why? It is a tale of 'Bilbo Baggins' and his journey with Gandalf and the dwarves to find treasure, and defeat the 'evil dragon', Smaug.

I was forced to read it against my will by my english teacher. Why it is a &quot;classic,&quot; I'll never know. There are WAY too many characters and place names.

I thought that once I'd finished it that I was through, but I wasn't so lucky. My teacher then forced us to read the first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. That book is even worse than this one, but that's a whole other review. So, in conclusion, I beg of you, whatever you do STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Okay I know that alot of people liked this book but I doubt its for the reason that it was a good novel but rather because J.R.R Tolkien wrote it so it must be a good story right? WRONG! I found it to be extremely silly at the way that Bilbo got out of all the different situations he got himself into. Very very silly and why exactly did he have to be in this grand adventure that Gandalf insisted he be in. Nothing about Bilbo appealed to me and I absolutely found the style way to dry and dull to the point where I had to stop reading it for awhile just to get a refreshed feeling.The only part that was slightly good was with Gollum but I found a lot of the ways that Bilbo solved the riddles so really pathetic that I wondered what the point was. I meen afterall Bilbo is soooooo smart that why even ask a riddle at all? I found Gandalf extremely annoying as well.Sorry but I hardly think Tolkien is deserving of the title 'master of fantasy.'"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I&#65533;m thrilled that I read something by Tolkien the whole way through, so that I can now, without any doubt, say that I absolutely hate his writing, and I will never pick up another one of his books again. I love fantasy, and it's about the only genre I read these days, but Tolkien does absolutely nothing for me.The story was extremely childish (which, I suppose, makes sense, since it was written as a children&#65533;s story). Bilbo and company would get themselves in trouble, and the solutions and the ways they got out of seemingly overwhelming circumstances were&#65533; laughable at best. Trolls get turned to stone by the coming of dawn, giant spiders easily abandon their prey at the sound of a taunt, and even the dragon proves to be less than fierce. Very silly indeed. The writing style was incredibly repetitive! If I had to read, one more time that &#65533;Bilbo wished he was back in his hobbit hole&#65533; and not for the last time!&#65533; I would have had it. As it was, the repetition was really trying my patience. Also, the first person narrator bothered me. Who WAS this person? If he constantly refers to himself as &#65533;I&#65533;, then he should make it clear who he is, and how he knows all about the hobbit&#65533;s adventures! Even the storyline was incredibly linear and predictable. There was little to no excitement in the entire book, and nothing caught me by surprise.Overall, I know my opinion is an unpopular one, and there are many fans of Tolkien's writing. I'll just have to accept that I'll never be among them."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"You know, I was so excited to finally read the &quot;legendary&quot; Hobbit.

Not sure I ever read it as a young adult. Read in a few days so a fast read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What has always impressed me about Tolkien is the attention to detail he puts into his work, and The Hobbit is no exception. You almost get the feeling that there really is a 'Middle Earth' out there somewhere.The saying \\"out of the frying-pan and into the fire\\" comes to mind when I describe The Hobbit to you, because this is a very fast-paced story, though not in the sense that the book is made of one epic battle scene after another. The plot spans over about a year, but the journeying itself is described sparingly while their (often dangerous) encounters with monsters and other races are described in great detail. The downside to this was that the climax seemed a bit rushed,but I enjoyed it nonetheless.The narration is old-fashioned, yet perfectly understandable. It reminded me of my middle grade teacher who used to read out loud to us in class. Sometimes the narrator speaks directly to the reader by commenting on the current happening in the book and it made me feel as if the narrator was letting me in on a secret of his by sharing the story to me.I really liked that Bilbo was, ironically, a very unenthusiastic participant in his own adventure. Though his almost dormant Took family genes, who are known for their odd adventurousness, is what in the end makes Bilbo accept his job as \\"The Burglar, \\" I'd dare say he is pretty much dragged into the whole thing. Tolkien uses a simple but effective way to show the great character development that Bilbo makes throughout the story by comparing the two sides of his heritage to each other. When he starts out, Bilbo sees himself as a hundred percent 'Baggins', a respectful and proper hobbit, but later comes to acknowledge that there might be a bit of the adventurous Took in him after all.There are thirteen dwarves (and a wizard) that Bilbo travels with, a number which I found a bit unnecessary. I think that Tolkien could have used half the number of dwarves and it would still have made the same story. Overflow of dwarves aside, I really enjoyed reading The book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I finally got around to reading this book. Its been on my list for years now.

Yes, Tolkien was a Catholic and LOTR reflects a very Catholic sensibility and view of good and evil. Ultimately it's just a great read that never gets old.

Although it's a far cry from Dante(my favorite foray into other worlds that I just wrote a book on), this book is timeless."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Giving The Hobbit less than 5 stars is absurd. When one talks about Tolkien \\"dilly-dallying and such\\" one is referring to his complex style of writing. Quite frankly, Tokien is not \\"less,\\" he is \\"more.\\" He demands that one pay more attention, he gives one more information. If one wishes to say that more isn't always better, then fine. The rest of us don't expect them to understand. Let me put it this way: It is like Champagne. People don't dislike Champagne, they merely don't understand it. These idiot reviewers \\"Larry\\", \\"Curly\\" and \\"Moe\\" don't prefer the taste of Champagne to 7UP, they simply can't taste it. Is it their limited capacity for intelligence? Is it upbringing? It doesn't really matter what it is, all that matters is that they can't \\"taste\\" The Hobbit. But those of us who can, can- and we love the taste. After all, we have no choice. These are people who would rather eat Aunt Jemima pancakes with fake syrup than have hot crepes rolled with fine preserves. Really, do the opinions of these people actually count? It is understood by many that an opinion is only an opinion- how untrue this is! In the legal world an opinion is something that is ruled and weighed to be best, to be most true. There _is_ such a thing as a good opinion, even the best opinion. And opinion can be right and an opinion can be wrong. I daresay that giving The Hobbit 3 stars is wrong. And why do I dare? Because if someone told us that cow manure tasted better than ice cream they would be wrong. The bottom line is this: Mozart is better than The Beetles; Ferraris are better than raced out Subarus and Ice Cream does, in fact, taste better than manure. If, like this idiot, you are a simpleton who can can neither hear, taste nor see then don't bother to post your opinions to the rest of us. Instead, take my advice and cozy yourself up with something you can understand like Harry Potter and let yourself float away to the world of un-imagination. You will be much happier and won't have to deal with the headaches of trying to figure out what Tolkien is trying to say, nor will you have to deal with the frustrations of not being able to see in full color and dimensions the Dwarves and Elves and Wizards they way that the rest of us can. I almost pity you, but then, you wasted 60 seconds of my life with degenerate reviews so on second thought, get out of my gene pool and stop breathing my air. It's people like you that make the rest of our lives so two-dimensional by preventing more work like The Hobbit from ever being created with your lack of understanding and abundance of stupidity.P.S. The Hobbit is a great book, arguably the greatest, certainly the greatest in its own league. It was written by an adult and is absolutely suitable for adults. The fact that it may also be enjoyed and understood by children is only a further credit to Tolkien's genius. Don't let the altogether too commonly found ramblings that this is a book for children discourage you from reading it if you haven't already. While not everyone is capable of enjoying it, it is criminal not to at least expose everyone to this book for anyone who is capable of enjoying it who is denied the oppurtunity has been cheated of one of the finest intellectual pleasures of this past century. My advice to you is to read it slowly and thoroughly. It is an experience like nothing else that will never be quite as magical the second time around.P.P.S. If you don't know what The Hobbit is about, in short, it is about Adventure. A great Adventure full of Swords and Magic; of Dwarves and of Elves and of Wizards and Hobbits; Good, Evil; Trolls and Goblins; Suspense, Excitement, Comedy and Tragedy; Music, Riddles and Poetry. All of this presented in one of the most unique styles of writing ever encountered; a style of writing that paints every detail of Tolkien's fantastic world in your mind as if you were there. Not a single word is wasted and every element of the story is to be enjoyed. If any of these things sound even remotely fascinating then read this book- you won't be disappointed.P.P.P.S. Comments about the illustrated versions for those trying to decide between the two illustrated versions of The Hobbit done by Alan Lee and Michael Hague: I recommend the Michael Hague edition hands down. The illustrations seem to fit the book much more than Lee's. Lee's anything but poor, but Mague's are more merry, bright and rich. The characters appear heartier and the colors set a better mood. More simply put, when I look at Lee's illustrations I feel like I'm standing in the dining room of somebody's grandmother- wallpaper, china dolls, lace and all- they just seem old and dry. Hague's characters, the dragon especially, seem more believable- when I turn the page I don't get a feeling like what I'm looking at is out of place. Another difference with Hague is that I am confident that anybody would enjoy his illustrations, but with Lee I merely see why some people 'might prefer it.' Hague really does have that illustration feeling I expect to see in a book; Lee's look like they belong on a museum wall. Also, I feel that Hague took a more direct interpretation of the book while Lee seemed to illustrate as he liked to fit his own style without much less regard to the book.

I was considering that I should read this series of books, since it is one of those classic \\"good versus evil\\" things that are never boring, and always tons of fun to read. Since it came out as a movie as well, I decided that I cannot hold it up longer, and started the series.The hobbit, for some of you who don't know, came first in 1937, before the wars, and it became the fourth best-selling novel ever. After it showing a lot of success, Tolkien decided to write series of book afterwards, which eventually became the infamous lord of the rings trilogy. The book (now a major motion picture) itself focuses on adventure and travel, giving you wonder and satisfaction as you read through them.The story goes on like this: there is this hobbit who goes by the name of Bilbo Baggins, who like any other hobbits, like their comfortable homes and teatime at 4 \`o clock, keeps things tidy and scheduled, and never goes out on adventures. Well, never till now since Mr. Baggins was the first one to ever be out on a grand- scale adventure and return with a lot of success. He goes out on a great and a dangerous quest with 13 other dwarves and a magician to reclaim the great city of dale from Smaug, the dragon. In the end he manages to lead the dwarves safely to the destination, finish the quest in the end, and returns home, living happily ever after.There are classic adventure funs to be read from the story, about trusts and friendships, magic and discovery, and all sort of that great stuff, so read this book to begin the whole lord of the rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Reading it as an adult, I found that there is much more to the story than when I read it as a teenager!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Awesome!

Better then the movie. Everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"&quot;First published in the United States more than sixty years ago, J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' has become one of the best-loved books of all time. Tolkien's fantasy was then adapted into a fully painted graphic novel, which became a classic in its own right...&quot;These words are found on the back of the graphic novel's cover, and I'm glad that's all they say about the possible quality of the book. Thankfully, the graphic novel isn't praised to be as equally good as the actual book, because while it is indeed good, it doesn't compare to Tolkien's early literary masterpiece.I'm not familiar with American graphic novels (Japanese manga is more my trade), so I can't fairly compare this graphic novel to other graphic novels. However, I can say that this book does make use of the term &quot;graphic novel&quot;: it runs somewhat like a comic book, using pictures, and is occasionally filled with excerpts of storytelling from the original book. So it's not really a comic book, and it's definately not a novel, so it most likely really is a graphic novel, but I really can't say for sure.The artwork of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; graphic novel is like everything else that's been used with the Middle-Earth licence: some will like it, some will hate it. The color scheme reminds me of an oil painting and the character designs appear somewhat &quot;old-school,&quot; although some people won't have any trouble with that style. To my knowledge, all of the story of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is in the graphic novel, but expect some scenes to be condensed. The pacing can be a little off, and sometimes things just happen out of the blue. Still, the execution of the entire graphic novel is very well done and, and it does manage to capture quite a bit of the believability of Tolkien's world of Middle-Earth.This is where the biggest problem arises. The graphic novel is good, but it is no substitute for the actual book. To read this graphic novel as a substitute for the book is like reading Cliff Notes in place of an enjoyable literary classic. It's interesting to read after reading the book, but that's it. Reading the graphic novel before the book and expecting to get the exact same experiece takes away a lot of the magic Tolkien created.All in all, this graphic novel is good, but it's nothing compared to the real deal. I recommend only reading this after reading the original book; to do otherwise would be denying to yourself the beauty and magic of Tolkien's early masterwork. It's a classic graphic novel, but nothing more."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There isn't much to say about a book that has a great story, magical yet believable characters, and a magical world full many a creature.

The last thing he wanted was to be involved in an adventure.

Now Bilbo will have to adjust to new situations daily as they encounter wolves, goblins, giant eagles and spiders, and other creatures just to get to the mountain. Once they get there, they have to face the fierce dragon. Can they survive?This is a fun adventure. It's very easy to feel for Bilbo as they face one obstacle after another. &quot;He thought of his home, not for the last time.&quot; I smiled every time I saw that line. My biggest complaint about the book is that it is a bit episodic in nature. Their many adventures don't seem that interrelated for most of the book. This is a minor issue, however, and it's very hard not to like the characters and root them on in their quest to reclaim their rightful place.I've read this book twice, and hope to get to the Lord of the Rings soon.

J.R.R. Tolkien brings you right into this amazing fantasy world. The book is mainly about a hobbit who lives in a hole. J.R.R. Tolkien puts in some awesome detail about his home. A hobbit is a humanlike creature that lives underground, smaller than a dwarf. The book starts when Gandalf, a mysterious wizard, and a group of dwarves visit the hobbit. They bring the hobbit on a long journey to defeat Smaug, a dragon that sleeps on gold and jewels. this book is action packed right from the thrid or so chapter. One of my favorite parts was when the hobbit fights many giant spiders. Any lover of fantasy books has to have read this. This book will keep you reading all the way through, the ending is awesome by the way, and Gandalf plays almost no part in the book but does in the other books from the series.

I loved Beorn and wished he was more integral to the whole story, but maybe he's in The Lord of the Rings (I've forgotten!).

This is what Bilbo Baggins from The Hobbit is trying to do. This exciting tale is written by J.R.R. Tolkien. Meticulous Bilbo goes through many challenges to get his gold, and has many near death experiences. The protagonist in this story is viewed through third person, or narrator form.This hobbit, being so little, having big padded feet, and curly hair as they all do, must face many challenges. One of them is meeting Gollum, a horrible, sneaky little creature who lives back in the caves of the goblins. First, the dwarves that are with Bilbo and of course Bilbo himself are running from the goblins where he is knocked out. Second, when he wakes up he finds a ring and decides to go looking for the others. After walking quite a ways in the darkness he steps into something cold. At this time he meets Gollum. This creature then makes a deal with him...If Biblo wins a riddle game, Gollum won't eat him... if Bilbo doesn't win the game Gollum will eat him. Do you think Gollum is going to play a trick, or as Gollum would say, \\"play a tricksy\\" on Bilbo?Another exciting part is when Bilbo is like a kidnapper during the story. Bilbo is on the verge of being caught when he thinks up a plan to help his crew that he is with to get the treasure. He must get each of them and help them out of being captured. His plan is to get into barrels left over from food and drinks that are put into a river. Then they are floated to near the crew's destination. Will they make it?Ladies and gentlemen invite you to read The Hobbit. It is a wonderful book, and I encourage you to read it. So if you want to see if he out lasts Gollum and resists getting caught, read The Hobbit!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"When Bilbo opened his eyes, he wondered if he had; for it was just as dark as ebony with them shut. No one was near him. He could feel nothing, see nothing, except for the stone of the floor.\\" In The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, the protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, a meticulous hobbit, finds himself in an adventure. Bilbo has to go along with thirteen dwarves and a wizard, named Gandalf, to slay a dragon named Smog. They have to slay Smog because he stole treasure from the dwarves many years ago.An exiting part of The Hobbit is when Bilbo finds a ring when he was left behind in the goblins' tunnels. \\"His head was swimming, and he was far from certain even of the direction they (the dwarves, Gandalf, and himself) had been going in when he had his fall. He guessed as well as he could, and crawled along for a good way, until suddenly his hand met what felt like a tiny ring of metal lying on the floor of the tunnel. He put the ring in his pocket almost without thinking...\\" What is this ring? Is it any importance to Bilbo? Read The Hobbit to find out more.Another exiting scene is when Bilbo first sees Gollum. \\"Deep down by the dark waters lived old Gollum, a small slimy creature, as dark as darkness, except for two big, round, pale eyes that glowed like telescopes in his thin face. Gollum got into his boat and shot off from the tiny island in the middle of the lake; while Bilbo was sitting on the brink altogether flummoxed and at the end of is way and wits. Suddenly, up came Gollum he whispered and hissed, \`Bless us and splash us my precioussss! I guess it's a choice feast; at least a tasty morsel it'd make us, gollum!' When he said \\"gollum\\" he made a horrible swallowing noise in his throat. That is how he got his name, though he always called himself, \\"my precious.\\"Those are only two small parts of his adventure because he still has to beat his final challenge, Smog the dragon. What will be the fate of Bilbo? Will he survive or be barbecued alive? Tune into The Hobbit to find out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a delightful tale about a single hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who breaks away from his normal, every-day hobbit-life to go on an adventure. Not that he exactly wanted to go on any adventures, which are very frowned upon by the hobbit society, mind you, but the crafty wizard Gandalf rather tricked him into it. So, Bilbo left behind his normal life and hobbit-hole and joined his companions to start their journey, \\"one fine morning just before May.\\"Throughout the story, I really enjoyed reading J.R.R. Tolkien's descriptions of people, objects, and even situations. The descriptions really allowed a reader to draw a fantastic picture in his head, while, at the same time, didn't put up too many walls or restrictions as to not allow much, if any, room for variations in different people's perceptions. From his head-to-toe description of a hobbit to his inside-and-out description of the Baggins' residence, Mr. Tolkien really makes the reader become a part of the story through his descriptions.I also liked the plot line in its entirety. Mr. Tolkien was able to keep things moving and keep the reader wanting to read, but, also, allow some parts to be less action oriented through his use of suspense. He didn't make the characters run into problems left and right during every leg of their journey, yet he wouldn't slow things down so much that he would cause the reader to lose interest either.The last thing I would like to point out that I liked in particularly was Mr. Tolkien's use of riddles in different parts of the story. In fact, Bilbo and Gollum's \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" chapter was one of my favorite parts of the book. I found it very fun, though also very challenging at times, to play along and try to figure out each riddle before reading on to see if I was correct. Also, another riddling part of the book that I enjoyed was when Bilbo spoke to Smaug in a very riddling manner.Though I liked most of Mr. Tolkien's style of writing and use of riddles, I found some parts a little hard to follow at times. \\"There a warm welcome was made them...\\" is one example. Not that it was necessarily all that hard to follow, more so that I don't hear talk like that very often, and it was a little odd to hear at first.Now, like I said, The Hobbit is about Mr. Bilbo Baggins who is pulled away from his home in The Hill and ventures past The Water when Thorin and Company hires him as a burglar. Everything starts out well enough and they make their way towards their destination. But, things make a turn for the worse when they run into three rather unpleasant fellows in the woods. They manage to push on, though, and get a nice rest, thanks to Elrond, before running into their next hardship. I'm talking, of course, about their run-in with a not-so-nice crowd on the Misty Mountains. Yet, somehow, they even manage to make it though that little skirmish, and Bilbo even picks up a little something along the way. However, Bilbo and the gang are far from safe, even after getting away from those whose acquaintances they had made on the Misty Mountains. Yes, once they had escaped the dangers of the Misty Mountains, they really found themselves up a tree! But, luckily, thanks to a little outside help, they made it safely to the home of Beorn, where they stayed for a short time before venturing further. All this and poor Bilbo and his companions still haven't made their way through the awful Mirkwood Forest, the marshes on the far side of it, or the valley of Dale, where the Lonely Mountain and the terrible Smaug himself awaited!Overall, I really enjoyed this book, and I would have to say that it's the best book that I have read, to this day. I would recommend this book to all who enjoy action, adventure, suspense, and a good plot line. However, I would also recommend that those who do decide to read The Hobbit have a good imagination and brush up on their knowledge of certain fantastical creatures, such as dwarves, elves, trolls, goblins, and wargs, a bit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit\\" to me was one of the best books I have ever read.

And I think it is a great introduction into the life-thrilling books of the \\"Lord of the Rings!\\" I would say that if anyone likes adventure, surprises, and excitement they should read this book.

Lee was one of two Tolkien illustrators called by Peter Jackson for the making of the trilogy film, The Lord of the Rings. His brilliance shines through in the recreation of Rivendell and the warm feel of Hobbiton. As a life-long fan of the Lord of the Rings, I have never been disappointed by Lee's interpretation of a scene or character. His artistic skill hits the mark dead center every time on every concept. In fact, his is one artist of a few (if not the only one) who are officially recognized by Tolkien's estate as a bard of Middle Earth. Therefore, the illustrations in this beautiful edition of a great book by the 20th century's best author are bound to appeal to you as you read it. In this book, the arguing trolls are just as I've imagined them, and the dwarves are like real people, not plump bodies with noses the size of their heads. The eagles, too, are glorious.

Personally, I've never been quite sure why a single book would be in a box, but I suppose it does protect the lovely gold embossed cover with Tolkein's runes all over it. The full page color reproductions of Tolkien's watercolor illustrations also really added to the quality of this edition of the book. Some of them are very pretty, and were not present in my smaller copy of The Hobbit. This is definietly the collector's edition, not the small portable copy to read in waiting rooms.It had been a while since I had read The Hobbit, so it was nice to refresh my memory of the story before seeing the movie. It has a little introduction in the beginning, which may have originally come from the Lord of the Rings, explaining dwarves and that orc and goblin are interchangable terms. I would say this edition is well worth the cost for an enthusiast willing to wait for it to come out of backorder. If you haven't read The Hobbit before, you should, whether you buy this or another copy, but be warned: there is a lot of singing and other poetry. Even the orcs sing at least once, which is odd, even if it is about torture and cannibalism and other orcish topics."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It was a great book, and I've always enjoyed adventurous ones,but this one seemed to really catch the idea of true adventure.

It is relatively short, yet plants the seeds for the huge trilogy that follows, as well as telling a ripping good tale. Get it and read it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was able to get this wonderful book for $11. I will not comment on the story more than to say that it is truly a great story. Tolkien sure makes the story come alive as you read it.The focus will be on the materialistic part of the book. The cover is truly beautiful. Gold, green, red. It is covered with dwarfish rune language. The paper on which the book is printed is high quality. It is thicker than regular paper and even feels good to touch.The animations are in beautiful colorings on special photo paper. There is for example a picture of Rivendale, very similar to this: [...], however, it comes across even more beautiful in the book than it does on the screen of my Macbook Pro.I bought it for $11 which is a great price for this beautiful piece of art. I noticed when I wrote this review that it is $18, which is a lot higher (63%). The raise in price is most likely due to the Hobbit being out in theater. I am not sure that the price will go down. I would like to guess that the price will go down in a few months (unless the DVD and Blu-Ray release of the movie spikes the demand in Hobbit related products). If you would wait close to a year, I am afraid that the release of the second Hobbit movie would increase the demands, and thus the price of this book again.Recommendation: Buy it. If not now, in a few months (before the DVD/Blu-Ray release)."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Enchanting! Intriguing and written to appeal to any age.

I was surprised by the ending and can't wait to see what they do with the movies."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"IntroductionThis is a fantasy story written by J. R. R. Tolkien prior to the Lord of the Rings trilogy and sets the stage somewhat for the Lord of the Rings (LOTR). The Hobbit is not so much a prequel as it is a story set in the same fictional universe of Middle Earth.One interesting note is that the Hobbit took 20 years to write, while the LOTR trilogy took 16 years. What gives the stories such richness is that very fact. Tolkien took great pains to set the backdrop for each story.Book HighlightsThere are definite points of similarity between the two works. For example the ring that Bilbo finds is the same ring in LOTR that is known as the \\"Ring of Power\\". In the Hobbit, the ring functions mainly as a means of escape and evasion for Bilbo. It enables him to escape from the character Gollum for example. In the LOTR trilogy, the ring has grown in power and calls out to Sauron (its rightful owner). The ring in the Hobbit only seems to have the power of invisibility, given to the wearer. By comparing the two (LOTR and the Hobbbit) the ring is not dangerous to wear for Bilbo, but by the time Frodo is chosen as the ring bearer in LOTR, the ring places the wearer in great danger. It attracts the ring-wraiths (ghost riders that serve Sauron).(Warning Spoilers Below)Gandalf also figures prominently in the Hobbit. His function is to select Bilbo to play the role of burglar in the company of the Dwarfs. Their mission is to recover the stolen treasure that Smaug the Dragon had taken away from the Dwarf people. Bilbo is of course very clever and does help the Dwarfs out of some close scrapes. Gandalf helps the party out as well throughout the book. All in all, their mission is successful. They do in the end free the treasure and Smaug is killed by an archer in the nearby Lake Town.Book EvaluationI think the Hobbit is a very engrossing fantasy story. Tolkien pioneered the genre. It makes sense that he took 20 years to write the tale. The main characteristic of this type of book is its believability. It immerses the reader fully in the story. It immediately draws the reader in to care about the characters and the plot. Tolkien was without a doubt a genius and wrote with a very high level of skill. While there are some differences in emphasis between the LOTR and the Hobbit, the two stories do tie together well. I would say what would have improved the Hobbit is to have added some foreshadowing of the rise of Sauron and show the evil power behind the ring. Whether or not you might like to read in the fantasy genre, I would recommend this book to everyone. This is one of the best examples in this genre, and is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventure, the story was very well believable and easy to follow."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book was great and i just love the golem part when he always says my precious and the the riddle game"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I REALLY LOVE THIS STORY.

At the moment of writing the author was Professor of Astronomy and Geometry at the University of Cambridge. In this book the lives of 18 astronomers are discribed, some of them are known to everyone, but some are not so generally known. The book starts with an introduction of a few pages on the history of astronomy.A list of the astronomers featured in this book:PTOLEMY, COPERNICUS, TYCHO BRAHE, GALILEO, KEPLER, ISAAC NEWTON, FLAMSTEED, HALLEY, BRADLEY, WILLIAM HERSCHEL, LAPLACE, BRINKLEY, JOHN HERSCHEL, THE EARL OF ROSSE, AIRY, HAMILTON, LE VERRIER, ADAMS.To give an idea of the content and style of writing I copy the first two phrases of the first astronomer featured in this book, Ptolemy:The career of the famous man whose name stands at the head of thischapter is one of the most remarkable in the history of humanlearning. There may have been other discoverers who have done morefor science than ever Ptolemy accomplished, but there never has beenany other discoverer whose authority on the subject of the movementsof the heavenly bodies has held sway over the minds of men for solong a period as the fourteen centuries during which his opinionsreigned supreme.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of astronomy or science, and of course to everybody who is interested in any of the astronomers depicted in this book. I did find the manner in which this book was written quite dull and lifeless ('2-stars'), but because of the information it gives (worth '4-stars') I give it a '3-star' review."},{"Title":"Great astronomers","review":"Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance. Sorry I can't be of more help but it will be a while before I do. The title caught my eye!"},{"Title":"Great astronomers","review":"I found this book fascinating covering 2000 years in the history of astronomy, and I enjoyed the rather quaint 19th century writing style. It explained the physics very well so that I was able to understand better such phenomena as the movements of heavenly bodies and the effects of their gravity however small, the precession of the equinoxes, the invention of the calculus. The discovery of Neptune was an amazing story. Knowledge was gradually accumulated over the centuries due to the hard work, dedication - often lifelong - and brilliance of these astronomers. Their biographies were most interesting as well. Over the last 110 years since this book was written our knowledge has increased exponentially."},{"Title":"The complete illustrated book of the psychic sciences (Pocket book)","review":"PREMISE & NATURE OF THE BOOKThis book concisely describes 17 types of \\"psychic sciences\\" (i.e. astrology, cartomancy, colorology, dice, dominoes, dreams, graphology, moleosophy, numerology, palmistry, phrenology, physiognomy, radiesthesia, tasseography, superstitions/omens, telepathy/ESP, yoga, etc. Despite the title, I have a problem calling these sciences. In a survey published in the Winter 2001 issue of Acquisition Review Quarterly, the Journal of the Defense Acquisition University (page 68), 77% of responders agreed that \\"The word \\"science\\" must be restricted to those fields in which archival history, established laws, adequate empirical evidence, and adequate metrics have been established to form a science.\\" Only 23% agreed that \\"Academics should be free to call any subject that they choose a \\"science\\" with no institutionally established requirements and standards for linguistic quality control.\\" The authors do, however, caveat a number of entries as lacking empirical validation or being unscientific--i.e. superstitions. Still, as a popular book, this one contains no bibliography, references, footnotes, or authors' bios though there is an index.COMMENTS ON SELECTED INDIVIDUAL TOPICSOf course, the coverage of individual topics is somewhat limited, however, judicious use of drawings, figures, & charts greatly enhances this work. It does not, however, include Runes (e.g.The Book of Runes, 25th Anniversary Edition) or the I Ching (The I Ching or Book of Changes). Also, it doesn't address the meanings of the Tarot's Major Arcana (seeThe Complete Guide to the Tarot). In the large chapter on Astrology, the authors chose to ignore Uranus, Neptune, & Pluto (Pluto (American Federation of Astrologers)) as well as planetary aspects, elements, etc. (The New A to Z Horoscope Maker and Delineator (Revised and Expanded)) On the other hand, they include ruling planets of day & year. Some of their descriptions seem to disagree with some other astrology books I've read--as do some entries on colors (e.g. interviewee dress recommendations etc. though their comments on p. 111: the colors in national flags of allied/axis powers in WWI & II were most interesting. It was also very interesting that number readings were not consistent across various methods (e.g. dice vs. dominoes).MY FAVORITE PARTSI especially liked their many telepathy/clairvoyance experiments pp. 331-334, some of which (e.g. #14 and pp. 423-4: example #11) appeared to be double blind--which reminded me of telepathy/clairvoyance tests very scientifically and successfully performed as reported in the Transactions of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers some years ago. The need for double blindness is easily shown from the Amazing Hans demonstration in which a horse was apparently able to multiply when given two numbers by its owner. Upon filming and viewing it closely, investigators discovered a \\"tell\\" by which the horse, watching its owner, merely detected when he wished the horse to stop stomping the ground--providing the correct answer. Furthermore, the authors astutely point out that:p. 235: \\"As an authority succinctly puts it: 'Every number has a certain power which is not expressed by the figure or symbol employed to denote quantity only. This power rests in an occult connection between the relation of things and the principles in nature of which they are the expression.'\\"I'd be more comfortable, however, if the authors had provided some reference to where they obtained the contents of this book!"},{"Title":"The complete illustrated book of the psychic sciences (Pocket book)","review":"The Complete book of Psychic sciences is an excellent beginner to the young aspiring diviner.

She was constantly argumentative and all-knowing with decidedly modern sensibilities. There was nothing - and I mean nothing - she couldn't attempt, handle or do. I got so tired of her. The hero, Lord Chance, was more interesting. However, he couldn't save the book."},{"Title":"The Nabob's Daughter","review":"It's amazing how two authors can take the same plot device, and one does it so very well, and the other--umm, not so well. The one done well was 'Taming of the Shrew' by good old Will, who wasn't afraid to use humor in the telling. This version, however, just goes on and on and on and on! With NO humor. Well, that may not be quite true. The author did take great pains to attach tag lines in nearly every paragraph, saying 'she said with amusement'. Or, 'amusement lit up her eyes' or something similar. But that doesn't make it funny!And--after 240 pages or so of this constant arguing and bickering and author explanation of the arguing and bickering, a two-month or so voyage to Jamaica on a fairly small cargo ship, when the hero and heroine are the only two non-crew persons aboard,(although of course, as the owner's daughter, she was perfectly capable of sailing the ship, just as she could run the sugar plantation, and the rum distillery and the home farm and several other businesses, while the hero was just a useless aristocratic parasite, although with nice shoulders!), being ship-wrecked near their destination, and having to cross the island on foot, complete with her broken something (arm, leg, whatever--I was too bored and disgusted with her hard-headedness to pay attention by this time) they're still 'Miss Cantrell' and 'my lord' before they fall into each others arm's on the last page--with amusement, of course! Bah, humbug.I've read other books by this author that I quite liked, but this one just didn't make it."},{"Title":"The Nabob's Daughter","review":"Anjalie Cantrell, a rich merchant's daughter from Jamaica, crosses words with the homely, arrogant and stuffy Viscount, Lord Chance. Anjalie tries to make everyone dance to her tune. Even Lord Chance admits to that and, too bad for the reader, they are not very interesting or reasonable tunes at that. Is Anjalie supposed to be considered smart because she gets people to do what she wants? It was tiring to have to read 230 pages of what is supposed to be considered wit and good writing. Anjalie and Lord Chance were both arrogant, his sister just simply stupid and the plot actually boring. Where was the humor? Darcy wearing a foot-wide cravat? While most regencies or love stories in general need a plot that enables the characters to develop their relationship, one in which the hero and heroine constantly aruge seems a waste of space. They do not even seem to like each other and why should they? I wouldn't. Fortunately, most people do not conduct their courting that way."},{"Title":"The Nabob's Daughter","review":"Immediately upon opening the book, I was confounded by the title. After all, what is a Nabob? Is it a fish? An eskimo? It would be helpful to have a definition in parentheses on the cover for us &quot;lesser informed&quot; people. The description of the run-down conditions in Jamaica was accurate, I can tell since I went to Jamaica last year. The vivid descriptions of English brothels stirred my imagination and brought the book to life. The character of Anjalie is very unique, as her split personality adds a lot of flavor to the book. I mean, when you have a Jamaican girl that's nice and dainty by day yet a vampire by night...you can see what I mean. While reading the book I grew to sympathize with the drunken pirates abducted by Lord Chance and forced to dance the macarena aboard Captain Blackbeard's hearty sea vessel. All in all a great book to read if you enjoy pirates, brothels, an rampant sex."},{"Title":"The Nabob's Daughter","review":"Jamaican by birth, Anjalie is a wealthy heiress visiting relatives in London. After her success in the ton, she could easily make an advantageous marriage, but, scornful of the fortune-hunting beaus who surround her and the superficial lifestyle of the English upper class, she wants only to return to life in Jamaica.The oh-so-proper Lord Chance is scandalized by Anjalie's plain speaking and shocking attitudes. She should not even KNOW about the seamier side of life, let alone go around rescuing lightskirts from rakes and talking about drunken pirates!But, oddly enough, he finds himself drawn to her outspoken manner and lack of pretension. For the first time in his life he begins to question his own lifestyle and beliefs. But when he believes that she encouraged his sister to run away to Jamaica to join her disgraced &quot;fianc&eacute;,&quot; he is ready to wring her neck. It is only when Anjalie and the earl are shipwrecked in the wilds of Jamaica that the two begin to truly understand and appreciate each other.Since Regencies with headstrong, independent heroines have always appealed to me, I found myself glued to the pages of &quot;The Nabob's Daughter.&quot; In the beginning, the hero seemed a bit stuffy and overly critical, but the trek through the jungle caused him to realize the relative worthlessness of most of the London society's strictures and appreciate the more important things in life.

One of my favorite stastements is on page 13, made by his father when someone showed him the book &#34;Baryshnikov at Work&#34;, (Knopf 1976) it actualy brought tears to my eyes, his father fatally ill in Sverdlo suffering from a brain disease. The sight of the book seemed to revive a forgotten memory. With tears in his eyes, he turned the page and suddenly said, quite distinctly: &#34;My little son.....my pride&#34;...... It gives you a sense of how much his father loved him. There are a lot of wonderful things in the book. It also give you a knowledge of how the Soviet Union was at the time.

However, be forwarned, that in spite of the misleading claims on the packaging of these cassettes, labeling them an &quot;unabridged classic&quot;, this is actually a significantly ABRIDGED version of the play. &quot;Unabridged&quot; here apparently means they have not shortened the production by the Canadian Broadcasting Company that is presented on the cassettes. This version of the play is also &quot;adapted for audio&quot; by speaking stage directions in a number of places, or making other changes in the text so the listener without a transcript can better know what is going on. Some may find this useful, but Shakespeare purists will definitely want to look elsewhere for a recording of this play."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra (The Pelican Shakespeare)","review":"This cassette version of Shakespeare's play about two strong-willed individuals whose passion for each other leads to their downfall is magnificently done. Anthony Quayle, who does a hilarious Falstaff on other recordings in the Caedemon series, plays a heroic but flawed Antony who is all too aware of his captivity to Cleopatra, and yet unable to break free of her. Pamela Brown is equally fine as the imperious, manipulative Cleopatra. The rest of the cast is similarly superb, especially Jack Gwillim as Enobarbus. The recording, originally made in 1963, receives an excellent remastering in this cassette reissue; the sound quality is fantastic."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra (The Pelican Shakespeare)","review":"This performance is billed as abridged but is infinitely more complete than the one amazon labels unabridged. To the extent that any of the Caedmon performances differ from whatever text you have in front of you, they are merely adhering to one editorial reading than another--several times I have listened to a Shakespeare Recording Society production and heard passages not printed in my complete edition of Shakespeare (Riverside). I have never been disappointed in either the quality of the text or performance in a Caedmon recording (or Arkangel for that matter). The main shortcoming of the Caedmon series is in the audio quality and if you can make allowances for that, you will find in these an excellent perspective on Shakespeare's art."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra (The Pelican Shakespeare)","review":"We all know the play. Everyone's read it, at least parts in school. But not everyone gets to read an edition so well edited, so finely crafted by such an editorial craftsman as Adam Frost. Were it not for the Frostian touch, Shakespeare in this play might just seem like another hack Elizabethan dramatist. But here, the words sing and soar. Frost has the ability to dramatize page numbers and italic type. Of whom else can one say, &quot;That is the most perfectly placed editorial thought I've ever encountered? What a pleasure!&quot; I heartily recommend this superbly edited volume."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra (The Pelican Shakespeare)","review":"Not one of Shakespeare's more memorable works, there are some pluses to this play and relatively few minuses, but neither the pluses nor the minuses are anything that stands out. It is nice to have yet another play told in Shakespeare's beautiful language, and enjoyable to see a love story that centers on people old enough to no longer be in the first blush of youth, even if they ARE still young enough to be beautiful and virile. On the other hand, I'd have liked to see these more mature lovers BEHAVING somewhat more maturely, instead of being just as frivolous, headstrong, and foolish as the kids in &quot;Romeo And Juliet&quot;, and there really aren't any lines from this play that come immediately to mind as having entered the &quot;Quotes Hall Of Fame&quot;, as so many lines from Shakespeare's plays have. Nothing on the order of &quot;A horse! My Kingdom for a horse!&quot; or &quot;Alas, poor Yorick; I knew him well.&quot; or &quot;To be or not to be, that is the question&quot;, or so many others.If you enjoy Shakespearean plays, you'll probably enjoy this one. But there's no real reason for anyone but a completist to read this."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra (The Pelican Shakespeare)","review":"Do not buy this if you want this to listen to in the car.

It's a must-read for anyone interested in this group."},{"Title":"Memoirs of an Italian Terrorist","review":"With all the chatter about terrorism, this little book fills a gap with its unique insight into the mind of a terrorist. Written by an unnamed young man who joins a terrorist cell in Italy, this book neither glamorizes the life of a terrorist, nor does it condemn it.For anyone who wants to try to understand what might motivate someone to become a terrorist, this book is approachable. Since the author is a European, readers might find it easier to identify with him."},{"Title":"A Little Learning (An Inspector Peach Mystery)","review":"When the Director of the University of Eastern Lancashire is discovered dead with a bullet in his head, the relentless and intimidating figure of Detective Inspector Percy Peach jumps into action. His interviewing technique is pure genius as he gleans every possible scintilla of information from his subject.This is a classic police procedural as DI Peach visits suspect after suspect and slowly puts together the puzzle of who murdered Claptrap Clark. The entertainment lies in Peach's interviewing style, an elaborate act which is designed to keep his adversary unbalanced and in a constant state of nervousness.Hilarious scenes are provided intermittently throughout the book when Peach reports to his superior, Superintendent Thomas Tucker. Showing as little respect as possible, putting forward outrageous theories and baiting his boss at every opportunity, I found myself looking forward to every meeting with ever greater enthusiasm.This is a terrific book that provides a very well constructed mystery, investigated by a character who provides consistent entertainment. It's part of a series of books featuring Inspector Peach, which is good news because one book of Peach is definitely not enough."},{"Title":"A Little Learning (An Inspector Peach Mystery)","review":"This was a very fun read set in British academia.

I can always remember seeing it. My Dad is now 77 years old. It travelled with him from the UK to Jamaica, where he and my mum has returned home and retired. He kept money, reciepts, papers etc in this book. I was visiting my parents over the weekend and wanted something to read, I asked him if I could read it. I have read Susan Jeffers and Iyanla Vanzant and many others, but this book is brilliant. As old has it is it, it has not dated in my opinion. The concerns that one had when this book was written has not dated. I said to my Dad I could not have read and understood this book if I did not have some life experiences of my own. It is a very deep and profound book"},{"Title":"The Art of Selfishness","review":"My Mother and Father said it the wrong way. They told me to share and not be selfish.What they should have said is share don't be greedy. Because of the way it was put I have had a negative outlook at the word selfish.It made my life hard to fulfill, and being raised as a Catholic it was compounded even more. The Catholic Church pushes its impression of the Bible, and is always telling us to give more then we do, to dig deep and give more.I met a woman in my church; her husband is in the Army Reserves and is serving over seas. She has a small child and is living in a place with holes in the walls and not sure where her next meal is coming from. She gives more then she can afford each week for collection, keeps enough money to light a candle some times. She needs to just keep all the money and take care of her family and herself first. I believe God does not care how much you sacrifice, but how much you believe in him. Self sacrifice is to me a lot like suicide and that is one thing that will definitely keep you out of his grace.This book helped me to look at the some of the stories that made me think I was selfish, and see them in another light. For example the last days of Christ, after the last supper he went in to the woods and prayed to his Father to give him strength to do what he had to do, instead of what the Apostles wanted of him, spend his last hours with them, By doing what he wanted, and not what they wanted, this gave him the strength to fulfill his destiny. He then gave to us so much more then could have ever been thought of.People would describe me as the kind of person that would give the shirt off my back for someone I don't even know. This book has shown me this is self destructive and hurts me and the ones I care the most about. I found out taking the shirt off my own back would only weaken me. I should just go get a shirt out of the closet, give it to them, one I don't need, not the one I was wearing. When I take the shirt off my own back, I could get cold and can get sick, then the ones I care about have to give of themselves to help me get better, and the one I gave the shirt to now needs a coat. It is good for me to give but not when it hurts me or the ones I care about.I have found myself in the past in a relationship for 18 years that was destructive to me, because it was with a taker, and she was greedy and kept taking and only gave back the least amount as possible just to keep me around so I would keep giving to her. Looking back, most of the things she gave me she did not give me at all, she just let me get it myself.An old saying is when you smile the whole world smiles with you, what a wonderful gift, a smile. This book has helped me to see something, the only way to smile is from the inside out; the only to do that is to remember I am the most important person on this earth. If I want to give to the ones I love I have to have something to give.I hope you will get out of this book as I did. If so and it helps you to start being happy, then when you are done give it to someone you care about we all know someone like me and hope they can start being happy inside of themselves, by keeping what they deserve, not giving it all away.I have learned it is not all about just giving, but sharing, sharing is taking too. I had a relationship with a giver, a wonderful person; I believe I messed some things up by not knowing how to receive, except gifts, take.So for me I believe life is give and take, balance. I am going try taking, as well as giving, but keep enough for myself, hope I never get greedy, and to keep the takers out of my life, I want to be happy too."},{"Title":"The Art of Selfishness","review":"Profound!

Where her father had doubts, however, Elspeth had none, and when her father died, freeing her from a life of little more than studious servitude, she gathered up her meager funds, screwed up her courage, and left her home in Scotland to traverse an ocean and cross a country. From civilization to the grim practicality and dusty lawlessness that defines the Arizona Territory in 1870, Elspeth traveled, intent on her dream, intent on finding Kantalan...and intent on convincing Dominic Delaney, a rogue of questionable recent history but the one man her father thought knew of Kantalan, to take her there.Hunted by hired mercenaries for years after a gunfight that left a vengeful man's son dead, regardless of the fairness of the fight or the son's instigation, gunman Dominic Delaney has given up everything of value in his life, including his beloved family home, Killara, to keep his family safe. He eschews the homestead, residing instead in a whorehouse in Hell's Bluff, Arizona, making a living playing cards and spending his nights enjoying female companionship. Always looking over his shoulder. Always expecting a bullet in his chest. It's a hard life that's left him jaded and cynical, but when Elspeth shows up in town, doggedly persistent in her attempts to get him to do her bidding, Dominic's normal laconic nature gets a rude slap.Queerly captivated by the obviously innocent young woman, Dominic has no intention of leading her anywhere but to his bed, yet he's quick to realize one painful but salient truth: for all her innocence, Elspeth is a force to be reckoned with, and her stubborn intensity about the fabled city and dreams of the treasure of history is a juggernaut that not even his self preservation can withstand. But leading her to Kantalan could very well be a suicide mission. If the mercenaries don't find and kill them, the ancient prophecy of a city lost to the ages and guarded by a pernicious god just might.For years I've read and enjoyed Iris Johansen's suspense novels with absolutely no clue that she'd started out with romance years earlier. Shame on me; good on Loveswept for resurrecting this fantastic historical romance originally published in 1988. What a treat this sweeping saga of romance, treasure hunting, and frontier life turned out to be!It's no surprise just how excellent Johansen is at the craft of writing, what did surprise is how completely captivated I became by the characters here and the story told. There were plenty of issues stacked against the book because of my reading preferences. I'm not a huge fan of historical novels, I don't particularly care for the landscape of the Southwest as a book setting, and I can pretty much take or leave frontier novels set in the Wild West. I was drawn to this book solely because I enjoy a good archaeological adventure a la Indiana Jones.What I got instead was a breathless novel that shined a harsh but grimly accurate view on life in a place and at a time that was hard, sometimes cruel, and utterly unforgiving, with characters that were complex, layered, and only as good, most of the time, as they had to be to survive. Unless being bad paid better. I fell in love with Elspeth, whose feisty determination and courage despite the unimaginable dangers was as inspiring as it was exciting to experience, even when she was being a bit of a termagant. It took me a bit longer to warm up to Dominic, the boozing, whoring discontent who at one point set out to abscond with and rape Elspeth in punishment for some manly slight. He wasn't always a very nice guy, and while I appreciated the feel of historical accuracy and believability given his backstory, he didn't satisfy me as the romantic male lead until well into the book.I was also surprised at how little of the novel actually included the archaeological adventure and search for Kantalan. Especially after the prologue of the book. That was my one genuine complaint with the novel, actually. Getting to the point of Elspeth and Dominic's journey to Kantalan seemed to take an awfully long time, with a tremendous amount of character development and world building preceding it.I can't really complain too much about that, though, as one of the facets of the novel that made it truly shine for me was the vibrancy and depth awarded the secondary characters. Dominic's nephew Patrick and Patrick's unacknowledged cousin Silver, in particular, added so much to the story and were such fascinating characters that no sooner did I finish this book than I immediately wished I had another with them featured in it. Their stories practically begged to be told and continued even as their lives mixed and mingled - often painfully - with those of main characters Dominic and Elspeth.Still, as much as I adored them, and admired the realistic touches of historical accuracy that the racial tensions evidenced, I was perplexed at how long it took to get to really deal with Kantalan and the too-expeditious manner in which it was done. And as the progression of a genuine romantic relationship between Dom and Elspeth didn't really dig in until just before that trip, a little too much of the book felt more like a battle of wills between two powerful contenders than a historical romance.Of course, when the romance did kick into high gear I was swept away again by the sensual intensity and chemistry between the characters and loved every moment of their time together.There was so very much to appreciate in this layered, detailed, authentic-feeling historical romance. I'm so annoyed with myself that I had no idea these books existed before I became a fan of the Eve Duncan series. I'm dying to read more about this complex and sometimes tragic clan of Delaneys, and can only hope Loveswept takes pity on this new but rabid fan and continues to release the rest of the Johansen books that feature this proud but flawed family. Hey, I'm willing to beg. Dignity is so overrated.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Loveswept, an imprint of Random House Publishing Group, via NetGalley.

(And at such a price, too!) This was one of my favorites, back in the day.This historical is leisurely, melodramatic, occasionally amusing and heart breaking, with plenty of passion, both repressed and expressed. It is an old fashioned good time, in that it is pure escapism. Even when shedding a few tears, you are having a good time.Although she hit it big with thrillers, Johansen started with romances; specifically, with the Loveswept Categories. And books about the Delaney family, with authors Hooper and Preston, were probably among her best. They led to these bigger and better works, and I personally can't wait for all of them to come out on Kindle.Enjoy."},{"Title":"This Fierce Splendor (Delaney Dynasty, 1)","review":"This Fierce Splendor by Iris Johansen e ISBN: 978-0-307-79894-7The story starts out in Kantalan, Mexico 1517 A.D. A colony of people living there worshiped the god, Ra. Sayan was a clairana and she had angered the priest by not keeping herself pure, she had fallen in love with Dalkar.

I have since purchased the whole series. Loved them all. Only one is on audible books however and one on kindle. I would like to see the whole series available on both."},{"Title":"This Fierce Splendor (Delaney Dynasty, 1)","review":"Elspeth MacGregor has come to Hell's Bluff in the Arizona Territory in search of Dominic Delaney, the infamous gunslinger. Convinced that Dominic can help her find the lost city of Katalan, the hidden city and lost civilization that she had dreamed about since she was a little girl. Elspeth will go out of her way to convince Dominic to take her to Katalan. What she never expected was the few friendships to be made, discovering just how strong and brave she could be and maybe, an unexpected love.This is my second Love-swept book and my first time reading anything by Iris Johansen. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but really struggled with the prologue. It left me feeling a little confused as if I just stepped into the middle of a story with characters and a very old city that I needed to know more about. Though it left me scratching my head, it all came together toward the end where I was finally able to make sense of those first few pages. If anyone comes across that same feeling as I did in the prologue, hold on and keep reading. The puzzle pieces fit together nicely.This book was originally published in 1988 and I am so glad it was republished and put in front of my face. I get so caught up in the many books that are being released currently, that I'm missing out on older published books that contain great stories I cannot wait to pick up some more Love-swept romances.Elspeth was a great character. Shy, timid and very insecure. She did a lot of growing in this book and I loved watching her become more comfortable with herself. She was determined to be strong and brave and after enduring the emotional abuse of a father who never respected her or thought much of her, it was easy to see why she thought of herself as plain and unlovable.Dominic Delaney on the other hand, saw something in Elspeth upon first meeting. She was stubborn and he had a spark of admiration for her. Dominic first comes off as harsh and mean and at times, I was at war with myself on whether or not I even liked his character. I liked hearing his thoughts and feelings on Elspeth, but then he would open his mouth and say something that made me want to hit him over the head, or his actions didn't feel right. When it came down to it, Dominic was fighting his feelings and trying to keep her at bay. His heart was in war with his conscious and his body was at war with both. He wanted something he didn't think he deserved. Dominic had a bad boy image and reputation, but he was also a very loving and sensitive man and it was easy to see when we had a glimpse of the real Dominic. It showed in the sacrifices he made to protect his family and the love he had for Killara and the family homestead. He feels an instant attraction to Elspeth and fights it for fear he will ruin her. Dominic Delaney has had a price on his head for 10 years, for killing a man in a fair fight. The man's father had set out hired mercenaries to revenge his son. After being careless not long before, Dominic lost a Friend whose death was used to draw him out. He is now convinced anyone he loves could be in danger, which is why Dominic is so guarded.I loved seeing how Elspeth affected Dominic and because of the way Elspeth was raised in thinking herself unattractive and not pleasing to a man's eye, she is innocent in the ways of a young woman and really knows nothing of love and sex. I thought it was funny a few times, just how inexperienced she was and not even aware of the things her body was trying to tell her. I loved watching her struggle with her attraction to Dominic as she was trying to sort through very strange emotional and physical feelings her brought out in her and all the while, unaware that Dominic is fighting his own feelings. Of course, some of that was due to some harsh words Dominic had said earlier in the story, that was at one point where I really wanted to reach into the book and smack him :) The author did a great job in giving these two some great chemistry. From the beginning, I was holding my breath every time I thought they were ready to give in, just to realize they were only little teases I was given to what was to come when these two finally came together. When they finally gave in, I was relieved and happy. The foreplay, the chemistry, the barbing and arguing all led up to a really great love story.I must mention that the secondary characters really rounded this story out. Each time they stepped onto the page, even if just for a few lines, you stopped to take notice. The Delaney family dynamic was amazing and I really didn't want to let them go when the story ended. So many possibilities for follow up stories. I have no idea if there is more of the Delaney clan, but I plan to find out.This is a great story of love, sacrifice, treasure hunting and a little bit of suspense thrown in. A frontier novel set in the wild west where life was hard and unforgiving. There is death, love, drama and a family that grieves loss all the while dealing with an outside culture that not only caused some of that loss, but is now a part of that family dynamic. There are also some myth's thrown into this story as the search for Katalan is linked to the lost city of Atlantis. Really gave it an Indiana Jones Esq. feel to this book. Though the search for katalan didn't really happen till close to the end of the book. Elspeth's character talked about Katalan quite a bit and at one point, I thought it wasn't going to happen. The story really revolved around Dominic and Elspeth's romance, but when Katalan finally came into the picture, everything really fell into place.Overall, this was a really great read and these characters will most likely prompt me for a re-read down the road. The only issue I had was a handful of mixed up sentences.\\"The Delaney's wouldn't do things in the ordinary looked at shoulder. \\"I way, of course.\\" She Patrick over Elspeth's suppose I should ofNo, I didn't do that on accident, that's an actual sentence from my copy. I came across several of these through out the book, it didn't take away from the story, just made me stop and go \\"Whaaaat????\\" Took me a few seconds to understand what I was seeing and move things around till I could make sense of them. I was given a PDF copy of this book that I had converted, so I'm not sure if this is in all copies or just something that happened with mine. I'm interested to know if anyone else who has read this book also came across this in an e-copy"},{"Title":"This Fierce Splendor (Delaney Dynasty, 1)","review":"I love Iris Johansen's older romance novels. This one is part of the Delaney saga that she wrote with Kay Hooper and Faye Preston. The hero is very alpha. In fact, there's an early bodice-ripper scene,but that doesn't detract from the story. It develops it.I quite enjoy this story. Hopefully the rest of this series gets the e-treatment."},{"Title":"This Fierce Splendor (Delaney Dynasty, 1)","review":"Too long, too wandering. It started out OK and I was interested in the characters, but then it just kept going and going and going...and the plot twists and added characters were NOT moving the story along, just bogging it down...I ended up putting it down intending to get back to it and ended up reading everything else I had waiting, and then STILL didn't pick it back up...and I pretty much finish everything I pick up...."},{"Title":"This Fierce Splendor (Delaney Dynasty, 1)","review":"This is the first Iris Johansen book that I have read.

I almost removed this book from my kindle when it went from one century to another, but I am glad I didn't.

However I didn't make it to the second chapter before I changed my mind."},{"Title":"This Fierce Splendor (Delaney Dynasty, 1)","review":"This is a great love story that I just happened to come across in my grandmother's basement.

I was given this ebook in exchange for honest review."},{"Title":"JOB (DAILY STUDY BIBLE)","review":"This is a difficult review to write because of the wide range of emotion I experienced while reading John Gibson's commentary on \\"Job.\\" It was like reading a book that was actually Dr. Jeckyl AND Mr. Hyde, switching between a feeling of great admiration for the author and becoming violently angry at him.I'll begin with the good: Putting the conversations of Job and his three friends (who try to comfort him and do a terrible job) into perspective. I've read the Bible's \\"Job\\" a number of times and the poetry-style narration made my eyes glaze over as I read. I understood the meaning of the sentences, but didn't understand the raw emotions being displayed. Gibson points out that very emotion! He points out when Job is dancing on the brink of blasphomy--he yells at God asking, \\"so what if I've sinned against you? How does that harm you?\\" He taunts God and accuses Him of acting like a bully towards Job. But Job isn't the only person in this book that made me shake my head in disbelief. Job's three \\"friends\\" repeatedly try to convince a violently sick man on his deathbead (Job himself) that God's letting him have this horrible disease because Job is a rotten, no-good, dirty sinner. With friends like them, who needs enemies? Gibson does a fantastic job of pointing these exchanges out, giving me new respect for the Book of Job.Now, to where I get angry with Gibson. Our differences are theological, the worst kind of difference. First, we disagree concerning when the story of Job actually took place. I say somewhere between the times of Noah and Jacob; Gibson says after the Israelites left Egypt. No big deal there. Where we seem to have our big differences is our trust in the Holy Scripture as God's infallable word. Gibson insults the beginning chapters of the book by calling the story of Job's downfall a \\"folk tale,\\" implying that it was a silly, happy prologue to the meat of the story: the debates. He has a habit of pointing out the author's \\"mistakes\\" (the author is the Holy Spirit. He don't make mistakes) and even goes so far as to REMOVE chapters of the book (because they don't really belong in the Bible) and make them an appendix! The Holy Spirit doesn't need an editor!I believe that the Holy Bible (the entire thing) is the inspired word of God; that the dot over every \\"i\\" and the cross of every \\"T\\" is supposed to be there. God would not let his message to us be corrupted, either by the addition of verses that \\"aren't supposed to be there\\" or by the removal of stuff that God wants us to read. God is more powerful than us. He'll keep out the stuff that's not supposed to be there and doesn't need Dr. Gibson to help him out. Furthermore, Dr. Gibson sets a serious precedent for theologians: when mere, sinful people start trying to decide on their own what parts of the Bible are Holy and what parts are not Holy, it reduces the Good Book to yet another \\"what's right for me isn't necesarilly right for you\\" idea. As for me, I'll let God decide and just view the entire book as Holy as it is--even the parts I don't like.In sum, the parts that Dr. Gibson has respect for and treats seriously are excellent and emotion enducing. It's just too bad such a gifted commentator doesn't have respect for the entire book of Job."},{"Title":"Heir To Danger (Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 1312)(Code of the Outback series)","review":"Tom McCullough is a ranger.

Fred Bear was responsible for many of the advances in bowhunting and archery we see today. Anyone who reads this book whether a beginner or an advanced archer will learn something from Bear's years of experience. There are many exploits in the book which tell of his adventures. Fred Bear is one of the few men I know of who traveled the world, hunted and killed every type of animal,even a bull elephant with a recurve bow. This books sound practices and tips will help every archer improve even if you hunt or just enjoy shooting targets."},{"Title":"The Archer's Bible","review":"If you lived bows in the 70s, you must have this book.

He believes in skill, rather than the brute strength of a gun or compund bow. This is an excellent &quot;how to&quot; book for hunters. Bear starts at the beginning of recurves bow shooting, and takes you through to the end. He also interjects plenty of personal interludes, which prove that this is a man who acutally hunts with a recurve, and knows what he's doing."},{"Title":"The Archer's Bible","review":"the pages were seperating from the binder and the price on the cover was blackened out, small tear on front cover."},{"Title":"The Mysterious, Magickal Cat","review":"I have always loved cats, and felt the magical power they possess. This fantastic book opened up worlds of knowledge concerning cats, from their history, persecution, breeds, magic, and even a chapter of cat &quot;tails&quot;, if you know what I mean. I sped through it in two days. It has adorable pictures of cats on almost every page, and includes photos of domestic and wild cats, of every type you can imagine. Miss Conway really knows her stuff! This book is seething with info and shaped into a fun, easy reading style. It brings out a happy mood in me. Yet another splendid work of literature by DJ Conway, a Mistress of Magick!"},{"Title":"The Mysterious, Magickal Cat","review":"I'm so glad someone finally wrote this book! It's all here -- history, myth, spells your kitty can help you perform, info about the different breeds, touching stories by cat &quot;parents&quot; whose kitties showed psychic abilities, interesting scientific facts about cat behaviour, photographs of exotic cats, folktales, cat deities, etc. Only one thing I didn't like. Was it really ncessary to tell us about cat persecutions and actually show us a picture, albeit an old one from some old horrible time, but, you know, to show us? The truth is harsh and I didn't really want to see a chapter on that in a book I love so much. But, that was only one chapter and the rest of the book is truly loveable. Thank you, DJ Conway, for writing about our furry little bundles of love :)"},{"Title":"The Mysterious, Magickal Cat","review":"One day, I won an award for my Creative Writing class since I received the highest mark, and this award was a gift certificate to buy a book at the local bookshop. Before I received the award, I found out about the Mysterious Magickal Cat, and being the world's truest and most loyalist cat lover (trust me, no one can match me *laughs*) as well as someone fascinated with magick, I did not know Cat Magick existed until I picked up a copy of D.J.'s book. My knowledge of cats and Magick have expanded, thanks to Mrs. Conway, and I would definitely want to meet her! I am presently looking for more Cat Magick spells. I am very pleased with the book, the money sure is worth it, and it is a fascinating book to read!! Where else can I find a book that is exclusively on the most beautiful, most powerful, most WONDERFUL pet on the face of this universe, the cat with mythology attached to it, along with the Ancient Egyptian magick!!!!!!Excellent job, Mrs. Conway, and I encourage you to continue!"},{"Title":"The Mysterious, Magickal Cat","review":"I have a Herd of little Fur Babies of my own and this gave me insite into the past and present lore of the cat. I love the every part of this book. It even gives spells using cat parts, but only the good kind such as shed wiskers and claws. A must for any mystical person with a magickal cat."},{"Title":"The Mysterious, Magickal Cat","review":"I was extremely excited to see that this book was coming out, and after reading it I can say that I did indeed enjoy it, except for a few minor things. The format made it difficult to focus from one paragraph to the next, mostly due to the inclusion of photographs on the page that offset the print to one side or the other (although I'm not complaining about the graphics, they were beautiful.) Also, I felt sort of let down that she included the handful of spells she did in the book, when I had thought perhaps the list would be more extensive. This was most likely in order to give you an idea of what to do on your own with your ~own~ pet, as books such as this are often more prompts to create your own magickal workings and not a to-the-letter guidebook on the subject. However, I'm not terribly disappointed, as she was relatively thorough in the simple spells she chose to include. The book covers every aspect of the cat you could possibly imagine from body language to folklore to anatomy. If you love cats, and even if you're a non-wiccan/pagan, it's a wonderful book to read just because of the everyday info you can learn about your favorite feline friends."},{"Title":"The Mysterious, Magickal Cat","review":"I love cats and I loved reading this book.

Troward being one of the forefathers of New Thought gives a very insightful and scientific outline of the power of our thought and spoken word and how the Law works. If you have not read some of his earlier writings like \\"The Creative Process in the Individual\\" and become familiar of his way of teaching and writing it may be hard to grasp. I have been fortunate enough to been exposed to some excellent teachers in New Thought and once I \\"got\\" how Troward writes it opened new doors of thought and perspective. In all honesty Troward was the forefather of Qauntum Physics from a intuitive level. So I suggest when you read him have a open mind and open heart and let his words speak to you and the glimmers will shine through. If you would like to get a sample of one of the next great teachers of this generation visit [...]"},{"Title":"The law and the word","review":"Mr Troward thinks deeply and seeks to bring the reader into an understanding of basically, \\"cause and effect\\". He paints a broad picture of how things start and the law or principle by which they originate and translate into their intended purposes. He uses science frequently to show that all things that we have been able to use for our advantage we have discovered certain laws by which they work. Once we find the laws we have been able to unfold a myriad of uses and applications of the laws for a vast number of things. The \\"Law and the Word\\" is his premise for the explanation of how things originate and produce their effects. He starts with God and creation. God spoke (his thoughts) and things emerged and took shape and form. Man being an expression of God made in his image accomplishes the things he does in the same manner by his word (thoughts) and the law translates them into reality. These realities may come into existance by various means including his own efforts in cooperating with the law of his being. Troward says that it is always the law and the word, but the word comes first and the law brings it to pass. Although Mr Troward ventures into some areas of thought that are quite challenging to get a hold of, he often returns to a scriptural basis for most of his insights. Of all the new thought writers Thomas Troward is perhaps the most scriptually focused in all of his writings. There is a reverence and a respect for the bible and he constantly uses biblical texts to help support his conclusions. He certainly uses terms like \\"we may reason\\" or the word \\"speculate\\" in stating some postulations but he unwaveringly uses biblical quotes with a firmness of faith and affirms his obvious recognition of the authority of Christ and the meaning of redemption. The last chapter is full of scripture and he states clearly his belief in \\"the atonement\\" and reconciliation with God that allows the higher dimensions of man's ability to use the Law and the Word in unlimited ways.

I recommend you keep a dictionary handy."},{"Title":"The law and the word","review":"This book repeats itself alot.. and goes no where.. with no point in sight..

The descriptions of the homes and the relationships between the people were, as per VCA, very involved and quite detailed. It was enjoyable in those extents.However, as my title says, I am not happy with the advertisement letter from Annie. When I saw the caption on the back about a letter from Annie I anticipated her as a chracter IN the book. Not a character in an ad for the Casteel Series. Any TRUE VCA fan has already read that series, it is generally thought of as the favorite. Not cool Mr Ghostwriter or Mr/Ms Publisher.But, Willow is a great story and I am looking forward to the next books in the series."},{"Title":"Willow (De Beers Family 1)","review":"I just didn't feel for Willow as i had all the previous characters. The series starts with Willow as a college student, returning home after a tradegy in the family. i won't spoil it, so that's all i can really say. It's the typical set up, except i really wish that the series has started earlier in Willow's life, like all of V.C. Andrews other series. I just didn't get to know Willow, she was boring, and the relationship with Thacther Happened rather quickly in my opinion. I did manage to finish it, so that's why it gets 2 stars."},{"Title":"Willow (De Beers Family 1)","review":"I couldn't get through the series because I found myself uninspired by the character. She lacked the drive of V.C. Andrews previous heroines. Her father lies about her real mother so of course she goes to find out about her blah blah blah. I mean her blandness reeks on every page.I really don't recommend this book to any...it's sad to say since VC Andrews is my favorite author and i find her books very entertaining.

The novel Willow was better then I thought it will be, I was sure it will had been another boring stories from the Ghost Writer but I was very surprise at how the book turn out to be. It was okay, not as good as the novels from the real VC Andrews used to write of course but Willow is a fast reading, it may be boring at first but when she arrived at Palm Beach that start to be interesting. It sure is du &quot;D&eacute;jas-vu&quot;, very clich&eacute;, the characters in this story are mostly black or white, good or bad, snob or poor, good looking or ugly, cruel or nice again that not real life, no one are just black or white! I could not believe how snob and how the rich people from Palm Beach could throw their money like that and just party and gossip, it doesn't sound too real but maybe it like that in real life but again just black and white characters who had no subtance is boring but I like the mother of Willow &quot;Grace&quot; and her son &quot;Linden&quot;, I found them interesting, I think they were good characters who sound real this time. The mother of Thatcher (Bunny) get on my nerves so much, I can't stand her, if a woman in real life act like she did, almost went turn nuts just for every little problems in her life, that sure is immature, if that type of woman existe how can she deal with life? The character of Bunny sound so not real! And how could Willow went with Thatcher so fast, I think that was very stupid of her to do so, she sound very eassy, she didn't even knew much about him and sleep with him and after move into his house and with his parents, again all that doesn't sound real. The letter from Annie Casteel of the Casteel series to Willow, I thought was odd, why she wrote to Willow, what the used? Really why mixing thoses two series?

I believe if we only read books we like, we limit our experiences, and may I say, was this book an experience. The V.C. Andrews machine was running out of material with the advent of \\"Melody\\", and by the time \\"Willow\\" came along, who cares about the hackneyed recycled deep-buried family secrets anymore? And the most &lt;gasp> shocking secret, was that Willow really was her father's biological daughter, the result of an affair with one of his mental patients. Real ethical guy, huh? Preying on a deranged woman. Then there's Linden (isn't that a type of tree?--eyeroll, please), Willow's artsy (a.k.a. nutty) half-brother, who, of course, develops a little crush on her and basically acts like a jerk. And the cast of boring, cliched characters continue with Eaton Thatcher, who is like every other male interest in the V.C. novels, and his vain and selfish mother, Bunny (I won't even get into the other characters).Willow's cover story under the pseudonym Isabel Amou isn't believable, but then, perhaps people who live in ritzy Palm Beach really are this stupid. It sounds like they never work, but just party all the time (and never grow up), and if that's so, don't you run out of money eventually, or have to at least show up to work once in awhile and make sure your money is still making you money? I would call Palm Beach (from the way it is described in this mind-numbing tome) a Paris Hilton paradise.I was truly disgusted with Claude (Willow's father) because he knew his wife (Willow's stepmother) physically and emotionally abused his daughter, and yet stayed with the woman because he believed Willow's nanny, Amou (Portuguese, by the way) would look out for her. What kind of father is this? Not a daddy, that's for sure, which Willow still calls him; she refers to her stepmonster as her \\"A.M.\\" (I guess for \\"adoptive mother\\").As for Willow's romance with Allan (her college boyfriend), just like Bobby Lockwood (Melody's boyfriend at the beginning of the series), what was the point?Now let me get on with specifics:Page 70 (top): Willow talks about how reading her father's diary rivals the best romance novel. Ick! Who wants to read about their father doing it with some stranger, even if she is your real mother, or anyone else for that matter. You came into being, that's all you really need to know. Your mind can fill in the blanks. Then on the page next to this one, Willow's father actually considered having his child aborted. I think that was when I lost all respect for him. As a doctor, you bring life into the world, not take it away when it is inconvenient. Do no harm.Page 93: Willow talks about how her A.M. raised her to believe she had \\"disturbances\\" (i.e. that she was \\"touched\\"), and I was led to believe by the back cover (never trust them--they are almost always so much better written than the actual content inside and can, at many times, actually mislead the reader), for I was waiting for Willow to crack up, or at least think she was cracking up, but neither ever occurred. When Ruby goes a little crazy in \\"Pearl in the Mist\\", it was eerie and exciting.Page 137: Willow's inner dialog is stupid--her \\"counter selves\\" warring with one another. I know her father was a psych doctor, but these cold, clinical ways of analyzing everything didn't make the characters seem very human.Page 194: I love how Willow says she sees a famous pop singer (along with an actor who was in the most recent blockbuster), but doesn't bother to even make up names for these people.Page 217: Thatcher (the rich, young lawyer Willow screws, and who leaves her when he finds out she is Mad Montgomery's daughter) tells his conquest (I think they've already banged each other by this time) that Palm Beach doesn't have any hospitals or cemeteries. Is this true? Too bad this book didn't make me care enough about Palm Beach to find out.Page 241: Willow wants to sleep in the room her mother was allegedly raped in by her father (or stepfather--don't remember exactly), resulting in loony Linden's birth. The question is...why?Page 414: Worst metaphor ever: ...spreading it over the civilized world like hot butter over bread... I say, better to use no metaphor than a ridiculous, nonsensical one.And for the grand finale, the phantom of this soap opera was Amou, Willow's nanny who seemed more of a figment of Willow's imagination than an actual person. Maybe Willow really was a nutcase, her father playing along with her schizo tendencies."},{"Title":"Willow (De Beers Family 1)","review":"I thought that this book was going to be very bad, just a same plot but with different character names. There was a good change to this book, it left you with hope for the next book that is supposed to come out in the series. Anyway this book was about Willow DeBeers, a nice, personable, 19 year old college student that was adopted. When both her adoptive parents die Willow is left with a stunning truth that her adoptive father was her real father. Willow goes in search of her really mother, who now lives in Palm Beach with her other child. When she gets to Palm Beach, Willow forms a new identity and with the help of a uptown lawyer and his family finally finds that love always insn't what you need."},{"Title":"Willow (De Beers Family 1)","review":"When I first started reading this book I knew it wasn't going to be like the others ones that I have read.

Neiderman obviously wasn't trying as much as he had been before, and everyone was flat. The story was only mildly interesting, and there was none of the thrills and chills that came with reading a real VCA book, or one of Mr. Neiderman's earlier ghostwriter books (Cutler, Landry)And I'm not sure why Mr. Neiderman couldn't have chosen a better family name, instead of the name of a jewelry business."},{"Title":"Willow (De Beers Family 1)","review":"I was very disappointed with this series. It's not written in the same style as all the other VC Andrews books. I have never been so disappointed with the lead female in a V.C Andrews series before. Also, her story was dull, and many of the characters seem flat and two dimensional. I was bored with it. I also jumped the gun and bought the entire book series, without reading it, so I'm really kicking myself. *Sigh.* oh well, life goes on! P.S, If you want a way better VC Andrews story and character, read the Logan series instead. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Willow (De Beers Family 1)","review":"I have read every VC Andrews book and this one was the only one that I could not finish reading.

I was expecting another skim session after reading such books as Into the Garden and The Falling stars series.

I read some of the other reviews, one person stating it was a sham because Willow lived a fine life with a nanny. True she was, but not all rich people live glorious lives. The new writer for the V.C. Andrews books has worked hard on creating a new series and I think she will grab the V.C. Andrews audience. Willow grows up with a nanny, a horrible adoptive mom, and a adoptive father who is a highly respected man in the psychitiary field. The nanny is more of a mother than her adoptive mother. Her father ends up passing away and Willow runs off to Florida to seek the truth about her past she was never told.The ending is fabulous and I can't wait to read the next book. I have it being sent here as I write, plus the send book also. Anyway, if you are a V.C. Andrews fan, I suggest you read it.

Willow was a pretty good herione, although I prefer Heaven, and I liked the way she was strong. A pretty disapppointing book, though, comsidering all the great reviews it got.

It's the same old stuff, just a different setting, as usual. Of COURSE the &quot;dark family secret&quot; is that Willow's father had an affair that produced her - since when has the GW been creative and come up with something new? Just once, I'd like to read a VC Andrews that doesn't include the word &quot;real&quot; when describing a mother or father. The character letters at the end are nothing more than marketing plugs for the other books - maybe people are finally catching on that they're just not worth the money."},{"Title":"Willow (De Beers Family 1)","review":"This was my first VC Andrews book and I'm hooked. I have all but the second in the series and when I get it, I will read the rest. I've also picked up other books to read.I thought Willow was strong as a child in having to endure her adopted mother's hatefulness. Finding out her adopted father was really her father came as no surprise. You could just sense it in how he treated her.She showed such strength in standing up to her aunt, to her boyfriend and going in search of her mother.

She leaned across the small table and whispered, \\"I've lost the instruction manual for this child.\\" If Carol A.Josel's OtherWise and School-Wise had been available then, that mother would have found solid hope and practical ideas for raising her son to be academically wise.The organization of the book is very user-friendly. Twenty-eight chapters cover a wide range of topics, some general such Part 2 on memory making, and others skill-specific, such as the chapter on spelling. By covering a wide range of topics, the book becomes a truly comprehensive resource for guiding a child through the school-age years.Each chapter, or part, as Josel names them, comes in a well-organized format that is consistent throughout the book. For example, the part on \\"Computing Time\\" begins with a statement, followed by a couple of quotes that state facts like \\"47 percent of Americans say very few parents know what their teens are up to; 60 percent say the government should restrict access to some Internet material.\\" (The quote is from Newsweek's Devin Gordon.) Then, the thinking question from Josel: \\"What are your thoughts?\\" More facts follow and another quote complete the page.The next two pages of the \\"Computing Time\\" part offer bulleted suggestions to address computer use among school-age children. Next are two pages that offer websites recommended as useful resources to help parents help their children manage curriculum. Homework helper sites and research sites appropriate for schoolwork complete the chapter.I found the chapters on studying and taking tests particularly helpful and also appreciated an insightful chapter on cheating. The educator's viewpoint, as well as the parent's, is effectively represented.Each chapter in this excellent compilation of ideas, techniques and discussion starters offers high quality, practical information.The Appendix does not disappoint. Examples of graphic organizers are included that help students organize information and their thinking. Concept maps, story mapping, and Main Idea/Details graphs are a few of the excellent guidelines in getting the student started on thinking through a topic. Even comma rules are summarized for easy reference.A comprehensive Bibliography follows and guides the parent or educator to resources for exploring ideas even further than what is presented in this book.I highly recommend Other-Wise and School-Wise as a must-have resource for anyone involved in raising or educating children today. It has a easy-to-reach-for place on my bookshelf.Paula Buermele is a reviewer for BookPleasures and the author of \\"The Dream Catcher Tour.\\""},{"Title":"Other-Wise and School-Wise: A Parent Guidebook","review":"There is always that one invaluable book that we go back to time and time again.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Other-Wise and School-Wise: A Parent Guidebook","review":"Reviewed by Beverly Pechin for Reader Views (2/07)This definitive and unique aspect of child rearing brings a touch of reality in with a combination of knowledge of the system and past experiences. With topics such as Manners, Motivation, Test Taking & Cheating, and Homework as just a few of the main categories discussed, Carol Josel uses her past experience and expertise in the field to help you give your child direction and definition in life.A concise, thorough listing in her Bibliography assures the reader that continued education is out there to help you be the best parent ever and hopefully create a child that has direction and purpose. This listing gives you a seemingly endless list of resources that can be referred to at any time, so you're never at a loss for where to turn when you need some parenting help.While no book is ever the \\"say all\\" of child rearing, Ms. Josel covers so many aspects that you will face or have faced as a parent that she almost seems to compile the complete book in one solid sitting! Divided into 28 Categories, the author takes a candid look and approach at how to get the best bang for your buck so to speak. Emphasizing the importance of such things as family dinners, homework time, scheduled times for computer, television and other fun activities she creates a feeling of \\"I can do this\\" from a parent's perspective and the child's. With creative ways and techniques to help you obtain a harmonious family atmosphere, Ms. Josel has exercises and practices that help not only the kids, but the parents too. Designed to be done both together and separately, these exercises emphasize different areas from promoting discussions about everything from homework to general life issues to improving your skills as a student when test day comes.Packed full of great resources, ideas, techniques and thought-provoking discussion starters, this author combines her own knowledge with the knowledge of others to create a concise and accurate book that will have you walking away feeling as though you can make a difference in your child's life.\\"Other-Wise and School-Wise\\" would make a wonderful gift for a new parent, teacher or anyone feeling a bit overwhelmed with their parenting skills.

For chemists wanting a good current expository text, that does not assume any prior knowledge of it, try this work by Rouvray.There is much overlap between studying complexity and information theory. Indeed, this book has a chapter devoted to Shannon's theories. But, as befits a book for chemists, that chapter is toward the end. Instead, Rouvray talks about complexity in the context of thermodynamics. [You do remember most of your thermo books, don't you?] Then we are shown how complexity can be quantified in so-called complexity indices, for various molecules.Then there is a discussion of how molecular complexity might be correlated to the difficulty of synthesis of such molecules. Hopefully, your chemical intuition can come into play, making complexity far more understandable."},{"Title":"Zeralda's Ogre","review":"The subject is very Grimm's fairy tale, an ogre that eats children; the tone, and the illustrations, are not. The ogre is shown walking down the village street with a bag over his shoulder, a child's arm is sticking out! But the picture includes lots of other details - children being hidden in cellars, and a depessed looking teacher in gown and mortarboard; the text with this picture says that children went into hiding, schools shut and teachers were unemployed. The light tone fits the story-line, which is, that the ogre accidentally comes to taste young Zeralda's wonderful cooking, goes off eating children, and they have a long, happy, life, spent throwing extravagent dinner parties (a lavish sample menu is illustrated)."},{"Title":"Zeralda's Ogre","review":"This classic book is one of my childhood favorites. Growing up, it reached mythic proportions in my memory. I recently bought it for my 2-year-old daughter, and she loves it too. It's a memorable tale of a nasty ogre who craves little children until a guileless girl converts him with her prodigy-like culinary genius.Zeralda's Ogre is great on a number of different levels. It has a scary element that I loved when I was a kid - kind of a Grimm's Fairy Tale aspect. Now that I'm a grown-up, I recognize a terrific sly sense of humor in it as well. The illustrations are great - filled with fun little details (bugs, lizards, etc.) that little ones like to seek out.

Rescuing the hungry Ogre from his own clumsiness and his irrational appetite, Zeralda gives him tastes he never forgets. Soon all the Ogres want what's in Zeralda's kitchen. None want it as much as Zeralda's Ogre though. In a surprise and twisted ending, she marries him. If Disney can pull it off with Shrek, then author Tomi Ungerer should get accolades for her work too.

He's a gifted spinner of tales about Peru's historic and folkloric culture, transforming the history of that period \\"...into short prose pieces which he called 'traditions'.\\"Palma \\"...portrays incidents which relate to historical events...human foibles and idiosyncrasies on one hand...and courage and integrity on the other.\\" Thus, he weaves a rich tapestry, a broad panorama of the people from the period, \\"...Viceroys and their courts to criminials and their milieu...nobles, priests, soldiers, merchants, beggars, nuns, housewives and prostitutes...\\" all as the went about their daily lives. As the tales unfold, we are treated to a lively, robust, and entertaining series of candid insights as to the motivations and values of Peru's people as Palma pokes fun at the \\"...pompous, the overbearing, the egotistical. Targets of his satirical pen are institutions such as the Catholic Church, the monarchy, the courts, education...pointing out the human weaknesses of individuals who make up these institutions.\\"Palma's extraordinary work has long deserved translators equal to its value--to make it available to a wider audience. Such translators have appeared in the person of Merlin D. Compton, who has edited -- and, with his son, Timothy G. Compton, translated from Palma's original Spanish into English -- the best of Palma's historic and folkloric tales.Both Comptons are uniquely qualified for the task. Both hold Doctorates in Spanish and have been long tenured language and literature professors (Brigham Young University and Northern Michigan University, respectively). Both are previously published and have traveled extensively in Spain, Peru, and Mexico for many years, including the places and communities where Palma lived and wrote. Merlin Compton, in recognition of his being the foremost writer about Palma's life and translator of his work, was conferred an \\"Honorary Professor for the University of Ricardo Palma\\" in Lima, Peru.Anyone interested in Peruvian Traditions as a subject, or Ricardo Palma as a teller of its history and folklore, could not do better than to read the Comptons' skilled and artistic translation of it. It was obviously a labor of love for them both -- and will prove to be a timeless expression in English of Palma's work."},{"Title":"Tenants Rights (California Tenant's Rights)","review":"i found it to be very helpful and informative.its a better understanding for those who rent.plus you find out things you did nt know.i was very impressed by the book.i would highly recommend the book to anyone who s renting and has questions that need to be answered.and this book is very,very helpful."},{"Title":"Esoteric Philosophy of Love & Marriage","review":"As with most of Dion Fortune's works (said only because I haven't yet read them all), this piece is indispensable for anyone wanting to understand the world around them. Yes, it is about marriage -- and not only on the physical plane; that is what makes it so potent, because Fortune shows why natural marriages are as they are FROM SPIRITUAL CAUSES. But because all of creation is built up from this basic marriage of two divine halves, the book offers much to consider in contemplating any subject.The nice thing here, too, is that despite the depths that Fortune can reach in certain works, she tries to keep this one simple enough for even beginning readers. By the end she may really be pushing them ... but by then, they've been well prepared.This is a must-have for any student of the esoteric."},{"Title":"Esoteric Philosophy of Love & Marriage","review":"This book goes into depth I've never seen anywhere else. Dion discusses the chakras, and how a couple relates on all the levels. For example, the root chakra is a magnetic connection, the heart chakra love...well that much is obvious, but an explanation is given of how a busy executive might have a strong intellectual relationship with a business associate, be able to discuss intellectual topics with her that he can't discuss with his wife, so on the level of intellect that is essentially a connection, just as if he had sex with her it would be a connection, but on a different chakra level. The goal being, to be compatibly mated so that you connect on ALL the chakras with your partner. POWERFUL STUFF! I think this book, along with The Shared Heart by Barry & Joyce Vissell, should be given as wedding gifts to every couple! They just might save a few marriages!"},{"Title":"Esoteric Philosophy of Love & Marriage","review":"If your not the type of person who generally agrees with esoteric/occultic thought, then you may take issue with some of what is presented in this book... but, then again, if you already have qualms with esoterica, why are you reading anything by Dion Fortune?A lot of what is written in this book - I feel - must be taken in conjunction with the perspective of the author: the time period, where she comes from, and her status within that society. For example, I would question her opinion on homosexuality (even though I'm not a homosexual), given the pluralistic values of our current culture in comparison to the values of her time. None-the-less, she makes an excellent argument for her position: each chapter gradually building upon the previous chapters successively until the breadth of material becomes clear. Questions I had in the beginning and middle of the book were addressed in later chapters, leaving no holes by the conclusion.I would, though, especially recommend that the reader take their time on the chapter regarding the 7 planes. Having those clear in your mind will make the rest of the book much easier to comprehend.Otherwise, I agree with the other reviewers. I thoroughly appreciated how this book made a consideration of the energetic principles involved in how human being relate to one another (as opposed to providing a \\"thou shalt/shalt not\\" list of behavior based on some doctrine that doesn't explain the WHY of the preference/avoidance). This is one of those books which, personality being accepting to a different perspective, all youths should read as a \\"coming of age\\" into their adulthood (and the sexual liberty that comes with it). It would aid to dodge a lot of unhealthy relationships.I only gave this book 4 stars based upon my ability to test its veracity against an internal sympathy/harmony. (I would have been very happy to give it a 4.5 if that were an option). Yet, this may be simply a symptom of a lack of understanding, experience and/or ability to comprehend on my part.In any case, it's a relatively inexpensive book and a quick read (my wife and I read it together in the course of an afternoon), so there's really nothing to lose by purchasing & reading this book."},{"Title":"Esoteric Philosophy of Love & Marriage","review":"If you are looking for new depth of understanding of your relationship with your spouse or life partner this book offers insights like no other. Dions lifelong practice of qabalistic magic and other esoteric practice gave her a thorough grounding in the true nature of love and - yes - sex.For a woman of her generation she examined the depth of sexual relations, marriage and deep friendship with clarity that few have ever managed. While she uses careful language (how could she not!) one is never in doubt of her meaning.I have found great value in all of Dions work. She is able to produce mental \\"software\\" that with practice enables us to create a framework within our own minds that reaches out to our subconscious and higher consciousness in ways that only the greatest teachers have been able to provide.She is truly gifted - and this work on the philosophy of the the sexes is one of her best."},{"Title":"Esoteric Philosophy of Love & Marriage","review":"I think that the topics reviewed here should be included as part of the spiritual education for all the people, no matter what religion they practice.

I also like the way that they discribed the conditions that they had to live in so good. Maria was very good at talking to the people like they were haveing a regular converstion so it felt like you were there with them. It was also helpful that they had a glossery in the back of the book so if you didnt know what a street term ment,you could look it up and you would know what the gang members were talking about and/or discribing. Over all I think this book is worth while and I would suggest it to everyone intrested."},{"Title":"Crews: Gang Members Talk to Maria Hinojosa","review":"This book really made me think a lot about what a &quot;loose cannon&quot; really goes through to get how they are. Usually, the media exploits these types of people and they don't talk about how they got this way... But in this book, they tell you about their lives and how they get to the point where they are at and what they want in the future. Maria really did a good job and let the boys and girls speak their mind. Once you read this book, you will start to understand the Crew members and the atmosphere that they live in.So check it out because its something that will elevate your thinking about other human beings."},{"Title":"Hot in the City 2: Sin City","review":"Book arrived in a timely manner and great condition."},{"Title":"Hot in the City 2: Sin City","review":"This is the 2nd book in Alexander's Hot In The City trilogy, and at first I thought Ms. Alexander was going to tell Lynda's story, who appeared in French Quarter as Liz Marsh's supportive friend. But instead she writes about Liz's sister Diana, the wildest of the Marsh girls. Maybe someday Lynda will get her own story.Diana has been flirting long-distrance with colleague Marc Davenport for months, but she's actually trying to tame her bad girl ways and settle down, maybe even get married. A business trip to Las Vegas gives her the opportunity to have her last fling before accepting the marriage proposal of a man her family approves of, as well as explore the fascination her and Marc have for each other after several months of trading phone calls and emails. Diana figures this is one place she can really let loose and give into her true nature with a man who shares her naughty sense of adventure and not judge her for it but rather indulge her every outrageous fantasy, as well as several of his own. Almost right from the start the sex is non-stop and wild. On their first night together after they meet, they share a wild ride in a limo, and that opens the doors to some very wild sexual encounters, many involving other people.While I did find this story very sexy, I would have much preferred that the characters have a strong emotional connection that is evident from the start, and I just didn't get that. I couldn't help but be a little turned off by Diana's and Marc's first time together - which was spent with two of his friends who \\"enjoyed\\" Diana a little themselves. Not that there is a problem with that because it is a very exciting fantasy - it just felt like something was missing. This continues in various scenarios with other people until finally you wish it was just the two of them spending time together. I did feel a little like Diana's wild-child personality was the excuse to explore some of the more shocking multiple-partner encounters. It wasn't until near the end that I could feel that there was something going on between Marc and Diana besides the sex. True it was evident that they liked each other way before they met, but it seemed like it would have been very easy for either of them to walk away at any time.If you loved \\"French Quarter\\" like I did, you may be disappointed that Sin City doesn't have the same romantic longing between the two characters which worked so well in FQ. Don't get me wrong: the sex is unbelievably hot and the sense of the forbidden heats up the story, but I would rather read an erotic romance than just plain erotica. Still, Ms. Alexander is a talented writer and I would definitely continue to read her stories.Many strong sexual themes are explored here, including menais a trois, same-sex, mild submission and domination, and voyeurism and may not be suitable for all readers, so if you pick this one up, be ready for some blistering hot sex scenes not found in your traditional romance novel."},{"Title":"Hot in the City 2: Sin City","review":"This blisteringly hot erotic story will have you summoning your local fire department to contain the blazing inferno of lust that \\"Sin City\\" by Lacey Alexander will ignite.Marc Davenport is a cocksure, sweet and sexy, alpha bad boy with a delicious body and intelligent mind. He has learned to embrace his inner, and outer, bad boy, but he never would have thought he'd find someone that would accept that part of him, much less love it. Now all he has to do is convince Diana that it's okay for her to embrace her naughty-by-nature ways as well.Smart and sexy Diana Marsh has always been the audaciously brazen bad girl in the family. Instead of embracing her naughty nature, she decides she wants to please her parents for once, and changes her wicked ways. She almost convinces herself that she has defied nature by starting a career, buying a house, and dating the perfect man that her mother picked out for her. Well, he would be the perfect man if she truly was the good girl she was trying to be. Despite Diana's best efforts to change her wicked ways, she soon realizes that in \\"Sin City\\" her self-restrained bad girl is much like molten lava that boils at the surface of a volcano just waiting for that perfect moment to erupt.If you are looking for white-hot eroticism, then look no further. \\"Sin City\\" by Lacey Alexander, the second in the \\"Hot in the City\\" trilogy, tells the story of two erotically ardent characters who were born to be bad. Explore \\"Sin City\\" with them; vicariously experience their venturesome sexuality and their realized dreams of having their naughty natures embraced by the other. From start to finish, this one will have your blood boiling, and you're A/C running non-stop, and long after if you're anything like me. I think it's a good possibility that sometime in the future we'll be hearing about Adrianna's story. Oh and I'm sure Ms. Alexander could never forget Carter... I'm just salivating over the possibility of hearing his story.

The essays are grouped into three Part and further subdivided into topic sections within their respective parts. Although the main audience is IS/IT management, this book should also be read by business process owners who are the consumers of IS/IT services.Part I is brief and sets the context by discussing the larger issues of competing with information and how to use information to create business value. This is the foundation of the rest of the book and is aimed at IS/IT managers and [in my opinion] business process owners. Part II (Putting Information to Work) begins with Section A's four chapters that tie information as processed and provided to the business to business goals and objectives. The value of these chapters is they educate the IS/IT manager in the business value of the services and products that they are providing and showing them the bigger picture of their roles in supporting business objectives. Section B (Creating New Reality) consists of two chapters that touch upon knowledge management issues to a degree, and certainly illustrate how information can be leveraged into actionable knowledge. Section C's two chapters address cost reduction, while Section D devotes two chapters to risk management and control.The most interesting portion of this book is Part III, which is focused on how to use information as a competitive advantage. The five chapters in this Part starts with the basics of competing with information, and ends with a look at building e-commerce capabilities.Overall, this book will provide IS/IT managers with a good foundation in business uses of information, which promotes a better understanding of IS/IT's role as a service provider and information manager. This is important because, from what I've observed at many clients, IS/IT is focusing more and more on tools and technology, or infrastructure building. The direct result of this focus is a growing chasm between what's important to the business and what IS/IT perceives its role to be. The essays in this book will go a long way towards educating IS/IT management and refocusing them on what is really important."},{"Title":"Competing with Information: A Manager's Guide to Creating Business Value with Information Content","review":"Donald Marchand has created a series case studies which describe how the leadership at different organizations used information collected during the course of business to better compete and even learn to dominate different aspects of their world.

LDL down from, 182 to 118 and HDL up from 49 to 54.This was accomplished in 10 weeks by rigidly sticking to the zero saturated fat recommendation and half heartedly trying the Niacin regimen.I cut out cheese, milk, whole eggs, etc. and substituted with olive and canola oils.I have since ramped up the niacin regimen to the complete doses recommended by the book and will see if I can improve on these already impressive numbers.Try it, it works.UPDATE - 10 weeks after the review above I had my lipids checked again and my total cholesterol is now 133; that's pretty amazing considering mytotal was 275 just five months ago and I have not taken any prescription medications.

The only thing I need to work on is increasing my good cholesterol. There are some stories and it is written in a casual manner so it is easy to read and not to technical.

The author is trained in both journalism and science, and after suffering one heart attack and thinking about leaving his kids fatherless, he \\"got religion.\\" He now reads all the medical research on heart health, distilling it down and explaining it to the lay reader. He has the right attitude, only trusting studies that have good methodology and have been replicated.He considers diet, including fruits and vegetables, fats, meats, soluble fiber and alcohol. He goes over the research on antioxidents and other supplements, including the vitamin that works better than prescription drugs: niacin. He also covers stress and exercise.Heart disease is completely preventable. If you have high cholesterol or other risk factors, this book will set you straight on what works and what doesn't. My doctor agrees with the parts he's read, and the information here is in agreement with other sources like the American Heart Association website and webmd.com.If what you want is an owners manual for your heart, a book length treatment that mentions all the important studies and their results, then this book is for you.

Fortunately I may have discovered this book in time to avoid the problems that my mother, uncle, grandfather, and who knows how many prior generations faced.Two months ago I had my cholesterol checked and the total cholesterol was 214, HDL 30, LDL 156, and Triglycerides 142. The doctors wanted to put me on medication that could have side effects or cause liver damage, etc. I wanted to find a natural alternative, since I could well be taking it for 40+ years. I read Kowalski's book, took HALF the niacin dosage he recommended, and made slight modifications to my already low-fat/cholesterol diet by incorporating some of the foods found in SuperFoods Rx by Steven Pratt (spinach, soy, blueberries, whole grains, salmon). When I received the latest blood test results today, my levels had fallen to a total cholesterol level of 185, HDL 33, LDL 132, and Triglycerides 102.

I ordered this book in October, 2007, and finally got around to reading it in June, 2008. Based on its advice, in July, 2008, I began taking 1000 mg/day (a modest amount, according to the book) of slow-release niacin (Enduracin, ordered per instructions in the book). I vetted this with three different doctors, none of whom raised any objections. In February, 2009, I retired and began getting back into hiking (an activity which had been more or less on hold during my last year of work). Very soon thereafter, I began having severe pains in both heels. Ultimately, I was having trouble getting around my house, let alone walking a mountain trail. A podiatrist recommended four weeks of physical therapy and new orthotics, neither of which seemed to help very much. After much research and experimentation, I concluded that the pain in my heels was due to a sort of induced gout (\\"gouty attacks\\" being a possible side effect of niacin) and I stopped taking it (after 644 days on it). There was immediate improvement in my heels, then a leveling-off period for a couple of weeks, and then continued slow improvement since. After 52 days off the niacin, I am now back out hiking and I am more or less convinced that my heels are really finally on the mend. I will never, ever take niacin again. I worry about possible liver damage done by the amount that I took. And, did my cholesterol levels improve? Not really. Don't be taken in by the hype in this book!

Now that's all well and good, but if I were to follow the authors advice on dosage of the aforementioned vitamins and oils, then it would end up costing me significantly more, way more than my $10/month co-pay for Zocor. Plus, like I mentioned, there's no amount of vitamins that can beat a statin drug's effectiveness at lowering cholesterol.So while the book has some useful advice, keep in mind there is no \\"cure\\" and you really won't see significant lowering of LDL or total cholesterol levels using this book. Talk to your doctor about a statin drug."},{"Title":"The New 8-Week Cholesterol Cure: The Ultimate Program for Preventing Heart Disease","review":"This book deserves many more than five stars! Millions of people will lead longer, healthier, and more productive lives from following the advice here.In the last 15 years, knowledge about how to reduce heart disease has made major strides. This book is the best source I have seen about what has been learned, and how to apply it to help yourself and those you love. You will probably find it helpful to bring your copy along to see your physician because many primary care physicians will not be up-to-date with the latest findings in some areas, such as the use of supplements.If you liked Mr. Kowalski's first program for controlling cholesterol, originally published in 1987, you will adore this book. When asking himself what had changed he noted, \\"Why, practically everything is new!\\" Mr. Kowalski reviews in detail the strengths and weaknesses of that program, describes the research that has been conducted on cardiovascular health since then, and shows you other risks in addition to cholesterol that must be addressed. He also debunks pseudo-science about cholesterol control.What impressed me the most is that Mr. Kowalski's old and new programs have worked perfectly for him. Here is a man who had his first heart attack at age 35 and double bypass. He had a second heart attack at 41, followed by a quadruple bypass. In the foreword, cardiac surgeon Dr. Jack Sternlieb describes how the most rigorous tests of Mr. Kowalski's heart and arteries show that it has no blockages as of 1999. Without this program, Mr. Kowalski would probably have needed another bypass operation several years ago. His family record of heart disease is not a good one, and he probably has a genetic tendency to problems in this area. Mr. Kowalski is very physically active now, and has no limitations on his life style due to his cardiac history.The new program has familiar elements in it, but is considerably less restrictive than the old one. You can eat a lot more foods, and a lot more fat (as long as it is the right kind of fat). The dietary guidelines are quite similar to the new ones brought out by the American Heart Association in 2000.For most people, the diet features avoiding saturated fat and trans fatty acids, limiting overall fat to hold weight at a healthy level for your height, eating fish at least twice a week (especially fatty fish), lots of fruits and vegetables, whole-grain breads and cereals, consuming soluble fiber, lots of fluids, limiting sugars and empty carbohydrates, and eating slowly. Exercise is 15 miles of walking a week. A variety of supplements are encouraged (especially antioxidents, B vitamins, minerals, polysterols, and pantathine). Don't smoke. Limit alcohol consumption to moderate daily levels, but do not imbibe solely for the cardiovascular benefit. Take one aspirin a day if your stomach can handle it.I liked the candor in the book quite a lot. For example, \\"I'm a little embarrassed when I look at the subtitle of the original book, which promises \`no deprivation.'\\"In addition to the overall recommendations, each element is described in detail including the scientific studies that support why it works, who should not follow the recommendation, how to work with your doctor for the best results, side effects that can occur, and how these recommendations compare with the various prescription medications now available for lowering cholesterol. He also describes how these recommendations affect other factors for cardiovascular risk such as the amount of low-density lipoprotein (a negative component of overall cholesterol), high-density lipoprotein (a positive component of overall cholesterol), triglycerides, homocysteine, and C-reactive proteins. The section on niacin (B-3) was particularly interesting since it involves changing liver functions, and you are encouraged to work with your doctor in this area. I was not familiar with the \\"niacin flush\\" but was glad to learn that the newer versions usually avoid that problem. I especially found the discussions of the special issues that women, young people, and seniors have to be helpful.Get this book today . . . follow its advice . . . and keep it with you!"},{"Title":"The New 8-Week Cholesterol Cure: The Ultimate Program for Preventing Heart Disease","review":"I've been reading a lot lately about heart disease, and &quot;The New 8-Week Cholesterol Cure&quot; gives a complete run down of how to care for your heart (against cholesterol) and tells you why you're doing it. It also tells you what not to do, either because it's bad for you or because some other advice you may have received is a wive's tale.In plain, friendly language, Kowalski tells us what causes problems with the heart and how to find out if you're in trouble by asking for certain tests. He explains what these tests mean and what is considered normal/risky/dangerous.And, of course, he tells us what to do. There is much more to it than eating low fat, Kowalski explains. He tells you what fats you should be eating and what fats not to. He gives other very specific recommendations on what to eat, supplements, and exercise. All of these recommendations are backed up with medical research studies or explanations of why it works. Kowalski gives encouraging statistics and benchmarks on how much people in the past have improved by following certain recommendations.In my recent flurry of reading up on heart disease, much of what Kowalski has to say is in line with the latest research. There are even a few tips that I hadn't read about before, like a cholesterol-blocking plant sterol and, for those who want beef, special breeds of cattle that produce very low fat beef that is still tender.Kowalski even makes short recommendations on mental factors that can be heart harmful.The one pitfall in this book (and the reason why I didn't give it five stars) is the diet recommendations for weight loss. In a rare departure from the rest of the book, I don't think Kowalski supports this chapter is very well by citing medical research or scientific fact. Kowalski recommends a low-carb diet (40 grams or less) and very low calories (850). Forty grams of carbs is about 1-1/2 pieces of bread, and most nutritionists say that eating under 1,200 calories a day puts your body in starvation mode, in which your body slows down metabolism because it thinks you got stranded in the middle of the desert. Carbs are necessary to give energy to your brain. Putting your body in starvation mode means that the body will try and get energy from your muscles, meaning that if you gain weight later you'll have a larger proportion of fat to muscle. While I don't think all low-carb diets are dangerous (carbs, in my opinion, do need to be judiciously controlled), 40 grams a day and 850 calories is a bit extreme. I wouldn't follow the recommendations in this chapter.However, I wouldn't let this prevent you from buying the book. The rest of &quot;The New 8-Week Cholesterol Cure&quot; is full of wonderful advice to keep the cholesterol monster away."},{"Title":"The New 8-Week Cholesterol Cure: The Ultimate Program for Preventing Heart Disease","review":"After a routine physical, my doctor reported that my triglycerides were at 508 and total cholesterol was at 220. I was given 2 months to get the numbers down or go on prescription medication.This was the first book my wife checked out at the local library. I read it and followed the guidelines on &quot;eating habit modification&quot; (I don't like the word &quot;diet&quot;). I cut out all deep-fried foods, started walking with hand weights at least 3 times a week and started taking 500mg of Niacin daily.After 8 weeks my lipid profile reflected the results: total cholesterol went to 151 from 220; triglycerides went to 146 from 508. My doctor set the target triglyceride target at 150 to stay off medication.The other &quot;side&quot; benefit was that I was able to shelve my Ranitidine prescription (heartburn medicine) which I took daily... sometimes twice daily.Hence, my recommendation to get it, read it and DO IT!"},{"Title":"The New 8-Week Cholesterol Cure: The Ultimate Program for Preventing Heart Disease","review":"My first reaction to the book was that the author was too wordy and a shareholder of Endurance Products (the on-line purveyor of the supplements he recommends in his book, who, by the way, are indeed the most reasonably priced source I've found for the products recommended by the author).Having read ALL the other popular books on this subject, I learned that the basic difference between this book and the 2nd best book on the subject (the Harvard Medical School Guide to Lowering Cholesterol by Freeman and Junge) are that Kowalski promotes niacin and phytosterols whereas Freeman and Junge prefer the use of prescription drugs.I made several of the dietery changes (in both books), added 750 mg of niacin to my daily routine, and popped a phytosterol tablet before indulging in a meal sure to contain cholesterol. The result was that I dropped my total cholesteral from 265 to 206, raised my HDL from 45 to 56, and lowered my triglicerides from 185 to 135 IN ONE MONTH! To boot, I lost 10 pounds so far while on the program. I am also enjoying Kowalski's recommended nightly quota of two glasses of red wine - cheers to raising my HDL!My doctor wanted me on Lipitor but agreed to let me try to control my cholesterol on my own for three months. He was surprised, to say the least, when he saw the dramaticly improved numbers in my last blood test. I can't wait to see the numbers at the three month mark.I do not agree with Kawalski's recommendation to attain your target weight via starvation diet (my term for his 800 calorie a day regimine - not his) then adding calories until you stabilize your weight. I don't think one in a hundred will be successful on such a severe program. Elsewhere in the book, he advocates moderation in the diet however, so read the relavant chapters more than once to get the big picture.Little changes made a big difference in my case and this book can show you how to make those changes for yourself."},{"Title":"The New 8-Week Cholesterol Cure: The Ultimate Program for Preventing Heart Disease","review":"Kowalski deserves 10 stars!He covers it all -- cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart disease -- &amp; what to do about it all!

The new version opens, for instance, with a chapter called \\"Way beyond cholesterol\\", in which Kowalski acknowledges the fact that much of heart disease is caused by factors other than cholesterol (despite the book's title). Mr. Kowalski recounts his personal journey through the maze of heart disease beginning with his first bypass operation at age 35.Mr. Kowalski writes with honesty, clarity, and without hidden agendas (like pushing cholesterol medication). You can follow his advice like that from a caring mentor.The chapter on niacin is particularly good reading. \\"This deceptively simple miracle of nature has done more than anything else to save my life.\\" Kowalski describes the ups and downs of this fascinating yet powerful vitamin and how it can be used to correct many of the neglected causes of heart attack like low HDL, high triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a).

No prescriptions, no meds, no drug company fiascos. The Niacin recommended in the book and sold locally at Walgreens is $10.99 a bottle (100 tablets). I've not heard of others who have had as fast results as I had but, to address the criticism of the low cal/low carb diet, to jump start one's health is exactly the goal here. After a year, I did do another liver panel--no problem for me but is something some people will have to take into consideration. The flush?...you'll only forget the aspirin once. I don't know if this is the answer for everyone, probably not.

I've given a copy to my internist and keep a copy on hand to give to anyone interested in making the effort. What surprises me is how little the docs know about Niacin, and how rarely this program is mentioned in the magazine articles.

It was so fascinating, I finished the book in one night. And those of you who seen the book know it is about two inch (more or less) thick.Would you rather DIE, or EAT CORPSES of bodies once belonging to your dear friends? Tough choice to make, but the Uruguaian rugby team who's plane crushed in the Andes in 1972 had to make theirs.Everyone who reads the book asks himself: what if I were in their situation? Would I have been brave enough to go on? Would I have been able to eat human flesh, even if it was the only mean of surviving?It is really pretty powerful. It actually makes you think, this book. Makes you appreciate the bravery of Fernando Parrado and his fellow passengers, be it if they made it at the end, or not.Piers Paul Read does a fabulous job of recounting it to those who haven't been there, makes it all come alive (what an ironic choice of a word) in front of our eyes."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"It is a story about a plane crash that took place in the Andes. The plane's destination was to reach Santiago in Chile, which it never did. As the plane flue over the Andes mountains, a snowstorm was making it very difficult for the pilot of the plane to see. The plane's elevation was too low causing it to hit the side of one of the mountains, which resolved in a crash. From that point the survivors of the crash were forced to do whatever was necessary in order to survive. They ate the flesh off of their dead friends' bodies and those who didn't died. What made the story lively was Piers Paul Read's well made setting, good characterization, and in depth description of different events. All of that made the story as if it was a movie. The setting is what set the tone for the story. What makes the sting in this book so good is that it doesn't just talk about where the story took place but it describes what the game of Rugby is. As it does that it also tells the reader about the most important 15 characters of the book. It describes the game as, &quot;Two teams of fifteen men face one another on the field. They wear no helmets or protective padding and there are no substitutes. The objective of each team is to place the oval ball on the try line defended by the other side or to kick the ball over the bar and between the posts of the H-shaped goal.&quot; After a well made description of the game the book goes on to tell why the plane was headed to Santiago. It mentions why the Christians want their rematch so badly. It all makes the reason for the whole trip to Santiago, make sense. The book says &quot;The first fifteen of the Old Christians had, through overconfidence, lost the Uruguayan championship to a team they considered inferior; as a result, some of the club's officers thought that they did not deserve another trip to Chile.&quot; The setting also mentions why the plane had 40 passengers instead of the few that the rugby team was made of. The extra passengers are what made the trip to Santiago a reality. To fly on the plane it cost $1,600 U.S. dollars no matter how many passengers there were on the plane. So the team found extra passengers to go on the plane to make the cost of the trip only $40 per person. This problem was described as &quot;Another problem they faced was filling the forty-odd seats of the Fairchild F-227 which they had chartered from the Air Force.&quot; These are only some of the examples from the setting of the book. The setting is what made the book exciting from the start. The other strong element in the book is it's good use of description. All authors have their own way of using description in their books, because that is what makes up the style of a book. Piers Paul Read uses good description without overdoing it like some authors do. He only goes into detail when it's necessary not just to make the book longer. One good example is when he describes the game of Rugby. It is described as, &quot;The ball can be kicked, carried or passed back; the player who holds it can be tackled by an opponent who will throw himself through the air to bring him down-grabbing him around the neck, the waist, or the legs.&quot; The book has many weird parts, which makes it good. In order for the survivors of the plane crash to survive on the Andes without food for tens of days they needed to eat. So they ended up eating the dead, which provided them with enough food to survive. Those who didn't eat had to pay with their lives by starving to death. It's amazing what people will do to survive and this book does a good job of making a person see what people are capable of once it comes to life or death. They tried to make the flesh taste as good as possible, and the book describes this as, &quot;The embers of the fire were still hot; it seemed sensible to try cooking a piece of meat on the hot foil. They did not leave it on for long, but the slight browning of the flesh gave it an immeasurable better flavor-softer than beef but with much the same taste.&quot; The book can also use very little detail by just saying what is needed. It talks about many little things without talking about things too much. When the author tries to describe the feelings of a character in the book he gets to the point without over doing it. The author describes one of the characters as, &quot;Eohavarren, in considerable pain from his smashed leg, remained cheerful and outgoing, screaming and cussing at anyone who stepped on him but always making up for it afterward with a courteous apology or a joke.&quot; In my own opinion I think that the book is very good and easy to follow. I love the parts where the characters of the story eat the human bodies down to the end, when they get rescued. It is interesting from the start down to the end. Some of the parts may make a reader sick, but that's what makes the book so good. It is that what brings the story to life as a reader reads on. After reading the book I found out that there are many uses for dead bodies. In conclusion I want to say that this book is worth reading and I give it an eight."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Alive, by Piers Paul Reed, is a great book. It is a story about a rugby team from Argentina. They travel to a tournament in Chile, and their plane crashes in the Andes. To make a long story short, they have to start eating the dead to survive.

You see what people will do in order to survive. There was a plane crash in the Andes mountains and the survivors had to figure out how to get rescued and how to live until then. I give this book 3 stars, and not 5, because of one thing-it dragged on in some parts. The story would keep going on about what the families of the survivors were thinking and what they were doing to try and locate them. There was just too much detail about this when it could've been only a few paragraphs. It seemed to take forever to finish. I thought that this story was really good once I had finished it-it just took awhile to get there. It was nicely described with how the survivors were coming along. There were some nice details about how the people were dying and what was happening to them. They had run out of food and saw the only way to survive as to eat the dead. It was really hard for all of them to get used to that idea. It really makes you think about what you would do in that situation. It also talks about how people were getting frostbite and gangrene from the cold and from infectious injuries from the crash. This is a good book to read if you have a lot of time on your hands.

Alive is an excellantly written account of their ordeal in the Andes, and their survival through ingenious ideas and the eating of their dead friends' human flesh. Meanwhile, Alive also covers the search party attempts made by the members of the families of the boys trapped in the Andes. This book also gives a good account of most of the boys personalities and their will to survive. The most compelling thing about this book is that they never gave up there belief in that they could survive through their belief in god. In the end two members of the group climb a mountain and hike for days to reach civilization and save the remaining 14 still living in the busted plane. This book is truly a great account of the determination for humans to survive at all costs. I would reccommend this book to anyone who would like to read a true and emotionally gripping story. Alive is one of the best things I've read in a long time."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"I believe that I'm not the only person who read this book, but I wanna say to all the people who didn't read it yet: &quot;you have to read it!&quot; It isn't a normal book, it's a true happend story that's beautifull written down. I have seen the movie 'Alive' several times, but when you read the book, you will notice that the book is told with much more details. I'm only 15, but the story really surprised me... I found the book dramatic but i really like it how the boys of the rugbyteam support eachother...if you read the book, you will understand what's friendship all about. It isn't just be friends and support eachother... a real friend also gives his life for his friends...in this book, almost every guy says that when he is dead, the other may eat his body, so they will not die. I hope that the persons who read the story or who wants to ask something about it...they may always contact me at griet_f@hotmail.com I love reading, but i never read a book like this one! Please do yourself a favor and read it... Thanks !"},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"I read the book first and then read a lot of its reviews. It was interesting to read, afterwards, the comments of people who didn't particularly care for the book.If you appreciate the pained lengths that consciencious authors take to accurately describe true life events, then you will appreciate this book. It is evident that the author expended enourmous efforts researching the chronology of this extremely traumatic, harrowing adventure. (So to those who criticize it for a kind of \\"documentary\\" style, you are right in this regard. The \\"read\\" is much better suited for connoisseurs of non-fiction. It is written in typical but credible \\"drama in real life\\" narrative style.) My view is, with all the criticism given, it is notwithstanding very suspensful, vivedly written and captivatingly interesting. Probably the greatest hallmark of Piers Paul Read's account is simply the detail he includes to give you a complete and realistic perspective of the traumatized human psyche in morbedly perilous moments. After you finish reading the book, you really feel like you can appreciate the grit it would take to survive where most would choose to die."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This book's controversial topic of cannibalism made it stand out from other books. Although some parts of the book dragged on, the book was overall a page turner. This book is about a clan of men and women: rugby players, their friends and family, and a few other passengers, that crash in the Andes. In the end, only sixteen men survive and to survive they have to eat the bodies of their dead friends. I like how this book describes the main characters' personalities in an accurate and honest way. In this book the characters are not portrayed as angels or demons but instead, humans."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"One of the greatest adventure stories I have ever read. It is a story of human courage, endurance and a sheer spirit of survival in the face of the greatest adversities. Terrifying details of the excruciating 72 days - believe me, the movie does not catch even 20% of this written account."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Time has not diminished the drama of the tale of the Uruguayan rugby team whose plane crashed in the Andes Mountains. Of the forty five people on the plane at the time of the crash, sixteen came down from the mountain about seventy days later with a saga of survival not easily forgotten.Theirs is a journey born of tragedy and human endurance. The author unfolds a tale that is gripping in the telling, as enthralling as it is almost unbelievable. It is investigative reporting at its best, because it does not fail to convey the human drama and pathos behind the story of this remarkable struggle for survival high up in the Andes Mountains. Masterfully written, it is a well balanced narrative that takes great pains to ground the experience of the survivors in the context out of which it arose.The plane had crashed in the Andes Mountains on Argentinian territory. It was an exercise in terror for those on the plane, as it barreled down the mountain, before finally coming to rest in a valley of snow high up in the Andes. Of the forty five persons on board, thirty two had initially survived the crash. Some, however, had sustained serious injuries. Time would not be their friend. Moreover, with little warm clothing (keep in mind that October is springtime in South America), the survivors were exposed to the extreme cold of the night air, high up in the Andes. Though spring, this still meant temperatures well below freezing. Damp, cold, and hungry, amid the anguished cries of the injured, thus began the first of many such nights.By their tenth day in the Andes, the limited food supplies, which they had rationed with all the care of a miser, had virtually run out. Starving and ravenously hungry, they voiced what they all knew to be true, but had not dared to voice before. They must eat, or they would die. The only thing left for them to eat, however, was abhorrent and deeply repugnant to them. Digging deep into their conservative, religious souls, they found a way to justify actions that would have them transcend a new reality. Their fallen comrades would now provide the means of their sustenance. All eventually succumbed to this only means of survival.This, while one of the most dramatic parts of their story, is just that, a part. Their survival entailed much more. They had to endure other deprivations. They had to survive the elements. They had to overcome a profound despair over being seemingly forgotten by the outside world. Ultimately, only sixteen were able to do so. How they did so will fascinate all readers of adventure literature. The means that they took to let the world know that they were still alive will astound even the most jaded of readers. It is an account of human endurance that is thought provoking and compelling, a quest to reconcile physical needs with the spiritual. It is, above all, a riveting testament to life."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"The book Alive survival in the Andes by Piers Paul Read was a very action pact book and was very well written. This story is about a rugby team and how they are on a flight over the mountain and the plane hits a couple of air pockets and ends up hitting one of it's wings on the side of the mountain. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes actions books or a good nonfiction story. The book did start off a little slow but picks right up. The more I read the less I wanted to put the book down. I hate to read and I loved reading this book. The book was interesting and detailed about what the people did while they where stuck on the mountain. I read this book for my World Lit. and Comp. English class and found it very easy to read. This book also taught me that given a bad situation you have to do whatever you can to survive because at that point in time, your survival is the most important thing. I also have much respect for these people and what they went through. The book helped me realized just how cold and how difficult it would be to survive up there even if your plane didn't go down, and you were just a mountain climber. I will tell all my friends about the book and would recommend it to anyone who is a reader because I think that it is such a well written book anyone would love it."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"It seems that the 1972 Andes crash will forever be associated with cannibalism. While it is certainly true that cannibalism was a factor in the survival of the 16 who came out of the mountains, it is only a fragment in a fascinating true story of survival and social dynamics.When the Uruguayan Air Force Fairchild crashed in October 1972, the survivors expected a quick rescue. When rescue didn't come, the survivors were faced with hard choices. Piers Paul Read does an excellent job showing how the old social structure began to break down, and a new one emerge. An up-and-coming \\"triumvirate\\" of three cousins eclipsed individuals who were deemed leaders prior to the crash. Nando Parrado, who was a quiet and introverted individual prior to the accident, became the determined leader of escape efforts. Roberto Canessa, a brilliant yet difficult medical student, served as both as a catalyst for survival and a self-centered burden.Read examines the personalities of the survivors, and depicts a broad spectrum of characters. There were those who immediately gave up all hope, and resigned themselves to their fate, while others were determined to survive at any cost and not give up. What emerges is a self-contained mini society under extreme stress. It was a real life \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" without the anarchy.There is enough detail to make this book a true historical resource and more than just a retelling of the story, as it was related in the move of the same name. There are grisly accounts of eating the dead, and riveting details about the quest to find the plane's tail. There is also an examination of the religious conflicts that the boys faced during and after their ordeal. Read also examines, to a lesser degree, efforts by the families of those on the plane, to keep looking even after Chilean officials gave up the search.This book is a gripping read that works on many levels. On the surface, it is a story of survival (I wouldn't use the word \\"adventure\\") under the most brutal circumstances. It is also a study of group dynamics, which counters William Golding's social commentary in \\"Lord of the Flies\\". The book needs an index and better maps. Nevertheless, it is a story that is hard to put down - and is a story that is true."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"The 1993 movie Alive was shown over the weekend on TV, I decided to finally borrow this 1974 book from the library, and finished it quickly, I couldn't put it down. The novel is a well written account of the survival of 16 Uruguayan boys from a plane crash in the Andes in October, 1972. The author didn't dramatize or sensationalize the despair of the group and the bravery of some (it was unnecessary), instead it comes across as an objective account of the people involved in the plane crash. I enjoyed the parts about Uruguayan culture -- how family and religion are predominant, how their parents (the fathers organizing more searches and mothers seeking clairvoyants and religious miracles) were involved in the rescue long after the governments of Chile and Uruguay had given up. The movie did not show this side of the story at all.The boys themselves had their own sort of society in that valley in the Andes -- not everyone was helpful or had the instinct for survival and all of them had never been through this kind of hardship, but they made it work and their system kept 16 of them alive for 72 days. They had their share of so much bad luck (not knowing where they were, the expeditionaries took a longer/harder route to civilization; their parents had the right idea of their location a few times but looked elsewhere) and some good luck (they did not lose a single boy in their many expeditions). What got them through was a mixture of hope, love for their families, inventiveness and extreme stubborness -- all of which are admirable qualities and make their story worth telling."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"I've read this book so many times. When I'm sad, it elates me. When I'm depressed, it shows me that I have nothing to be depressed about. When I doubt, it re-affirms me.

It is simply breathtaking."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"\`Alive' is the profoundly moving story of the survivors of an air crash in the Andes in 1972.A true story, this book recounts how the plane crashed and the things the survivors had to do to survive. From building hammocks and working out methods of melting snow for water high in the mountains, to sewing makeshift sleeping bags to the ultimate decision to eat their dead companions, the levels of courage and bravery are staggering to read of. You also read of the lengths they went to to be rescued and some of the aftermath on their return home.The struggles the survivors went through are incredible to read of and the moral dilemmas around their decision to resort to cannibalism elevate this above other survival stories. I have read many other books of this type and this book was gripping, at times harrowing and ultimately inspiring.This book has two photo plate sections which show some of the conditions and the people involved. They are a little blurry, as is expected of the period, but they give some indication of the conditions on the mountainside.The events on the inhospitable mountain profoundly changed all of the people involved and by reading their story you too will be changed and affected by their experiences.

Many of us have seen the movie or know something about the story. Well, if u never read the book, you don't know much. Very well written, with extensive detail, this book will transport you to the mountain, to feel anxious, desperate, angry, sad, abandoned, and finally joyfull and blessed after being rescued. At some moments you will laugh and at others cry. Of course it will keep you wandering: what if I was the one there? what would I have done? how would I have felt? would I have been able to resist?.

But a fantastic read that will keep your interest throughout."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This is a classic book on winter survival, detailing the survival of 16 Uruguayan rugby players for 10 weeks after their plane crashed in the Andes Mountains on October 12, 1972. As is well known, these men survived by eating from the bodies of the victims that died in the crash or died afterwards. We learn of their physical and mental hardships and the group dynamics that arose during their ordeal, and how the survivors came to make the choices they made.A movie was made about these events, and at least one survivor has written of his experiences on the mountain. The movie, which I haven't seen, isAlive. The memoir, which I haven't read, isMiracle in the Andes: 72 Days on the Mountain and My Long Trek Home.Gruesome details of their cannibalism are rare in the book. One passage is quoted below.\\"The last discovery in their search for new tastes and new sources of food were the brains of the bodies which they had hitherto discarded. Canessa ... had been the first to take a head, cut the skin across the forehead, pull back the scalp, and crack open the skull with an ax. The brains were then either divided up and eaten while still frozen or used to make the sauce for a stew; the liver, intestine, muscle, fat, heart and kidneys, either cooked or uncooked, were cut up into little pieces and mixed with the brains. ... For the stew Inciarte used a shaving bowl, while others used the top halves of skulls.\\" (p 216)The book is a factual report of what occurred on the mountain among the survivors and what efforts were made by their families, friends, and government officials to find the lost plane. The author limits himself to a dispassionate, careful telling of the events and does not abstractly discuss the psychology of survival or speculate on what a descent into cannibalism might imply about human nature or our conventional principles of morality. Do extreme situations loosen moral strictures or do such situations merely loosen moral restraint? The author does not raise these questions. The Roman Catholic survivors found moral support for their choice through believing they had a moral obligation to survive if it were physically possible, and therefore to act in accordance with that obligation, and then by using Christ's words at the Last Supper, they arrived at an analogy of a sacrifice of the dead for the living."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This is the only book I've ever read where I caught myself shielding my eyes so as not to know quite so much about the fine points of cannibalism. I ended up skipping about two pages detailing the butchering of the bodies, which organs are the most nutritious, etc. However, the author was just doing his job and there's only a few pages involving cannibalism.The plane came down in a snow field at 11,500 feet elevation, higher than the highest mountain in California by comparison. This put them far above the timber line in a frigid place devoid of all life -- not even a fly or a blade of grass. Due to incompetence on the part of search and rescue operations and also a so-called psychic who had the rescuers searching everywhere but the right place, the survivors were presumed dead and left to fend for themselves for 72 days, and would likely have never been found were it not for the daring feats of mountaineering by two of the survivors who went on an arduous 8 day trek out of the mountains and into Chile in search of rescuers.With no food it was inevitable the group would have to eat the dead if they were survive. As someone explained, your survival instincts and your appetite will not only lead you to eat the dead, but eventually to savor it. Then, when the two expeditionaries finally connected with civilization, a peasant tossed them a crust of bread and their appetite for human flesh evaporated.As horrifying as it was, there is an upbeat message in this book about the unshakeable will to live, about the utility of human solidarity in the face of death, and the mystical communion between the survivors and their dead comrades who saved their lives by providing the nourishment to survive.This book has been around a long time. It's a page-turner and millions have read it, especially in South America where this event was known simply as the Andes crash, and the survivors are still celebrated as heroes. Google it if you want and you'll find lots more info, photos, and a Google map reference to the exact spot the wrecked fuselage came to rest."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"What would it be like being stranded in the Andes with very little food or water? Well Alive by Piers Paul Read might give you an idea. This emotional, and yet exciting non fiction book accurately depicts the terrible seventy-two days a team of Uruguayan rugby players and their relatives experience. The setting of the book is in the Andes Mountains, Uruguay, Chili, and takes place in 1972. The theme of this book is man's will to survive is more powerful than anything. The main characters of this moderately paced book would be the last sixteen survivors, the two strongest of them being Fernando Parrado and Roberto Canessa, who play a big role in the survival of them all. After being stranded for seventy-two days in the Andes Mountains this small rugby team forms a special bond and learns the true meanings of life. I think this is a very exciting, but gory book and would recommend it to anybody but only if you have a strong stomach because there are many references to dead bodies and eating human flesh. These rugby players show us that with faith and a strong will to survive we can overcome large obstacles."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"I couldn't put this book down.

Being a survivor of a fatal car crash that put me into a coma for 4 days, I watched this movie over and over because of the effect that it had on me. However, I felt that there had to be more information than what was shown in the movie, so I decided to get the book. I found out that I was right.The movie only showed you what the people in the crash were going through and nothing about their families and people back at home. People at home were doing so much and spending money and trying so hard to find their children and loved ones that everyone believed was dead.Something else that I found interesting is that in order to survive, the people had to act as cannibals and eat the meat of the dead humans in order to survive. Although many other people felt that this was unjustified, including some of the people that were there at first, it was necessary in order to survive.If they did not do that, they would have died very quickly. In my eyes, once a human dies, their body is just meat and their soul does go up to heaven. I truly do support everyone who did this and think they are great human beings for what they did.In addition, I remember reading that one of the people actually met one of the survivers, and I have to say, considering the fact that I myself was in a situation sort of like this, a coma, I would truly love to meet one of them and compare our situations.

This is a non-fiction story of a party who met with an accident in wintry Andes. In plane there were some passengers, one football team, man and wife, an old lady, and so on.. The plane was so small that could contain about 40. They were flying over the Andes for each purpose and that's common for all people even in winter. When they had still about 20 minutes ride to an airport, suddenly the plane hit a summit of the Andes and was cut in half. The back half of it fell to the Andes with a few passengers. The other half of it leaned to the front and also started to fall. Some prayed, some screamed while they were coming to the ground of Andes. The plane was crashed in the Andes. Luckily they survived excepting some people with no luck. But it was never lucky accident for survivors. The outside of the plane was snowstorm and it was deadly freezing. The next day morning 6 were found dead of freezing. They also had another big problem. It was foods. They didn't have enough foods for them all to survive until a rescue corps come. A few days later they could hear a portable radio saying that no survivors at this accident and gave up the search for survivors. One night a man said &quot;eat them.&quot;. Suddenly another said &quot;No! Did you go mad?&quot;. Then others said &quot;But it may be the only way to survive.&quot;. &quot;Them&quot; meant dead men bodies. Next day they made up their minds to eat them excepting a man who was against the opinion to the end. It was that night that he died. At last two strong men decided to cross over the wintry Andes to get rescue. They promised they got rescue for them all without fail. And they succeeded it. I don't remember in detail well, so I may make a few mistakes. But this is the approximate story of &quot;Alive&quot;. How do you feel their connibalism? Do you think they went insane with hunger? I don't think so. I think they knew it was abnormal behavior but it was only way for them to survive. They couldn't help it. They had no choice. Maybe they are proud of it and their living now. I also respect it."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"&quot;Alive&quot; portrays the Andes' survivors in a gripping and unbiased manner.

The powerful story portrays excellent examples of teamwork and perseverance in the fight for survival. Though this is an interesting read, I found the authors style to be very unorganized and boring. The introduction of the story, tells about the history of rugby and its existence in this teams home country. It is very boring and not really relevant. Following this dull intro, the book then takes you on a wild ride through a exulting, horrifying plane crash. This leaves many of the passengers dead and injured. After this I found the book very anticlimactic. Though it was very interesting and there were parts of the story that were exciting and very well written, I found that the author added too much dull information which could have easily been left out. The end result appears to be a book not meant for the thrill seekers, but instead, a shelf ridden book, anxiously awaiting it's intermittent rainy day use."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"The book has been called a lot of things, or at least the story it tells. Just how far would you go to survive in conditions these players found themselves? So I think for me the book is more than the true story of survival by school players; it is a demand for the reader to place him or her self in that position and think about what he or she would do. At least I found myself doing that. Could I eat the flesh of another human; a friend? Could I give up and just will myself to die? Rather than judging what they did I found myself being challenged to decide what I would do. Of course we never know what we would do until we are there and suffer through 10 weeks of terrible suffering. Still reading their story forces us to look at ourselves if we so dare.What is right and what is wrong when survival is the issue? What do we think \\"our\\" God would say to us? What does our faith tell us we can do or not do? There are so many issues and when you're freezing and starving and hurting from injuries it isn't so easy to think them through logically. But we are warm and well fed and have time. This book gave me the chance to think what would be right for me (not judge them) and go from there. And maybe we will be judged on what we decide is right or wrong.This is not a book I would read again, nor one I would even recommend. But still it gives us all a chance to look at ourselves through the eyes of those who lived it."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"It's become a bit of trivial fodder: In 1972, a plane carrying a Uraguayan rugby team and their friends crashed in the Andes. They survived there for over 70 days, doing whatever was necessary to survive, sustained on their faith, and the hope that they could one day break beyond the prison of the mountains and reach civilization.Since the story HAS become a piece of trivia, it's important that we read something that makes us understand the underlying humanity of the situation. To that end, Read's book is almost a necessity. It details day-to-day life in the crashed plane, and attempts of the Uraguayan families to find their missing loved ones.The great thing about \\"Alive\\" is that it chronicles the event in a somewhat detached manner. At first, this might seem odd; after all, such a tragic event is an emotionally-charged topic, especially once you get down to the human element. However, to tell the tale with emotion is to get LOST in the tale. To overcome this, read uses a scientific, detached description of events, which ultimately leads the reader to ponder the horrific reality these people went through. It is a very successful storytelling mode, which only hits a few snags (he insists upon calling cannibalism \\"anthropophagy,\\" and admits in the introduction that some of the survivors felt the book didn't go into enough detail about the friendship they felt for each other). Also, there is the fact that this book dates back to 1974, only two years after the events; it would be nice to know how the survivors faced the rest of their lives.Still, the book is thorough, and it's dry, almost dead-pan style is the only real way of describing the events that unfolded, without getting lost within the maze of emotions (actually, the dry delivery almost makes things even more horrible; don't read this book if you are squeamish). \\"Alive\\" is a tale of horrific events that tested the limits of humanity. It is a must-read for anyone interested in what being human really means."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This book was pretty good. Sometimes it made me forget that I was reading a NON-fiction book. It was quite interesting because I started to think about what I would do in their situation. Although kind of gross sometimes, it was an amusing story. Definitely not for the weak stomached. Some chapters were a bit slow and there were a lot of characters to keep track of, but for the most part it was an exciting read. I recommend it even if you don't have to read it for school. Especially if you buy it for $0.01 like I did!"},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"After seeing the movie of the same name, I had to go out and buy the book. It took me forever to finally find it, and when I did, I didn't regret it. My own dog-eared copy -- only a few weeks old, by the way -- goes with me everywhere now. The story of the 1972 plane crash in which members, friends, and family of a Uruguayan rugby team were forced to face the prospect of eating the flesh of the dead isn't the gratuitously graphic tale it certainly has the potential to be. Piers Paul Read portrays the victims and the survivors not as cannibals, but as people who have to escape torturous circumstancesin the only way possible. In reading this book, I found myself realizing that, in the same way as I had when I watched the movie, I couldn't help but think what I would have done in their situation. It took reading this book to understand that in refusing to eat human flesh and going along with a taboo like that, I would be condemning myself in such a situation, and I care to! ! o much about my family and friends to do something like that.

This is the question that the survivors of the horrible 1972 plane crash in the Andes had to ask themselves. When rescue was out of the question, they were given the terrible choice of either eating their deceased friends or perishing from starvation and malnutrition. The disaster began when a Uruguayan airplane set out from Montevideo, Uruguay to Santiago, Chile. While flying over the Andes, the copilot brought the plane down too early. The plane crashed, and for around ten weeks the survivors had to live in the middle of a valley in the Andes. At one point an avalanche goes into the plane and kills eight survivors. The book also follows the valiant quest of the parents to find their missing children. Throughout the book, most keep the hope that their sons are still alive. Do the 18 remaining survivors live or die? To answer this question, read Alive, by Piers Paul Read.There are many characters in this book, and Read does an excellent job of portraying each one's personality. Since there are so many, I'll only discuss the main ones. These are Fernando Parrado, Roberto Cansessa, Vizintin, Eduardo and Fito Strauch, and Daniel Fernadez. Parrado, Cansessa, and Vizintin are the of the group, and they have to try to find their way out of the cordillera (elevated valley in a between high mountains) to civilization. All of them are strong of heart and mind, and their fellow hold them in high regard. Over the course of the book they go on two substantial expeditions. The Strauch cousins (Daniel, Eduardo, and Fito) are the other powerful group amongst the survivors. Although physical ailments keep them from going on expeditions, the take the gruesome job of cutting up the human flesh and are united by their family bonds. Fito is the inventor of the group, as he devised a water making device. All these people were real, and these things really happened. There are many more survivors that each did their best to help the group, but those six are the main ones. The only thing bad about them is the similarity of their names.This was one of my favorite books, especially out of nonfiction stories. It is amazing to think that these brave boys survived the bitter cold, near starvation, and the mental breakdown that often occurred when away from family, friends, and just plain people for so long. I myself would find it so hard to eat the flesh of my friends, but when you think about it is just a silly taboo. I really enjoyed the authors style of writing. At times, I felt as though I was up in the Andes myself, enduring all of their hardships. There were also two stories going on, one about the parents and the other about the survivors. Three adjectives I'd use to describe this book are interesting, inspiring, and informational. Alive was a thrilling story of human adaptability, ingenuity, and courage. Get a copy today!"},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"In October of 1972, a chartered plane carrying 45 passengers and crew left Uruguay to travel to Chile. A majority of the passengers were made up of young men who were part of an amateur rugby team going to Chile for a game. Others included family and friends. Over the rugged Andes, the pilot made a fatal error, and the plane crashed into the side of a mountain, flinging parts of the tail section, fuselage, wing, rudder and even some passengers out over the desolate landscape. The survivors were, for the most part, very young men (average age around 23 years old). On average, they came from priviledged families. Most were devout Catholics. They enjoyed their cigarettes. They loved their mothers and girlfriends. They loved the game of rugby and were eager to experience a taste of the world outside their beloved Uruguay.Over the next 70 days, the remaining survivors battled cold, avalanches, injury, fear and hunger. To survive, they prayed - alot. They devised plans for capturing water. They made forays into the vast white bleak landscape to search for supplies and a way out. They became makeshift doctors and surgeons and helped the wounded. They waited for rescue to come from the outside. And to fight off starvation, they ate their dead.The story of the 16 remaining Andes survivors makes for riveting reading. The first time I read this book I was in my early 20s myself, and I remember the cannibalism being the overriding memory I took away from this book. Now I'm older, and it's not the cannibalism that captures my attention, but how these very young men kept their sanity, faith and courage in the face of unimaginable horrors. Of their cannibalism, they are unapologetic (which is as it should be). However, they didn't take what they did to survive lightly, and one of the survivors says it best:\\"When one awakes in the morning amid the silence of the mountains and sees all around the snow-capped peaks--it is majestic, sensational, something frightening--one feels alone, alone, alone in the world but for the presence of God. For I can assure you that God is there. We all felt it, inside ourselves, and not because we were the kind of pious youths who are always praying all day long, even though we had a religious education. Not at all. But there one feels the presence of God. One feels, above all, what is called the hand of God, and allows oneself to be guided by it...And when the moment came when we did not have any more food, or anything of that kind, we thought to ourselves that if Jesus at His last supper had shared His flesh and blood with His apostles, then it was a sign to us that we should do the same--take the flesh and blood as an intimate communion between us all. It was this that helped us to survive, and now we do not want this--which was something intimate, intimate--to be hackneyed or touched or anything like that....\\"Alive is much much more then a survival story. It is a glimpse of courage and faith in the midst of death, fear, and hopelessness."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Couldn't put the book down. Well written true story that makes you appreciate life. My heart goes out to all on plane and there courage to survive. A MUST read for those who enjoy bio's.Christa"},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Time has not diminished the drama of the tale of the Uruguayan rugby team whose plane crashed in the Andes Mountains. Of the forty five people on the plane at the time of the crash, sixteen came down from the mountain about seventy days later with a saga of survival not easily forgotten.Theirs is a journey born of tragedy and human endurance. The author unfolds a tale that is gripping in the telling, as enthralling as it is almost unbelievable. It is investigative reporting at its best, because it does not fail to convey the human drama and pathos behind the story of this remarkable struggle for survival high up in the Andes Mountains. Masterfully written, it is a well balanced narrative that takes great pains to ground the experience of the survivors in the context out of which it arose.The plane had crashed in the Andes Mountains on Argentinian territory. It was an exercise in terror for those on the plane, as it barreled down the mountain, before finally coming to rest in a valley of snow high up in the Andes. Of the forty five persons on board, thirty two had initially survived the crash. Some, however, had sustained serious injuries. Time would not be their friend. Moreover, with little warm clothing (keep in mind that October is springtime in South America), the survivors were exposed to the extreme cold of the night air, high up in the Andes. Though spring, this still meant temperatures well below freezing. Damp, cold, and hungry, amid the anguished cries of the injured, thus began the first of many such nights.By their tenth day in the Andes, the limited food supplies, which they had rationed with all the care of a miser, had virtually run out. Starving and ravenously hungry, they voiced what they all knew to be true, but had not dared to voice before. They must eat, or they would die. The only thing left for them to eat, however, was abhorrent and deeply repugnant to them. Digging deep into their conservative, religious souls, they found a way to justify actions that would have them transcend a new reality. Their fallen comrades would now provide the means of their sustenance. All eventually succumbed to this only means of survival.This, while one of the most dramatic parts of their story, is just that, a part. Their survival entailed much more. They had to endure other deprivations. They had to survive the elements. They had to overcome a profound despair over being seemingly forgotten by the outside world. Ultimately, only sixteen were able to do so. How they did so will fascinate all readers of adventure literature. The means that they took to let the world know that they were still alive will astound even the most jaded of readers. It is an account of human endurance that is thought provoking and compelling, a quest to reconcile physical needs with the spiritual. It is, above all, a riveting testament to life."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"I thought this book was a very insightful veiw into the thoughts and feelings of the Andes Survivors.

It would be very hard to do that for people that are from Uraguay which is on the eastern side of South America and is known to have beautiful weather. The Andes Mountains are known as some of the most dangerous mountains in the world. The conditions they were put trough were beyond belief. The part i least enjoyed reading about was when people died because i knew that it was a real death. Some of the characters froze to death and others starved to death.

This is a well-written novel about a team of strong rugby players and their loyal fans and family who crash on a plane in the high Andes Mountains. Their only shelter was the plane's shattered fuselage and their only supplies consisted of wine, marmalade, and a few candy bars. This story captures this horrific catastrophe and the amazing survival of the original thirty-two survivors to the final sixteen that actually made it out alive after they resorted to canabalism. I loved this novel and believe it is the best non-fiction adventure ever written. As I read about their story, I felt as though I knew the characters personally and began to truly feel emotions and troubles they were experiencing. Alive is very realistic and captures the hopelessness of the situation and the special bonds between the survivors. After reading Alive, absolutely no one will underestimate their will to survive.Alive is especially appealing to those people who enjoy suspenseful adventures novels. Anyone who loves detailed accounts of nature and its landscape will enjoy it thoroughly.

Incredible story of survival...makes you question to what lengths you would go to to survive."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Suspense, emotions, and cannibalism. In the book, ALIVE: The Story of the Andes Survivors, author Piers Paul Read showcases his ability to hypnotize the reader. Seriously, it's as if he works in jedi mind tricks into his writing. Throughout, he keeps the reader interested by teasing him or her with the constant use of internal cliffhangers and mental shifts.The book begins focused on a group of Uruguayan rugby players accompanied by some of their friends and family members on their annual trip to Chile to participate in a rugby tournament. With forty five jubilant passengers on board, the Fairchild FH-227D takes off on Friday, October 13, 1972 and begins its route across the Andes. However, extreme weather conditions cause the plane to jeer off course and plummet down into the barren mountains. The story then goes on to recount the seventy two days that the survivors of the crash are forced to suffer through before being rescued.While retelling the experience, Read chooses to switch back and forth between the stories of the survivors and the rescuers. Not only does this give the reader a sense of completeness, it also allows Read to insert a cliffhanger at the end of almost every section. This tool helps make ALIVE a very page-turning book by keeping the reader on end and wanting more. Also, Read often compares and contrasts both sides. In their need to survive, the passengers might do something unthinkable, such as resort to cannibalism, and through the author's calm, convincing tone, the reader becomes familiar with the idea and even begins to view human flesh as just another food source. However, when Read switches back to the rescuers, the reader suddenly snaps back to the \\"outside world,\\" and the actions of the passengers suddenly seem unthinkable and grotesque. Such realizations prove that Read was capable of writing the story in such a real, telling way using mind-washing diction that the reader feels as if he or she is actually trapped in the Andes with the passengers.The fact that Read is capable of making events preceding the crash as well as events that occurred days after rescue seem just as intriguing as the seventy two days of survival is also one of the best elements in this book. To do this, Read plays with the reader's mind by either withholding certain information or making great use of dramatic irony. This in turn makes the reader feel somewhat frustrated but in a good way since it makes him or her want to read more. This also showcases Read's talent to pick out the key ideas (or atleast the ideas that would be most meaningful to the average reader) presented in the story of the Andes survivors.The only aspect of this book that I disliked was the beginning. Read decides to use a large majority of the first chapter discussing history and backstory about the Uruguayans, their various reasons to take the plane to Chile, and an overly-detailed explanation of rugby. By putting all of this information together, Read makes this section sound like a passage from a textbook. Worse still, this uninviting opening may even deter the reader from reading further. To avoid this, Read should have weaved this information throughout the first few chapters so that the book would have started off with the focus being on the Uruguayans' interactions with each other before the accident.To add, Read signifies that the majority of the dialogue in the book is fabricated. However, Read also makes it clear that he went through a lengthy interview process with everybody significantly related to the accident before writing the novel. In this way, some parts of the book aren't completely accurate, but they are as close as possible. Also, the dialogue adds another dimension to the story. It makes everything seem relatable. Without it, the story would be quite lackluster, and it would resemble narration rather than an engaging account of survival. In fact, the dialogue is one of the best features of the book because it provides the reader with a deeper understaning of each of the passengers' personalities by showing rather than telling.Overall, this book is very well written, and it does an outstanding job of pulling the reader into the story. As long as you push through the dull introduction, you'll find yourself divulged in this truly miraculous story, which is why I give this book a very deserving four out of five stars."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This is a very interesting book.

He argued forcefully that they were not going to be rescued; they would have to escape themselves, but nothing could be done without food; and that the only food was human flesh.\\" (page 78) This is an important quote from the book Alive by Piers Paul Read. Alive is about a Catholic rugby team called the Old Christians that got in a plane crash over the Ande Mountains. The people who survived the crash have to make the decision to eat human flesh or not since they are Catholic. I think it would be alright because, \\"They believe that virtue lay in survival and that eating their dead friends would in no way endanger their souls...\\" (page 80-81) Another opinion I have is that the victims used teamwork, encouragement, and sacrifice. I think this because, (on page 79) Zerbino said, \\"'...that if my dead body could help you stay alive, then I'd certainly want you to use it...'\\" Though this book may be intense, I recommend it to everyone because, people think they have it rough when little things go wrong. These people survived a plane crash and had to convert to cannibalism in an attempt to survive."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"AlivePiers Paul ReadIn 1972 a group of rugby players from Uruguay boarded a plane to take them to Chile for a game. Unexpectedly, they had to make stop in Mendoza, Argentina because of bad weather in the Andes Mountains. Everything went downhill from there, for as they set out across the Andes, one of the planes wings broke, causing the plane to fall at a catastrophic speed. More than ten of the passengers died in the crash and most were severely injured. They were trying to survive in below zero temperatures with nothing but bits of chocolate and rugby clothes. Many of the injuries proved to be fatal, ranging from parts of the plane sticking through stomachs to crushed femurs and frostbite. As everyone struggles to survive, more and more people die. There is virtually no food and to top it all off, an avalanche kills even more people. As everyone continues to grow weaker they are faced with a major dilemma: in order to survive they must eat their dead teammates flesh. But who could eat his best friend, who was alive and talking only hours before? This incredible non-fiction tale is enough to get anyone crying. This book deserves a 4 star rating because of the excellent description and the amazing adventure itself. This book is like something people have nightmares about and I have never read a book that is so intense. A number one best seller and \\"thunderous entertainment ... a classic human adventure... a narrative of terrific and enduring significance\\" (The New York Times.)

You get to know the boys of this tragedy so well...they become your friends, your family, and you feel the pain when one does not survive. The strength from not only Nando Parrado but Roberto Canessa makes this story so exceptional. Nando was full of a will power so strong that you could sense every step he took through the mountains.

He probes deeply into the motivations and decisions of the survivors, and we must admire their intelligence, resourcefulness and, above all, their courage. We who have the luxory of access to the Internet no doubt take the basics of survival for granted--we know where our next meal is coming from. But anyone who reads this book will never take food or the smallest creature comforts for granted again. Read writes that after the experience the survivors disdained all superficiality and learned what was they truly valued in their lives. The gift of the survivors to the world is their own story, which wakes us up to this reality without having to go through such a harrowing experience ourselves.

The escape, despite the power of the environment,was heroic. Anyone who has been lost while bushwalking can strongly identify with this. The reunion was deeply moving, also tragic for many relatives.

Dudley, the persons in this book were forced to reach the ultimate survivalist conclusion: that resorting to cannibalism was the only way to remain alive in impossible conditions. This book is an amazing chronicle of the experiences of the survivors, even though it lends itself to a long series of exceedingly tasteless jokes about the menu (Peasant Under Glass; French, Fried; Ladyfingers; Baked Alaskans).Highly recommended if you have the stomach for it, and can read it without instantly making judgments about the people involved... no one who was not on that mountain top can truly say what s/he would have done differently in the same situation."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Alive.

This book also really raised questions in myself about what I would do in such a situation. I would have to say that the worst part of the book was that it is so graphic, which I guess is neccessary to the plot itself.

There's really no other way to describe it. Read captures magnificently the true story of a rugby team from Uruguay, along with a few relatives and close friends, whose plane crashed in the Andes Mountains on the way to Chile, where the boys were to play against another rugby team. Amidst a sea of death and horror, the people who survived the initial plane crash are forced to take immediate action in order to preserve their lives and the lives of others around them. Only the hope of a rescue that never comes carries the boys through their first few days on the mountain. When they realize that the rescue has been called off, their adventure truly begins. This is a story of brotherhood in the purest sense. Stranded in the freezing Andes, cold, hungry, weak and desperate, the survivors struggle against all odds to remain alive. They prove to be quite inventive and ingenious, using what remains of the plane to create a better world for themselves in the Andes. They maintain hope even as their friends continue to die and in their extreme hunger they are forced to consume the flesh of the corpses. It is their optimism and brightness of spirit that carries the final sixteen through to the end. In the meantime, their parents and families continue to search for the boys even when the countries of Uruguay, Chile, and Argentina abandon the search. Although many don't see how the boys could still be alive, they do not give up hope. At the end of the book, to see each boy reunited with his family is quite amazing. Words cannot express the depth of feeling that emerges from these pages. The story of the Andes survivors and their families is one that begs to be told. No work of fiction could compare to the inspirational quality of this work. It's a &quot;must read,&quot; and once it has been read, it cannot easily be forgotten. This book will haunt your dreams and find its way back to your thoughts time and time again. More than anything it will allow you to project yourself ! into the conditions endured by the boys and ask yourself, &quot;What would I have done?&quot; Would you have been strong and believed you would be saved up until the end? Would you be destroyed by the absolute desperation of the situation? In truth you could not know until it happened to you. And it could happen to you. Perhaps the very knowledge of this is what makes the story of the Andes survivors shine. Their strength and will to live is extraordinary. It must be read to be believed."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Time has not diminished the drama of the tale of the Uruguayan rugby team whose plane crashed in the Andes Mountains.

This alone should illuminate the style in which this book is written. It is not gratuitous, nor fictionalized. Everything is laid out in a straightforward, almost documentary fashion. This approach to telling such an indescribable tale actually serves the story well. The experience of these young men over the 71 days they were lost in the Andes Mountains is simply unfathomable. To cloak the telling of the story in a barrage of parables and adverbs and overwrought descriptions would, I think, diminish the power of its truth: The will of these 16 human beings to survive at all costs rose above every brutal reality thrown at them on a sustained basis for 10 weeks. Truly, it's hard to imagine their plight being much worse. It's equally hard to read this book without being consumed by the question of \\"What if that was me?\\" We each doubtlessly like to think that we'd have been one of the 16 survivors, but as each chapter unfolds, I couldn't help but wonder to what extremes could I be pushed before succumbing? Having seen the movie and read the book, I can't help but think that the movie cheated the audience somewhat, first by sanitizing the eating of the dead. For the most part, the survivors were only shown peeling back strips of muscle tissue which looked an awful lot like chicken. I don't think it should have been a major focus in the film, but the reality of cannibalism in the extreme was what enabled these men to survive and cannot be overlooked or brushed aside with only a perfunctory acknowledgement. The book was not remotely indulgent or gratuitous on this issue, but no details were spared. The corpses were scavenged, skulls were split with axes to get to the brains, strips of fat were laid on the plane's roof to dry in the sun, the men endured horrible bouts of diarrhea and other maladies, on and on... there is nothing pleasant about this kind of survival. The matter-of-fact writing style simply laid it all out and yes, it's disturbing and quite difficult to read. Very little of the dead's remains were not used as food and the author presents it plainly, but it's no less graphic for the telling. The second aspect in which the movie cheated on the storytelling was the final expedition of Nando Parrado and Roberto Canessa which facilitated the rescue of the 14 men who remained on the mountain. This was a 10-day journey of profound difficulty, the last few days of which, in the film, were condensed to a 30-second montage. The book also goes into quite a lot of detail on the searching efforts of the parents, as well (completely omitted in the movie). This slows down the story noticeably, but is a necessary part of its telling. ALIVE is a gripping tale of harrowing survival in one of cruelest set of circumstances imaginable. The book is well-written, utterly compelling and I highly recommend reading it if for no other reason than to inspire a profound appreciation for one's own life."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Time has not diminished the drama of the tale of the Uruguayan rugby team whose plane crashed in the Andes mountains.

Digging deep into their conservative, religious souls, they found a way to justify actions that would have them transcend a new reality. Their fallen comrades would now provide the means of their sustenance. All eventually succumbed to this only means of survival.This, while one of the most dramatic parts of their story, is just that, a part. Their survival entailed much more. They had to endure other deprivations. They had to survive the elements. They had to overcome a profound despair over being seemingly forgotten by the outside world. Ultimately, only sixteen were able to do so. How they did so will fascinate all readers of adventure literature. The means that they took to let the world know that they were still alive will astound even the most jaded of readers. It is an account of human endurance that is thought provoking and compelling, a quest to reconcile physical needs with the spiritual. It is, above all, a riveting testament to life."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This book is so well written that you will feel like you were there and suffered with them. After reading this book I felt like I had a new appreciation for life. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Author Piers Paul Read does a superb job of narrating this awe inspiring, nightmarish tale of survival. A violent plane crash in the Andes leaves a team of young Rugby players to battle, sub-zero temperatures, avalanches, the death of friends and loved ones, hopelessness and eventually starvation. Their will to survive brings them to a horrible choice few ever have to make; resort to canabilism or die a painful death by starvation. What makes their decision even more heartbreaking and terrible is the fact that most of the bodies they must eat to live are friends, teammates, and/or relatives. For nearly 80 days we live through the waking nightmare via Read's narrative suffering unimaginable physical and incomprehensible mental trials, but in the end it is oddly a tale of hope, faith, love and the ultimate sacrafice."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"I just had to re-review this book which I just finished reading again. And again, I was riveted. Even though I got caught sneaking a page or two at work (twice) and knew the outcome I couldn't put it down. Piers Paul Read did a masterful job of portraying this true story of human drama, endurance and survival of the Self. The book definitely exceeds the movie.The book runs the gamut of human emotions and responses to catastrophic disasters, and effectively portrays the extremes of human strengths and frailties, along with defeats and conquests in an inspirational and exciting manner. Heroes and heroines there were. Cowards and weaklings too. Mediators and the Head-Strong also were among them. Put them all together and you get a good mix and idea of what we are all about. I could not help but feel I was there, that I too shared in their victories and commiserated in their defeats. Great Book! They must have had a great spirit watching over them."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"While the movie adaptation of Alive depicts the major events of the ordeal fairly comprehensively, only the book contains the complete account. Piers Paul Read's book is very complete and detailed, more fully describing the daily sufferings and routines of the survivors. In particular, emotional stresses, individual personalities, and the grisly task of obtaining flesh are related in depth.It is frightening to consider how easily we can be thrust into a situation as horrifying as that the Uruguayan travellers in this book had to endure, but their story should not be avoided because it is upsetting. There is much to be learned from this account: the value of resourcefulness, of ability to do the agonizingly difficult, and of courage in frightening circumstances. Furthermore, to recognize how nearly hopeless a situation can be, and what extraordinary effort is needed to escape it helps us recalibrate our perceptions of difficulty, misery and pain to more accurate levels.Though the survivors requested and evaluated this book, it is completely frank. Read gives an honest description of each survivor, including personality failings which made some survivors a further hardship to the rest. The growing despondency and physical withering of the survivors is told with harsh vividness. Describing how dead bodies were utilized was surely the most difficult task, but Read writes of this area with as much detail as any other. Corpses were not only stripped of muscle, but also internal organs, then bone marrow, then the skulls cracked for the brain within, as corpses available for food became scarce, ocasionally requiring that the grisly, partially eaten bodies be exhumed. In addition to the ordeal on the mountain, also included are: a brief description of the emotional outcomes of the experience; the media bombardment; the personal search conducted by parents for the crash site. Maps are included to place the story, but these are not scaled.This account does leave one disturbed. The truth of our defenselessness but for the blanket of civilization is a valuable lesson that can only be shocked into our conditioned minds, however. There is a place in everyone's reading for such material, and furthermore, this incredible story takes only two or three days to read."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"As a kid in 1972 I heard on the radio that survivors from a plane crash in South America had walked out of the mountains weeks after being given up for dead. This superbly readable narrative tells their story. Thirty two of the 45 rugby players and other passengers survived the hard landing in the deep snow (some with injuries). Now they were trapped high in the remote and frigid Andes Mountains with almost no provisions. No rescue planes appeared overhead - all search flights scoured the wrong area due to faulty navigational readings the pilot (who was off course) radioed in before the crash. Shivering in their new home (the plane's fuselage), each person knew they'd need extraordinary effort and some luck to survive what became a ten-week ordeal of damp, cold and death. The author shows how the group developed several life-saving innovations. We also see the devastating choice they faced when their rationed food ran out; either cannibalize their dead comrades or die of starvation. Later, in near desperation, they sent their fittest members up the icy slope of a nearby peak. Perhaps the two could somehow ascend safely without proper equipment, and then find a way out from their frozen death trap.Author Pier Paul Read makes readers feel like they're sitting alongside the survivors high in the frozen Andes. This is not a happy story - too many perished from injuries and harsh conditions. Still, this is an utterly fascinating narrative (and later a 1993 film) about determination and the will to survive."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"I remember in college reading about these plane crash survivors who walked out of the Andes after having been stranded for several weeks... So when the book came out a few years later, I read it in one sitting. Well, actually, when I started to fall asleep I put it down, but as soon as I woke up started again until I finished. It is still one of the most compelling books I've ever read and in discussions with people on favorite books, it is at the top of my list. The other reviews describe the story, but what is so compelling is how this survival situation brought out the true characters of the teammates--which ones got hysterical, which ones turned to mush, which ones became the leaders--and how ultimately heroic they all were. What the reader keeps asking oneself is, \\"What would I have done in that situation?\\" How would I have handled the extreme situation these mostly upper-class boys found themselves in? The author does not spare the reader the grisly details of the crash and its aftermath. I did not find it boring in the least. I relished all the details--the descriptions about their lives before the crash, their families' annguished search for them... It is truly a heart-rending--and triumphant--story. Also, the movie of this event done in the 1990s is surprisingly good. I recommend that, too. The decpiction of the plane crash in the mountain is particulary jarring. But, the book is stunning. Read it!"},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"I highly enjoyed this book and would definately recommend it to anyone who wants an exciting read. Alive not only entices the reader with tons of detail but it catches the readers hearts by really showing what the survivers went through to survive. Each page is filled with emotion that overflows to the reader. A story of determination, hope, strength and love any person that reads this book will not be able to put it down. A must read for all with strong stomachs."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"After seeing the movie, I always meant to read the book. I wish I read it a long time ago. Although, the book reads a little slow at times, it provides such a detailed account of what the survivors endured. The book does not read like a fiction where most of the events lead up to the conclusion. The author detailed the families seach for the boys but this had little on the conclusion except that the families kept looking for them, albiet in the wrong place. Towards the end of the book, I found myself skimming paragraphs which didn't involve the survivors. Sorry, but some of it seemed just like filler.However, this book is still worth a 5 star since the author did detail the survivors account and this book will make you think what you would do given the same circumstances.Having finished this book, I still find myself thinking about it. Read this book. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Havent read a better Real Life incident. It doesnt come better than this. The narration is powerful, yet sensitive. You almost feel as if you were there among the crash survivors all thru the story. If ever there was a &quot;CANT-PUT-DOWN&quot; book then this is it. I had read this book long time back(I cant even put years to it) but still it stays imprint in my memory. Those 16 survivors of the Uruguayan team. All heroes in their own right and two really determined young man who dragged on those mountains, despite despair, their will to survive.

But what is striking about this story is the amazing amount of mutual cooperation among the survivors, most of whom were in their late teens and early twenties. That they managed for the most part to retain their civilized natures in the wake of utter hopelessness and through working together devised a workable plan to effect their own rescue is nothing short of remarkable. Nearly three decades have passed since the crash, but the compelling nature of this story has not diminihed in the slightest."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This book is amazing. It is a true adventure story that is realistic and amazing. You find youself wraped up in this book completely. I could not put it down!

It just shows that NO one can be simply indifferent to the book - read it and go on living the same way as before. Everyone who reads it can't help but putting themselves in the same situation as the survivers and wondering what they'd have done, if they'd have eatten human flesh or not. Personally, I don't think I'll be able to eat any meat at lunch today, but it doesn't matter. This is the one book I will never forget."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"I had the wonderful opportunity to meet Nando Parrado, one of the survivors of the crash, and found him to be one of the kindest people I have ever met. After meeting him and hearing his story, I immediately went home and read &quot;Alive&quot;. The book was even more powerful after hearing a condensed version of the story directly from Nando. I encourage everyone to read this story of family, friends, courage and triumph. It will help you realize the truly important things in this life."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"I met Nando Parrado during a conference last Friday and I spend a couple of hours talking to him yesterday as he came to present his story of survival to the executive team of the company I work for. Nando was one of the two boys who, after enduring 72 of the most horrible days imaginable, crossed the Andes Mountains on foot and with nothing more than their will to survive and their desire to reunite with their families once more.I have to say that meeting Nando and listening to his personal perspective of the events was one of those life altering experiences I will never forget. Even more, spending an hour privately talking to him is a truly remarkable experience. yes, I'm a little starstrucked, I have to admit, but I kept wondering how many world personalities would have caused that effect on me.I feel lucky to say my soon to be wife and I met him and got a chance to listen to his story. A story of Leadership, Teamwork, Courage, Creativity, Endurance, Fear, Adversity and Love.I strongly recommend this book as a fair account of those events in 1972, and as a document of the human experience for generations to come.Regards,Ervin RodriguezSan Juan, Puerto Rico"},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"I read this book in high school in 1976 (causing a long waiting list at the library because I read so slowly.)This book is perfect: avoiding melodrama and sensationalism but with the pacing of a great documentary.All of the characters are so distinct and so fully-realized you will get caught up in their individual quirks and behaviors...so much so you will be right there with them when they make a very difficult decision to survive. The subject matter may not be easy to take, but the book is so well written you will agree you would have done the same thing.A one-of-a-kind book that I hope stays in print forever...this is how all non-fiction should be done."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"My book group were given this book last month to read and then discuss.

I'm buying copies as presents for relatives -- and I'll rent the video (which will probably be disappointing). Highly recommended !!!"},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"The emotions you feel while reading this book travel like a roller coaster. You try to imagine what it must have been like and yet can never come anywhere near the true horror of it all. To think that 16 people survived it does seem like a miracle.

It starts with a group of optimistic and eager Uruguayan rugby players that leave for Chile on a charter plane for an important competition there. On their way, they crash in the middle of the Andes. They not only face the lack of food due to no plants or animal life on the mountain, but also sub-zero temperatures and two avalanches. This is a story of how the desire of surviving comes true. This book also made us think about death from a wider perspective, and of how hard it is to lose a friend and have to eat his dead flesh in order to survive. We recommend this true and amazing story of man against the drastic condition of nature, in this case the extremely cold temperatures of the Andes"},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Truly the single most inspirational book I have ever read, and definitely the best piece of nonfiction. It's written so well, though, that it successfully lacks the boredom that bogs some nonfiction down. Nando Parrado is a true hero that is given much justice in Read's telling of his story. Read is fair and descriptive about the cannibalism, but in this incredible study of human nature and the reactions of different strong and weak people when the chips are down, ultimately turns the videocamera on ourselves and makes us wonder - unsettlingly so- how we would react. It flows with good dialogue and factual simplicity, with an ending that deserves three cheers. I don't know that any other nonfiction writer could have tackled this controversial story with the soul that Read did. I will never forget."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This book kept me riveted to it for the three days it took to read it.

This well-written book far exceeds the few attempts the movie industry has made at this true story of human drama, endurance and survival of the Self.The book runs the gamut of human emotions and responses to catastrophic disasters, and effectively portrays the resulting human frailities, strengths, and conquests in a most inspirational and exciting manner."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"I have been reading and rereading this story for 6 years and each time I am amazed anew. This story gives me hope. Hope for humanity, for the human spirit; it renews my faith in God. ALIVE is the story of teamwork and perseverance. Just as words cannot express or be contained in any book what these people went through, I cannot exclaim enough how this story has touched me and to what degree I recommend it. I feel that mostly likely, the survivors would not want to be idolized or even revered - but it is their accomplishment that we should recognize and learn from. None of us can fully understand what they endured and the challenges that they surmounted, but if we can realize what the important things in life are, then we have absorbed a great part of what this book is about."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This is the most shoking, tragic book ever. I will never forget it because it is life. It is what happens. A story so god awful could never be fiction. No writer could have poured the emotions through these pages as Read did.

There is so much more that you can descover about life after reading this book."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This book by Piers Paul Read is one of the best books I have ever read.

Tough decision to make, and one we wouldn't be faced with in our normal lives. Their emotional and physical struggle to live tests the extreme of human spirit and nature.

It was required reading in my South American Geography class, at the University of Northern Colorado, about 1975.This book tells the story of a sports team flying from Argentina to Chile, whose plane went down in a snowstorm. It is the story of the survivors, and how they turned to cannablism of the dead frozen bodies for several months. A couple of them managed eventually, after several months, to get out and get help for the remaining survivors. They were quite scarred psychologically, and ended up being absolved by the Pope. After going through that experience, they don't keep in touch with one another.One of the most gripping survival experiences I have ever read, and I highly recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"I read this book last summer but still find myself recalling it in conversations.

It is a survival story that deals with friendship, endurance, and faith. The men in the book were put to the test of, hunger, fear, and cold. When the Uruguayan plane carrying the soccer team crashed in the Andes mountains in 1972, the first reaction of those who survived the crash was hope of being rescued. The men in this book lived not knowing how or when they would die. They had no food, and everyone was restless throughout the book. The thought of being rescued slowly slipped away. On the tenth day on the mountain the boys resorted to the only available food, and that was their teammates. This really disgusted me, because the style of Piers Paul Read's writing was so graphic it sent chills up my spine. I thought I was going to throw up. Some of the people ate a lot of the dead bodies and others just eat enough to stay alive. I think that the author's intent of all this gore was to show, accurately and honestly, what the men were forced to do in the situation conflict that it caused with their religion. It said they were not guilt of any cannibalism in their church, but they still had to live with themselves. The author did a great job making you feel as though you were right their on the mountain. I sometimes skipped over the eating parts just because I couldn't take it anymore. I think this book it great for people that like survival adventure stories. I think it also deals with some religious aspects too.

Though the story was very compelling, I felt lost and bored while I was reading through the middle section. I think that a good editor could have helped that situation. One certainly got a sense of the tedium of the young men's lives as they languished on the mountain but the sameness of the details soon became quite tedious to me.In addition, I think a good editor would have made sure that a book of this nature would have included a chart or list of all the victims and survivors. With so many names to keep track of I became very confused who was who, who had died or survived, and when the deaths occurred. As I read the book I searched the book more than once looking for such a help.Admittedly I read a First Edition of the book so, perhaps, later printings included such a chart. If not, it needs one."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"A rugby team and their family and friends.. travelling together for a big match.. flying over the Andes mountains. Seems pretty regular I suppose, except that the plane crashes, and it can't be pinpointed. There is instant death and feelings of hopelessness, but there is also the spirit of life, and the desire to survive. I have read this book several times and each time I get the same emotions. It is a great book, but be warned, it is not for the weak of stomach! Still, Piers Paul Read does a wonderful job of telling the story of the Andes survivors. If you have not read it I highly recommend it. Yes, it's a little gross, but by the time you get to that part you are well immersed in the story."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Alive was a novel based on the true story of the Andes Survivors. There were thirty-two people who survived the plane crash and spent seventy gruesome days in the Andes. Their only source of food was wine and a small amount of candy. The only shelter that the thirty-two survivors had was the fuselage from the plane, which obviously didn't live up to the standards of the cold, harsh weather they had to endure. Being lost and cold, the number of survivors dropped slowly but drastically. They started off with thirty-two survivors and by the end of the book there was only sixteen survivors. As the number of survivors decreased slowly, the bond between the remaining was truly evident. For the matter of survival, the people who were struggling to survive had to resort to cannibalism and eat the \\"meat\\" of the people who died. In the book the reader can also see the never-ending struggle to find the men by their families and friends. The reader gets a sense of what it is like to try and survive in the Andes, but they also see what it is like for the families. Even though what these men went through may sicken you, it was the courage of these men that shone through. This book is absolutely a must-read for anyone."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"I love this book, as you can see, I'm from Uruguay, and this story is part of our hearts.

Going through the first chapter was well worth it, because the rest of the book brought me into the amazing adventures the survivors went through. It kept me on the edge of my seat, wanting to know what would happen next.I would recommend this book for a more older audience: teenage on. The reason being, the book goes into fine detail. It brings you into some of the gruesome and overwhelming events that the survivors went through, before and after the rescue.If reading a true, exciting story about a group of people giving their all to survive and having your emotional flow never stop, Alive is the book for you.The book made me realize that anything is possible if you never give up!"},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This book moved me.

He loved it better than the movie. Lisa LL,NM"},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This was a truly amazing book that really made me cherish life. Being a survivor of a fatal car crash that put me into a coma for 4 days, I watched this movie over and over because of the effect that it had on me. However, I felt that there had to be more information than what was shown in the movie, so I decided to get the book. I found out that I was right.The movie only showed you what the people in the crash were going through and nothing about their families and people back at home. People at home were doing so much and spending money and trying so hard to find their children and loved ones that everyone believed was dead.Something else that I found interesting is that in order to survive, the people had to act as cannibals and eat the meat of the dead humans in order to survive. Although many other people felt that this was unjustified, including some of the people that were there at first, it was necessary in order to survive.If they did not do that, they would have died very quickly. In my eyes, once a human dies, their body is just meat and their soul does go up to heaven. I truly do support everyone who did this and think they are great human beings for what they did.In addition, I remember reading that one of the people actually met one of the survivers, and I have to say, considering the fact that I myself was in a situation sort of like this, a coma, I would truly love to meet one of them and compare our situations. I have a bit of an idea of what they went through. At the same time, I wouls also congratulate them and share my story, for this would really make me very happy."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Great book, the author does a wonderful job. This book moves along and is never dull. Many times with type of book the big event that start out the book is about the best part of it and the rest of the book kinda dies after it, but not this one. The story keep going and you want to keep reading. I would put this up there with Into Thin Air and above The Perfect Storm. It is much better then the movie."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Alive starts out slow for the first two chapters. It then speeds up to be an excellent story of survival. This book is a great story of suspense, and the human will to live. It shows how much we take for granted.WARNING: this book is definetly not for people with weak stomachs."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This book was very exciting and entertaining. It kept me on the edge on my seat throughout the whole book. I could never put the book down. I had to read this book for Lit circles in my World Lit class and I'm glad I choose the book I did. It's weird to think something like this did happen and people got through it all, thats one of the things that kept me reading. The only thing I didnt like about this book was the characters were hard to get to know. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense. This book is interesting,thrilling and very exciting!!"},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"I absoultly loved this book I would recomend it to all of my friends. I liked it because I am the type of person who enjoys a little exitement and action in their books, and thats what this is all about. I really think that you should give this one a try.I believe that the best part of the book is when the plain was going down, (crashing) and how much detail they explained it in. The worst part for me was when they did the canibleism because I for one have a weak stomach and don't take things like that very well.The best two story elements I thought were, number one the climax like i said before when the plane was going down it was just explained so well I could see it right before my eyes. Number two would have to be the setting, it was in so much detail it was like I was right there witht them expierencing what they were, seeing what they saw. Thats why I liked this book I really recomend it for you."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This book was truly the best novel I have ever read.I couldn't put it down.This book was written in such a way that it pulled you into the story.

It is a book that you will have fun reading and not be able to go to sleep until you find a good spot to stop at. Pick it up, read it twice, and give it to someone that you think would enjoy it. It will make you believe in the unbelieveable, and actually feel better as a person."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This is the original action-adventure survival tale, and far better than the self-gratifying Into Thin Air or the generic Perfect Storm. For one, the soccer players stranded in the Andes really didn't do anything to put themselves in that situation other than getting on the airplane. They didn't pay untold thousands to climb a mountain they had no business being on or pilot their fishing boat into a hurricane out of sheer stupidity. In that, it's much easier to feel for the victims and marvel at their ordeal. You will constantly find yourself thinking about the gravity of their situation and at what point you yourself would begin devouring human flesh. It's a story that could be great as a work of fiction, but being that it really happened, it's transformed into something amazing and grotesque at the same time."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"At the beginning of his book author Piers Paul Read informs his readers that he decided not to fictionalize any events, instead he chose to let the narrative of the interviews flow freely and speak for themselves. It was the wisest choice he could have made. Although stomach churningly graphic a moments there are many others that let you feel the spiritual nature of the ordeal these young men faced for seventy-two days in the Andes. In its documentary fashion the book perfectly communicates the &quot;Christmas Miracle&quot; that is the story of the Andes Survivors. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Ever scince a friend recomended the book to me and I started to read the story, I was immediatley glued to the pages. This story about the plane that went down in the Andes Mountians is truly an invigorating narritve. I felt true sense of brotherhood among the group. As the number of survivors slowly decreased, the bond between those remaining grew stonger. You really have no idea what it was like to survive over seventy days in the Andes until you have read this story of those brave men whose will to survive was stonger than the pesimistic attitude that clenched them in the beginning. It may seem somewhat disturbing what these boys had to resort to, you can't deny the courage that would forever change them."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"...if you are at all sensitive. If you are, this book will leave you staring at the dark, afraid to sleep, for days after you've read it. I'd have preferred to type my thoughts on this book without rating it, because I don't feel able to rate Read's book fairly. Suffice it to say that his brand of totally unfiltered, graphic journalism is writing that I am unable to appreciate. Some see in this grisly true story an affirmation of the value of their own lives; good for them. I see in it a disturbing proof of just how little distance there is between our highly evolved civilization and the animal. Many animal species, many, many more than just the familiar praying mantis, are cannibalistic. Human society was able to evolve only after the taboos against incest and cannibalism developed: after father and son stopped battling each other for the right to bed mother and sister, and after men no longer looked on each other as sources of food in lean times. I'd like to believe that our species has evolved farther than this story shows it has. As I recall, the survivors had been on the mountain only nine days when they decided to and began to eat the dead. I have fasted on water alone for more than nine days. True, food was available to me, so my situation is not truly analogous to that of the survivors, but my point is that I was not so hungry that I was on the verge of madness. I would be more sympathetic toward the survivors had they waited to begin to dine on their companions when they were mad with hunger, not detached and rational. And the callousness of the survivors once they had begun to eat the dead lingers with me, many years after I skip-read this book (I simply could not read whole passages of it). Yes, it was callousness for the two who went down the mountain to \\"gorge\\" on (and for the writer to report their \\"gorging\\" on) the remaining human flesh in their pack once they were again within sight and sound of civilization. I don't hold that the survivors are guilty of any crime. But I would not wish to meet or know any one of them. Some people who are empathetic and as wholly evolved as any among us can read a story like this and be uplifted by it. I cannot. Nor could I perform an autopsy, though I am grateful that there are those who can. If you are the sensitive sort, leave \\"Alive\\" unread. You'll sleep better for it."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This book was very dull at the beginning, it slowly picked up the pace and it became better. By the time the cut into human flesh it was getting interesting, and then came the waiting, the people on the mountain, searching for rescue and dieing. It was getting boring again until they went to search for the tail at which it became more interesting. I'd say this book was not the most interesting I've read, but not the least. I'll leave it off saying it was... Interesting."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Alive is a very boring book. The plot is way to long, and it takes to long to read. The book really doesn't make sense either.How the survivors live in the Andes is kind of weird, I think. Something that was good about the book is that the author made you feel like you were actually in the mountains with the survivors. Something else that I like about this book is that theywere saved in a really cool way. Another thing that I don't like about this book is that there is a lot of days that this book takes place.So,if you were to buy this book I would sort of recommend this book.

Honest to god, this has to be more boring than a four hundred page technical manual on how to brush your teeth.I had to read this piece of crap at school. I mean, the book is absoutely splattered with reviews saying how gripping it is. I myself, I just... wasn't hooked.

A real doozie, that one. Sure to grasp the attention of even the most ADHD affected kid out there. No bloody way anybody could put this one down.I guess there was just something I was missing here. Maybe it would be my lack of belief in a deity, or the fact that I'm pro-cannibalism in the proper circumstances.

Let me state that I am the only one in my family who doesn't believe in &quot;God&quot;. I was not surprised by the fact that the ones who put all their energy and concentration in &quot;God&quot; were the first to die. For example; Eugina and Susana Parrado. Those who believed in teamwork and self survival were the ones to survive. I felt that it is hard enough if one should have to live through a tragedy, one does not need to pick up a book to get his or her share tragedy in life. Since I've read this book, I have not been able to put a piece of meat towards my mouth without putting it down and remembering how people ate their friends and family to survive. Then, I think, will I die if I don't eat this poor animal that was killed and only means of life was to feed men and women who don't understand that the poor animal's life was cut short and killed by us?

If you wanna save time, just watch the movie"},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"The main problems I have with this book are the lack of suspense and the poor documentary-like writing style.The book isn't suspenseful becuase you know from the beginning that there will be survivors, the digestive and cannabalistic hardships are predictable, and you cannot attach yourself to the characters and worry about whether they will be survivors. The only genuinely suspenseful part of the book lasts about 7 pages. The characters are consistently one-note in nature, and the interaction between them becomes predictable quickly. A probable reason for this is that the author didn't have enough room to develop the main characters since there are so many of them.I am aware that the book is nonfiction, and my secondary complaint is most likely a symptom of that, although I've read well-written nonfiction before.I'm quite tired right now, and I've probably made several spelling and grammar errors which I'm not the mood to check for."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Alive is an awesome book!

The boys were faced with almost certain death, yet their faith in each other and in God enabled them to withstand what for most of us would be beyond our ability to endure.

Thankfully, it did."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"I won't write a term paper here. You're wondering whether this book is worth reading or not. It is worth a read. This book is especially for anyone who ever lost a close friend or a member of their family and is wondering if they are even still alive. I wouldn't want to even venture a vague estimate as to the odds against anyone in this party surviving after a crash landing in the frigid Andes. Most assumed all were dead from the crash itself. Yet a party of individuals survived and clung to life with every fiber of their beings. In fact, they valued life so much that they were willing to consume members of their party who died along the way. I read this account years ago, and, even to the present day, I have still not heard of another account in which humans eat humans to survive. So you can imagine the shock this book produced in me. Yet I don't blame the survivors in the least, as some have. And I am confident that if the dead knew what the living had to do to survive, they would have been thankful that their flesh did not rot in the Andes but it actually saved lives. What a story! You will find it hard to stop reading until the end."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Alive is a book that speaks about human beings, trapped in the worst condition anyone can be caught in; freezing conditions, without adequate protection nor food, dead friends all around, 16 persons remaining alive from the 45 passengers, and no sign of a rescue nor an end to this ordeal. The only way out is to help each other and find a way to survive. The ordeal doesn't last a day or 2 but 10 weeks.I have read Alive when it first came out in the 70's, when I was young and life was fast around me. I am reading this book all over again 30 years later, and I think this book should be thought in every university as it teaches how we could or should think in desperate situation, what could be done or what are the options instead.Bad satiations always happen in life however how many times do we get the chance to find out or read about it the way we do in this book.This is one of the best books I have read, and I recommend it for anyone who wants to learn from a deep and human story"},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Time has not diminished the drama of the tale of the Uruguayan rugby team whose plane crashed in the Andes Mountains. Of the forty five people on the plane at the time of the crash, sixteen came down from the mountain about seventy-two days later with a saga of survival not easily forgotten.Theirs is a journey born of tragedy and human endurance. The author unfolds a tale that is gripping in the telling, as enthralling as it is almost unbelievable. It is investigative reporting at its best, because it does not fail to convey the human drama and pathos behind the story of this remarkable struggle for survival high up in the Andes Mountains. Masterfully written, it is a well balanced narrative that takes great pains to ground the experience of the survivors in the context out of which it arose.The plane had crashed in the Andes Mountains on Argentinian territory. It was an exercise in terror for those on the plane, as it barreled down the mountain, before finally coming to rest in a valley of snow high up in the Andes. Of the forty five persons on board, thirty two had initially survived the crash. Some, however, had sustained serious injuries. Time would not be their friend. Moreover, with little warm clothing (keep in mind that October is springtime in South America), the survivors were exposed to the extreme cold of the night air, high up in the Andes. Though spring, this still meant temperatures well below freezing. Damp, cold, and hungry, amid the anguished cries of the injured, thus began the first of many such nights.By their tenth day in the Andes, the limited food supplies, which they had rationed with all the care of a miser, had virtually run out. Starving and ravenously hungry, they voiced what they all knew to be true, but had not dared to voice before. They must eat, or they would die. The only thing left for them to eat, however, was abhorrent and deeply repugnant to them. Digging deep into their conservative, religious souls, they found a way to justify actions that would have them transcend a new reality. Their fallen comrades would now provide the means of their sustenance. All eventually succumbed to this only means of survival.This, while one of the most dramatic parts of their story, is just that, a part. Their survival entailed much more. They had to endure other deprivations. They had to survive the elements. They had to overcome a profound despair over being seemingly forgotten by the outside world. Ultimately, only sixteen were able to do so. How they did so will fascinate all readers of adventure literature. The means that they took to let the world know that they were still alive will astound even the most jaded of readers. It is an account of human endurance that is thought provoking and compelling, a quest to reconcile physical needs with the spiritual. It is, above all, a riveting testament to life."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This was one of the best books I've read recently. Occassionally, the author throws in a few macabre details which may not be pleasant for some readers; however, it's an incredible story and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"\\"What would I have done, in their place?\\" That's the question any reader of this terrifying true story must ask, and the answer may not come easily.In October 1972, a chartered plane crashed high in the Andes. The members of a post-graduate prep school rugby team from Uruguay, the \\"Old Christians\\" as they were nicknamed, were aboard it with family members and friends, on their way to a match in Chile. Ten weeks after the crash, two survivors made their way far enough toward civilization so that an astounded Chilean peasant spotted them and summoned help. Soon the rest of the survivors, 16 souls in all, were located and airlifted to safety.How did those 16 people stay alive through those weeks when South America's winter gradually turned into spring, in a place of nothing but cold and snow? Through avalanches and howling storms, with no emergency supplies or equipment, and no survival training? These ordinary folk thrust into a most extraordinary situation made choices no human should ever have to make, and nevertheless managed to keep their humanity intact. Meanwhile, their families - told by the authorities that it was long since time to give up hope - refused that advice, and kept the search going.This is a gruesome book in places, because the author tells the truth just as he learned it from the survivors themselves. It's also one of the most uplifting reads you'll ever encounter."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Cold, starving, and trapped in the Andes, the survivors of a charted plane crash struggle to survive. Despairing, their families search for them. Read interweaves the stories of the survivors and their loved ones as they face insurmountable odds. A moving testimony to the power of faith -- in God and in the human spirit. The moment when Canessa's father learns that his son, whom he had given up for dead, is alive and waiting for him, is one of the greatest moments ever captured in words. Their Christmas reunion makes this a good Christmas tale."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"&quot;Alive&quot; is a fascinating tale of survival that has acquired a notoriety because of something that happened during that period of survival. That notoriety is a shame because it detracts from the greater story of how so many individuals could have made through what had happened to them. For those totally uninitiated to the story, a plane load of Uruguayan rugby players (and family members) goes down in the mountains of the Andes en route to their game in Chile. All efforts to locate the downed plane were unsuccessful and the search eventually is called off. However, many of the passengers have survived and are essentially, in good health. They gather together their resources which were limited because the flight was relatively short and thus the on-board supplies were short as well. Things happen as the survivors await the rescue that doesn't come and the most infamous thing that happens is that many of the survivors take to eating flesh of their departed. Ultimately, in what is the most spectacular event of the book, a couple of men decide to reach civiliztion on their own (scenes from &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; come to mind) and they actually succeed. This leads to the resue of the others as the whole world discovers their amazing survival. They also discover one of the not-so-secret means of their survival; their canabalism. A variety of sleazy accounts in print and film sought to depict that shocking aspect of an otherwise amazing survival story. Fortunately &quot;Alive&quot; (both the book and, later, the film) rise above that to bring the real story. This account is one you won't be able to put down until you've turned the last page."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"The book Alive is a true story about a rugby team surviving in the Andes Mountains after their plane crashed.

This isn't a TV Survivor game where people compete in contests, eat rice and vote each other off until someone wins the jackpot. In \\"Alive\\" a group of students, their friends and family are trapped in some of the most inhospitable terrain and weather conditions in the world. Only a few scraps of food, nothing but snow surrounding them, many of them grievously injured and not one piece of survival equipment. And no one is \\"voted off\\". If you don't survive, you die there. One survivor sees his wife die in an avalanche, another loses his mother and sister, others lose cousins. The oldest survivor is only 33, the youngest is 19.Of 45 who left on the trip, only 16 survived and a few of them were close to dying when they were rescued. It is simply a fantasic story of ingenuity, faith, brotherhood, and courage. The struggle of Canessa and Parrado to climb the mountain with no mountaineering gear in a desperate bid to try and save the others is just amazing.There was an excellent companion documentary made in conjunction with the movie version of \\"Alive\\" and it is full of interviews with the survivors. I later read that several of the survivors made an emotional trip back to the crash site and to the mass grave of those who died. What a moment that must have been.\\"Alive\\" is an inspirational book and the story of the sixteen will remain with you forever."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Alive is an excellent book worth reading for anyone.

The rest of the story tells you about the adventure of a Rugby team trying to survive from their crash in the Andes Mountains.

I will say it might be tough to eat red meat for a while after reading this."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"Alive details the true story of 45 people who crashed in the Andes Mountains in 1972, and the struggle of the survivors to make it home to safety, even as search and rescue efforts failed and were called off.This is an amazing story of the will to survive, and the incredible lengths to which people will go, reminiscent of more recent books such as Aron Ralston's autobiographical \\"Between a Rock and a Hard Place.\\" Like that story, it details an extremely difficult personal choice that is necessary to survive--in this case cannibalism. Unlike that book, however, it is also primarily a story of mutual compassion, aid, and cooperation in an increasingly hopeless situation, rather than one individual's personal struggle.The transformation of the group from unprepared pleasure fliers (many of whom only had tee-shirts to wear in the cold mountain snow) into determined survivors who learn to rely on each other is an inspiring read. In the face of increasing hardships, including an avalanche and hearing on a radio that the search for them has been called off, the group learns that reliance on each other is the only thing that will save them. The moral discussion of their choice to resort to cannibalism is also described at length, as they make this and other decisions as a group despite frequent interpersonal tensions. If nothing else, the book is worth reading for the survivors' various religious, logical, and philosophical perspectives on cannibalism and survival in general--as well as their own ever-present mortality.The only slow sections of this book are the excessive breaks from the main narration of the survivors to describe events in the outside world (mostly, continued fruitless searches). But the tale otherwise provides plenty of narrative suspense in addition to the interesting study of cooperation, morality, and determination, making this a difficult book to put down."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This true story will touch you on so many levels. It is heartbreaking, sad and beautiful, yet at the same time inspiring. What these young men went through to survive will astound you. I couldn't put it down. There is the stark truth involved of how they survived, but if you look past that reality, you'll find real heroism in the face of certain death. Everything from creating a device to melt snow for drinking water to keeping each other's hopes alive. Read goes into the men's thoughts and reasoning, and gives you insight on how and why they reacted the way they did. There is a lot of detail in the book that the movie left out. If you like true life adventures, you must check this out!"},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"this is an amazing story that had me attached to this book and reading nonstop.The only downfall is that there are a lot of misspelled words.I like the book, good state, and fast delivery."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"This book is a great tale of the human spirit overcoming all. Despite numerous hardships there are survivors of a plane crash in the Andes mountains. The methods of survival are told in great detail (not for the faint of heart).

No one can help but be moved by the tragic plight of the survivors of the crash of the Fairchild, with its 45 passengers aboard. Although their ultimate solution for surviving is well known- consuming the remains of the dead- what moves more is their resolve to live, their courage, and their problem-solving. One wonders how they are doing today, after living through such a harrowing experience. Ultimately, what we have in &quot;Alive&quot; is a picture of people going instantly from a 20th century, technological community (i.e. being in an airplane) to a stone-age, tribalistic one. Amazing story."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"I just reread this book and was awed.

It took extraordinary individuals to survive this incident and even greater ones to recall all that had happened to them. There is nothing that is left out of this book.

Being a survivor of a fatal car crash that put me into a coma for 4 days, I watched this movie over and over because of the effect that it had on me. However, I felt that there had to be more information than what was shown in the movie, so I decided to get the book. I found out that I was right.The movie only showed you what the people in the crash were going through and nothing about their families and people back at home. People at home were doing so much and spending money and trying so hard to find their children and loved ones that everyone believed was dead.Something else that I found interesting is that in order to survive, the people had to act as cannibals and eat the meat of the dead humans in order to survive. Although many other people felt that this was unjustified, including some of the people that were there at first, it was necessary in order to survive.If they did not do that, they would have died very quickly. In my eyes, once a human dies, their body is just meat and their soul does go up to heaven. I truly do support everyone who did this and think they are great human beings for what they did.In addition, I remember reading that one of the people actually met one of the survivers, and I have to say, considering the fact that I myself was in a situation sort of like this, a coma, I would truly love to meet one of them and compare our situations. I have a bit of an idea of what they went through. At the same time, I wouls also congratulate them and share my story, for this would really make me very happy."},{"Title":"Alive the Story of the Andes Survivors","review":"By now, the story of \\"Alive\\" is well known. A plane carrying a group of Uruguayan rugby players crashed in the high Andes, leaving the survivors stranded for over two grueling months. They resort to cannibalizing those who were killed in the crash in order to survive. Eventually, several of the young men embarked on a desperate effort to reach civilization, succeeding just in time for the remaining survivors to be successfully rescued.It's a horrific tale, and one that is very well told by author Piers Paul Read. To his credit, Read avoids ...sensationalism. He lets the words and actions of the survivors speak for themselves. What ultimately emerges is a testament both to the survival instincts of the players and to their very humanity despite what they were forced to do.

This book has absolutely no plot or even a story line, it is simply the ramblings of a sexually disfunctional person."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"Tropic of Capricorn is the gretest book I have ever read. I read Tropic of Cancer first, and was interested and intrigued by it, but not until I read Capricorn would I truly call Miller one of the greatest American writers. Also banned from the U.S for 30 years, Capricorn goes beyong the sexuality and bitterness of one who has &quot;given up&quot; and lived for themselves as Cancer outlines autobiographically of Millers days in Paris. In Capricorn Miller looks to the roots of his childhood and life in New York and examines what made him the man he is and brought on his great change to &quot;a new way of life&quot;. It has elements similar to Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg Ohio, which may be its greatest moments, as it tells small &quot;grotesque&quot; character studies of the people that shaped his life. Miller combines ideas of Eastern mysticism with the chaos of an ever industrializing world. Capricorn goes beyond linear writing to pursue a dreamlike atmosphere: one of admitted Surrealist and Dadsist influence, whose influence in turn can be seen in the later beat writing of Kerouac and Burroughs among others."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"I first read this book when I was 16. Today, I'm 30 but I still manage to read it every two or three years to remind myself to be true to my feelings. Miller's writings, in general, are autobiographical. Some of the events have actually occurred while some are his dreams/visions. However, all are real to the man and real to most anyone who truly knows themself. There's no candy-coating here. Some reviewers see only the sexuality of the book. While that's certainly a great portion of the book it isn't what the book is about. It's about being who we want to be and freeing ourselves from the reigns of &quot;normality&quot; and confinement. That's why it's so disturbing. He expresses himself through his character and the characters around him. He mocks society and himself simultaneously. He is truly &quot;human&quot;. My one desire, if I should ever be able to fulfill it, would be to write a novel that's worth ten percent of what this one is. Miller is the best friend one could possibly want to have because he doesn't cover-up his intentions."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"\\"For there is only one great adventure and that is inward, toward the self, and for that, time nor space nor deeds even matter\\" (4).Miller's two tropics - CANCER AND CAPRICORN- are essentially manuals for the creative life. They present Miller's transformation from lay-schmuck working in the belly of the beast that is the American economy - jobs such as his position with the Western Union Telegraph company, which he refers to as the \\"Cosmococcic / Cosmodemonic Telegraph Company\\" - to his evolution as en expatriate writer living in Paris. The books are really designed to be read together to magnify the metamorphosis, the rite of passage. While CANCER chronicles the latter portion of Miller's experience abroad, the prequel, CAPRICORN, written five years later in 1939, is the more developed and more seminal of the two and elucidates with much greater detail the affects of his epiphany.Most artists will immediately recognize the struggle Miller endures. Married to the \\"wrong\\" woman and with a young child in tow - a relationship which he finds stifling to his creative development - Miller faces tenable employment situations to support this life. Those jobs he does find do little to allow him to prosper; rather he finds himself as a cog on a wheel of Hell. His transformation from the morass of what society deems sound and true is painful. Anyone who has ever made such sacrifices to pursue the unspoken dreams to create from what grows inside of them will sympathize with Miller's dilemma. To pursue a life of an artist is frightening enough: to do it behind the rancorous veil of the American dream is horrifying. Miller recognizes the banal existence of modern America with its machines, its backward corporate policies, its worship of the unthinking and mechanical and he also knows he must break from its fetters.Part of Miller's disenchantment with America is organic to his being just as much as it is experiential. As a child, Miller feels a unique disassociation with his peers and even his family. This self-possessed knowledge of his unique intelligence leaves Miller with a feeling of disorientation. As an adolescent, he sees his drunken father convert to piety when wooed by the charisma of a local minister. Miller, Sr. then falls from grace when the minister is called to another location and as a result of this perceived abandonment, cycles back to his earlier state of crapulousness. The event seems to have intimated to Miller the importance of being self-reliant upon a constant wellspring of inspiration so that disappointment in other people does not interrupt the flow of creativity.Miller describes the evolution of the artist as riding \\"on the ovarian trolley.\\" In fact, those very words are what preface CAPRICORN. For Miller there are really two births the artist experiences before his final descent into a world riddled with isolation, hunger and anticipation. Of course, there is the physical birth but this is more a symbolic representation than Miller's actual recognition of his square-peg, round-hole emotional relationship with the world at large: this is the first stage of birth. The second stage comes years later out of the \\"Land of F@ck\\" as Miller coins it, the place where the \\"spermatozoon reigns supreme\\" (198). These phrases, as they would first seem (and were seen for many years that the book was banned from U.S. publication), are not some sordid and gratuitous account of Miller's perceptions of the world or his conquests. Rather, he uses the extended metaphors and kennings to give the reader an understanding to the visceral almost primordial conditions from whence the artist arises. For Miller, spiritual ascension is a process biologic as well as intellectual.\\"Once this fact is grasped there can be no more despair. At the very bottom of the ladder, chez the spermatozoa, there is the same condition of bliss at the top, chez God. God is the summation of all the spermatozoa come to full consciousness. Between the bottom and the top there is no stop, no halfway station\\" (199).There is an almost funereal quality about Miller's cognizance here: this idea of exploring one's complete \\"ANNIHILATON\\" before metaphysical resurrection. Miller understands the need for an eradication of the former self before the rebirth of the artist as he moves from the \\"terra firma\\" to the \\"terra vague.\\" Along with this laying waste of the individual comes the erasure of connections to the self: friends, family, lovers - all abandoned to pursue the freedom to express unhindered utterance*. To this point, Miller's use of \\"Tropic of\\" in the titles of CANCER and CAPRICORN now begins to make more sense as he asserts himself to be on the boundary between this land of the physical and the spiritual; the place where men aspire to be God for a period of time just before the flash-point of creative impulse.He brings the idea of the \\"ovarian trolley\\" full circle when he talks about the importance of discovering Dostoevsky - this being the first glimpse of a man's soul - and then later in a book called CREATIVE EVOLUTION by Henri Bergson. He carries the latter book with him everywhere and extols its virtue upon any man or woman who would hear the new standard version on the gospel of solitude.TROPIC OF CAPRICORN should be standard reading for anyone in the arts, for any artist who has ever felt the pang of isolation, who truly believes in the necessity of sacrifice, a higher calling and commitment to one's creative endeavors. Miller's importance to world literature is vastly underrated and in many cases. Writers are simply too intimidated to face the truth in what he espouses. Miller operates as an Overman and as such, it is right that he should pose a certain condition of tremulousness in his readership: he has forged his own society, he has forged his own being into something closer to what history had intended for him since his first phone call into the horn of the fallopian. This is discomfiting for most and is intended to show how the application of introspection for an artist can lead to becoming an acolyte of unconventional philosophy: how a writer emerges as \\"e pluribus unum.\\" Henry Miller's doctrine is reserved for the initiate, the mad few who choose separation from the masses as a means for creative growth. Miller's epitaph should simply be, \\"My name? Why just call me God - God the embryo.\\"2005-06 Edward J.

If so then you know what to expect from Henry Miller. Tropic of Capricorn is an account of his life up to his trek to Paris in the 1930's. Mr. Miller allows us into his world of words and images that consume his mind and soul.In this semi-autobiographical novel, Miller gives us a glimpse into the breakdowns and revelations that brought him from the streets of Brooklyn and onto the pages of literature. From his first word, we follow him on the road to discovering his world and bringing to life the writer within. Through his free-flowing prose and vivid scenery we follow Henry from his many sexual exploits to the dark sided humor of life as only seen through his maddened eyes. This book is one of the few that truly changed my views of life and my purpose.If you have any taste like my own and the life of Henry Miller intrigues you to no end then definitely pick up Tropic of Capricorn. Like a morsel of bread to a starving man, Capricorn only left me hungrier for more Miller to chew on. Other books I adore are, of course, Quiet Days in Clichy, Tropic of Cancer by Miller, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"Capricorn is an absolutely unique and shattering novel. Miller's ability to write with great cynicism and bitterness about modern life and then instantly plunge to the deepest depths of the philosophy of being is astonishing. At times speaking in a kind of psychobabble, a line or two of this prose/poetry is sometimes enough for one sitting. A bitter novel about the death of the spirit amidst the inevitable continuation of life, Tropic of Capricorn is Miller's masterpiece and one of the twentieth century's greatest works."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"\\"Once you have given up the ghost, everything follows with dead certainty, even in the midst of chaos.\\"Surely one of the greatest opening lines ever, and Miller doesn't let up from there. Its hard to know what to say about this book apart from that it will either disgust you or blow your mind. A few years ago, my reaction would have been the former -- but things happen. The fact is, different books matter to us at different periods in our lives, and it can be hard to explain why. I can honestly say, this book has a spiritual dimension that is powerful, and can speak to you during your low times.If the idea of a writer looking at the world using his own consciousness, with absolutely no objectivity, and with complete honesty, sounds good to you-- this is your book. You will find a kindred spirit in Henry Miller, and perhaps even a fatherly, wise (but always laughing) source of solace."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"Out of idle curiosity and a desire to reread (third time) Miller's Tropic novels, I checked the consumer reviews of Tropic of CANCER first. I am interested in new generations discovering the stuff that I read going back to the early 60s. I found the reviews surprisingly dense, repeating the old cliches and personal prejudices.Those of TROPIC OF CAPRICORN, on the other hand, are pointed and intelligent. Moreover, they recognize one of Miller's great traits--- humor. One reviewer pointed out the book's \\"hilarity\\", an apt characterization. Another emphasized Miller's description of the Cosmodemonic messenger service at which he worked. This is one of the most memorable sections of any book I have read: hilarious, biting satire, and (before Miller departs) a great New York book.I have always thought Miller was, among other things, a parodist, and thus those who take him too literally (from Norman Mailer to the guy who showered after reading CANCER)are missing one of our outstanding writers, or certainly mistaking the author for the narrator."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"Its amazing to me how many times I mention Henry Miller to people only to have them say: \\"oh right, the guy who was married to Marilyn Monroe. Lucky bastard!\\" Sheesh, that's really very sad. I couldn't think of two writers more fundamentally different than Henry and Arthur Miller. Henry Miller SHOULD have been the one married to Marilyn Monroe, that would have been a wonderful thing.That said, don't expect objectivity in this review. I am a massive, unabashed fan of Henry Miller, controversy be damned. I own nearly all his books and have read them all several times, particularly the key ones (Capricorn, Black Spring, Cancer, Sexus, Nexus, Plexus, Quiet Days in Clichy, the Air-conditioned Nightmare and Colossus of Maroussi.)Of them all, Capricorn is probably the grandest, the most 'hardcore' of all Henry Miller's work. And by hardcore, I dont mean the sexiest! (If the sex is all that interests you, read Sexus, I think that has more smut in it than all his other books put together.) Capricorn is hardcore HENRY MILLER. It's the rawest of his books, the most passionate and it contains for me, the quintessential joys of Miller: the humour, the anger, the joy of life, the scorn for the conventional world and the hatred of a nine to five existence. If these things appeal to you, then Capricorn is the book for you!When I innocently plucked it off the shelf of the public libary (because that is where I discovered Miller)I had NO IDEA what I was letting myself in for. The first page blew me away. I can truly say this is a book that changed my life. Of all the books I have read, this one, Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian, Norman Mailer's An American Dream and Stephen King's Christine were the ones that I lived most vividly. The words leap off the page and take possession of your mind and soul!It is a rollicking ride, a treat for the senses and one of the funniest books ever written. Yes, people associate H. Miller with smut, and to be sure he does that better than anyone, but he is also extremely funny, and you cannot fail to read one of his books and not find yourself chuckling along within a page or two. I find Capricorn and Black Spring to be Miller's most entertaining and laugh out loud books. There is pure joy of creation in every line.The other thing I love about Capricorn are the characters. It is packed with them. His time spent with the 'Cosmoccocic Telegraph Company' yields an absolute mine of memorable characters and one of Miller's best talents is rendering people, in all their warped glory, in exquisite detail. His powers of observation are unparalleled among writers. It is usually when he is in anecdotal form, recounting stories of his friends and acquaintances that Miller is at his best, and Capricorn is packed with these.It is also a book that is absolutely saturated with the essence of New York City. Much more so than Cancer is evocative of Paris, the sights, smells and sounds of New York are evident on every page of Capricorn. As much as he despised the city (although he loved his precious Ward 14 in Brooklyn), Miller was a product of it in every pore of his being. It is without a doubt one of the greatest works of literature to have emanated from that great city, and of course, there have been many.If you are new to Miller, I cannot recommend Capricorn as a starting point highly enough. It will leave you reeling and gasping, so electric are the words contained here. Miller was a unique writer, there will never be another like him. Not only that but he will never grow old or dated, unlike so many others. His words and sentiments are as fresh today as they were in the 1930s when he first penned them. A magnificent, brawling entertainment to treasure and re-live again and again..."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"i read this book after i had read tropic of cancer. i personally find miller much more enjoyable in his story telling mode which is the first part of the book. his perceptions of life are unique and at times hilarious. these are the parts of this book and of cancer that i enjoyed the most. it is when he enters the world of revelations that he loses me.this book also gives the reader much more insight to henry miller the writer. the closing portion of this book explains his following of the dada movement. this explains the irrationality and the sexuality of many parts of both books.with all that said, the first 100 pages of this book are remarkable and well worth reading. never will you meet a more interesting and funny group of characters or situations. the latter part of the book returns to this format and we meet miller's friend macgregor. now that is an experience!you can't even try to understand miller until you have read tropic of capricorn. it is worth the trip."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"Tropic Of Capricorn is certainly not for everyone. The first time I read it I was quite put off by it. But years later I was drawn to read it again and suddenly found it full of meaning.Most people speak of it as a book about sex, but really it's a book about spiritual awakening. It is not an easy read. It holds your face in the mud and asks you to see God. It's a book that makes you feel experiences, it wears you down, and then takes you into moments of satori."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"Henry Miller was capable of brilliant story-telling and, as this book shows, he could also be a tremendous bore.There are big parts of the book where the story-telling is first rate. He gives a very vivid picture of the vulgar and rather brutal working class milieu in which he spent the first 3 or 4 decades of his life. He makes his experiences and the people he associated with come alive, though one wonders to what extent the experiences are real and to what extent they are made up. One can well imagine a working class male in Brooklyn in the early 20th century having the experiences and thoughts that Miller portrays himself and his associates having. The first and largest episode in the book is Miller's life as manager of a telegraph company's message delivery service. Then there are other episodes in Miller's life that are detailed, going back to his childhood.It helps Miller in his story-telling that he is completely un-restrained in his use of language. He uses every four letter word imaginable and describes sexual escapades in extremely graphic language. He uses the four letter word that begins with \\"c\\" to describe the private area on the lower front part of a woman's body. He frequently refers to this private area throughout the book and his fondness for accessing it. The account of the period when Miller was the messenger service manager is laced with constant references to the sexual encounters that Miller and his buddies pursued (even though most of them were married at the time). Miller portrays himself in this book as a raging sex maniac. Let me give a summary of some of the sexual experiences detailed in the novel. For instance there is his piano teacher. He is in his mid-teen years and she is in her mid-20's. He is seized with an intense desire to access this teacher's private area and one day while they are seated at the piano, he makes some groping gestures in the direction of the private area. She thoroughly rebukes him but not long after, she encounters him outside sitting down in an isolated area. He lunges at her again but she successfully resists him, saying she doesn't want to do it there. They walk to another isolated area, I believe near a lake, and there she attacks him and apparently the subsequent copulation is quite intense. Then there is Rita. Rita is the sister of his friend Maxie and Henry intensely wishes to have a sexual encounter with Rita but Maxie does not approve of that. Henry runs into Rita one day and they go back to the vestibule of her family apartment and have mind-blowing sex on the floor. Henry is very proud that he was able to fornicate with Maxie's sister \\"right under\\" the nose of Maxie. Miller provides fairly vivid description of the placement of his hands and some other details that occurred during this vestibule fornication. Then there is a young gal who I believe Miller calls Agnes. We are introduced to Agnes in a story that seems to take place during Henry's mid-to-late teen years. One day, Henry, Agnes and another girl play naked tag by the river. Agnes and Henry also have other experiences together. For instance, they copulate in various public places, including public telephone booths. Another activity of Henry and Agnes takes place on street cars. On the street-car, Agnes, wearing nothing under her dress, lifts up the dress and sits on Henry's lap and.....you get the picture. Agnes also tells Henry the story how she bullied her brother into running his fingers around her.....um........There is another more graphic allusion to incest in this book. Henry has a young friend/prot&eacute;g&eacute;, an aspiring teenage thief/con-man named Curley. Curley appears impressed with Henry's skill in hustling money from friends and acquaintances; Henry does this because he is always dead broke. Anyway, we learn that Curley is involved in a sexual relationship with his aunt. His parents were circus folk and apparently abandoned him and he was forced to live with this aunt and this aunt feels that.....etc.These brutal and nasty stories of life in working class New York in the early 20th century are not all related to sex though there is a lot of that. It is from the perspective of a working class male possessed of a chauvinism not untypical of the time. Women don't figure much in this story except as actors in sex scenes. There are episodes where sex plays no part, for example the story of Miller's father's embrace of religion in his elderly years as well as the excellent and vivid stories about some of Miller's childhood friends and acquaintances.The episodes are sometimes unpleasant and nasty but very real and it is unfortunate that Miller has to break up the power of this novel by placing long rambling incoherent mystical discourses in between the episodes of the book and especially in the last part of the book. These psychedelic tirades really get tiresome and almost completely ruin the book. Tropic of Cancer, thankfully, has little of this gibberish."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"After Tropic of Cancer and 60 pages into this book I thought, 'He lost it'. I settled in and waited for the brilliant flashes of prose to trickle out of the day to day life of this Cosmodemonic Telephone Company employee.It was also at about that time I was picked up by the bottoms of my feet and placed on the shoulders of a drunken man who liked to run with the bulls of Pamplona.Oscillating between manic observations and eloquent prose Miller writes a treatise, dissertation and thesis on the love of living the moment. Nothing passes his eye or mind without inspection and you constantly find your 'normal' life the target of his thoughts.Your sensibilities enter the ring blind-folded against the whole history of heavyweight contenders ever to vie for a title. He comes at you from so many angles it's impossible to track.

And as a story of a man completely free in the modern world (1930's) with not a care in the world, it may even deserve some of its semi-classic stature! But it is not showing Henry'y best writing by any stretch!

Sure, blinding light would occasionally cut through the floating gray clouds of endless paragraphs, but for the most part this book seemed more like a literary endurance test. The beginning piqued my curiosity, but reading the rest of the book made me feel like I just wanted to get my money's worth. I think the most depressing thing about the book was toward the end when Miller was quoting the surrealists, ha ha, and I loved those quotes and it made me want to explore Breton and such, but they stood in harsh contrast to Miller's own writing. Miller seems like an interesting name dropper, a coach of literature that isn't so hot on his own two feet; but then again, I haven't read all of his work, but I'm wondering if it's worth the effort. Henry Miller seems to touch upon things that have already been done better by other writers: Dostoevski was a better rambling, ranting madman writing in a common vernacular; Rimbaud executed the dynamic between bitter nihilistic despair to innocence and hope better; and Lautreamont was much more obscene and capable of creating perfect, surreal, jarring imagery."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"i've read several books of henry's,but it's the very best coz i'm moved by what he said,so frank so grey so sentimentaland so good. sometimes i jsut forget he wrote it so long time ago,his work is everygreen,so to speak."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"In my opinion, it is essential that any budding writer read any Henry Miller book they can find. One of my personal favourites is Tropic of Capricorn. The amazing joy that i find in his words constantly dumbfounds me.

I am exactly in the middle. There are times where Miller's story telling is completely engaging and there are other times when his rants are too cumbersome and egotistical. I told everyone how much I disliked the book and then realized that I was talking about this book more than most I have read. It definitely hits a cord and like most great books, it makes you think. This book is provocative and based on the period of time, it is amazing that Miller was so advanced. I will read this book again and see if it has a different impact on me...."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"This book was way ahead of it's time. Written in the 1930's and banned for almost 30 years, it sounds like something written only yesterday.Miller is an amazing writer with real vision, insight and madness. The James Joyce of America. The book grabs you and holds you from page one. It's a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"wow. reading henry miller is like taking an amazing roller coaster rider while on ecstasy. his writing is intoxicating, it would make a truck driver blush. miller transports you back to a world that we've only seen colored be history. his style is abrupt his sentences infinite and his poetry beyond compare. this is a work of literature in the true sense. constantly testing the limits of imagination and self examination. highly recommended. read this book and pass it onto others!!"},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"I may have a soft spot for this book because it's the first of his I read, but this comes off as no less than his finest hour. The first fifty or so pages are almost unbeatable. Miller nails the very essence of the American character down with an unflinching vitriol that hasn't really been matched in anything else I've read. Given how banal much of the literature that comprises the curriculum in public schools is, I was somewhat shocked and completely mesmerized by someone exposing the degradation and absence of ethics in the the modern workplace so openly. Reading it well after the year 2000, it still was spot on in spite of taking place in 1920s New York.Sure, much has changed since then. Racism and sexism have become more veiled and subtle, but are still present in oblique and diluted forms. On closer inspection, I have come to think that the book tacitly makes the point that racism always was partially a red herring. The real enemy was a system that treated people as mere statistics and robbed us all of our humanity.A lot of people like Cancer better, but I have to disagree. This book is everything he was trying to do in Cancer and then some. Whatever style he was trying to formulate in Cancer, which while still very good basically only described a sort of expatriate hipster aesthetic. That isn't without its merits, but Capricorn was the book that looked not only looked America right in its hideous face, but saw Miller making \\"the only true journey which is to the self\\" (paraphrased). The sexual aspect of the book gets overplayed again and again, but it was only part of a larger transparency in Miller's writing. He wrote graphically and directly about sex in a time when it was utterly unacceptable to do so in popular discourse. His ability with the English language is largely unmatched in American prose. It was in this book, where he wanted to lay out his thoughts in the most naked manner possible, that he hit full stride stylistically.Unsentimental, deliriously descriptive, and brilliant."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"This book was fabulous. More bitter and disillusioned than Tropic of Cancer (you can figure that much out by page 5) this book is as good as the first one, if not more so. It's interesting how he'll talk about some kind of sexual episode and then he's off on a personal reflection of, say, his sickly father finding religion and becoming dependent on it. I agree with Miller himself--you don't want to reach the end of Tropic of Capricorn too fast."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"Like Tropic of Cancer, Tropic of Capricorn is part autobiography, part memoir, part polemic, part fiction, part fantasy, and part poetry, written in near stream of consciousness as Miller experiences one epiphany after another.As with the prior book, Miller's ramblings are the source and the result of his efforts to define himself as an artist. Other contemporary American writers, for example, F. Scott Fitzgerald, seem fascinated by their significance as artists and by the future importance of their art. In the Tropic books, Miller makes his consciousness of himself as an artist the subject of his art. In some ways, reading the Tropic books is like watching someone obsessively paint his self-portrait over and over, all with the title, Self-Portrait of the Artist.According to Miller, \\"Life becomes a spectacle and, if you happen to be an artist, you record the passing show . . . The surface of your being is constantly crumbling; within, however, you grow hard as a diamond.\\" He says he \\"was perhaps the first Dadaist in America, and I didn't know it. Nobody understood what I was writing about or why I wrote that way. I was so lucid that they said I was daffy.\\" The focus is not on the art (what he is writing about) but on himself as the artist, with an anonymous readership (\\"nobody,\\" \\"they\\") who doesn't understand him. As if his own belief in himself as an artist were not enough to convince us, he quotes a series of friends who insist that he should become a writer.While Miller lacks objectivity and security, he has moments of insight into the current human condition. \\"Now we are eating of the same bread, but without benefit of communion, without grace. We are eating to fill our bellies and our hearts are cold and empty. We are separate but not individual,\\" following an anecdote about sour rye, is a brilliantly simple description of a world he sees as cold and mechanical, when progress and war have robbed men of their humanity. \\"The smell of a dead horse . . . is still a thousand times better than the smell of burning chemicals . . . the sight of a dead horse with a bullet hole in the temple . . . is still a better sight than that of a group of men in blue aprons coming out of the arched doorway of the tin factory . . .\\" Honest death and decay, \\"after life,\\" are better than \\"death from the roots, isolating men, making them bitter and fearful and lonely, giving them fruitless energy . . .\\"Superior to Tropic of Cancer, Tropic of Capricorn still shows a lack of discipline, or a contempt for it. Separating the poetic gems are long, rambling passages that are sometimes pointless and sometimes nonsensical. He continues the use of incoherent metaphors such as, \\"Inwardly they are filled with worms. A tiny spark and they blow up.\\" Sometimes his attempts to play with words and prose are more childish than literary or artistic, for example, \\" . . . deeper and deeper in sleep sleeping, the sleep of the deep in deepest sleep, at the nethermost depth full slept, the deepest and sleepest sleep of sleep's sweet sleep,\\" and so on.Tropic of Capricorn is uneven, ranging from the lively and the lovely to the self-conscious and tedious. It's unfortunate that Miller expended so much effort trying to convince the reader (and himself) of his status as an evil monster and artist (perhaps with the idea that they are synonymous) and so little culling the irrelevant and refining the rest. Miller's perspective and vision are interesting, even compelling, when not muddied by his fascination with himself and by his need to stand out."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"Henry Miller captivates the reader from the first sentences, with his strong and astonishing philosophical thoughts and criticism of religion, of life in America.He is so daring, direct, sarcastic, obscene, cold, violent, cynical, erratic, passionate, that you feel as if bent, torn, whipped by a storm, a twister, crying and screaming, yet feeling marvelously alive.With his stunning surrealistic, nihilistic style, you endlessly fly from one world to another, delirious, chaotic, mad, free, ecstatic."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"After reading &#34;Henry & June&#34; by Anaiis Nin I wanted to read something by Miller and heard that this was such a masterpeiece. maybe its the male point of view that turned me off but I find it crude and tasteless and at times demeaning to women. Still have not finished it. Also AMAZON disappointed me by not charging this to the AMEX gift card as I requested but rather used my Debit Card as a result I have deleted my profile this was the second time this has happened."},{"Title":"Tropic of capricorn","review":"The novel version of T.S. Elliot's poem the Wasteland, Miller pours out his soul on the decay of industrialized America. Miller describes in an achingly beautiful stream-of-consciousness prose, the utter despair of life in a city with no soul. People that dwell on the sex and vulgar language are missing the bigger point as Miller describes the hypocrisy, racism, sexism, bureaucracy in a hopeless world. For all the despair Miller describes, I still find a hint of hope, even when he describes the lowest of low individuals, he does it in a lovingly way. In Capricorn, you can see Miller's heavy influence on the Beat Generation. Truly a masterpiece in literature."},{"Title":"The Works Of Robert Louis Stevenson In One Volume","review":"I've lived in Scotland 1 1/2 years so I was interested in this total collection of Robert Louis Stevenson's works. RLS was sickly much of his life and died a young man around 44. A few of his works are considered masterpieces for the era he wrote.His Treasure Island and Kidnapped are considered 2 of his best. I enjoyed them and rate them 5 stars. His Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was different than the movie of today. In today's movies Mr. Hide is shown as a huge muscle bound brute while RLS wrote him as a smaller man/creature than the good Jr Jekyll. Hyde is show with all the evil and badness Dr. Jekyll has but none of the good. 5 stars. Several of the New Arabian Nights stories were 5 stars. I liked the Merry Men about reefs, storms and shipwrecks on the reefs off a Scotland island. Also many of his poems especially his children's poems were 5 stars. A few bummer poems.There were also bummer 1 star stories with massive amounts of contractions, old words no longer used in the English language, and some old Scot talking that was barley understandable. It took me 6 months to read the entire 990 pages because parts were a slow, terrible tedious reading as some of the words are not used in today's language. I tried 2 dictionaries and could not find some of the words.In fairness the publisher does give some explanations of some of the old arcane words but only a small percentage. Some of the old English RLS uses 10 words where 5 would be used today. Lots of description but in places too much and some of the stories are slowed down by this.Just want the reader to know this probably will be a hunt and peck book with some great stories, some good and average and some terrible. A true mixture. If you don't have the time or don't want to expend the effort to read the slow tedious writings it maybe better to skip to another story or poem.

Mr. Jones' book has already helped me enjoy the game so much more by playing so much smarter.The discourse he provides about strategic, penal, and heroic golf hole styles provides an excellent mental framework for choosing a tactic for playing a hole. It helps organize the details Mr. Jones covers about tees, fairways, hazards, greens, optical illusions, and the architect's other &quot;weapons&quot; to foil your attack on the hole.For me, the test of a good author is making concepts that truly are not obvious seem very simple after you've read the book. When I hit the golf course after reading Mr. Jones' book, I must have said &quot;Of course! Just like he said!&quot; eighteen times. It was a real pleasure to come away from a book with an entirely new perspective on something I already enjoyed.I feel like I've already dropped three to five strokes per round by simply not getting &quot;fooled&quot; into traps laid by his father at my home course (Hampton Cove, Huntsville, AL).I recommend this book for the avid golfer.

But more than that - Robert Trent Jones Jr. offers his thoughts on recognising and reading the features of a course and the intention of its designer/architect - and how features give players clues on how the designer/architect intended a particular hole should be played. This information alone will lower your golf handicap.Including details on everything from the peculiarities of different types of grasses and how best to play from each, thru the different types of sand and their characteristics; and even discussing the advantages of carrying 3 wedges rather than two - this book is another Robert Trent Jones Jr. masterpiece.

However, Stoker's tale of the undead provides the contextual and historical background for today's vampire sagas. And its style reveals the civility of nineteenth century culture even under dire circumstances, which is lost in many of today's vampire stories. It is a classic. I have only given it three stars for the reasons I have just mentioned. But at the time it was written I'm sure it was received as a five-star thriller."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Just as Tolkien can be thought of as the base of all fantasy novels and role-playing games, this book is the basis of all stories involving vampires. Dracula is a complex, non-soap opera, but evil, as a vampire should be. The resent flood of teenage friendly blood suckers is just sad. This is the way that they should be presented. A must read for any one who likes horror or fantasy."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Best fictional book on vampires I have ever read.

I don't think I've seen a film or TV version that I'd call \\"fully faithful\\" to the book. The religious themes are usually watered down. The story is usually simplified or streamlined, with entire lines cut out or simply implied. The experience was definitely new.This is also slow reading. I'm accustomed to 55-65 pages an hour with most books, whether popular/commercial or literary, but I read this at about half that speed. Unfortunately, this was mostly my lunchtime book, meaning that it took me far too long to take the entire story in at once. It was still worthwhile."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Romantic, well written and of stunning originality, this is the story which started the vampire phenomenon.Composed as a set of letters and journal entries we follow Jonathan Harker and his encounters with one Count Dracula. Forget the myths and find out for yourself why this is considered one of the best books of all time."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"What can I say? Bram Stoker is the master when it comes to vampires. No one has managed to do it better despite the many imitations (I am yet another author who has tried to follow in his footsteps). I absolutely loved this story from the moment I was first introduced to the junior version in primary school. In hindsight it seems like a very strange choice for young children, but I'm not complaining. The whole books is so steeped in Victorian sexual repression and desire that it is great fun to deconstruct, which I did much later as an English major. Forget Twilight and it's shallow, obvious themes and read a book with real depth and something important to say about the culture that it was created in. I've got to admit it does lose me a bit when it turns into a \\"boys-own\\" type of adventure towards the end, but it isn't enough to detract from its overall brilliance. Bram, baby, you're the best!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"You know how it ends but it was fun to read.

After moving the file, just open your Kindle and there it is, instantaneously.I know for a lot of people this is pretty basic stuff but for those downloading a book from Amazon(or any other free online eBook provider)for the first time, it's nice to have a quick summary of how easy it is and how quick you can be reading your book. I also really like using and downloading free books, old time radio and other items from [...] which has just about anything you can think of. When you find a book you like here for instance, look inside the box on the left hand side and you will see 5-7 different types of downloads you can do, so even if you don't have Kindle, you can still download and read your book, in PDF for instance. Amazon is a great source and I buy a lot of different items through Amazon as well. Hope this helps someone."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Loved this story!! The language at times was a bit hard to understand but I took my time with it and things became a bit clearer when I reread it slowly. I loved the storyline, the imagery, the characters, everything about it was great! My favorite part of the book though will have to be the very beginning when Johnathon was being held captive at the Castle Dracula. I have to admit I was afraid for him and thought he was going to die there, I'm glad he didn't (sorry for the spoiler). What I did find equally interesting was how they took time to write in their journals and recorded everything - everything! that happened. They had really good memory lol. I would not have been able to do that, I would have been summarizing all the way through lol. Altogether it was a great read, and I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"What more can one say? The title sums it up.This is the I believe the original version. We all know the story, what we don't realize the additional journey of the story. I know as a teenager or young adult, I wouldn't have cared for the rich English language of old. Good thing age brings wisdom and appreciation of words of old.Some reviews I scanned complained of the time line and difficulty in reading the text. I can understand that to a degree, but in the broad picture, the work is brilliant. Yes, some of the time lines are a bit jumbled, but then this a collection of diaries and composed notes.In the final scenes it was necessary for Mr. Stoker to move the time line a bit as three different parties were descending upon the Count's Castle in hopes of riding the world of this menace. Brilliant!The love story that circles Mr. and Mrs. Harker has too be one of the all time greats. Gals, really want to know how deeply a man can love? Get a copy. And vice-a-verse guys. How many of us would gladly lay down our lives in hopes of saving the ones we love and care for so deeply.I thoroughly enjoy the writing style of ages gone past. Why? Because the reader is immersed in not only the story line, they become completely immersed in the characters physical, psychological, and metal habits. I believe many of us today rely on too much action to compensate well crafted plots.I recommend this book to any true vampire fan and those who appreciate an absolutely brilliant story."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I find reading classic literature very difficult at times. The language can be very distracting, and I'll have to reread a paragraph several times to understand the exact meaning. This is not so with Bram Stoker's Dracula. This book elicits fear from the very beginning, and holds the readers attention throughout. Modern vampire novels and movies do not hold a candle to the original Dracula."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"*Dracula* is now considered a masterpiece (with even such an august authority like Harold Bloom including it in his *Western Canon*). This is a recent development. The drive for canonization began about 20 years ago, after a generation of poorly educated academics, hypnotized by the need to politicize all literature, began talking about the book's \\"subversive themes\\" within its Victorian context. Before this, the novel was (rightly) dismissed as nothing more than a popular horror novel with some fun ... undertones. Influential, yes; but a classic of literature . . .? Alas, time marches on, and it now seems that Bram Stoker has become the Douglas Sirk of the Victorian literati. We are now told that Dracula is gay because his creator was gay. (After all, Dracula is a \\"Count\\", you know. Campy!) We are informed that the novel has a lot to say about how proper little Anglicans viewed swarthy Easterners. The Science vs. Religion debate gets a lot of ink. Freudian critics ecstatically write essays about the work, for obvious reasons.The critics may be substantially correct. However, none of their intellectualizing will help the modern reader as he plows his way through this Ladies' Gothic Romance. Stoker deliberately employs an antiquated style that would have suited the 1830's rather than 1897, when the book was published. Oh, the characters are all very \\"modern\\"; the women know how to use typewriters; the headshrinkers record their skepticisms on phonographic diaries; but they also say things like this: \\"Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgement Day\\" (Chapter 22). The dialogue is peppered with stuff like: \\"Oh, dear, dear Jonathan\\", \\"My dear, sweet little girl\\", \\"What fools we women are!\\", etc. It's all rather embarrassing to read . . . darling. Didn't Stoker learn anything about prose style from his buddy Oscar Wilde? How could any self-respecting author write like this after the advent of Hardy and Henry James?To be fair, let it be said that the first four chapters of the novel are among the best ever written in this genre. These early chapters are so strong, in fact, that the rest of the book is one long anti-climax. Jonathan Harker's journal is a compactly-written piece of terror that describes his spooky journey to Castle Dracula and his eventual imprisonment there by his lugubrious host. Even here, there's much to laugh at, such as Harker's snobbish anecdotes about the quaint \\"locals\\" of the Romanian countryside, his full cataloging of his meals (\\". . . I fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken\\", and so on), and the comical spectacle of Dracula cooking and later removing the table-service for his guest on a daily basis -- even after they have \\"caught on\\" to each other. Something about the early chapters has always fascinated me: Harker figures out within a fortnight that the Count is a vampire. The Count KNOWS that Harker is aware of his (the Count's) true nature. And yet they go on being civil to one another for at least two months afterwards! I wonder how they spent their evenings. The Count must have continued to cook for and feed his guest, who otherwise would've starved to death. What did they talk about? Stoker refuses to go into it -- the diary simply jumps weeks ahead.There are excellent moments later in the book. Two remarkable monologues: the blasphemous diatribe on the hypocrisy of gravestones by Old Man Swales, and Van Helsing's great paean to hysteria, otherwise known as the \\"King Laugh\\" speech. The saga of the doomed ship \\"Demeter\\" is almost as worthy as the first four chapters. Dracula, as wolf, bursting through Lucy's bedroom window -- with the servants drugged downstairs -- is a genuinely terrifying scene.Characters? Harker, Seward, Van Helsing, and Mina make the strongest impressions, except for Renfield, of course, the most interesting personage by far in the tale. And what of Dracula? He turns out to be a rather dim bulb. He apparently leaves the safe demesnes of his beloved Carpathians because he feels he's missing out on some sort of \\"action\\" or other. He's so eager to take a powder, in fact, that he forgets to make sure that Harker is safely dead (or Undead, as the case might be) before he books passage aboard the \\"Demeter\\". It never occurs to the vampire that the Englishman might make his way back home with a whopper of a tale to tell about funny-accented Romanians who climb up and down castle walls like Spider-Man. Further, the dopey Count recklessly goes after the same victims over and over once landed in England, thereby ensuring that a group of outraged Anglicans will pursue him to the ends of the earth. Oh well, Van Helsing DOES say that Dracula isn't very smart; but what does that say about Stoker's plotting? As far as the Count's appearance goes, the author apparently based the description on his own boss, the actor Sir Henry Irving.Ultimately, the novel's hero is Mina, by default. She represents the emerging power of the \\"New Woman\\" (her phrase). Every character, including the vampire, gets seduced by her eventually. Stoker makes a point of having Mina \\"win over\\" her poor dead friend Lucy's three suitors (AFTER she's married to Harker, no less) in a scene that subversively mocks Lucy's ... triumphs (which were pretty subversive already). Later, she adds the Dutch quack and the vampire to her collection of conquered males. Meanwhile, her husband Harker lies in the hymeneal marriage bed literally paralyzed, with gray hair, while she gets it on with Dracula. This priceless moment produces Stoker's best line, e.g., that bit about the Count forcing her face to his chest as if he were pushing a kitten's head into a saucer of milk. Unclean!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I first read \\"Dracula\\" after seeing the silent film classic \\"Nosferatu\\" on the late late show while babysitting, the classic movie which was based upon the novel but without the permission of the Stoker estate. I was a young teenager and it scared the wits out of me. The plight of Jonathan Harker and his growing suspicion and dread of the strange man he encounters in Transylvania as a solicitor (lawyer) who has helped this man, Count Dracula, purchase a house in London, and the horrors that he and his loved ones experience through the story (and if you haven't at least read the book, it's worth the effort, and it's free on Kindle).This review is of the new Audible edition, narrated by, among others, Alan Cumming and Tim Curry, two wonderful actors, and the best of the narrators of Audible books; a full cast of fine performers. I'm pretty jaded now; I've seen enough horror in reality so I usually don't read or listen to horror, but looking at the cast I decided to give it a chance. Even after all these years, it scared the bejeezus out of me again! I can admire the excellent performances and pacing, and remember now why the originals are so often the best. The cast members are well-prepared and convincing in their efforts, and the simple production is the best of all worlds. I have seldom enjoyed an audio performance so much, and encourage Audible to go on making recordings of classics of this caliber; I will look for them as time goes on. I recommend this to anyone who likes horror, vampires, or classics -- if you don't mind being scared out of your wits. I understand some folks enjoy that. In this case, I am among them, as this audio performance is truly a work of art."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"If you find yourself at home on a long, rainy weekend in winter. Perhaps the fire is going, all your friends are out of town, and there's just you and the cat; I highly recommend losing yourself in the original 'Dracula' (insert - thunderclap).If you're a reader of classics, you'll appreciate the dark symbolism and poetic language employed by Stoker. If you're not, it's one classic you might enjoy with its sinister yet saucy tale.The novel is a well known Gothic tale about the elusive Count Dracula. It is written in an epistolary style, which means it is a series of diary entries, letters, newspaper articles and so on. This style makes it interesting as we read about the story and characters from different perspectives, and we are left wondering which perspectives are reliable (insert- eerie music)!We are introduced to the story by Jonathan Harker, a young solicitor who travels to Transylvania to meet with Dracula on business. The narrative then switches back to England where Harker's fiance, Mina and her friend Lucy, pick up the tale. They wonder what has happened to Jonathan and also muse upon the mysterious arrival of a ship, with one dead body on board. The simultaneous sightings of a black dog have the town of Whitby in a flap. A strange sequence of events plays out, first with Lucy, then with Mina!The thing that keeps you turning the pages and wanting to know more is the lack of explicit reference. Stoker manages to allude to sexuality and horror in symbolic ways, making it all the more tantalising and just plain scary. The word 'Vampire' is barely mentioned, and so we wonder, along with Harker who or what Dracula is!Here is one of my favourite descriptions:\\"my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss, face down, with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.\\"Isn't it thrilling?!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This book was excellently written and it held my attention the whole way through. I was impressed with the breadth of knowledge on a variety of subjects the author must have had in order to write this and also... How modern this book seems. It must have been ahead of it's time.A thoroughly enjoyable read. I recommend anyone to give it a try."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"\\"Dracula\\" was not the first vampire novel, nor was it Bram Stoker's first book. But he managed to craft the ultimate vampire novel, which has spawned countless movies, spinoffs, and books that follow the blueprint of the Transylvanian count. Eerie, horrifying and genuinely mysterious, \\"Dracula\\" is undoubtedly the most striking and unique vampire novel yet penned.Real estate agent Jonathan Harker arrives in Transylvania, to arrange a London house sale to Count Dracula. But as the days go by, Harker witnesses increasingly horrific events, leading him to believe that Dracula is not actually human. His fiancee Mina arrives in Transylvania, and finds that he has been feverish. Meanwhile the count has vanished -- along with countless boxes filled with dirt.And soon afterwards, strange things happen: a ship piloted by a dead man crashes on the shore, after a mysterious thing killed the crew. A lunatic talks about \\"Him\\" coming. And Mina's pal Lucy dies of mysterious blood loss, only to come back as an undead seductress. Dracula has arrived in England -- then the center of the Western world -- and intends to make it his own...\\"Dracula\\" is the grandaddy of Lestat and other elegantly alluring bloodsuckers, but that isn't the sole reason why this novel is a classic. It's also incredibly atmospheric, and very well-written. Not only is it very freaky, in an ornate Victorian style, but it is also full of restrained, quiet horror and creepy eroticism. What's more, it's shaped the portrayal of vampires in movies and books, even to this day.Despite already knowing what's going on for the first half of the book, it's actually kind of creepy to see these people whose lives are being disrupted by Dracula, but don't know about vampires. It's a bit tempting to yell \\"It's a vampire, you idiots!\\" every now and then, but you can't really blame them. Then the second half kicks in, with accented professor Van Helsing taking our heroes on a quest to save Mina from Dracula.And along the way, while our heroes try to figure stuff out, Stoker spins up all these creepy hints of Dracula's arrival. Though he wrote in the late 19th-century manner, very verbose and a bit stuffy, his skill shines through. The book is crammed with intense, evocative language, with moments like Dracula creeping down a wall, or the dead captain found tied to the wheel. Once read, they stick in your mind throughout the book.It's also a credit to Stoker that he keeps his characters from seeming like idiots or freaks, which they could have easily seemed like. Instead, he puts little moments of humanity in them, like Van Helsing admitting that his wife is in an asylum. Even the letters and diaries are written in different styles; for example, Seward's is restrained and analytical, while Mina's is exuberant and bright.Even Dracula himself is an overpowering presence despite his small amount of actual screen time, and not just as a vampire -- Stoker presents him as passionate, intense, malignant, and probably the smartest person in the entire book. If Van Helsing hadn't thwarted him, he probably would have taken over the world -- not the Victorian audience's ideal ending.Intelligent, frightening and very well-written, \\"Dracula\\" is the well-deserved godfather of all modern vampire books and movies -- and its unique villain still dwarfs the more recent undead."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Having only journal writing to tell the story creates so much suspense between entries. The characters are well developed and there is a sense of dread throughout the story. I love the Twilight series because of the romance between the main characters and true love's triumph. Dracula by Bram Stoker is much different. There is romance within the plot, but that is definitely not the focus. If I enjoyed Gothic horror, this book would have been my favorite, but for me it was too dark. As much as the grim nature of the story repelled me, I had to find out what happened next. This is an excellent period piece to read as it whisks the reader into another time for a life and death adventure. Don't expect anything like the fairy tale feeling of Twilight. This is most certainly not a 'feel good' read. I rated it five stars because I believe the story achieved its purpose. It kept me reading until the very end. The author very successfully described what was happening without being graphic. I recommend this book for many reasons. First, it is extremely well written. Second, it is an excellent exercise to read fiction from a previous century. Finally, it is unlike anything else I've read and enjoyed the fresh experience of feeling like the characters were telling their story directly to me via their journals."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Let me begin by saying I am not at all a vampire fan - meaning I have never read a vampire book, never read a horror novel, and do not watch horror movies. (Of course, years ago I did see parts of the black and white Dracula movie. Who hasn't, right?) Well, I must admit that I was curious about this recent \\"vampire craze\\", so I thought, \\"Why not give it a try and read the classic that started it all?\\" So I did. I read it in less than a week. Honestly, I wasn't expecting to like it. So I was pleasantly surprised and shocked to discover that I actually loved it! I was instantly pulled into the story. I do agree with a few other reviewers that at times it is a little slow - but the slow areas didn't last long at all. Also, keep in mind this was written in 1897 when there was no radio or television. Books were their only source of entertainment, so people didn't mind a few slow parts back then. About the plot - Again, I was pleasantly surprised. You read more about all the characters who are affected by Dracula and how they plan to kill him. I really enjoyed getting to know them all and being pulled into the story through their diary entries and letters. I had expected Dracula to be in more scenes, and he wasn't. But that was fine, because the story flowed really well and you saw Dracula \\"when it mattered\\" to the plot. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone. It only has a few bloody scenes, so do not worry on that account. Overall, it is a wonderful story! I thoroughly enjoyed reading it! And remember, I'm not a vampire/horror fan. But honestly, this book is a lot about the story of the people (Jonathan, Mina, Lucy, Dr. Van Helsing, Arthur, Quincy) who have been affected by Dracula - so it is really interesting! Give it a try! I think you will be pleasantly surprised, just as I was!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"First of all, I love almost anything that's vampire fiction like Blue Bloods, Vampire Kisses, I Am Legend, Let The Right One In (Let Me In for American viewers), The Silver Kiss, and importantly Dracula. But guys let's be honest: doesn't this new book cover give you the essence of bloody Twilight? Seriously this goes with the new book covers for Frankenstein, Pride & Prejudice, Romeo & Juliet, and Wuthering Heights. As you can tell I really hate Twilight and I don't like how it's taking over literature pieces and that some teens are just reading these wonderful classics because they look like the Twilight books. It's sad really and I know it's not really a review but I just had to get this off my chest:P"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I'd never read Dracula before so it made a fun Halloween treat. I tried to read it \\"fresh\\"...to shun what I \\"knew\\" from all the media and pop-culture references that are nearly impossible to avoid.While it was difficult (impossible?) to fully forget all the things that culture has thrust on me, I did try to envision what this book would have been like if I'd read it 100+ years ago when it was originally published. While it shares many elements of the graphic novels and general horror writing of the time, it is certainly more \\"terrifying\\" than much of the other horror writing I've read from that era (which isn't saying a whole lot since I haven't read a ton). For the era, this novel seemed to me startlingly graphic in terms of describing the horrors encountered by the main characters. Compared to the gothic novels I've read, this is definitely more creepy. It reminded me a lot of the eerie, creepy horror of some of Poe's works.The writing style was a little different than I imagined. It's set up as an epistolary novel with the narrative coming from multiple points of view as written after the fact in diaries, letters and even some newspaper clippings and commercial documents (ships logs, etc). Thus, we are somewhat distanced from the action of the story, but we also get it from a variety of perspectives and with multiple different voices. Some of the voices were very similar to one another and hard to distinguish. The most distinguishable was Van Helsing who was actually written with a very strong dialect that sometimes annoyed me.I definitely applaud the attention to detail in this book. The descriptions of Dracula's castle and (later) the various homes/parks/streets in England were very vivid and easy to picture. Even more engaging were the details brought to life through the emotional turmoil of the characters. Reading the diary of Jonathan Harker, I could completely envision his growing terror throughout his stay at the castle. I also really liked the detail and interaction in the letters between Mina and Lucy.There were a number of times where I wanted the story to \\"hurry up\\" but when I sat back and read the novel without the cultural baggage of a world that's grown up with the vampire/Dracula mythos, I felt myself very content to move along at a slower pace. Not only did I find myself enjoying the methodical unraveling of the mystery and the descriptions of the Undead, but I also found that the slower pacing created a greater sense of anxiety and apprehension.I only had a couple of minor complaints that stayed with me after finishing the book.First and foremost, I wanted much more interaction with Dracula. There was a ton of build up and a lot of \\"off stage\\" action implying what Dracula had done and what he was doing. We saw him with some regularity early on but in those instances he was still more of an enigma than a source of horror. There were only a very few scenes in which we actually came face-to-face with him as evil antagonist. Furthermore, each of these confrontations was usually over very quickly. Even the final confrontation was concluded quickly. I appreciate that the novel's form makes it impossible for us to see things from his point of view or actually observe his actions off-stage (unless perhaps he had left his own journal), but I would have appreciated more encounters or perhaps lengthier encounters. Instead, most of what we learn about his power and abilities come in short snippets followed by explanations from Van Helsing.My second complaint had to do with Dr. Seward and Renfield. We have Deward's diary which provides information as to Renfield's strange behavior and his unusual outbursts. While I will grant that the chronology of things makes it difficult/impossible for Seward to piece together what's going on, it seems that there were a number of times where Seward should have sought more information but didn't (such as when Renfield escapes and runs to a certain home...even with his rantings and ravings and the strange workmen hauling boxes of dirt, Seward doesn't bother to investigate the owner of the home...I would think that it might be worthwhile to see if there was a particular reason why an escaped lunatic ran to a very particular home after escaping). In spit of Seward's education and experience, it seems that he let a number of threads fall away. Perhaps this is part of the nature of working in a sanitarium in the 1800s.All in all, I really enjoyed finally reading this book. With it's huge influence on modern culture, I definitely recommend checking it out and getting to know this original and exciting work. Be prepared for a bit slower pace but if you put yourself in the mind of a reader in the early 1900s and try to distance yourself from the cultural baggage, I think you'll be in for a very creepy ride.*****5 out of 5 stars"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Long before Twilight, Team Jacob and Team Edward, before Sookie Stackhouse and the Vampire Diaries or Lost Boys, there was the classic thriller Dracula. However, unlike the super sexy vampires of today, Dracula is a true enemy of people. His origins are downright demonic, and you don't want to meet him in a dark wood. So if you want to see where the excitement started, sit down with Bram Stoker and his dark creation. I did and had some nightmares as a result."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"The writer slowly takes you away from reality and makes you believe in what you read. Superb narration with comfortable pace. Slowly you get involved in the intrigue and horror."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Here we compare the epistolary style of Bram Stocker - in the book 'Dracula' - and Choderlos De Laclos - in the book 'Les Liaisons Dangereuses'. This choice was made because both are famous examples of epistolary novels and both have movie versions. We make considerations about the possibility of the style itself be the responsible to the great success of the protagonist of the former - Dracula - in our century.The common characteristic of both books is the absence of a narrator. In the former, the book is a group of diaries and personal journals written by all the characters of the book except Count Dracula. In those papers, the characters write about the happenings. In the second case, the book is a group of letters changed by the characters. So, the reader must build in his mind the whole history, on both books. Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley also was written in this way, but in that case there was only two narrators, so the narrative is smoother.But there are differences between the books. In Dracula, from half to the end, all the characters join themselves to register all happenings. They believe they could find clues on these papers. So, in the last half, the history is told smoothly. In Laclos's book, the characters do not know each other's letters, so only the reader knows all the happenings. Under this point of view, Dracula is clearer than Laclos's book. However, the fact Dracula does not keep a journal himself make the reader anxious with Dracula's steps. In Laclo's book, the reader does not share the anxiety with the characters.We think this characteristic of Stocker's book is one of the main sources of the success of the title character, aside the vampire mystics of course. In this book only the &quot;good&quot; characters told the history, so the reader feels he is being told only one side of the happenings (the &quot;good&quot; one). This fact drives the reader to try understanding Dracula's feelings and causes. Also, this gives liberty to movie directors creating any sort of personality to Dracula, in their adaptations. These versions by themselves create a totally rich and new universe to vampires. And Stoecker himself coined all that liberty in the style."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I was blown away by this book and highly recommend it to anyone mature enough to appreciate the superiority of literature over Hollywood kitsch. Long after all the movies have lost their sophistication and have become corny, this book will still be disturbing. When you read it, keep in mind that it was written over a century ago when society was rigidly moralistic and consider how shocking it would have been to a Victorian audience. Another suggestion is to consider reading it from the point of view that it could be the fear of the spread of syphilis that Bram Stoker was tapping into with the sexual-like contamination of the blood and the insanity. Then take it a step further and consider what impact the book would have if it were written today, only about AIDS."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Even if you only /sort of/ adore vampires, just like folklore, or have a passing interest in supernatural fiction--&quot;Dracula&quot; by Bram Stoker is a rather necessary book. It's a wonderful, dramatic, fully realized, surprisingly topical novel, a quick read for all its antiquated language, and still popular even after all these years."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"According to my 18yo son who purchased this book:As far as the book itself goes, this is a very nice edition of Dracula. The cover, the page quality, font style/size, and the built-in bookmark work together to give the book a rich look and good feel while reading.I have noticed that other reviewers complained about their copies of this book arriving slightly damaged, and while mine was not damaged at all, I was surprised to find it loose in the box, rather than secured to cardboard with shrinkwrap as most other Amazon books are.I know this may sound petty; however, I can't understand the issue people have with the fact that the book is portrayed as if the events within have actually happened. Fantasy fiction, people. Ever heard of it? Last time I checked, well-written books make you feel as if their world were real, drawing you in. I don't think of Dracula as a real person's diary any more than I think of Lord of the Rings as world history. It's just a good story."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Of course you know the story of Dracula. Or you think you know it, the tale of this blood-sucking Count and the damsels in Victorian costume. The fact is the Dracula you find in the original book is far from the images you have from Bell Lugosi, Gary Oldman, or inimitable Christopher Lee. Read the book, and you know Count Dracula is in fact more like a reptile (he can climb down the wall of a building like a lizard), and his very bad breath.The book written in 1897 can still provide some good scares here and there, but these scares belong to the tradition of Gothic stories. The story gets most macabre when it tells about the fate of bitten Lucy, which is still shocking to many readers. Except that and some other chilling episodes (such as bloofer lady in the graveyard) the story may be a little slack by today's standard, and the ending might not be what you expect.[WRITING STYLE] Well, I don't have much to add about the tale of the Count itself. I only say that the whole book consists of diaries, journals, letters, clips from newspapers, etc. written by the characters such as Jonathan Harker and his sweetheart Mina. If you're not accustomed to the style, you might find it irritating at first, but you get used to it sooner or later.[CHILD BRAIN?] The book's Van Helsing is not Peter Cushing or Hugh Jackman. The real eminent professor is older, more talkative, and most of all, has curious sense of humor which he calls King Laugh. He introduces several methods to protect the ladies from the vampire (like garlic flowers), but some part of his erudition (including brief reference to \`nosferatu') sound very strange today. According to Helsing, Dracula has a \`child-brain' and that's the reason the Count cannot outwit the humans. His idea sounds bizarre today, but to understand it you need to keep im mind that the book was written for the readers who shared the now discredited, turn-of-the-century ideas about psychology or criminology. In short, Helsing is not joking. He means it as the author Bram Stoker.[PENGUIN EDITION] FROM HERE THE REVIREW IS ABOUT THE PENGUIN CLASSICS EDITION. For the new edition of Penguin Classics, Maurice Hindle revised his introduction. The new introduction is readable and informative, and puts the book in its historical context. This edition also provides appendix - 1) Bram Stoker's Correspondence with Walt Whitman: 2) Charlotte Stoker's Account of \`The Cholera Horror' in a Letter to Bram Stoker [Charlotte is Bram Stoker's mother]: 3) Bram Stoker's Article \`The Censorship of Fiction': 4) Bram Stoker's Interview with Winston Churchill.But probably you should start reading the book first without any knowledge, and enjoy its Gothic world. Though Bram Stoker wrote more than ten books (and some of them are better than you expect, like \`The Jewel of the Seven Stars') it is because of Count Dracula and his chilling story that he earned the reputation, and the book tells you why."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This is a classic no matter what opinions people have. Bram Stoker's monster is arguably the original vampire, if not that, he is certainly the most infamous. The lesser known graphic underground story \\"Varney the vampire\\" had surfaced earlier. Varney the vampire is one of the first, more roughly written vampire novels.The sorrow and malevolence of \\"Dracula\\" is what makes it tragically romantic. It was Bram Stoker's very complete story, and talent that structured and established the finishing touches on the characteristics for the legend of the vampire in the mainstream.I have read \\"Dracula\\" many times and still discover thought provoking sub-plots. The novel is deep-rooted and entertaining.The structure of the book composed of diary entries, letters, records, telegrams, etc is a different approach and original. Then the book becomes debatably \\"interactive\\" as the author reveals that his characters (Dracula's enemies) are reading their own diary entries along with you, in order to pursue the powerful Count Dracula.Bram Stoker was a talented author, this is undisputed in my opinion. His writing is a bit disturbing, but his artistic range and ability to tell a story is masterful. Aside from Count Dracula, the other characters are memorable as well. Full and charismatic. Although my favorite character has always been Quincey P. Morris, an example of this is the character Abraham Van Helsing. Van Helsing has practically taken up as much space in vampire lore as vampires themselves. Almost every vampire film or book has some spin-off version of Van Helsing."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"...of those first Victorian readers who were unacquainted with all the modern monsters and special effects. The idea of the eternal vampire is an old one from Eastern Europe (originally from Egypt) and the joining of an actual person (Vlad the Impaler) with the legend set the stage for all that was to follow.This book is in the form of a diary, surely one of the best mechanisms available when handled adroitly. The slow seduction of Mina by the Count can be interpreted in a number of ways but the best way is left to the imagination. There is always that ageless quandry - does one become a Vampire, lose one's soul, yet gain immortality? Get the book - better than any of the current crop."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula is a masterpiece of Horror fiction, undoubtedly a classic and a necessary read for anyone who would consider him/herself a Horror fan. The title character has been forever imprinted on the minds of the world as the true name of the Vampire, and almost anyone who you could possibly ask could give you a pretty good description of the framework of the story.A rich, reclusive count from the dark land of Transylvania tires of his homeland and searches for a home abroad to quench his thirst. Not for riches, not for glory, but for blood. For this count is a member of the damned breed, the Nosferatu, the Vampire. A demon condemned to live off of the blood of the living, while being neither alive, nor dead. It is a sad and frightening tale, filled with action and suspense.Dracula is not only famous for its introduction of the mythology of Vlad the Impaler (in somewhat diluted form) to Western culture, but also for its formula. The inescapable evil (Dracula) to be confronted by a small, yet wary band of people lead by one who knows all of the creature's secrets and weaknesses (Van Helsing) has become a Horror staple. And folks never seem to get tired of it. The subject of Van Helsing, a character who almost, but not quite, overshadows Dracula in popularity is long overdue for a novelization of his own. Van Helsing's encounters with the supernatural would most definitely draw a fanbase.If you're a Horror fan, or just like good old storytelling, Dracula is a book not to be missed. In fact, this novel should be required reading. It just might help increase the literacy rate!Note: this edition has an awesome cover drawn by Boris Vallejo and it claims to be unabridged (abridging this story ought to be illegal!)"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"After reading one female reader's review, I fear it may be necessary to point out that &quot;Dracula&quot; is not a &quot;retelling&quot; of &quot;the story of Count Dracula.&quot; Rather, this novel was an original creation. The plot, with which we are now so familiar, began (but did not end) here. Mr. Stoker exploded for what turned out to be the only time in his career with original genius; the characters, plot and the main antagonist were all children of his imagination (with the exception of the fact that the name 'Dracula' comes from the Romanian 'Drakul' who was a sadistic warrior prince in ancient times, but not an alleged vampire). Also, it is important to note that Bram Stoker was concerned with writing a horror novel about the supernatural, NOT about what some future generation of feminists were going to think of Mina Harker as &quot;an example&quot; of women's liberation. It really is disheartening reading reviews of great books which attempt to recast the characters in terms of revisionist politically correct dogma. Mina Harker is a Victorian woman from England and a wonderful, empathetic character whose presence is vital to the exposition and the other characters. To impugn her as a character because she doesn't fit the current ideas of radical feminism is to demean derivatively all the women of her era. For all we know, these women led more sensitive and fulfilling lives that women of her age today, and literature should be criticized on grounds which are non-transitory (i.e., political trends and fads)."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

The book is really interesting, a true page turner, it is full of action. And it is very different from the movie with Gary Oldman. Very. Now just a couple of words to explain why I rated it 4 stars. Two things were a bit annoying: somewhat lengthy monologues of Van Helsing, and the fact that there is a very precise division between the good and the bad characters.

K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker's Dracula is truly a timeless classic. It is the book that effectively began the world culture's fascination with vampire tales. It is so ingrained in our culture that even people who have never heard of Bram Stoker know the name and basic characteristics of Count Dracula. The book is written as a set of letters and diary entries by different characters in the story. It has inspired many Dracula movies and spinoffs loosely based on the original book. The book is very interesting for the most part. I find Jonathan Harker's first entries highly interesting. However, this is a very long book and not what most people would call an easy read. Parts of the book drag by kind of slowly. I think this is definitely worth the read. Especially when one considers that it was the precursor to all other vampire stories from Anne Rice right down to the plethora of current novels that are so popular at the moment."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

An intense, moving, riveting and downright awesome tale depicting everybody's favorite Bat Man. Most people already know roughly the story, but they are probably unaware of how good the novel actually is. Written from the viewpoints of various characters, the tale blends itself seductively through a gothic and often scary sequence of well written scenarios. From London to Transylvania, each chapter maintains the impetus of the story nicely, tying up all loose ends in a dramatic showdown in the batcave itself.Nothing else really to say except that this is a definite must for anyone who is lucky enough to be able to read.Good work Bram!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

With such a big build up, I was dissapointed to find no battle or even a struggle once they find him. Dracula goes out with a whimper. It was almost too easy. Lack luster ending for sure. The Francis Ford Coppola film Bram Stroker's Dracula (1992) is much better. But in all fairness, I am sure for it's time, it could have been so much more.

The characters known as Jonathan Harker, Mina Harker, Abraham Van Helsing and Dracula are original works of pure imagination. Dracula is not your ordinary villain. He kills people madly by sucking their blood. He's also very cunning and controls people over their will.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"After getting into someThe Undead and Philosophy: Chicken Soup for the Soulless (Popular Culture and Philosophy), I decided that I had been greatly remiss in not reading Bram Stoker's classic \\"Dracula\\".Surprisingly, this was only one of many novels written by Stoker, though by far the most popular. It has not once been out of print since it was published. Not a bad achievement, really.The book is written through documents, and covers a large range of changing viewpoints. Those documents include journals of the main characters, (such as Jonathan Harker), letters, telegrams, newspaper reports, and so on. I thought it strange, but this style of writing works exceptionally well and is a mark of Stoker's ability. It gives a greater air of authenticity to the plot, which is creepy enough, in itself.The basic plot is a creepy tale of Count Dracula who decides to move to England and start a new \\"life\\" there. Buying up properties, Jonathan Harker has to travel to the Count with the papers. What follows is a series of strange and mysterious events that leave people puzzled and wondering. Dracula is hatching his own vile plans for the land of England.The narrative flows along very well, and keeps the right level of tension. In some places, things just get freaky, but it all adds up to a very eerie and tense tale. This is among the best books of the type I have read.Set in later Victorian England, the heavy duty sexuality that exudes from the book was something of a surprise. Never crossing the line into crass obscenity, Stoker weaves a sexuality throughout the vampire encounters that is almost palpable and would have been shocking in his day. One can see where the inspiration for Lestat and more modern vampires comes from, (if one had missed the obvious, that is!).There was one thing that made the book a little tough to get through in places: the dated and very 19th century English. Of course, to change it into a more modern dialect would be verging on sacrilege, but a potential reader would need to be aware of it. Some parts I found a little tough and I had to really think about the meaning. However, in some ways, this added to the charm of the book as the language is actually quite nice for the most part.\\"Dracula\\" is truly a classic, and definitely comes with this reviewer's unreserved recommendation. It is simply a great read and it is a pivotal book for all the immitations that it spawned."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I've had mixed feelings about this book.

Over all I think it's a terrific book to read but you probably might need a strong stomach, but I will suggest this book to almost anyone!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

There isn't a graceful sentence in the entire book. For this reason Dracula remains more an entertainment than a work of art, but that shouldn't prevent any prospective reader from experiencing this wonderful tale.This edition is handsome and includes a number of interesting accompaniments, including Stoker's fan letter to Walt Whitman."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Next year is the 110th anniversary of the publication of Dracula. Dracula, or Count Dracula, is probably the most famous vampire of them all. After one hundred years, Dracula is so ingrained into vampire mythology that when we think vampires - we think Dracula.You could argue that the reason for this began with F.W. Murnau's film Nosferatu. Although the main character, wonderfully portrayed by Max Schreck, is referred to as Count Orlok - the viewing public were not fooled! Thousands of fans knew Murnau was telling the Dracula story! And so began a phenomenon, Dracula is now the most portrayed character in the horror genre - beating the likes of Frankenstein - and notching up over 160 portrayals. Most notable of these, apart from the previously mentioned Max Schreck, include those by: Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee and, more recently, Gary Oldman.So, does this explain the unbelievable success of the Dracula novel? Are the scores of portrayals serving as huge advertising campaigns? Is this the reason why one hundred years on thousands of copies of Dracula are still being sold? Of course not!Bram Stoker's Dracula completely captured the imagination of the reading public. One of the reasons for this is that it is not written like a novel - one unknown voice telling you a story. Stoker's Dracula is told to us by many voices all of which are characters within Dracula. The protagonists tell us the story through diary entries, newspaper clippings and letters. This style of story telling adds to our fear while reading, as it immerses us in the character's plight and gives us the impression that these events could be based on truth. You may think this last statement ludicrous and it probably is, but the fact that we have never found the burial place of Vlad Dracula (Vlad the Impaler), only adds to an air of uncertainty. When you are alone at night, a copy of Dracula on the bedside table, the wind and rain pelting against the windowpane, what seems ridiculous in cold light of day seems only the more real with the unexplained noises that occur during the night.One of the most interesting reasons why Dracula has survived the test of time is quite simply; it is the ancestor of all vampire novels. All other vampire stories are descendants of it, even Anne Rice, who refers to Dracula in one of her novels as the, \\"vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman,\\" cannot dispute that her novels are descended from it.How do we know that every vampire novel is descended from Bram Stoker's? The reason is simple, Stoker set down a list of vampire rules, and every book that followed after has used these rules. These rules may have been reinterpreted but still today, most stay remarkably true to Stoker's original vampire laws. Stakes through the heart, fear of religious symbols, sleeping in coffins- these are all Bram Stoker's ideas. All modern portrayals of vampires and vampire slayers use Stoker's story as a benchmark, or something to aspire too. You could even argue that Buffy the Vampire Slayer's watcher is a modern interpretation of Van Helsing.Stoker was also the first person to coin the term \\"Un-Dead,\\" used to this day by fiction writers to refer to vampires or zombies. Not many writers have ever achieved the accolade of inventing a word that becomes automatically absorbed into the English language.In conclusion, if you are a avid reader looking to read one of the classics, you can't go wrong with Bram Stoker's Dracula, and like wise if you are aspiring horror writer - make it first on your list of books to read and inspire you."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"\\"Dracula\\" was not the first vampire novel, nor was it Bram Stoker's first book. But after years of research, Stoker managed to craft the ultimate vampire novel, which has spawned countless movies, spinoffs, and books that follow the blueprint of the Transylvanian count.Real estate agent Jonathan Harker arrives in Transylvania, to arrange a London house sale to Count Dracula. But as the days go by, Harker witnesses increasingly horrific events, leading him to believe that Dracula is not actually human.

Bram Stroker is hands down the best vampire novelist ever known the way he writes Dracula is amazing. In a diary, journal, different points of view. You see the story unfold of Count Dracula you see his past, and how he will do anything to have his love again. Mina, Jonathan Harker's soon to be wife is her, Dracula's lover. It's a classic novel that doesn't need a sequal like the new book \\"Bloodline\\" which wrecked the ENTIRE point of Dracula. The book is basically a race against the clock to see who can save Mina first. Dracula is amazing the books a page turner to the very end, and it's amazing how Bram writes it.

K.

The book starts out with Jonathan Harker's journey to Transylvania where he meets the Count and then things get bizarre as Mr. Harker finds the count is rather odd in his mannerisms and he finds out a little to late he has become a prisoner of the Counts and is trapped inside the Count's estate while the Count travels to England. Leaving Mr. Harker to try and find a way out and make his way back to England. Meanwhile, in England strange events happen, a ship with a dead crew runs aground during a storm and Lucy Westenra, a friend of Mr. Harker's fianc&eacute;e Ms. Mina Murray, is attacked after sleep walking and strange wounds are found on her neck. Then the story slips into the hunt and destruction of the feared vampire Dracula and the eradication of him from the earth. The story is told through characters journal entries and telegraphs and new articles and other documents which can mildly confuse things but is quickly forgotten as you turn page after page. The text at times can become confusing but my copy of the book had wonderful side notes to try and explain things. Over all, it is a wonderful book of literacy merit and has enthralled countless people for years and is a wonderful read from front to back. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys tales and those searching for the heebie-jeebies."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I have a tradition of reading this book over October every year and it still gives me the chills. Stoker's lush decriptions and the quality of the characters (they are of course rather simplified) makes this one of the more perfect stories ever.I love the \\"realism\\" that the book gives off. The journal entries, the telegraph clippings, and the letters give the story an authentic feel.I have watched every Dracula movie that ever came out and I am still waiting for someone to make a real Dracula. Not sexy, but terrifying. A predator with no hesitation. Dracula is the most frightening character in history for a reason. You see how manipulative he is with Johnathan Harker in the begining, you see how controlling he is with Lucy Westenra, and climacticly, how cruel and inhuman he is with Mina Harker. He was calculating and terrifying, as if to prove that no one was safe, and you couldn't protect even the most precious people you know. Gave me the willies then, gives me the willies now. The men in the story have all the compassion that Dracula lacks. Quincy and Jack were hands down my favorite characters.I fell in love with Jack Seward at 14 and it was interesting to see shades of Jack develop in the man I truly fell in love with and married."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker's classic novel \\"Dracula\\" recounts the tale of the many people who come to interact with the terrifying Count. Jonathan Harker, the first to encounter Dracula, tells of his hair-raising experience while staying with the Count as a business guest. From there, the reader is taken on a chilling ride through the Count's antics as he comes to England and wreaks havoc on the population.There is really no need to summarize this whole tale. It is certainly familiar to just about everyone. While I am a huge vampire fiction reader, it took me some time to finally get around to reading this novel. The only drawbacks of this book were some difficult language and the length. I definitely believe that this novel could have been about 100 pages shorter. It was thoroughly enjoyable, nonetheless.I highly recommend this novel to anyone! Absolutely a fantastic read!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Published in 1897, Bram Stoker's Dracula soon became known as a work of pure genius. Even today, it is much read across the world, and regarded as THE all-time classical horror story.The actual novel is written as a series of diary extracts, and the peopleinvolved submitted their diaries after the event in order to make sense of it. Through time, stories are changed and manipulated - and this in turn, makes them all the more mysterious and thrilling. There is a possibility that Stoker was trying to tell us that perhaps the events were exaggerated through different people's perceptions of them. We do not know whether to believe it as a true story; or a work of complete fantasy; or if we have been informed of all the gory details or not.In the story, we meet Jonathan Harker, who leaves his beloved fianc&eacute;, Mina, to travel to organize the finances of a Count Dracula, buying an estate in England. Harker soon becomes suspicious of Dracula's motives. Dracula's intentions soon become clear. He intends to create a race of Vampires to rule the world and place the Human race second in the food chain. Such an idea is so immense, and the implications are terrible. Together with Professor Van Helsing, Harker and a few others seek to hunt down the Demon and destroy him. This is revenge for their beloved Lucy, who fell at the hands of Dracula; for Mina, who becomes a communication portal for Dracula; and for the sake of mankind.This is a story about good against evil. It depends upon the late Victorian ideal that good shall always triumph. The almighty God must win against Satan in the end. Together with this, Stoker seems to depict the social classes of the era to be corrupt."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"As expected this classic was completely enthralling and entertaining. It took me back to a time when words meant different things before being tainted and destroyed by popular culture. The characters were vividly described and supported throughout the story. The details were many, yet not boring or mundane. This book is worth a read anytime and I'm glad I went back and re-read it once again! Anyone looking for great literature, should definitely check out this classic offering."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"While the book is dated and is sometimes hard to follow minor points because of the almost Elizabethan way Stoker wrote his dialog, Dracula remains a very scary and an all-around great read. I'd love to see a straight out adaptation of the book. Coppala's film version is close, but lacks a lot of what makes the book so great. And adds a lot of things that aren't in the book at all. Also, in the last few years with both \\"True Blood\\" and \\"Twilight\\" becoming so popular, I recommend horror fans should read the original text to see how creepy and unfriendly vampires can be!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I too bought this copy from Penguin Publications for the lovely way it was produced. I think most of us are familiar with Bram Stokers Dracula but this edition is quite nice. I don't know about other produced copies but this one starts with the preface and then a chronology, introduction, further reading and a note on the text. I was very impressed with the chronology. It starts with the date 1847, 8th, November the birth of Bram. Then it continues on with important dates in his life. I loved it. This really is a nice copy for those who are collectors of books."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"The story itself is really good. The style of writing, told from each of the characters' diaries, is descriptive and story telling, while allowing the reader to also see what each character is feeling and why. The middle tends to drag a little, but the story picks up again towards the end. Unfortunately, the editing for the story is lacking; there are several points where pronouns repeat or the verbs were not in the proper tense. It made the reading more frustrating, as you had to figure out what was supposed to be said and how, before you could then enjoy the story."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I don't know what to say about this classic book that hasn't already been said 100 times, but I'm going to try. This is obviously the standard vampire classic that all vampire stories are judged by, although it isn't the first vampire story. Carmilla by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu came out first and was a heavy influence on Stoker, but Stoker's Dracula is the work that has endured better.The only hindrance I can see for people to love this story is that the language is older and a little different than modern English. I'd read the free preview in the Look Inside and see if the writing style suits you. If it does, get this book right away. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula was my first 'classic'.First, confession: my literary education has been sorely lacking. While I've always been an avid reader, my interests have erred towards fantasy and sci-fi. I never really read outside genre. During high-school, we read a good handful of Australian YA novels (Looking For Alibrandi could still make me cry!), but in my English class, we didn't study Shakespeare, the Brontes, Austen or Dickens. And it's been bothering me. I keep asking myself how I can rattle on about how much I love reading, love books, love literature, when I've really read so little.So I set out to rectify it. I read Dracula. And it was HARD.Before I get stuck in, let me disclaim: this is isn't really a 'review', so much as my journey into an as yet uncharted realm of my literary educationDracula is a great story, but it is not an easy read. It's a rewarding read: the story is complex and clever, dark, frightening, and disturbing. It plays on human fears and weaknesses and paranoias. Mortality, death, loss and spirituality (your mortal soul). The vampire is not a glamorous creature. He is shocking, cruel, vindictive and villainous. He is not a likeable character, yet, like Mina, one does develop a degree of pity for this unpleasant creature.I feel richer for having read it, but it took work (3 months, while my Father-in-Law one-upped me by reading it in a day). Also: Stoker's descriptions of the Transylvannian landscape, and the infamous Castle Dracula, are exactly how you ever saw them shown in a movie. It's eerie, atmospheric and the pictures drawn with his words are so evocative. Renfield is a fantastic character--one of the most memorable and intriguing of the story (just had to throw that in!).I admit it--I love vampire fiction (yeah, yeah, I mean Ed and Bells, Eric, Cat and Bones and Louis and Lestat), but I think given the take we have on vampires in modern fiction, this is the most wonderfully unique and dark tale I've read in the 'genre'. If you like books with pasty-white boys with sharp teeth, you must read this novel."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I am a huge Dracula fan. I see him as the ultimate villain and monster. The book was free so i didn't really mind it being the first book on my Kindle. The beginning is awesome. following Jonathan Harker in Dracula's castle. The middle drags on. It's just characters going through their lives except Seward and Renfield who have awesome parts in the book. The end is where it picks up again with the hunt for Dracula begins and then comes to an end. I recommend it for the big vampire fan who wants something different than Edward Collen."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Very captivating, it's the kind of book you just can't put down. A chilling thriller, my favorite kind."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Count Dracula is indeed monstrous; he is cunning, meticulous, intelligent, and imaginative. In an Earthly sense, he is the ultimate gangster. Supremely powerful and determined, he allows nothing to deviate his will. And he demands that his minions be loyal to the bone--the slightest departure therefrom resulting in brutal murder. In the spiritual sense, he is a rogue entity, a half-breed of the carnal and noncarnal worlds, moving freely in both, and yet belonging to neither. Such is the sensational fiend created by Bram Stoker over 100 years ago. &quot;Dracula&quot; mesmerizes the reader with its suspense, terror, and beauty. However, the novel can be wordy. This book requires patience. But one's diligence in pursuing every single word to the end will not go unrewarded. Imagine the sight of a ghastly white sepulchre in the Moonlight, or the gleaming eyes of a thousand rats protecting their master. Professor van Helsing and Mina's journey to Castle Dracula is riveting. The destruction of Dracula's three brides is horrific and luscious. This omnipresent tale can still raise the precious hairs on your neck."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula stands as one of the greatest novels I have ever read. For horror, only one other novel comes close to giving the reader such a feeling of all encompassing evil and wickedness, that book being Lair of the White Worm, also by Stoker. Not only does one delve into the realm of all encompassing wickedness but one also finds himself having a religious encounter unlike any before. The forces of good verses evil have never been more apparent. One cannot help but sympathize with Dracula for one realizes that Dracula is Dracula and by his very nature must be the sanguinivorous fiend that he is. Yet, one knows that Dracula must be destroyed for nothing that evil should be allowed to exist. I read this book by candle light after dark. Atmosphere really enhanced this book. Dracuala was the most religious experience I have ever had. It is a must read for everyone and is one of only a handfull of books which I rate as a 10 out of 10. Read it before your coffin lid closes, it will disturb you."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I first read Stoker's classic sometime around 1963, when I was a teenager. It impressed me then and it impresses me still. I am approaching fifty years old now, and at least once a decade I have to dust off the Count and read him again. I read to my daughter all of her life and, a few years back when she was about 12, I told her that there was one, last book I would read aloud to her, DRACULA. She found the first few chapters a bit dry, so did I the first time through, and then the momentum builds and is sustained perhaps longer than any novel I've ever read. When I would come home in the evening and after dinner she would be waiting with the volume in hand. She loved it! In 1997, while visiting London, we were touring the west side of Highgate Cemetery, and I was struck by the locale and a certain, haunting familiarity that it seemed I had with it. A year or two later I was shocked to learn, quite by happenstance, that this very place had been the inspiration for the London segment of Stoker's book! Few books will meld with one's concious, will become part of one's psyche for a lifetime. Bram Stoker's DRACULA is a giant among the few."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Wow! This book is awsome! Even though it was required reading after reading the first few pages I was hooked. It is amazing how someone is able to write something as good as this. The only thing I didn't quite like was the way some things kept staying the same, like when Mina Harker was getting hypnothised. For a few days she said pretty much the same things. What would make this a better book would be more interesting variations."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"One of the most amazing aspects of this truly classic book, is that when Bram Stoker wrote it, he had nothing to go on. that is, he had no set rules for horror stories. the way he unravels the mystery of the count himself to harker is genius. i think the first 50 pages of &quot;Dracula&quot; are a template for classic horror. and these themes are what today's writers use to tell their horror tales. you WILL enjoy this book"},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

But as the days go by, Harker witnesses increasingly horrific events, leading him to believe that Dracula is not actually human. His fiancee Mina arrives in Transylvania, and finds that he has been feverish.

A lunatic talks about \\"Him\\" coming. And Mina's pal Lucy dies of mysterious blood loss, only to come back as an undead seductress. Dracula has arrived in England -- then the center of the Western world -- and intends to make it his own...\\"Dracula\\" is the grandaddy of Lestat and other elegantly alluring bloodsuckers, but that isn't the sole reason why this novel is a classic. It's also incredibly atmospheric, and very well-written. Not only is it very freaky, in an ornate Victorian style, but it is also full of restrained, quiet horror and creepy eroticism. What's more, it's shaped the portrayal of vampires in movies and books, even to this day.Despite already knowing what's going on for the first half of the book, it's actually kind of creepy to see these people whose lives are being disrupted by Dracula, but don't know about vampires. It's a bit tempting to yell \\"It's a vampire, you idiots!\\" every now and then, but you can't really blame them. Then the second half kicks in, with accented professor Van Helsing taking our heroes on a quest to save Mina from Dracula.And along the way, while our heroes try to figure stuff out, Stoker spins up all these creepy hints of Dracula's arrival. Though he wrote in the late 19th-century manner, very verbose and a bit stuffy, his skill shines through. The book is crammed with intense, evocative language, with moments like Dracula creeping down a wall, or the dead captain found tied to the wheel. Once read, they stick in your mind throughout the book.It's also a credit to Stoker that he keeps his characters from seeming like idiots or freaks, which they could have easily seemed like. Instead, he puts little moments of humanity in them, like Van Helsing admitting that his wife is in an asylum. Even the letters and diaries are written in different styles; for example, Seward's is restrained and analytical, while Mina's is exuberant and bright.Even Dracula himself is an overpowering presence despite his small amount of actual screen time, and not just as a vampire -- Stoker presents him as passionate, intense, malignant, and probably the smartest person in the entire book. If Van Helsing hadn't thwarted him, he probably would have taken over the world -- not the Victorian audience's ideal ending.Intelligent, frightening and very well-written, \\"Dracula\\" is the well-deserved godfather of all modern vampire books and movies -- and its unique villain still dwarfs the more recent undead."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

If you're into vampires, this is what started it all. If a century of cheap knockoffs have ruined vampires for you, take a look at how they should be. Within these pages are vampires as they should be. Dracula doesn't glitter in the sunlight, he doesn't flee from blacklights or start loving his prey either (take that Coppolla!). It's no surprise that Dracula is the most played role in the history of film.No other words I could speak could magnify and praise this book any further, so I'll stop before I write a whole novel.

Anyone investigating 19th century Western literature or who has a keen interest in disturbing fiction should read this novel. Indeed, Freudian, Darwinist, Niethzean, and Socialist forces were changing the West in the 1800's, and Stoker effectively uses them to frighten the reader. However, Amazon.Com wasn't convenient in the 19th century; it wasn't around. Similarly, what scared middle class Britons in the 19th century just isn't disturbing any longer. So if you want to read a disturbing fiction to be truly disturbed, avoid this. If you want to read a classic 19th century novel, read something by Dickens. Avoid this novel unless you have an acute interest in specifically reading it."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

There are a whole new breed of horror writers focusing on the vampire element in this day and age. You would be better of focusing on one of them. Dracula may be the most famous Vampire of them all, but if it's a good blood curdling horror story you are after there are many, more evil and fierce than he ever was.It's more like a warped version of beauty and the beast. The characters have that kind of melodramatic foppishness that comes with the period it's set in.

This book is a classic; it was written for a different audience at a different time; it is not going to replace either of the other titles in the pantheon of vampire fiction. However, it's the base of most vampire fiction, and it's nice to see where the myth and legend start.If you liked Anne Rice, Stephenie Meyer, or even Nora Robert's newest vampire novels, you might really like Bram Stoker, too. Or... you might find that you have a generation gap and that Dracula, the real, classic Dracula, isn't nearly what you'd hoped it would be. If you're expecting Dean Koontz, Stephen King, or Anne Rice at her lush, Lestat verbosity: you will NOT get it with Bram Stoker. Different time, different generation, different message. Vampires in Dracula=BAD."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"The idea of the vampire is fascinating, but Bram Stoker's book is not. I began reading this novel in the hopes that I might find more depth of character and plot than in the movie. But any hopes for this were demolished by the clumsy form, lack of a real narrator, and lack of character development.At first I found the form interesting. The whole story is related through diary/journal entries by the characters, newspaper clips, telegrams, etc. Yet by the time I had read roughly 100 pages, I was growing tired of listening to the characters bubble on about their emotions, and how beautiful everyone except Dracula is.Towards the climactic scene, the journal form begins to conflict more and more with the plot. As the actions become more time-compressed, the characters have to spend more time writing down conversations and updates to the plot. One imagines them scurrying off after anything happens to go and write it down in their diary. (I don't know anyone in real life who does this.)Also, since he is seen through the distance of the characters' point of view, Dracula has hardly any recognizable presence in the story, except as the invisible menace. Being a boring villain, he is defeated by boring, superstitious means. What reason is there for the vampire to appear in the characters' lives anyway, unless to punish them for a wild imagination and gushing diaries?The only character of interest is Dr. Van Helsing, especially when he speaks of an odd impulse to laughter that comes up at the most inopportune times, and when he speaks of the vampire's &quot;child&quot; brain.Otherwise, the book suffers heavily from lack of a good narrator (who would perhaps scale down some of the gratuitous sentimentalism), and so I suggest watching the Francis Ford Coppolla film instead."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"I am fond of Bram Stoker's method of retelling the tale of Dracula from the vantage point of many different characters via their journals. At times however, these journal entries became rather wordy with extraneous information. I am glad that some of the characters' hopes and fears are explicity expressed, but then others' are not which is disappointing. The main female character, Mina Harker, is treated as an equal to the male characters (she was praised for her typing skills and her courage) and at the same time thought of as delicate and someone that needs protecting. It is a rather confused example for women's liberation to say the least. And my last comment deals with the fact that the ending falls horribly flat. All this suspense is built up, then in the final climatic scene (man vs monster) there's no struggle and it's all over very quickly without the extreme details given in the previous scenes. I expected something more from a &quot;Classic&quot; horror novel."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"If you've always been intrigued by the Dracula phenomenon, then you'll enjoy saying you've read the book that started it all. But don't expect to enjoy actually reading it. It's nothing like the old movies, and that's not necessarily a good thing.Stoker takes what was a bold and shocking topic in his time, and, after a riveting introduction that leaves the reader hoping for more dark excitement, turns it into a wordy, sappy Victorian story of bland idealism in the face of a vague, unworldly evil.Stoker misses many of the fundamentals that provide the backdrop for a true epic. Just what does the Count look like? Where did he come from? What rendered him immortal? None of these topics are addressed in satisfying depth.Stoker's presentation of the various characters' journal entries and personal letters in chronological order holds great potential for providing numerous unique perspectives on the Dracula saga. That potential is wasted, however, as each chapter is written in the same syrupy, grandiose Victorian tone.Stoker has a poor sense of actual human speech, as the lead vampire hunter, a supposedly highly educated and worldly Dutch psychiatrist, nonetheless speaks English sans verb conjugations and tenses. And each male character launches at least once into a page-long homily that professes his undying, holy, chivalrous, and pure (...yawn...) love for the main female character, whom they have all sworn to protect.By the end, I found myself just wishing that Dracula would die already, which he ultimately does, in the most mundane and least surprising way possible. The ending was, in fact, so predicable and so clumsily foreshadowed, that reading the last half of Dracula is really a waste of time."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Since I like very descriptive prose, the details as seen through the eyes, thoughts and emotions of the characters create a suspenseful journey into the world of yesteryear hundreds of years ago. I read some of the critiques by some readers, and whether or not the \\"interpretation or modernization\\" of Bram Stokers original text was altered to their disappointment, that would be sad for they wouldn't enjoy this version.As for me, I am neither a literary genius nor am I a historian so this modernized English version (if that is what the critques say)works fine for me. I would rather comprehend what was being said and let the story tell itself with all the descriptive suspense, action, and lust that appeals to both men, women and anyone else who has always enjoyed a good Dracula \\"story\\". Actually, I don't mean to sound chauvanistic but the first encounter with the first three female vampires was totally and beautifully lustful.I'm not done with this book yet, since I've just begun reading but I look forward to more great reading until the very end.Would I recommend this book for a casual read?

Today's vampire franchises rely on gore, violence, and sex to tell derivative stories, and they miss out on the mystery and creepiness of the original legends. In my estimation, current vampire tales are largely soap-operas for young adults.You'll not find over-the-top Hollywood silliness in this book. What you will read about is a creepy, twisted monster, centuries old and capable of hideous acts.For me, a low-key approach is much more realistic than a double-barreled shotgun blast in the face of the fantastic. Most current vampire stories are hard to believe because every event is so out of proportion with what most people know as real life.

He wasn't the first or even the best (check out Carmilla or Varney), but it was his creation which essentially set the mold for every vampire story to come. From the creepy Transylvania countryside, to gloomy England, the wizened hunter, the helpless damsels, and determined heroes. Stoker's model can be seen in nearly every horror film and book of the last 100 years. Sometimes the language can be a bit stilted for modern readers, even preachy, but the construction is masterful.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"There is much of value in this story: the quaint settings, the historically interesting social interactions, the unraveling mystery, the discovery of horror, and the destruction of evil. The underlying legend is fantastic, but I thought that the awkward language and slow progression of events weighed down the story. There are many conversations between the central characters as they eventually discover who Dracula is and how to destroy him which use over-blown language with the expression of a great deal of \\"despair,\\" \\"agony,\\" and \\"anguish.\\" The central characters have a series of interviews and meetings while Dracula attacks, after which the women are always cold, and exhausted, and languid, and pale. The women are too weak on their own and must suffer the failings of their own pathetic female natures; I grant this presentation is a product of that era but it wears thin. The characters must overcome their ignorance about fighting the evil vampire, but their tribulations, so charmingly conflicted by proper Victorian mores, seem never-ending. The writing picks up at the end, thankfully, as the bad guys are destroyed.

Someone travels to a castle to do business only to get more than he bargained for as the owner of the estate is Count Dracula, a bloodthirsty vampire hungry for Jonathan Harker's blood. The source novel is not the first vampire novel, that would be Lafenu's Carmilla who had a lesbian female vampire. Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula is the closest film adaption to the novel, though in the film his motivation was love and not blood lust. The piece of cheese just about says it all, stay away from this unless you're into gothic novels and are on Welfare. The price is a bargain for such a lush portrayal of 1890s Irish gothic culture.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"+++++(Note: this review is for the book \\"Dracula: 100TH Anniversary Edition\\" published by Signet Classics in 1997.)This particular book has three sections:(1) A half page biography of the author of this novel, Bram Stoker (1847 to 1912).(2) A ten page introduction to this novel by Leonard Wolf.(We are not told who Wolf is.)(3) The actual novel that was first published in 1897.Wolf's introduction is very informative. Generally, Wolf outlines other Gothic novels beginning with the first English Gothic novel published in 1764, then discusses Stoker's novel, and finally ends with a filmography beginning with the first vampire movie in 1922.The actual plot of this novel is simple. Dracula decides to move from Transylvania (where he resides at \\"Castle Dracula\\") to London, England so as to feed on fresh prey. A small group of humans in London learn what he is and decide to destroy him.This novel has eight major characters (of which six are male and two are female). Two of the most interesting are as follows:(1) \\"Count Dracula\\": a Transylvanian vampire who has been feeding off the blood of peasants for centuries. He is the greatest vampire and leader of the undead, who in life had been a man of legend. Now he is a monster with a unique combination of supernatural powers and extraordinary human characteristics that make him a threat to humans everywhere. (Wolf tells us that \\"Dracula\\" means \\"dragon\\" in Romanian.)(2) \\"Dr. Abraham Van Helsing\\": A philosopher and metaphysician and, as well, one of the most advanced scientists of his time. He is the first to discover what Dracula is.There are many minor characters in this novel. The most significant one is \\"R.M. Renfield.\\" He is an inmate at an insane asylum and refers to Dracula as \\"Master.\\"This book is a horror novel overall but constant themes run throughout it. The main ones are as follows:(1) friendship(2) religion (and religious duty)(3) sexuality(4) superstition.The actual writing in this novel is extraordinary. One of my favourite quotations is as follows:\\"When the Count saw my face [which had a fresh cut from shaving], his eyes blazed with a sort of demonic fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads [that] held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.\\"The cover of this particular book is interesting. It shows a picture of Castle Dracula in Transylvania. It is the Count's home and base of power.Finally, I had two minor problems with this novel:First, there is a chapter where Van Helsing mentions all of Dracula's powers. I found that one important power that's unique to Dracula himself (and unknown to most movie viewers) is not mentioned.Second, I found the conclusion of this novel somewhat weak as compared to its riveting beginning.In conclusion, it's true what the back cover of this particular book states: \\"[This is] a novel of peculiar power, of hypnotic fascination. The reader is warned that he [or she] who enters Castle Dracula may not escape its...spell, even when he [or she] closes this book.\\" Be sure to read this book to learn the true story of the leader of the undead!!(first published 1897; this particular book published 1997; biography; introduction; 27 chapters; actual story 370 pages)+++++"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"...of those first Victorian readers who were unacquainted with all the modern monsters and special effects. The idea of the eternal vampire is an old one from Eastern Europe (originally from Egypt) and the joining of an actual person (Vlad the Impaler) with the legend set the stage for all that was to follow.This book is in the form of a diary, surely one of the best mechanisms available when handled adroitly. The slow seduction of Mina by the Count can be interpreted in a number of ways but the best way is left to the imagination. There is always that ageless quandry - does one become a Vampire, lose one's soul, yet gain immortality? Get the book - better than any of the current crop."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"The book is a classic, what more shall I say? However, history has been very kind to Stoker and his magnum opus, and it is not without flaws, although there are little.To begin with, I did not like the format and overall organization of the novel. Much of it, if not all, is layed out in the form of either a diary or correspondence. Secondly, for a sixth grader (my age at the time), a book written ca. 1897 can be very difficult to read, especially a gothic novel such as this. Furthermore, the books length just added to its deteriorated state. It's not just Bram Stoker, either, I had the same problem with the gothic novel classic Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. Ironically, I read them both in the same year.But nevertheless, this book started it all. Without Stoker's real claim-to-fame we wouldn't have any of the vampire horror movies we do today, we wouldn't have the urban legends nor the myths, we would be missing out on so much. And so, that's why I gave the novel a 3/5, because it's a historically significant and enduring work, even though my (and its) age may have been an influence. If you had some of the same problems I had with it, may I suggest going back and re-reading it, you'll probably get a lot more entertainment."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

At first seduced by the Count's gracious manner, he soon discovers he has become a prisoner and begins to see disquieting facets of the Count's daily life. Searching for a way out of the castle one night, he falls under the spell of three wanton female vampires, the Brides of Dracula, but is saved at the last minute by the Count who wants to retain Harker as a friend to teach him about London, where the Count plans to travel among the \\"teeming millions\\". Harker barely escapes from the castle with his life.Not long afterward, a Russian ship runs aground during a fierce tempest, on the shores of Whitby, a coastal town in England. All passengers and crew are dead. A huge dog or wolf is seen running from the ship, which contains nothing but boxes of dirt from Transylvania: Count Dracula, in his animal form, has arrived in England.Soon the Count is menacing Harker's devoted fianc&eacute;e, Wilhemina \\"Mina\\" Murray, and her vivacious friend, Lucy Westenra. Lucy receives three marriage proposals in one day, from Arthur Holmwood (Lord Godalming); an American cowboy, Quincey Morris; and an asylum psychiatrist, Dr. John Seward. There is a notable encounter between Dracula and Seward's patient Renfield, an insane man who means to consume insects, spiders, and birds, and other creatures -- in ascending order of size -- in order to absorb their \\"life force\\". Renfield acts as a kind of motion sensor, detecting the proximity of Dracula and releasing clues accordingly.Lucy begins to waste away suspiciously. All of her suitors fret and Seward calls in his old teacher, Professor Abraham Van Helsing from Amsterdam. Van Helsing immediately determines the cause of Lucy's condition, but refuses to disclose it, knowing that Seward's faith in him will be shaken if he starts spouting off about vampires. Van Helsing tries multiple blood transfusions, but they are clearly losing ground. On a night when Van Helsing must return to Amsterdam (and his message to Seward asking him to watch the Westenra household is accidentally sent to the wrong address), Lucy and her mother are attacked in the night by a wolf. Mrs Westenra, who has a heart condition, dies of fright, and Lucy herself apparently dies soon after.Lucy is buried, but soon afterward the newspapers report a \\"bloofer lady\\" (sometimes explained as \\"beautiful lady\\") stalking children in the night. Van Helsing, knowing that this means Lucy has become a vampire, confides in Seward, Arthur, and Morris. The suitors and Van Helsing track her down, and after a disturbing confrontation between her vampiric self and Arthur, they stake her heart and behead her.Around the same time, Jonathan Harker arrives home from Transylvania (where Mina joined and married him after his escape from the castle); he and Mina also join the coalition, who now turn their attentions to dealing with Dracula himself.After Dracula learns of Van Helsing and the others' plot against him, he takes revenge by visiting -- and biting -- Mina at least three times. Dracula also feeds Mina his blood, creating a mind bond between them, aiming to control her. The only way to forestall this is to kill Dracula first. Mina slowly succumbs to the blood of the vampire that flows through her veins, switching back and forth from a state of consciousness to a state of semi-trance during which she is telepathically connected with Dracula. It is this connection which they start to use to track Dracula's movements.Dracula flees back to his castle in Transylvania, followed by Van Helsing's gang, who manage to track him down just before sundown and kill him by \\"shearing through the kneck\\" and stabbing him in the heart with a bowie knife. Dracula crumbles to dust, his spell is lifted and Mina freed from the marks. Quincey Morris is killed in the final battle, stabbed by gypsies; the survivors return to England.he book closes with a note about Mina's and Jonathan's married life and the birth of their first-born son, whom they name Quincey in remembrance of their American friend....Enjoy...Nigel"},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

The story is told through by different diary and journal entries, newspaper articles, and other notes. What was intriguing was that not once did Dracula show up.

It begins with Jonathan Harker, a real estate agent, visiting a count Dracula in his castle in Transylvania. Dracula wants to buy a property in London (and become a member of London society) but as Harker's diary reveals, something is seriously wrong in the castle. The novel follows Dracula's appearance and exploits in London as he begins to wreak havoc on Harker's fiancee and their friends. They form a kind of coalition to stop him.There is nothing remarkable in the story - it is indistinguishable from a heap of other vampire stories with the elements of stalking, attempts at scientific explanations, beheadings of the vampires, their uncanny strength and ability and so forth. What I think makes this book notable is the writing. It has a classic tone to it but is quite fast-paced, and Stoker also uses several of his characters as narrators making it a fairly multifaceted tale that well captures the helplessness, despair and anger felt by the characters due to the exploits of count Dracula.A great horror novel."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

Based on the bloodthirsty Transylvanian ruler Vlad Tepes, otherwise known as the Impaler because of his practice of impaling enemy prisoners-of-war on stakes, &quot;Dracula&quot; is the tale of an evil count who is a vampire. The story has little to do wuth the historical Vlad, but that makes it no less spine-chilling.This unusual novel is told entirely through diaries and letters of the main characters. Count Dracula buys a property in England through Jonathan Harker. The count seems to have a taste for English ladies' blood, and when he goes after Harker's fiancee Mina, she narrowly escapes, though her friend Lucy was not so lucky. Hunted and on the run, Dracula himself escapes back to Transylvania, hotly pursued by Harker, Professor Van Helsing, and others. This chase and its climax culminates in a thrilling show-down!David Rehakauthor of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I don't know why Amazon has taken this off the listing. This is a very good edition of Dracula. Gorgeous binding, with red gilded pages. It's a beautiful book of a wonderful classic and I hope they realize they made a mistake in removing the listing soon. I bought mine on a few weeks ago and there were NO flaws!After having read the horrible Dracula The Undead by Dacre Stoker and my own mind and soul rebelling against the sparkling angsty fad that is Twilight I have decided to reacquaint myself with a true king of the night. I was not disappointed.This novel is an Epistolary novel. Epistolary style is an artful attempt at realism by making a novel consist entirely of detailed journal entries, letters and fake newspaper clippings. This was a popular style in Victorian England with authors like Robert Louis Stevenson and Bram Stoker. In general if I am reading Victorian literature I usually prefer a straight forward narrative like Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo or Oscar Wilde.People take for granted just how scary Dracula can be simply because our culture is over saturated with almost cartoonish caricatures of him. The poor guy can't even introduce himself with a Romanian accent without us wanting to giggle because of what we associate with him but let's forget the cliches and modern over-saturation for a bit and think of Dracula for who and what he is.Dracula is a pretty scary guy. He does what he likes and to Hell with the consequences. When he talks to Jonathan Harker it's civil but there's the under-current of menace. It's almost like listening to the double talk of a crime boss from The God Father. His wording seems cordial when he tells Harker that he wants him to stay for at least a month to improve his English (even though he already speaks nearly perfect English) but what he's really saying (and what Jonathan is detecting) is 'I'm not letting you leave here. I am going to make you lie to your loved ones about why and there's a very high chance I'm going to kill you.'Dracula has incredible powers and yet, apparently for the fun of it, he climbs along the walls of his castle, up and down, like a spider. Why does he do this? He does not have to do it. Dracula can turn into mist or a bat or a wolf but apparently it amuses himself to scale a wall with the ominous quality of lizard-like motions as if on an unconscious levels he wants to prove how NOT human he is.On his way to England Dracula kills the entire crew of the Demetre. He slaughters them one by one. He can walk about in day (though it leaves him weakened and limited in his powers). He does NOT sparkle. He can turn into a bat, a wolf, or a foul vapor. He can also conjure winds and terrible torrential storms. He's strong as at least ten men and can defy gravity. He has the senses of a wolf and he can move like an animal and can be just as savage. He can enthrall minds and make you forget what he wills you to forget. The films always make it seem like Dracula has a LOT of limitations but if you don't have some garlic, wolfsbane, or sacred object in immediate reach you are utterly helpless!I think reacquainting myself with Dracula was my own mind's way of rebelling against the Twilight fad to remind myself of when vampires were both dangerous, terrifying and sensual at the same time. You can be charming and suave and still pretty damn scary. Stephenie Meyers and a lot of modern writers seem to forget this.I can recall once watching a documentary on the History channel some years ago about the real Dracula castle (I believe it was Bran Castle) and what happened was the villagers complained of strange noises up at the castle so they sent some priests to bless the place (much like in the Hammer horror film Dracula has Risen from the Grave) but as they neared the castle a terrible storm hit and they had to do the blessing from over a thousand feet away. At that moment the door to my apartment creaked open and, though I had not realized I before, I knew, at that very moment, that Dracula was probably the most terrifying fictional monster in existence.Dracula is the only classic monster that can give me nightmares.So if you're into vampires and miss the good old days when they were both seductive AND scary or just feel burnt out from Twilight I strongly, strongly recommend this classic."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Had Stoker set out to make the 'MOVIE OF THE SUMMER' Dracula very well fits I into the blockbustercategory. I knew I always anted to read Dracula, having been a fan of the FF Copala movie since being a kid. At first the journalistic approach to the story kind of kept me away. I thought it would have been confusing, it really isn't. The pacing especially in the first half he book is great, there is alot of tension build up. To be honest the pacing falls off a bit, and the story gets bogged down in the middle, with an unnessasry amount of time spent on Dracaulas first victim. I also found it hard to get through the parts when Stoker writes in the accents of the dialects in and around London. Also when Van Helsing is written, the broken English gets hard to follow sometimes.Over all Dracula is a great read. Stoker writes locations very well, each scene is specific to the mood. I like the location at the end the book.I did find it to be a bit anti climatic, the 7 years after epilogue is satisfying. I read this in and around the late fall and Halloween season, a good time to read this. I think I would have liked more scenes with the count, as for the last 2/3 of the book, he's written about only and has no spoken dialogue at all. Dr Seward is easily my favorite character, and its nice to read Harker as opposed to the 2 dimensional ways he's portrayed film.Dracula is a classic. Worth the read."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

The book itself is to small; yet, thick and hard to hold open when reading. Also, what bothers me even more, the beautiful foil design on the book's cover rubs away onto your hands while you're reading. I'm only a quarter of the way through the book and i'm afraid the pretty design will be completely rubbed off by the time i finish. Now, i have no desire to purchase more in the collection, and am thinking about returning the book if possible.I was so excited about how nice the books looked, but they don't seem to be made for actually handling and reading.

I've never gotten so scared from a book before! It leaves you in complete suspense. I couldn't put it down! I should've read it along time ago!!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula by Bram Stoker is a classic horror book written in 1897. The book was part of a genre called invasion literaturein which monsters tries to take over the United Kingdom.An English solicitor named Jonathan Harker travels from England to meet Count Dracula in his castle in Transylvania to provide legal real estate support. Harker soon discovers he is a prisoner in the castle and noticed Dracula's nocturnal life.Harker barely escapes.Soon after a Russian ship runs aground in Whitby, England. All the crew are missing, only the body of the captain is found. In the captain's log there are tales of strange events which took place during the journey, leading to the crew's disappearance.A large dog is seen jumping a shore.Later in England, Harker's finacee Mina Murray and her friend Lucy Westenra are being tracked by Dracula. One of Lucy's friends, Dr. Seward, is taking care of an insane man named Renfield who eats insects, birds and spiders to absorb their life force.Unfortunately Lucy starts to waste away and Dr. Seward calls his old teacher Professor Abraham Van Helsing from Holland. Van Helsing recognizes Lucy's illness but refuses to specify because he is afraid Seward will not believe his stories of vampires.The doctors lose the fight and Lucy dies. Soon after, reports of children being stalked by a beautiful lady at night are being talked about. Van Helsing knows Lucy became a vampire. Together with Lucy's suitors, Van Helsing tracks her and kills her.Mina and Jonathan get married but Dracula learns of Van Helsing's plot and takes revenge by feeding from Mina and making her drink his blood creating a spiritual bond. The group knows that the only way to save Lucy is to kill the Count.Dracula flees back to Transylvania, pursued by Van Helsing and his group who are aided by Mina. Van Helsing goes to the Count's castle and kills his brides. The rest of the group attacks the castle at sundown and kills the Count.At first I didn't think I'd like Dracula by Bram Stoker and I'm surprised at how much I did like it. The novel is composed of letters, journals, newspapers articles, telegrams and a chilling ship log.The story is told through alternating view points, the only person who knows the whole story is Van Helsing - and that includes the reader. At the end of the novel you still don't know if you missed something or if Stoker purposely left something out. While I can certainly see how that would bother people, personally I thought that was part of the genius of the book.I was surprised at the many themes the novel touched, from sexual conventions, to immigration and from culture to colonialism and, of course, good vs. evil. The novel is extremely atmospheric as one would expect.The role of Mina Harker was surprising at most, especially considering this is a Victorian novel. While virtue and innocence are unabashingly hailed, Mina assumes the role of a pious woman yet rise above her prescribed roles in society to become a partner with the men hunting the monster.Yet my biggest surprise was Dracula. For being the title character he is found very little in the novel, yet his presence is on every page. How Stoker managed to accomplish that is a mystery and is simply nothing but astonishing. The Count is a strong character, he doesn't give up, he doesn't want to be understood or forgiven. The Count will destroy you unless you destroy him first.Intelligent, well crafted and well written, the book reads as if it was written yesterday. It is just as relevant today as it was in Victorian times."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula is such a popular novel that the ideas Bram Stoker created have been used to create countless other stories over the years. This fact alone makes it a great work, but it stands the test of time. In spite of the many literary and film mutations, Dracula has not lost its edge, and some of the brilliant ideas have not been carried from story to story, making this work still shocking after all of these years. It is remarkably suspenseful and scary, and well thought-out. Stoker makes the vampire completely realistic. His other characters are fleshed out completely, so we root for them against this compelling but evil demon.Stoker uses the diary format to bring the story to life and make readers feel as if they are living the events with the narrator. This book starts with the tale of Jonathan Harker, the man who visits Count Dracula's castle in Transylvania on business. He begins his journey excited about traveling to a foreign country, and Dracula's hospitality makes him comfortable in a castle which he later realizes is more like a prison. From here, Stoker takes us to England where Harker inadvertently aids Dracula in invading. He plagues the city, especially Harker's fiancee, her friend Lucy, and Lucy's potential husbands.Much has been made of the sexual implications of this novel, and although it is impossible to deny the fact that Dracula only targets women as victims, and that the female vampires use the temptation of a kiss to lure their male victims, this theme is not overt, and it is not essential to the entertainment value of this book."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Like my Alice's adventure in wonderland review, this book review was also initiated by my school program. I began to read the book as an assignment when it was first given to me, but after a while, it became a part of my enjoyable daily activities. The book may not be short, but when you enjoy it, every chapter is, and it is quite satisfying.The main story is all about the vampires. Although there are some love stories in there and some thrilling track downs, it is all a way to emphasize and reveal the un-dead. In the book there are total of 4 frequent perspectives you may encounter, and those are: Jonathon's, Mina's, Lucy's, and Dr. Seward's. The book is written in a so-called epistolary style: it is a series or letters, notes, messages and diary & journal, mostly by the characters I mentioned above. Writing the book like that automatically enables the abilities to swiftly change from one perspective to other, even the smooth scene overlaps, and that is exactly what the author did.The storyline starts with Jonathon paying a business visit to Count Dracula, and eventually getting trapped in his castle by our vampire. While his doom approaches, the scene overlaps to Lucy and Jonathon's love, Mina. Dracula moves into London at that point and begins to suck Lucy's blood. As Lucy dies, Dr. Seward and few more people are introduced to fight over Lucy from the death. They fail and have to horribly end Lucy's undead life, and begin to take interest in vampires. After that, they unite with Jonathon, who miraculously survived, and track down the vampire who has begun to suck Mina too, and blah, blah, blah....The story does end with all the vampires being eliminated and Mina surviving, so it is a happy ending for everybody who is not dead.To end this nice and good book, I think I will give you my school project which was a found poem. It is about Jonathon being trapped in the castle. Enjoy!Such a beautiful place, indeed the castle was.But explored further, it was not.Doors after doors, all bolted and locked,In no place save from windows on the walls,Is there an available exit.The sensation of being held captive is overwhelming,A wild beast possessing me.Rushing up and down the stairs,Trying every door, and peering out the window,Behaving like a rat in a trap.The conviction had come to me,That I was helpless as I can be.I sat down quietly as I have done anything in my life,Beginning to think over what was the best to be done.Though I am thinking still,No definite conclusion was drawn."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This review contains mild spoilers.Dracula is a book that's all about mood and suspense. The gloomy castles, foggy nights, and dark graveyards set the scene for a creepy tale of evil and bloodsucking. Rather than having lots of action scenes, Dracula is focused more on suspense and psychological creepiness. Told in sets of alternating diary entries from the perspective of many different characters, the plot is revealed slowly from the revelations of each person's experience. While this means that the reader gets to understand what each character thinks and feels first hand, it also means that everything is told after the fact, rather than experienced as it happens. This, at least to me, lessened the excitement and made it a little more boring. The focus on each character's feelings and psychological angst reminded me a lot of Frankenstein, which was a novel of ideas and feelings more than action. Dracula had more action than Frankenstein, and despite the fact that the action was told rather than shown, the book managed to be interesting enough that I actively wanted to finish it. If you want to read an interesting classic, you could do much worse than Dracula.Now, while I like the style of Dracula, there were some thematic elements that bothered me a bit. Now even though it was published in 1897, the treatment of gender and sexuality in this book are still extremely conservative. I definitely haven't been the first one to point this out, but the characters in this book are downright sexist, and the entire book is basically a metaphor for the evils of sexuality. Don't believe me? Dracula bites only women, and the undead women are described as luscious, red-lipped, voluptuous, dark, and basically incredibly sexy.\\"There was a deliberate voluptuousness that was both thrilling and repulsive. And as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal till I could see in the moonlight the moisture. Lower and lower went her head. I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited.\\"Did I mention that they also eat babies and tempt men from their wives? Seriously people, if this isn't a metaphor for Stoker's fear of female sexuality, I don't know what is. Meanwhile, Mina Harker is described as virtuous, mild, sweet, etc on pretty much every page.\\"She is one of God's women fashioned by His own hand to show us men and other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its light can be here on earth.\\"Speaking of Mina, I was outraged at the way the men in the book treated her. She proved to be incredibly useful and capable, taking care of her husband, bringing people together, and transcribing their diaries so that they could get the entire story. And how do the men thank her? They keep her out of their plans, telling her that her female brain is too delicate to handle it.\\"Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams.\\"And of course Mina, being the meek and virtuous woman that she is, follows their directions. After all, how can the men go about their business if they are busy worrying about her and her lady-nerves? Goodness Mina, why don't you stay in the kitchen where you belong? And while Mina does become important to the rest of the plot, she is held up as the sweet and light moral center of the story and she still needs to be protected at all times by the manly men, which gets pretty patronizing and annoying after a while.Anyway, what I'm trying to say here is that while Dracula is exciting and suspenseful, it still has a lot of problems. Would I suggest reading it? Yeah. It's a classic. With vampires these days being all about teenage angst and glitter, it's nice to see where our modern vampires really came from. Still, you should notice the not-so-savory parts of the narrative and call them what they are. To do otherwise would be to ignore a large and important thematic part of the novel. So yeah, read Dracula, cringe at the misogynistic parts, and try to enjoy the ride. It really is an interesting, if sometimes maddening, book.Rating: recommendedNote: Since Dracula is in the public domain, I downloaded and read this book for free on my kindle.

But he managed to craft the ultimate vampire novel, which has spawned countless movies, spinoffs, and books that follow the blueprint of the Transylvanian count. Eerie, horrifying and genuinely mysterious, \\"Dracula\\" is undoubtedly the most striking and unique vampire novel yet penned.Real estate agent Jonathan Harker arrives in Transylvania, to arrange a London house sale to Count Dracula. But as the days go by, Harker witnesses increasingly horrific events, leading him to believe that Dracula is not actually human. His fiancee Mina arrives in Transylvania, and finds that he has been feverish. Meanwhile the count has vanished -- along with countless boxes filled with dirt.And soon afterwards, strange things happen: a ship piloted by a dead man crashes on the shore, after a mysterious thing killed the crew. A lunatic talks about \\"Him\\" coming. And Mina's pal Lucy dies of mysterious blood loss, only to come back as an undead seductress. Dracula has arrived in England -- then the center of the Western world -- and intends to make it his own...\\"Dracula\\" is the grandaddy of Lestat and other elegantly alluring bloodsuckers, but that isn't the sole reason why this novel is a classic. It's also incredibly atmospheric, and very well-written. Not only is it very freaky, in an ornate Victorian style, but it is also full of restrained, quiet horror and creepy eroticism. What's more, it's shaped the portrayal of vampires in movies and books, even to this day.Despite already knowing what's going on for the first half of the book, it's actually kind of creepy to see these people whose lives are being disrupted by Dracula, but don't know about vampires. It's a bit tempting to yell \\"It's a vampire, you idiots!\\" every now and then, but you can't really blame them. Then the second half kicks in, with accented professor Van Helsing taking our heroes on a quest to save Mina from Dracula.And along the way, while our heroes try to figure stuff out, Stoker spins up all these creepy hints of Dracula's arrival. Though he wrote in the late 19th-century manner, very verbose and a bit stuffy, his skill shines through. The book is crammed with intense, evocative language, with moments like Dracula creeping down a wall, or the dead captain found tied to the wheel. Once read, they stick in your mind throughout the book.It's also a credit to Stoker that he keeps his characters from seeming like idiots or freaks, which they could have easily seemed like. Instead, he puts little moments of humanity in them, like Van Helsing admitting that his wife is in an asylum. Even the letters and diaries are written in different styles; for example, Seward's is restrained and analytical, while Mina's is exuberant and bright.Even Dracula himself is an overpowering presence despite his small amount of actual screen time, and not just as a vampire -- Stoker presents him as passionate, intense, malignant, and probably the smartest person in the entire book. If Van Helsing hadn't thwarted him, he probably would have taken over the world -- not the Victorian audience's ideal ending.Intelligent, frightening and very well-written, \\"Dracula\\" is the well-deserved godfather of all modern vampire books and movies -- and its unique villain still dwarfs the more recent undead."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

After watching several Drac movies and a few Nosferatu's, I pretty much though I had a handle on the genera. Little did I know what a wonderful world of mystery and suspense that Bram Stoker opened up for me.The story is told mostly third party though the papers, diaries, and phonograph recordings (on wax cylinders) of those people involve in a tale so bizarre that it almost defies belief. The general story line is that of a Count that plans to move to a more urban setting (from Borgo Pass to London) where there is a richer diet. There he finds succulent women; something he can sing his teeth in. Unfortunately for him a gang of ruffians (including a real-estate agent, asylum director, Texas cowboy and an Old Dutch abnormal psychologist) is out to detour his nocturnal munching. They think they have Drac on the run but with a wing and a prayer he is always one step ahead.Of more value to the reader is the rich prose chosen by Stoker as he describes the morals and technology of the time. We have to come to grips with or decide if we can perform the rituals that are required to eliminate vampires verses the impropriety of opening graves and staking loved ones. The powers in the book differ from the movie versions in that they are more of persuasion and capabilities to manipulate the local weather. At one point the Dutch Dr. Van Helsing, is so overwhelmed by a beautiful vampire laying in the grave that he almost for gets why he is there and may become vamp chow.All in all the story is more in the cunning chase. And the question as to will they succeed or will Dracula triumph. Remember \\"For the dead travel fast.\\"Dracula"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

It is through this uniquely written book that I was acquainted with the true character of Dracula. None of the movies did the novel any justice until the modern version which followed the book quite well. I loved the idea of writing nearly the entire piece as a journal. This is a true classic tale of horror. I read Dracula sometime during highschool when classes were cancelled for a week and I thoroughly enjoyed every page.

If you've never read it (but perhaps seen one of countless movies -- all inferior), the plot you may *think* you know has in fact many unique twists and turns. And the whole thing builds so slowly, so eerily, that by the end you're practically ready to scream out loud. This *is* a 19th Century book, however, and you have to give it time. On page 20 or so you may be wondering where it's all going -- hang in there. By page 50 you'll be hooked.

I finished this book in fifth grade but still enjoy remembering what happened now. If you don't mind reading longer books, this is definitely a book for you. I really liked the way Stoker pieced everthing together. It got confusing at some parts, but for me that actually made the story even better because I would not know what was going to happen until it happened. There are some mystery or horror stories where you can figure out what is going to happen 10 chapters before it actually does. I would not put Stoker's Dracula in this category. I loved the way I could read a few chapters, then put the book down and think about everything I had just read without getting bored with the book. If my mom asked me to do something, I could put down Dracula and go around doing chores and thinking about what was happening in the story. I have not found many books where I can do this, so Dracula is really something special that I believe any reader will enjoy."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"From the past to the present, there has never been (and never shall be again) a novel of such description and definition of the Vampire as described by Bram Stoker. His depiction of the 'Man Himself' paints a picture of total evil, and he is likewise able to describe and form completely different and original characters, in Jonathan Harker, Jack Seward, Lord Godalming, Quincey Morris, Mina Harker, Lucy Westenra, and the powerful Van Helsing. Through these characters' eyes the story it told, vividly and with a sense of hurriedness that will draw you in and keep you through the novel, and through the method of 'journals' these characters come to life in a way that would not be possible otherwise. Truly, the movie did not hold a candle to the novel, and was not even accurate in many points (very different in many cases), so if you want to read the accurate and original tale, the powerful and spinechilling-read Dracula."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

And if I, at age 11, could easily read a book written in this Victorian style, it should certainly not be too hard for the one negative critic of the book.

This is truly optimized for the Kindle as it looks very natural, and the price can't be beat."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker was born in Dublin in 1847 and studied Pure Mathematics at Trinity College Dublin. He developed a passion for the theatre while at university and, on graduation, spent seven years in the Irish Civil Service. He then became business manager at London's Lyceum Theatre in 1878 and married Florence Balcombe the same year - beating, would you believe, Oscar Wilde to her hand in marraige. Stoker is obviously best known for 'Dracula', which was first published in 1897.Dracula is a little different to the standard novel - it's a collection of journal entries, letters and the occasional newspaper article. (It may sound strange, but it works very well). The book kicks off with the journal entries of a recently qualified solicitor, Jonathan Harker, on his was to Transylvania - a region in the Carpathian Mountains . Harker's firm had been employed by a local nbleman called Count Dracula to oversee the purchase of an old estate in England . The firm have settled on an estate called Carfax, at Purfleet, and Harker is travelling to tidy up the final details with the Count. He doesn't have the easiest of journeys - dreadful trains in Hungary, howling dogs beneath his bedroom window - but, poor chap, things are about to get an awful lot worse. Bistritz is the nearest town to his destination, Castle Dracula...spends the night in an inn there, planning to complete his journey the following day by stagecoach. His landlord won't talk about the Count or his castle - but, just before he leaves, his landlady begs him not to go, (She's especially concerned that it's St George's Eve when - at midnight - \\"all evil things in the world will have full sway\\"). Naturally, he pays no heed - but takes the crucifix she offers him. It's something that - as an \\"English churchman\\" - he's always viewed as \\"idolatrous\\". However, he becomes very attached to it in time.Harker's due to get the coach as far as the Borgo Pass, where Dracula's private coach will then meet him. Despite his coach driver's best efforts - he arrives an hour early, in the hope of taking Harker on to Bukovina - Dracula's coach arrives and Harker makes for the castle. Like the countryside's howling wolves, the driver's glowing red eyes and sharp white teeth aren't too comforting....though the Count's appearance is little better. (Dracula is old, incredibly pale, has set of long white teeth, long fingernails sharpened to a point and a strong handshake that's as cold as ice). Although, initially, very polite Dracula never eats with Harker and effectively bans him from exploring the castle - the majority of its doors remain locked to him. Furniture in the castle is very expensive and in excellent condition...though, strangely, there's no sign of either servants or mirrors. Harker later starts to understand what he's got himself into - thanks, in part, to an accident with a razor blade and a shaving mirror. By then, the castle has become a prison and he knows why the locals spoke of Hell, Satan and vampires when he was leaving the inn.Harker spends longer at the castle than he had planned, or wanted to - and the action shifts to England when Dracula leaves home - alone. The story is then picked up by Harker's fiancee, Mina - through her own journal and the letters she was writing to her friend, Lucy Westenra. The pair spend quite some time together in Whitby ...which, unfortunately, is exactly where Dracula's boat comes into dock. (Worse - ever the ladies' man - Dracula isn't long in making a move). Lucy has recently become engaged to the Hon Arthur Holmwood, the only son of Lord Godalming. (She had turned down Dr Seward - who has his own asylum - and an American gentleman called Quincey Morris the same afternoon Arthur had proposed. Marraige propposals were obviously a bit like buses in those days - you wait years for one and then three turn up at once). Seward's journal entries add quite a bit to the book, and his request for help from his old teacher, Professor Van Helsing, is very significant.The book isn't always overtly scary, though there is plenty of mystery and intrigue. Several 'obvious' clues - like the presence of a bat, or the puncture wounds on someone's neck - are repeatedly ignored. (Only Van Helsing has any idea what they're dealing with...and it's quite a while before the key players are able to get together and pool their information). It's very descriptive, and conjures up some great images - for example, Dracula's home in Transylvania was a \\"vast, ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.\\" However, after he leaves Transylvania, Dracula only ever makes fleeting appearances and the book does, occasionally, throw out a line you just have to laugh at. (The book has barely started before the gentlemanly Harker comments : \\"the women looked pretty, except when you got near them\\"). Still, the book is a classic, and - having defined the whole vampire genre - is one of those titles you just have to read."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"It's funny how you can know a story without ever reading it... and how it can surprise you once you do read it, even though you know what's going to happen.What I found most interesting was how much different it was from what I'd expected, and from the movies I've seen based on it over the years. Renfield, for example, was vastly more interesting than I've seen him in movies. He doesn't just sit there and moan for his Master. There's a method to his (literal) madness. And Van Helsing fails almost entirely to resemble Hugh Jackman in any way--a fact which I found terribly disappointing.And those three brides? Barely in the book at all.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise was Mina, and to a lesser extent, Lucy. I'd expected them to be the too-stupid-to-live women of the films. No, I'd expected them to be worse, since it's an old book, and Everyone Knows that women are viewed more equally nowadays, right? Not so. Lucy wasn't an idiot--she was seduced and controlled, yes, but it wasn't due to her flightiness, nor was she especially susceptible.Mina, though... I love Mina. She's a strong, intelligent character, and the men learn their lesson about trying to keep things from her to protect her when keeping her out of the loop puts them all in danger. From then on, she's a fairly equal partner in the fight, and she comes up with her share of the plans, and risks herself as fully as any of the men.So why was this strong, equal heroine acceptable in 1897, but not in 1931, 1958, 1979, or 1992? I know there are other versions--those are just the ones I'm sure I've seen."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I read Dracula to get into the \\"Halloween spirit\\" if you will. My father read this to me when I was quite young (I had an odd childhood) and I had only vague recollections of the novel which were somewhat tainted by the movie starring Bela Lugosi. Bram Stoker's Dracula is different... mustached, for one, with hair growing on his palms.Stoker tells the story through his character's journals and letters. The beginning, told through the voice of imprisoned Jonathan Harker, is by far the most exciting part of the novel. We are later introduced to other characters: the flighty yet virtuous Lucy and her many suitors, Jonathan Harker's fiance, the emboldened and wise Mina, and of course Van Helsing, the original vampire slayer. Dracula's pursuit of Lucy is also riveting, but after the characters finally catch on to Dracua's game, the ending is drawn out and the story becomes wearisome, as do the men's ferventl protection of their women's honor. Feminists, you may feel nautious. After the first section, we see very little of the most interesting title character, and are instead subjected to lectures from the verbose Van Helsing.Dracula is truly a Victorian novel told by an author whose ideal virginal woman is threatened by the bloodthirsty vampire. Similar to Frankenstein, a novel that cautions against scientific advances, Dracula cautions against seemingly immoral social changes. Count Dracula is supposed to be a despicable monster, yet recent adaptations of the story have turned him into a sympathetic character. (There is absolutely no mention in the book of Dracula's love affair with a woman who looks like Mina. There is no mention of Dracula ever having loved anyone.) I have a feeling Stoker would be disappointed, but not surprised.All of these many years later, I found parts of the story disturbing even for the 21st century: especially the sacks Dracula brings his brides...A classic worth reading!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula by Bram StokerDracula is one of the most popular horror stories ever written. Great ebook!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I've always been a fan of stories in which good and evil are pitted against each other, with humans caught in between. This theme is universal, though often repetitive, even preachy, in nature. In reading Stoker's \\"Dracula,\\" I was surprised to find one of the modern forerunners for this type of gothic struggle. Sure, it has blo od-sucking and violence. Sure, it carries slightly ero tic undertones. But the story is first and foremost a spiritual battle, with humans as victims and/or heroes of war.Jonathan Harker is a London solicitor sent on business to Transylvania. He is a guest of his client, Count Dracula. Soon, though, Harker realizes he is a prisoner. And the battle begins.Back in England, a ship arrives in grim style on the waves of a storm. A sweet young woman becomes a victim of Dracula's schemes. And Harker's fiancee finds herself caught up in an epic struggle for the lives of those around her. Drawn into the struggle as the standard-bearer, Professor Van Helsing leads a band of intrepid humans against this otherworldy evil.Stoker's book is tame by today's standards, even quaint, but his attention to dark and gloomy atmosphere, provides a perfect counterpoint for the shining, valiant hearts of his band of heroes. In his day, Stoker's story must've been fast-paced, nail-biting, and horrific. Today, it stands as a muted masterpiece of horror, showing that we don't need lots of blo od-and-guts to keep us intrigued. Using religious references and decisions of personal integrity, \\"Dracula\\" shows us a battle against evil that still wages. In that sense, it's as current and apropos as ever."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stroker's Dracula is a horror classic, indeed.The story is told in a variety of different journal entries, phonographs, and newspaper clippings. This, I found, to be the best part of the book; I enjoyed reading the story from the different perspectives Bram gave us. The characters are interesting and very engaging; Lucy and Mina are probably two of my favorite female characters. When lucy met her tragic end, I was sad to see her go, but was relived by the idea that at least her soul was free from that abominable virus.There are a few parts in the book that will definitely make you shudder while you enjoy it. It is not all lurid deaths and action, of course, there are quite a few parts when it feels a bit dragging, I thought (especially Van Helsing's lectures). Notwithstanding, the virtues outshine the minor flaws, and the book is an great experiece that should be read by posterity for many years to come."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I'm not Goth, so I approached this book with some fear and trembling. I definitely did not want a gore fest, bored nihilism, or mere milieu. I was quite surprised with the book. It reads more like a detective novel, akin to Kolchak or the X-files.What makes this book interesting is the format. The chapters are really selections from journal and news clippings. Thus, the book is written in the first person, which always enhances believability. However, Stoker takes it to the next level as we read the journals of the several characters. We see events through the eyes of Harker, Mina, Dr. Seward and, of course, Van Helsing. Part of the fun (and occasionally the fatigue) is trying to connect the events into a synthetic whole. As a historian, this is my bread and butter.Stoker is also a master of setting. As Harker approaches Castle Dracula, You can feel the air and smell the fear. The wonderful images from \\"Nosferatu\\" glimmered before my minds eye. Another powerful aspect is the religious setting, which was abandoned in the \\"Blade\\" movies. Not only do you fight Drac with garlic and a cross, but communion wafers are also powerful weapons. They are used to sterilize the dirt in Drac's coffins, and as part of magic circles.Probably the most surprising thing was to see how the character of Dracula has been amended and substantially weakened in his various translations. In this book (in the very windy expository passages from Van Helsing), we lean that Dracula can change himself into a bat, a wolf, or even dust, mist or a moonbeam. He also has a limited weather control.In this sense, the story is unbalanced-\\"Bambi Versus Godzilla.\\" We have a crowd of dense mortals going up against this powerful demon. I felt fearful, and wanted Doc Savage or Sherlock Holmes to step in and rescue them, since they were quite slow on the uptake. However, this just added to the story's tension.The book has three weaknesses. Dracula's characterization is flat. He seems to be more like a force of nature than a menace, which blunts the horror. It feels more like London's \\"To Star A Fire\\" than Starling going up against Hannibal Lector. There is a sense of danger, but no sense of psychological engagement. Although he gave the heroes a run for their money, Drac is wily, but not intelligent.The second is the repetition. The multiple visits to Lucy's crypt and the three blood transfusions could have been eliminated with no loss to the story and a great gain to the pacing. Eliminating the deadwood frees up the mind of reader to piece the story together form the various journals. That is why \\"Man of La Mancha\\" has been seen more times than \\"Don Quixote\\" has been read.The third is the crowd. Too many useless characters clutter the plot. Arthur, Quincy, and Renfield are props, and Lucy's thread could be eliminated, sine we have the same idea with Mina's transformation.There is a fourth flaw, but this is really a quibble. Drac is dusted on November 6th. It would have been more appropriate-and I was expecting-for him to be killed on Halloween.Excusing these three flaws and one quibble, this book is truly a classic and a masterpiece of the horror genre. It is a great Jack-o-Lantern stuffer."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I'll start by saying I'm not under 13 I didn't want to deal with signing up and stuff. Ok so anyway, this book is amazing. I am really into classics and discovering the origins of overused (now) stereotypes and cliches. In this book you learn all about how it began...and I'll tell you it began very well.The book is written through a series of journal entries, which are rivetting, but a little unrealistic. You never do see a different person's perspective on the same moment. I'm sure after the Death of Dracula all of the characters (who become fairly well developed) would have rushed to their little journals and wanted to account for the exhilerating (eh kinda) moment for themselves. But everything is used to move the story along...I think the first 100 pages or so of this book are some of the most engaging words strung together ever. I started the book at about 1 in the morning and thought I'd just read a page to get a taste, but really it got me hooked. The rest of the book is very good, but nothing compares to Jonathan freaking out in the Count's castle. I think the Count in the beginning of the novel is spellbinding...every paragraph giving either description or just when Jonathan is in his presence, is amazing. Too bad barely any conversing takes place again with this intruiging character.There are several slip ups in the novel, unfortunately. I'd like the book to be perfect, but it's not. I give 5 stars because the entertainment value of the book is 5 star-worthy. The characters are mostly just stupid and take forever to get things, and the chemistry between them all is uneven, and in the end Dracula is not the badass he was in the beginning.OK I am bashing this book too much so it seems I don't like it, but really if you pick it up you wont put it down until you're done. After you finish reading it you will forgive Stoker for some portions of unrealism just because those little things don't matter in the end (except his death!

Now, I try to read these classics naively and on their own merits, and I must say that this is one of the more disappointing experiences I have had. This is a matter of taste, but I would warn readers that they may find it similarly, well, bad.Not recommended."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I have to qualify my review first, by saying that (a) I'm not a big fan of horror, and (b) it's been a while since I read this book. However, what I remember most from this book, is how utterly boring most of it was. And to give myself a bit of cred, let me also say that I've read and loved many classic books, including quite a few wonderful Victorian novels, and am generally a patient reader. No, this one, IMO of course, is simply a dud.For one, it's simply not scary. Maybe at the time it was. For contemporary readers, unfamiliar with the legend and cultural context of Dracula and vampires in general, I could see how there could be some mystery and fear. But for 21st-century readers, who are inundated with vampire references and other cultural products of horror, there is simply not enough here to generate a blip on our mental radar. It's too slow. It's too predictable. It never gets close to shocking or scaring.More generally, this book is a very typical product of the Victorian era, and unfortunately mostly in the bad sense of the word. The characters are mostly - as many have remarked - cardboard-thin; almost all of them are either all-good or all-evil. Long, verbose dialogs are used to describe events, and the book is rife with repetitive descriptions.Finally, here's the clincher, for me: I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters. To me, that is a death sentence for a book. If I don't care about the characters, why should I care about the story? And I don't even mean care _for_ a character: I wouldn't mind having one I could hate, or at least dislike with a passion. Nothing. No emotional reaction at all. I cared more about Humbert Humbert than about Mina, or Lucy, or any of the sketch-like male characters in Dracula. Maybe if Dracula himself was more than a sketch it would give the book a bit more depth, but he isn't.All in all, just a drab, boring, slow-moving, disappointing read."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"Surprisingly \\"Denn die Toten reiten schnell\\" or \\"For the dead travel fast\\" is more than an opening line to this tale of love in the dangerous moon light. After watching several Drac movies and a few Nosferatu's, I pretty much though I had a handle on the genera. Little did I know what a wonderful world of mystery and suspense that Bram Stoker opened up for me.The story is told mostly third party though the papers, diaries, and phonograph recordings (on wax cylinders) of those people involve in a tale so bizarre that it almost defies belief. The general story line is that of a Count that plans to move to a more urban setting (from Borgo Pass to London) where there is a richer diet. There he finds succulent women; something he can sing his teeth in. Unfortunately for him a gang of ruffians (including a real-estate agent, asylum director, Texas cowboy and an Old Dutch abnormal psychologist) is out to detour his nocturnal munching. They think they have Drac on the run but with a wing and a prayer he is always one step ahead.Of more value to the reader is the rich prose chosen by Stoker as he describes the morals and technology of the time. We have to come to grips with or decide if we can perform the rituals that are required to eliminate vampires verses the impropriety of opening graves and staking loved ones. The powers in the book differ from the movie versions in that they are more of persuasion and capabilities to manipulate the local weather. At one point the Dutch Dr. Van Helsing, is so overwhelmed by a beautiful vampire laying in the grave that he almost for gets why he is there and may become vamp chow.All in all the story is more in the cunning chase. And the question as to will they succeed or will Dracula triumph. Remember \\"For the dead travel fast.\\"Dracula"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I found that if I put aside all of my preconceived notions of vampires, movies, etc from pop culture, and took this book on its own terms, it was great.

Yes, the scare factor is high enough to give a few shivers (and that is plenty good enough for me) but it's not terrifying or gory. What makes it scary is the creepiness. Also, the story is written through a collection of letters, notes, and the like by various characters. This style of writing makes the story considerably more intriguing. All in all I recommend the book to anyone."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This is one of those books I'd always meant to read...yet it seemed a little daunting in size, if not language. But now that it's available free on iPad (thanks Kindle), and winter storms have arrived DownUnder, it seemed like the perfect time to curl up with an eerie classic.Now I've just turned the last page, and as my heart-rate returns to less alarming levels, I feel I must write this unreserved recommendation. This book is a great, thrilling read. The language isn't too challenging, it's easy to adjust to the tempo, and the narrative quickly absorbed me.At times I was reminded of another of my favorite classics, Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White, partly due to the device of the narrative being an assemblage of diary entries, also the way our attention is captured and held as the 'plot thickens' and suspense mounts.Funnily enough, I'm not into the current vampire mania, but if you are, this is probably a great foundation."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"It is staggering to think of how many books and literary careers are rooted in the original publication of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Far from a perfect novel, it is a classic in the horror genre and is still capable of frightening unsuspecting victims today.The text is composed of a series of journals. Credit for pasting these journals together in this fictional account is not given. Jonathan Harker's journal through his original visit to Dracula'a castle begins the book. After this initial sequence the serialization comes from several voices including Dr. Van Helsing, John Seward, and Arthur Godalming. The female victims, Lucy Westerna and Mina Murray-Harker, also act as voices, though of varying quality.The overall plot is generally well-known, though the actual sequence of events may not be known. By contemporary standards, the plot does move somewhat slow. This is not a blockbuster of non-stop action. Many of the pages are in place to establish the conflicts that occur. The only complaint one could given in this is that the ending seemed rush. One may find themselves reading over the last few ages to ascertain understanding.Dracula is not a diffcult read. With the recent craze of vampire books and movies, it is a book many should read as it is a standard bearer in the genre. For many, it will be interesting to read how corrpted the original Dracula plot has become in contemporary pop culture. In itself, this is a learning experience."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Much to my surprise Dracula delivers on the creeps and holds up very well for the modern reader. Back in 1897 it must have really scared the pants off people even though they had to trudge through some of the endless dialogue of people congratulating themselves (how do they remember so much from a conversation and write it down word for word).The first third of the book, when Jonathan Harker travels to and stays in Dracula's castle, did deliver a good creepy mood and some genuine scares that flirted with disturbing.The wonderful descriptions of the countryside, the people met, and the eventual ascent to Dracula's castle were so effective at setting a mysterious mood that the reader is very concerned for Jonathan well before he even meets the count. Once the count appears the fun at the castle really starts.The second part of the book introduces us to Lucy Westenra and the cast of characters that will lead us through the rest of our journey. The scares are toned way down during this section. However, the transformation of Lucy is not without its subtlety frightening moments and we learn the original \\"rules\\" for vampires. It was interesting to read from the source about the power and limitations of vampires that is now ingrained in folk lore. Although we meet wonderful characters like Renfield, Van Helsing, and Mina, this part of the novel seemed to drag with endless talk among the characters about how smart, brave and loving they are. This self-congratulatory theme continued throughout the book and grated upon me at times. I chalked it up to mannerisms and the style of the times when Dracula was written and tried to ignore it.The last third is an all out hunt and adventure story. Mood, so well set in the first third of the book, is all but thrown out the window by this point as Bram Stoker takes you on a journey of death and redemption. Bram Stoker keeps the action moving which is a good thing because I felt this was the weakest section of the story.All in all I really enjoyed reading \\"Dracula\\" as a good scary story and a foundation to many stories that came after."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"The book Dracula is nothing like any of the movies or TV shows that try to depict him. There are no capes, unnaturally pointed faces or strangely coiffed hair, and no one ever says, \\"I vant to suck your blood!\\" Dracula is actually a fairly handsome gentleman with good manners (to a point) that does everything he can to appear as a normal human being: fashionable mode of dress, normal hair, polite conversation and if he is a little pale and his teeth just the slightly bit pointed, what of it? His good manners extend even to the point of entertaining his guests with jokes and stories that keep them laughing and listening well into the small hours of the morning. To his advantage.If you take everything you ever heard or have seen about Dracula from modern media and toss it aside, the book Dracula is actually a fairly creepy tome in it's own right, and with it's own unique nature actually can be construed as even scarier. The best of the technology they had on hand seemed to do nothing to stop him and old wives tales and primitive treatments were their only protection in a war that no respectable person would have believed they were fighting. The insane that did believe them had their own ends for their belief, and I believe the lunatic in the novel was one of the freakiest literary characters I've ever come across, Dracula and his brides not withstanding. This was one of the original horror novels, upon which all others are today based.One of the things I found frustrating about the novel was the amount of sexism in it. It was accurate and fully expected of the times, but the number of times they discounted or tried to protect women (and only managed to succeed in getting them killed or worse) drove me up a wall. The women were not helpless by any stretch of the imagination and, in their enforced cluelessness, managed to prove that by causing a whole lot of trouble that could have easily been prevented had they known what was going on. When they were clued in they proved invaluable assets in the ongoing struggle, but only at the end of all things, and only as an extreme last resort were they permitted to do so.If you enjoy some well written classic horror, then I recommend reading Dracula, with the caveat that you should keep in mind the era it was written in and be prepared to deal with the strictures placed on society back then, and the influence that will have on the story."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"To Stephen King and Dean Koontz, if you ever wonder why the literary world doesn't take your works seriously, even though you two have sold millions of books worldwide, read Bram Stoker's Dracula. That is how you write a horror story -- no time travel, no alternate universe, no alien beings. Dracula is just a suspenseful yarn and filled its readers with creeping dread as the story progresses, and the hunger to learn more. It was great fun reading it."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Everyone, no exception, knows about Dracula. Almost everyone can relate the names Mina, Lucy, and Van Helsing to Dracula. This is the original work where all these characters were created. Basically, the story tells of Dracula (!) who leaves Transylvania for England to find new prey and enter the society of learned men and the modern world.Stoker's narration style is brilliant, told through journal entries, newspaper clippings, and letters. Though it does slow down a bit in the middle, the general pace is fast and the story is action packed. It is perhaps a little predictable, but what do you expect from a story that's been told and retold so many times. The chilling account of Jonathan Harker's adventures in Dracula's Castle is the best part of the story. The dangers he encounters, the dark, dusty rooms and creaking doors, his discovery that he is a prisoner, his attempts to escape and the Count's unvoiced knowledge of Jonathan's distress alone make the whole book worth reading! What I found makes this book truly wonderful is the beautiful use of language in descriptions of the castle, the Transylvaninan landscape, sunsets and sunrises (as it is a vampire story), storms, the moonlight, etc., and this without slowing down the pace.The book does have some very scarry moments, but if you're looking purely for horror, blood, and gore you might not be satisfied. I have read many reviews and many complain that it is dull, not as frightening as the movies, too cliched, etc. Remember that what scared people in the 19th century or early 20th may not scare us today, with all our alien movies and violent video games. But this is the book that started the whole Dracula/Vampire tradition. It is due to the *un-dying* merit of this great work of literature that so many others have borrowed Stoker's ideas, changed, and adapted them. After a century of adaptations, ofcourse the original will be different. You must place the book in the context of its time to judge it fairly. Second, put aside what you already know from movies and other books about Dracula and vampires. When that's done, you'll see it is really a very enjoyable and enlightning read.There is one flaw, however. The characters are too dry. The women are all pure and virtuous and the men all brave and dutiful, and before long they all become one happy family. I know these were Victorian times but I still felt they could have had more depth. In any case, the character of the Count and everything else in the book quite makes up for this downfall, and it is not worth taking away a star.If you are a literary mind, the book has plenty of symbolism, dualism, and other isms to wonder at and analyse. The beauty of prose will add to your pleasure. If you are a Vampires and horror story fanatic, it'll be worth your while to read the original story, but don't expect to be scared out of your wits. In the end, it is at the very least a very enjoyable, thoroughly entertaining and rewarding read for anyone."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"The book that I read on Dracula was the unabridged version and it's not this one. However, I strongly recommend reading Dracula because it really scares you. It is told by a series of notes, journals, diaries, and letters. At first, i thought it was very boring because there's a lot of dialogue and everything is descibed in great detail. Fortunately, that's exactly what kept me hooked on the book. I would not put it down and I would stay up until 1:00 am reading it.So,here's a quick summary. Jonathan Harker travels to Romania to help a strange count buy an estate in Britain. He stays in the count's house only to slowly realize that he was a prisoner. After many horrifing and intimidating experiences as the count's \\"guest\\", he decides to enbark in a daring and frightning escape from the castle, to return to his loving fiancee, Mina. However,when Count Dracula is in the city, Jonathan sets out with a band of brave souls to destroy the evil count. There's a lot more in the story because it's 414 pages long. I really reccomend the book because it's 20 times better than the movie. I really think anyone can give it a try, and even though at first it's boring, you should make an effort to read it to get to the really good parts."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Of the many possible angles from which to respond to the book, two stand out in particular to this reader.Firstly, the style of characterization is quite effective. Stoker uses a classical device of epic fantasy, which is to unite diverse characters in an epic quest of earthshaking importance (Tolkien would use it some years later when he created the Fellowship of the Ring charged with the responsibility of destroying the evil ring). These characters form a band that has a remarkable chemistry and complementarity, especially since the team is made up of some familiar stereotypes. Van Helsing is the prototype strong hero, whose knowledge, charisma and strength of character are the emotional and psychological anchor for the other characters (and the reader) throughout the ordeals of the book. He is the Count's most formidable enemy, and provides unspoken reassurance for a modern audience that science, knowledge, discipline and courage are effective antidotes against fears of the dark and the supernatural.Secondly, the gender relations and sexual themes of Stoker's book are an interesting avenue to explore, having attracted the diverse opinions and guesses of Stoker's literary critics. There are wild theories about Stoker's necrophilia or sexual dysfunctionality which come from overly imaginative readings of his text, but then there is no smoke without fire. There are a few striking features of his portrayal of men and women. The men are always gallant and chivalrous, to the point of unnatural stiffness, and the women almost always virtuous and almost Victorian. However, Dracula and his bloodsucking appetites appear to have a dangerously seductive aspect, and it seems that his female victims cannot resist him. It is particularly disturbing that, as the book nears its ending, one of his victims (Mina Harker, the virtuous wife of Jonathan Harker) seems to feel a strange and intimate emotional connection to the Count, one that transcends her moral judgment and the physical distance between vampire and victim. There is rich material for the Freudian literary critic here.All in all, Dracula is an intriguing story, a product of a dark and brooding imagination which nonetheless maintains a steadfast faith in the power of science, of human courage against adversity, of common love and friendship, of man's unremitting fight against the forces of evil. The moral and theological dualisms constantly suggested throughout the text grip the conscience as well as the imagination."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I harbored more than a little skepticism when entering into this book after being disappointed by another &quot;classic&quot; horror novel--and perhaps the more critically acclaimed one at that--The Turn of the Screw. Screw failed to evoke any facet of terror because it was so deeply enshrouded in a language that naturally dulled the simplicity inherent in fear. Fortunately, Bram Stoker's classic, Dracula does not fall pray to a similarly unfortunate characteristic, and maintains a far more interesting and worthwhile story as well.Perhaps the part of Stoker's novel that cannot be praised enough, is the ubiquitous presence of evil, without it being directly recorded. It becomes almost a crash course in symbolism, to discover the events as they coincide with the gradual effects of Dracula's presence in London. What Stoker does is a lot similar--and far more effective in its respective medium--to what was achieved in the Blair Witch Project. We see subtle effects and character responses that all point to the villain, but the villain is always just beyond reach, never quite tangible, and more the frightening because of it. In this way, the novel instantly propels itself to one of the greatest horror novels of all time. Through thunderstorms, howling wolves, and a host of other events, we are given the hint of our nemesis, without the more vulnerable and less frightening physical individual.Moreover, there are the directly observable effects that come under the futile attention of the main characters. In my opinion, the novel reaches its climax of storytelling with the tale of Lucy Westenra, a purely superb encounter with the gaining effects of vampirism. It is truly the high point in the novel, as the tension rises amongst the characters and the gruesome postmortem effects are so vividly revealed to the reader, implying with more than a little emphasis that the condition can transform even the purest of creatures into a foul monster. It is the most horrifying, most engrossing, most intense, and ultimately most engaging portion of the story, uniting the reader with the urgency of the situation.As Lucy's story seems to be the high point of the novel, there is an unfortunate descension in pace following the cessation of her tale. This is nitpicking at best, but a concern that does--though mildly--affect the novel. A lot--too much--time is spent in preparation of a climax that occurs too quickly, and so the audience is bored by the length of unnecessarily long debate and then disappointed by an abrupt finale. But, recall, this is nitpicking at best.What lies within is one of the greatest--perhaps the greatest--horror novels of all time, and one that has defined the genre for the century since its publication. It should be the basis for all fans of macabre, gothic literature, as it stands as, perhaps, the greatest example, written in a superb manner that transfers the narration without being clumsy, and thus uniting the reader with the intense frustrations, struggles, and fears of a multitude of characters. Aside from being a feat of literary form, there is a genuinely splendid tale to be had from this, which develops over several, distinct acts that are united to create a well-written novel. In short, this is the quintessential horror novel that no fan should miss. It uses the far more effective literary devices of yore to establish the mystery and terror that modern fiction is so quick to neglect. To top it all, it's one of the most entertaining books ever written."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"*Note-contains spoilers*&quot;Dracula,&quot; the only book for which Bram Stoker is really famous, is very good. The use of multiple points of view enhanced the suspense, and the protagonists (my favorite was Dr. Seward) were all written well, as well as Dracula himself. And the first few chapters, beginning with Jonathan Harker's train arriving late, up to Harker attempting his escape from Castle Dracula, are some of the scariest passages in all of literature (especially the night-ride over the Borgo Pass, with the blue flame and the wolves). The climax is also very excellent, from the heroes' race to destroy all the earth-boxes to the final confronation with the Count himself.However, the novel bogs down a bit in the middle, during the &quot;Lucy Westenra&quot; section. In fact, all of the flaws of the novel occur during this section. Lucy herself is so bland and boring you find yourself wishing Dracula would go ahead and just kill her now. And everyone else blathering on about how perfect and pure she is gets quite irritating. Thankfully, once she is truly dead, the novel picks right back up.Overall--highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"...and I say that because this book (not a &quot;retelling&quot; of the Dracula myth, as one reviewer assumed, but the original Dracula myth in its pure form) does have its weaknesses. Some of the dialogue is overblown at times (and Van Helsing's fractured English makes him seem more goofy than wise and powerful). The characters sometimes are flat (Quincey Morris acting too laidback when he fearfully shoots at a bat--who happens to be you-know-who--perched on a balcony). And the physical description of Dracula--conceived as a stage role for Stoker's boss, actor Henry Irving--is more likely to induce laughter than fear. Stoker's depiction of Dracula is a skinny Henry Irving with Spock ears, fangs that protrude over his lips, long nails, and hairy palms. Not exactly scary. The Hollywood conception of Dracula as a normal-looking fellow who only sprouts fangs when about to attack is much scarier, and more fitting for such a menacing character. And Boris Vallejo's beautiful cover art for the TOR reissue pretty much cements the point. He, too, presents Dracula as a human-looking villain, but with an air of menace around him. As such, the character is actually more fearsome as a romantic icon than he is in Stoker's &quot;Henry Irving as fanged Spock&quot; description.That said, DRACULA's position as a classic is well-deserved. Its plotting is swift and furious, and the use of multiple viewpoints allows the story to be multifaceted. An air of melancholy gloom saturates the narrative, and it certainly stays with you even after you finish it. There are some truly chilling moments, and Dracula...well, even though he's not given much page time, he pretty much steals the show. He is indeed a paragon of pure evil, and as such is the most engaging character in the book. One can almost hear Bela Lugosi's voice snarling the dialogue. (It was fun to see him boast of how clever Vlad the Impaler--Dracula's true identity, as it happens--was when he defeated the Turks. That Dracula would actually brag about his glory days in the third person was a hoot.) Especially interesting is the comment at the end when Jonathan Harker, looking over all the journal entires that comprise the book's story, says that there's &quot;not one authentic document, just as mass of typewriting,&quot; which makes one wonder if Dracula was indeed a vampire who nearly destroyed these people's lives, or is the whole story a smokescreen for something else? That idea actually makes the book even more terrifying.In short, read and enjoy. It's a worthy book, and it is fun to see how the legend began."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Through this novel Bram Stoker gave us the greatest vampire story ever told. Other have done well writing different versions, and deserve credit, but I say, as always, that after everything is said and done, that Stoker's character, Count Dracula, is STILL THE BOSS."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker's Dracula is a novel of epic proportions and ingenious wit is displayed through, Stoker's vivid details and own creative efforts. Stoker enters the plot through the journal of Jonathan Harker, and narrarates the entire story through the journals and letters of the other characters. The stamina which is sustained in his novel is also worthy of noting. Stoker keeps the reader's attention from beginning to end. In the beginning he does it with his descriptive details of Count Dracula's castle in Transylvania. He describes everything from the dark morbid corridors to the dusty banisters. Stoker does not hesitate in describing his characters with the same infallibility. He talks of the Count in such a way that the reader can not help but remember afterward. Stoker captures every detail from Dracula's sharp pointed teeth to his eyes that glow red with evil. More towards the end, Stoker starts to have the reader anticipate with fear what will happen next and then become thrilled with excitement without even a shadow of disappointment when &quot;next&quot; does happen. In using the journals of his characters as form of narration, Stoker again triumphs. The journal format gives the reader an insight that the characters do not recieve until late in the novel. That very insight, helps foreshadow and intensify the drama of the events that follow each journal entry. Stoker also uses the journals to give the reader more than one pair of eyes to see the novel through. Stoker does so brilliantly, capturing everything from the distinguished wit of Professor, to the humorously ignorance of the minor characters, and then the innocence and femine views of Mina Harker and Lucy Westenra. In conclusion Stoker's masterpiece Dracula is carefully etched and equally haunting."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"After finishing Bram Stoker's Dracula, I was satisfied I had just read an excellent novel. Although it was a very lengthy twenty-seven chapters, I worked my way through it without a lot of difficulty comprehending the storyline. After reading Dracula, I felt the need to get up, lock the doors around the house, check the windows, and bury my head beneath the covers. Dracula has no central narrator. Instead, it brings together a number of different perspectives by combining newspaper clippings, letters, telegrams, and the diaries of various characters. Jonathan Harker, a young English lawyer, is the first character to meet Count Dracula, the novel's main villain who is a wealthy Transylvanian nobleman. The Count is also a vampire. Harker keeps a journal written in shorthand, but his entries are very meticulous, keeping exact details of what went on during the day. For example, on &quot;3May. Bistritz.--Left Munich at 8:35 p.m. on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late . . .&quot; His journals record the essential facts of his journey from Bistritz to the Borgo Pass,where he is met by Count Dracula's carriage, as well as recording the facts of his arrival and stay at thge Cast Dracula. He also records what he thinks, sees, and eats, even jotting down a couple of reminders to himself to get recipes for Mina Murray, his fiancee. From reading Harker's journal, it is clear that he is a very logical and organized thinker. He arrives in Transylvania to do some legal work for Count Dracula, but soon finds the behavior of his host threatening. Dracula casts no reflection in the mirror, and when Harker cuts himself shaving, the Count makes a lunge for his throat. Harker discovers that all the castle doors are locked, and that he is a prisoner. Dracula finishes his preparations for moving to London and departs, leaving Harker alone. The novel left me in suspense about Harker's fate as the scene shifts to England and the story of Mina Murray and Lucy Westenra is introduced. The story in the following chapters is presented through journal entries of various characters, as well as by newspaper articles and even a ship's log. Westenra, Murray's best friend, is wealthier and more flirtatious than Murray, who is a brave and resourceful young woman. Murray goes to visit Westenra in Whitby, where a mysterious ship arrives in a terrible storm, with only a dead man for crew and Dracula's fifty boxes of earth on board. There are several other strange occurrences at Whitby. Murray grows increasingly worried about Harker, who has not written her for some time, and Westenra begins to walk in her sleep. One night Westenra sleepwalks and goes outside to a spot by the sea. Murray follows and, when she arrives, she catches a glimpse of a dark figure bending over Westenra. Murray gets Westenra back to the house and notices two small puncture wounds on her throt. Over the next few days, Westenra appears to contract some kind of illness. Murray receives a letter telling her that Harker is in a Budapest hospital recovering from a &quot;violent brain fever.&quot; She rushes to Hungary and they are married. Harker can remember nothing of his terrible experience, and I never found out how he escaped from Dracula's castle. For me, the most intriguing character is Mina Murray, or, I should say, Mina Harker, since she married Jonathan. Her concern that her best friend Lucy was sleepwalking and her attempt to follow her were admirable. The night that Lucy walked into the churchyard and sat down on the bench, Mina saw that there was a dark figure standing over Lucy. Mina tried to get a better look at the figure, and its head turned toward her, revealing red, glowing eyes. To be honest, if I were Mina in that position, I probably would have been too frightened to move from my spot and go help my best friend. But Mina is brave, and she does not want her friend to get hurt, so she gets to Lucy and the dark figure is gone. Since Lucy is only wearing her nightgown, Mina takes off her slippers and lets Lucy wear them all the way back to the house so that she does not hurt herself on the gravel in her bare feet. Like any novel, Dracula has its pros and cons. The first chapters were a little slow for a typical high school student; in other words, nothing very exciting happens. The numerous characters and the news clippings were a little confusing, but the prose style was clear, although the vocabulary was a little sophisticated and Stoker probably wrote for an adult audience. Bram Stoker's Dracula is the best novel I have ever read, and it is the only suspense novel that kept my heart pumping. At first, reading the book seemed like a &quot;pain in the neck&quot; with over five hundred pages to go. However, I soon discovered it was worth my time. If you've not read Dracula, order a copy as soon as you have a free moment, and then on some dark, stormy summer night, build a fire, grab a blanket, and read--every word is good to the last drop!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker's tale of terror, 'Dracula,' is just as chilling today as it must have been to readers a hundred years ago. Stoker's original story, which has been told many times since in film and book, is the tale of Johnathen Harker, his love, and his friends, and their horrific experiences at the hands of Count Dracula. The book begins with Harker traveling to Transylvania to meet with the mysterious Dracula. Aquainting him with English customs and traditions when the Count buys land all over London from his firm, Harker soons learns of Dracula's true nature- that of an unnatural fiend who causes destruction wherever he goes. When Dracula travels to England Harker's friends enlist the aide of Dr. Van Helsing, the only man who understands just what evil the Count is capable of. The story that follows is one of love, hate, maddness, and adventure as Dracula seeks to destroy Harker and his friends. As well as being a great work of literature, 'Dracula' is a wonderful tale of horror that modern readers are sure to enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"The story of Dracula is a tired subject to modern readers. USA films production of the historic Vlad the Impaler, Hollywood productions of rewritten stories with new twists, and the entire (now hopefully dead) Goth movement have completely clouded the beauty, intrigue, and mystique of the original Dracula.It begins with a train-ride into Transylvania, but it takes readers far closer to intellectual ecstasy than many other books of its type. It is not a book for mild entertainment, rather it is a work that requires thought. Imagination cannot help but flourish as Stoker vividly describes his characters in appearance, speech, and emotion. Their surroundings are equally portrayed as real, common-place scenes. There is little of a supernatural bent to the work, really. It is the essential frightening look at what could happen to ordinary people in ordinary circumstances when something sinister and something extra-ordinary meets them.The original story is so far from the modern revisions that one will find it surprisingly fresh. It is like going through an entire genre of multimedia productions before coming to the one gem of them all. In this case, the original. Many are intimidated by the book's size and their preconceptions from modern mistakes. I believe that the real Bram Stoker's, 'Dracula' will excite and please more than people realize. I have bought copies for numerous reading-partners who have equally enjoyed this book when we have disagreed on so many others.'Dracula' is well worth the consideration."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This book is one of my all-time favorites. Its characters are believable, the story well crafted, and the entire reading experience a joy. Stoker's grasp of medical technology would make most modern physicians cringe (blood transfusions without verifying blood type, etc.) but who cares? This book is worthy of reading more than once.Dracula is the epitome of gothic horror yet it is not \\"spooky\\" and really doesn't cause nightmares in the reader. The book may not have the reputation of the film versions, but it is far superior to any Hollywood version. There simply is too much happening for any film to completely portray in two hours. The book is a classic good-versus-evil and reflects a Victorian view of faith and sexuality. Some on-line reader's guides are available to help give perspective on the book, but are not necessarily required.All told, I rank this book high, I have only a few other works of fiction I rate higher."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"... This is, without a doubt, one of the most facinating and absorbing adventure tales and vampire tales ever written. This is the book that created horror....One of the many reasons I enjoyed this novel is the way it is written through journals and letters. This book trails the heroic conquests of Jonathan Harker and his brave wofe Minna as they try to save themselves and countless other innocent souls from a man too evil to be human. I know why this is among the most popular books of all time by its fullness of action, suspense, gore and romance. But in order to see all of that, you'll have to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker's tale of the vampire Count Dracula, and related stories of vampires and other demons, have so saturated our culture that reading the originals of the genre is essential to any dedicated student of either literature or popular mythology. Fortunately, \\"Dracula\\" is not the dusty, overwrought tale one might expect from its length and age. Instead, it is intense, exciting, and usually difficult to put down. Stoker had a talent for writing engaging prose that is at once meditative and action-filled.But \\"Dracula\\" is neither flawless nor innocuous. It's a scary read, and sometimes a dense one - as the book progresses, the excitement is increasingly broken up by literally pages of speechmaking and other nineteenth-century affectations. While these may be interesting to a student of literature or history, they're static to the modern thrillseeker, and I found myself confused as to whether the author meant the characters' extreme statements of love, hate, allegience, etc. to be taken seriously.This is the dilemma of \\"Dracula\\". It's a good scare and an interesting read, but the length and breadth of the book convinced me that there must be more to it. The characters seem too obviously stereotyped - the men in their valiant, unselfish approach to villainy and the women in their purity - to be serious, and the plot proceeds along a course so obvious that it seems the author must be mocking himself. But that's the problem with reading a classic after you've seen the rip-offs: the classic seems old and overdone, a cheap parody of itself.Still, classics have a lot to offer. Beyond the fantasy element, \\"Dracula\\" offers a mixture of the traditional epic tale of man against the evil beast without, and the modern introspection of man against the evil beast within. Despite its flaws, it is a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"By day he sleeps in the dark and gloomy dungeon of his ancient and dilapidated castle.

Bram Stoker craftfully managed to weave an intricate web of suspense and thrills. No wonder the book is such a classic! Few other books compare to the majesty of Dracula."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Don't be mislead by the various movies you may have seen that were made using Dracula as a blueprint. This is actually a great piece of psychological horror. After a slow start, during which not much happens, beyond introducing the characters and your basic travel type novel of the day, the action suddenly takes off back in England. There is a certain slow dread that grows when you read this novel. Most people already know what happens in the book before they ever set hands on it. My advice is don't be gready for blood and gore. There is more an element of suspensful drama than a large body count.This is a book worth the read."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

This last time that I read it, I really had to make myself focus on it hard on the beginning of the book. The book is very good book for people too read. Many people can easily be brought into the way Stoker puts the details into the work. He has a lot of good descriptions of where Dracula lives and also by what Dracula looks like. He makes you think that you are in the story too.This book can also be very creepy at times. All the way through out the book, it gets more and more interesting. If you are a person who likes scary books, then Dracula is a book for you. I choose this book because I found it very interesting."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Don't get me wrong this was a great read, it's just that for the most part the suspense was lacking. I suspect this is because the Vampire character is such a part of our popular fiction culture. Really, with the vast numbers of works, both film and novels, that have spun off since Dracula was published, it was no wonder I felt I had read this book before.Still, there is something about hearing the story from the original source. I found the format of the book (i.e. being told through the diaries and journals of the participants) a great format. As I mentioned for the most part suspense seemed to be lacking however, the opening sequence with Harker at the castle kept me on edge...What was going to happen next, how was he going to get out of there!I gave this book 4 stars because all in all it was a pretty good read and...well it is a classic."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This is probably one of the finest works I've read in the horror genre. It is a deffinate must for horror, literature, and/or vampire fans (I fall under all three categories, with a particular stress on the former two.) Stoker achieved some amazing imagery, a dark atmosphere, and scenes that will never leave your mind in this novel. Its only flaw is that it is admittedly overwritten throughout places in the middle, but its redeaming qualities, and absorbing beginning and ending make up for this and then some. Stoker creates strong and memorable characters--my favorite being Abraham van Helsing; Johntathan Harker comes up in second--and all of this is packed in a well written piece. Probably the most memorable part of the book for me, as well as my favorite, was a speach given to Dr. Seward by van Helsing reffering to the weakness of science (&quot;The problem with your science is that you do not let your eyes see, nor your ears here that which you cannot explain....&quot;)This is definately a work to enjoy. And as a further note for vampire fans, should you not consider reading the work that truly launched literary interest in the vampire legend? No, it was not the first vampire story, but it is one of the best and best remembered; it is also the reason the vampire legend is what it is today. This should be on your bookshelf along with Rice's Interview with the vampire. (I also highly recommend Poppy Z. Brite's Lost Souls as a great modern vampire work.)"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"On a very cold and windy night, I was up in my isolated third floor room reading this novel. We have steam heat in my apartment, so I had the window open to get in some fresh air. The wind coming into the room caused my bedroom door to rattle on its hinges. I could not have asked for a better atmosphere in which to read this book.This is a great book to start off with if you love a good vampire tale. (But we know it's not the first.) Stoker writes an extremely effective and scary tale. The opening sequences with Jonathan Harker meeting the superstitious villagers, and then his ordeal in the Castle are effectively scary, great mood setters and some of the best horror writing I have ever encountered. Unfortunately, the book begins to flag a bit in the middle with endless meetings between Van Helsing and his cohorts. After a while I just wished they'd do something, and not just sit around talking about it. The book also left a few questions for me: how did Harker escape the castle, why did Quincey Morris hide in the shadow of a tree, and why was Renfield chosen to be the servant of the vampire? These are minor quibbles, and they effectively add to the intrigue. I also enjoyed the character of Mina finding some strength at the end, as too much of the book has her being the predictable Victorian heroine. (Yes, she indeed faints.)I think this is also a good book to be read BEFORE you pick up any Anne Rice. Rice perfectly carries on the tradition of the vampire novel, and this serves as a great \\"prologue\\" (for Rice debunks a lot of vampire myths in her books, and even has Lestat muse on the \\"truth\\" in Stoker's novel... but this in no way renders \\"Dracula\\" irrelevant.)Dracula is thrilling, racy (for its time... those three vampire women must have shocked the Victorian audiences right down to their lace collars), and a great read."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

If you can't afford a first edition- which cost thousands, then this is a nice substitute. Rich black leather binding, great bookmark, the pages are slightly tanned or faded to give it that authentic aged look. the cover art is very interesting, rather dark and is an attension-grabber. The red leaf pages are OUTRAGEOUS, and truly make this the buy of a lifetime. Great for collectors or first time readers alike."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"My review will focus on this VERSION of the story, not on Dracula itself. Before you purchase this book, you need to know that Townsend Library has made purposeful changes to Stoker's prose which impact the overall mood and tone of the novel. All old world spellings and Victorian colloquialisms have been removed. This is evident right from the first chapter where Stoker originally spelled the country where Harker is traveling as \\"Buda-Pesth\\"; in this version, they change it to the modern \\"Budapest\\". Another example is that in the original, Harker charmingly refers to a paprika meal he eats as \\"I had for dinner, or rather supper, a dinner done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but very thirsty.\\" In this Townsend Library Edition, the charming phrase simply becomes a reference to meal made of paprika. Townsend Press also has purposely removed or modified all references to Victorian-age technology such as telegrams, steam engines, Dr. Seward's phonograph-related journal entries, and Mina's shorthand, stating in the afterword that they did not beleive today's audience would appreciate such outdated forms of communication or transportation. Big mistake. In order to experience the true gothic nature of this most important of horror novels, avoid this version, and go with an unabridged, unaltered one."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"While I have always been a fan of vampire movies and books, I had never read the original Dracula by Bram Stoker. I had probably figured it was a pretty tame story told in some outdated English that was difficult to read. What a wonderful surprise I was in for! I have enjoyed this book tremendously. The story telling, style, and imagery are absolutely terrific. This particular publication also has footnotes and commentary on the symbolism behind much of the book if one is interested. I highly recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I read Dracula as a teenager and thought it to be slow moving and boring. Now that I've re-read it with my fully developed \\"man-brain\\" I am able to see what a terrifically spun masterpiece it is.We first learn of Count Dracula through the journal entries of Jonathan Harker, a solicitor sent to sure up some real estate business in Transylvania. The Count welcomes Jonathan into his castle, but on the conditions that he stays within designated rooms. He soon finds out that he is the Count's prisoner - and with growing anxiety he finds out what really goes on inside the walls of the dilapidated castle. He narrowly escapes with his life, but has unknowingly aided in the Count's relocation to London, with its teeming millions to whet his monstrous appetite.Dracula is a classic tale of subtle terror told through the eyes Mina, Jonathan, Dr John Steward with a few entries from Lucy Westerna and Dr Abraham Van Helsing. Dracula has stood the test of time in that the horror and suspense still pack a punch, even over a century later.*NOTE* It is very beneficial to purchase the enriched version, as there are very helpful literary explanations throughout the book that I would have never known. The only bad thing is that a few of them provide spoilers to later parts of the book - so I would suggest reading them the second time though."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This book was full of horror, love, action, and suspense. Though a few parts of it can be boring, for example, the part with renfield, the rest of the plot makes up for it. I read it in the eleventh grade, and it scared the heck out of me, all the while wondering what would happen next to Jonathan Harker, Van Helsing, and Lucy. All the characters were interestingly developed, but I wish that more appearances were made by Dracula, so we could see what he felt from his own point of view. Also, I thought the three vampiresses were erotically charged, but more should have been given as to who they exactly were in relation to The Prince of Darkness himself.This book had erotica in it as well, like with jonathan harker's encounter with the 3 vampiresses in Dracula's castle, and how he felt sexually aroused when near them. It also showed how evil can be alluring and sexy, with the beauty and volutuousness of the vampires conjuring desire in jonathan harker.This book had a great plot and suspense to go with it, as the theme of good vs evil continues. I also realized that Dracula, though an \\"evil\\" vampire, did at one time feel \\"human\\" emotions of love and longing with Mina, as he said \\"You'll be my companion and helper\\" to her. Stoker doesn't give all of it away, but there were allusions to a growing bond of blood, lust, sex, and love between the two. It showed dracula with a soft side to him, not as just a monster. Mina may also have discovered that, and found true love through an un-dead creature, but that love was never sustained, because they were from two different worlds that couldn't unite. I also feel Dracula was a very melancholy person in his castle, as he mentions \\"Through the years of mourning...\\" to Jonathan Harker, and that he came to London to find not just victims, but love, which he found in Mina. It's interesting that there are many sides to evil, and at times, you can actually sympathize with Dracula when he says stuff like this. He's evil, wantes to control others, but is also searching for a way to give and receive true love, but is torn in his own immortality. He's a very malicious, sad, and ambivalent character.Mina was a strong, caring, devoted wife to Jonathan Harker, but it seemed to be obvious to me that she did have some love and sexual desires with dracula, so romance was no stranger to this book. It was sad that Dracula never found the proper way to be in harmony with love and mina, but he did find peace in the end, which made it wonderful. You can almost cry at that concept. Very moving.I also loved that Stoker made this writing through journal entries, and newspaper entries, and in fact, this has encouraged me to keep my own personal diary to write my events in. This has also encouraged me to go to Transylvania myself, and see the historical Dracula's castle, that of Vlad tepes.In all, a great read, and terrifyingly sexy. No wonder this book has become known as the world's greatest of gothic romances, and horror stories written. It still has the power and the grip to conjure up gruesome images of blood and gore and darkness in a person, and if you truly felt terrified after reading this, then Stoker has succeeded at this task. It's a book of good versus evil, as I said, and how predators like Dracula feed upon the timid, the innocent, the beautiful, as do many criminals in real life, so you know how he compares with murderers, rapists, thugs, etc. in the real world. Stoker did a great job, and to this day, no book has ever made such great fuss over than Dracula. It's a great horror story. A must read!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Even the dialogue scenes were interesting and never bored me.Very unique style! No narrator...just a set of journal entries and newspaper clippings, so you really get inside each characters head. And despite what other reviewers have said, I liked each of the heroes and despised Dracula, which was Stokers goal.But! The book is anticlimatic! I won't ruin the ending for you but the grand finale is more bland than grand. After all the buildup you expect a firework ending and simply get a sparkler. Despite this flaw I thought it a very worthwhile read as it gives you a picture of both 19th Century England and the origin of Dracula....4outa5."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Written in diary form it introduces the reader to the young English Lawyer Jonathan Harker, his wife to be Mina, the enigmatic Professor Van Helsing and various other colorful characters that make this story so deliciously scary.At the heart of the story is the Vampire,Count Dracula of Transylvania who has decided to take residence in England and in doing so seals the fate of several people. One of the Count's first victim's is Mina's best friend Lucy who becomes a Vampire herself and suffers the fate of a stake through the heart and having her head cut off. Soon it is a race against time to stop Dracula getting his fangs into Mina as well, and only the brave Van Helsing and his trusty companions can save the day.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"After having seen numerous treatments of the Dracula story, I wrongly assumed I new it pretty well. After stumbling through the first few chapters, I got the swing of its style. Mr. Stoker used a rather novel approach in creating this novel. The perspective of the story changes with each chapter. You read narrative from many different characters. Awkward at first, later it gives the impression of a balanced account of the events. It seems to make the events more believable. A note now forgotten by many is this was a &quot;current&quot; story when written. It was not a piece of colorful historical fiction.The reader is not biased by the narrator's point of view. Anne Rice's &quot;Interview with a Vampire&quot; is told from Louis' perspective. That very story is given a different spin from Lestat in &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;. With Dracula, all players are backing up everyone elses story. The chilling effect, is that it seems true. I was very pleased that a hundred year old story could hold such a grip on me. Actually, it was I that had the grip, a tight fisted one, on the book until I finished."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

After reading it, however, I wish they would make another movie, more true to the book.While Lucy left much to be desired, and I still can't understand why she had so many men swooning over her, she was not as vital to the plot. Mina, on the other hand, was better developed and more satisfying. The descriptions were beautiful, whether of places the author was very familiar with or not.

Wondering how he was connected, because he didn't seem to be drinking human blood. His connection helped them figure out some things, but it didn't really seem to fit otherwise.Another surprise for me is that when you are newly undead you apparently suck blood of children?

I'm sure most of you have heard of the story of Dracula and maybe seen the film with Bela Lugosi, but have you ever read the original book? If you read Twilight and such things, you should read its predecessor, Dracula. The original book is told in the form of diary entries from various characters and letters. It is quite an interesting style of narration, especially for a horror book. You would expect the narration to be different, but I enjoyed the way diary entries were used; you got to see the perspectives of the various characters. Also, the way Stoker built up suspense, mystery, and dread was really great. As a horror story, it was quite effective. The story didn't start out that scarily, but gradually, ever so gradually, the horror creeped up on you and caught by surprise, until finally, you were totally chilled to the bone by the dreadfulness of it.

At first I was a bit judgemental, but when I actually read the book, it was simply brilliant! The fact that Bram Stoker has written it in diary form makes it more interesting. I thought it was really good."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This book I loved because it contained buckets full of vampire lore. Such as they can not be seen in mirrors, can not cross running water, can die if a holy bullet (silver bullet) is shot into their coffin, can not get out of their coffin if a wild rose is placed upon it, ETC. Surprisingly though it was not the first book about vampires. The first was a series of comics called &quot;Varney The Vampire&quot; and was very scary. This though blows way through the competition, paving the way for the next generation of vampire stories. This book has gone down in history and will remain one of the greatest vampire stories of all time."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker took an obscure regional legend and made it a classic tale of horror world known. He gave the vampire legend to the masses. The style he chose to present the tale, diary and journal entries, letters, somehow draws the reader further into the story. It's as if you are reading facts known to each character and are actually putting the story together yourself. An amazing way of drawing in the reader that has never been fully used since. No other book or any of the movies have captured the feeling you get out of reading the original Bram Stoker tale of Dracula."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"1-liner: the discovery and destruction of an ancient evil, as seen by proper Victorians.Dracula is a story spun through the perspective of several characters. It is presented in the form of diaries, journals, newspaper cuttings, and phonographs (ancient version of a typical voice-recording device). Jonathan Harker is a lawyer who travels to the superstitious lands of the Carpathians to ready the deeds of a resident affluent Count who has just bought some properties in London. Mina (Wilhelmina) Murray, who is engaged to and eventually marries Harker, is an etiquette teacher to Lucy, a woman with whom three men are in love with. Arthur Godalming, who eventually becomes Lord Godalming, when his father dies, is the lucky man who wins Lucy's love. Dr. Seward, who is the head of a mental institute, is also in love with Lucy. Quincy Morris, his and Arthur's friend, is also similarly infatuated. Finally, Bram van Helsing, a friend of Seward's, is an old scientist with an open mind, not yet stifled by the shackles of established science---he is the one who announces the possibility that Lucy is afflicted with vampirism.The tale starts with Harker describing his journey to the Count's castle. Things seem normal and the people only a bit eccentric in their superstitious ways until he finds out that he is a prisoner in the Count's castle. He's already discovered that the Count has powers that are unnatural - the ability to command wolves and the weather and the ability to climb down walls, as if a lizard. Moreover, the Count has disturbingly sharp teeth that protrude from his mouth. As Harker's fate becomes more dire, the reader is whisked away right when the moment is most climatic. The other characters in the story begin to develop.The story seems to develop something into a love story, as the reader discovers Lucy's three suitors - each a man worthy of praise. Three men are hopelessly in love with Lucy, who is, unfortunately, the first vampire victim these men will encounter. As she wastes away, the vampire in her taking over day by day until her final usurping upon her death, these men start to realize how dangerous and vile and un-Victorian are the ways of the vampire -- and, as such, the world must be rid of it! Thus, the plot.(Seward also describes his patient Renfield. Although capable of being a perfectly cogent man, Renfield is prone to eating bugs and birds and spiders. His theory that life is a process that can be lengthened by the agglomeration of lesser things via the taking in of the life essence of lesser creatures foreshadows the connection between vampires and blood - I suppose this, at the time, was something of a shock to the Victorian readers. )I found the storyline to be a bit convoluted at times, as I skimmed through the harried details that seem there just to hike up the word count. Moreover, the ending was something of an anticlimax. I suppose this is so because so much of the story has been stolen and parts of it used and modified so many times since its initial publication.What's interesting is that the act of having vampires explode into dust, so that their remains can not be traced, was not an original idea of Whedon's in his Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This is, in fact, what happens when the vampires are slain in Dracula.Moreover, Dracaula was shown to walk about by day, to hunt down the men who wanted to destroy his boxes of Carpathian soil. The hardcore vampire, I guess, isn't that afraid of sunlight."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Over vacation, I read Dracula by Bram Stoker. It is a classic science-fiction horror novel about a vampire traveling to London from Transylvania in the late 1800's. The novel opens with a journal entry from one of the main characters, Jonathan Harker, traveling by train to Transylvania to meet Count Dracula. During his visit, Jonathan notices abnormalities in the castle and even more strange incidents with the Count.Eventually, Jonathan is forced to escape from the Count by jumping into a river from the top of the castle. Jonathan, however, accidentally entices the Count to meet Jonathan's fiancee and their friends and pulls him into their world.After the death of one of their friends, the main characters become obsessed with ridding the world of the Count. The reading is difficult at times because the story is written in journal entries by the main characters about the same subject other characters are also writing or talking about.All and all, I enjoyed Dracula very much, and encourage all who like horror or suspense novels to read it. If you saw the movie from the early 1990's, the story lines are quite different."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"It is interesting to read the original literary versions of tales that have had a long reign in popular culture and have spawned many updates and adaptations. You can see that the tale of the original Count Dracula has evolved greatly in movies and books since the bad guy first appeared in Bram Stoker's book more than a century ago. (For an even better example of this process, read Mary Shelley's original Frankenstein novel sometime - the monster will amaze you.) Of course some aspects of the Dracula story have been corrupted over time. For example, most of the story does not take place in Transylvania, Renfield is not Dracula's butler, and Van Helsing is an aging intellectual rather than a swashbuckling monster-slayer. And most of all, the course of this original story pretty much eliminates the need for any of the multitudes of sequels that Stoker's original creation has inspired. Regardless, it is always a treat to go back to the source, as Stoker expertly made use of vampire folklore as it stood at the time, while drawing inspiration for the Dracula character from the real-life genocidal maniac Vlad the Impaler.Be prepared to read a book that is a product of the writing style of the late 19th century. Stoker's language is dense and a bit slow moving, with words like \\"stertorious\\" and \\"zoophagy.\\" The dialogue is very laborious, with characters speechifying in dramatic and gigantic verse that could hardly come from people in the midst of tense situations. Stoker used the unusual method of presenting the narrative mostly in the form of diary entries by the major characters, which stretches the limits of credulity. These people apparently finished up each day of valiantly warring against vampires with two hours of writing with excruciating detail in their diaries, then started each day reading each other's diaries before embarking on another perilous mission. But if you can stomach the rather stiff Victorian writing methods and the enormous monologues, you'll see why this book is an immortal classic for the ages. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I thought Dracula was a great book. It was filled with action and horror. This book was set in Transylvania. The main characters were Dr. Van Helsing, Count Dracula, and Van Helsings wife Mina.The way this book starts out is, Dr. Van Helsing is invited to stay at the famous Count Dracula's house to do research. Van Helsing accepts the invitation. Only after a few days of studying Van Helsing realizes Dracula wants to suck his blood and turn him into a vampire. Van Helsing's wife Mina is visited one night by Dracula and her blood is sucked.Van Helsing knows that if he stays in Dracula's house any longer he will be turned into a vampire, and he knows that there is still time to save Mina before she's completely transformed into a vampire.This was a really great book. It made you not want to stop reading."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"this is simply a paperback modern version of bram stokers tale dracula the greatest story alltime if you havent read the original stokers novel this paperback is a great book for you to read on a rainy autum night and is available cheap in this form so you have no excuse not to read the story that started it all"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Now, I'm something of a pessimist, so before I go into Dracula's virtues, let me tell you that I have one problem with it and one problem only. Oftentimes, Van Helsing will speak in a grammar set that is difficult to decypher. Once you do, though, it's worth it.This book describes quite well the nature of the Nosferatu, and their motivations and techniques. In fact, before reading this, I had never thought much of vampires, because going around drinking blood and sleeping in coffins always seemed rather small-time differences from the ordinary. Then I read this book, and it got me not only into vampire tales, but into victorian literature. Dracula, a powerful and ancient vampire, is given the form of a bat, a wolf, a wild dog and command over creatures like owls, rats, foxes and other nocturnal animals. He can generate clouds of mist around himself and shrink his body, scale sheer surfaces and escape easily from traps, and see in the dark. On top of all this, he possesses vast strength and regenerative capabilities as well as being proficient in sorcery. He has a bunch of other powers too. This is just the tip of the iceberg.Van Helsing's explanations of the flaws in our logic are truly special midway through this book, and the chase of Dracula is truly interesting. This book is, for me, far more believable than most horror fiction, because it is told largely in diary and newspaper clipping format. This, strangely, doesn't make the book less frightening or less exciting, but really, more so.I can safely say that when it comes to portrayls of Dracula, this first has still been the best. I read this with my brother recently, and he agreed with me that it was a truly good book. A pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"If you are looking for a great book to read, Bram Stoker's Dracula could be your perfect choice.The plot alone gives enough good reason to read this book. To start with, it's a classic. You can never go wrong with a classic. It's books like this that enrich your literary reading. Along with being a classic, Dracula demands that you take time to sit and read. It requires thought. By doing this it doesn't make the book seem too easy and a waste of time and effort. At the same time it's not too hard to understand. Dracula is great for all you out there who enjoy the supernatural. This is one that lets you escape and experience some of the creepy yet exciting events that do not occur in our everyday life, or world for that matter.Bram Stoker offers some intersesting characters in his book. It is hard to become bored with with a particular character throughout the entire book. Plus, if a madman that eats flies doesn't intrest you, then I don't think that anything will. Such charateristics really give the characters of Dracula stand out personalities. A madman, a prisoner, two doctors, a woman being turned into a vampire, the list goes on and on. These are merely labels compared to how the book presents them. It is easy to get to know a certain character so well that you can relate to them, or somewhat of their experience. This really helps to get into the book.The theme of Dracula really fits nicely with the plot and characters. First off I must give my satisfaction with the writing style. Not many authors use letters, diary entries, logs, and newspaper clippings to tell their story. This writing style really explores every character's point of view. It really helps the reader to know what is going on throughout the book. If that doesn't get the reader involed in the book, then the setting will. It goes from creepy castles to ships with dead men to civilization and so on. Without the setting it just wouldn't be the same. The setting really helps to establish a good basis for the plot and the characters. The genre of this book is considered to be gothic. When reading the book I noticed that it fits the five characteristics of a gothic piece of literature. It has a creepy setting, a damsel in distress, the supernatural, and gore. The wonderful gothic setting of old victorian England is the perfect environment for this delightfully dark book."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula is a classic. If you like horror books, even a little try this book. A very entertaining story that will, thrill, chill and amaze you to the very end! Dracula is a classic but I didn't like it that much ( thats why I gave it three stars, but a very good story. )Try It Out."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Everyone knows the name \\"Dracula,\\" but the majority have only seen the legendary Transylvanian Count on the silver screen or through pop culture; few indeed have actually read the work that started it all.One cannot claim to be a fan of vampire literature or of Dracula himself without having read Bram Stoker's tremendous work of gothic horror. Think that Dracula and other vampires can't be out in daylight? Wrong--they simply have no powers during the day, which you'd know if you read this extraordinary book.Written in epistolary form (that is, as a series of letters and diary entries), the story is presented from the viewpoints of the main characters, from Jonathan Harker to his wife Mina to Dr. van Helsing. Rather than detracting from the story, this format breaks up what would otherwise be a rather long manuscript into manageable chunks and adds to the historical character of the novel.Modern film interpretations have presented Stoker's story through the eyes of each producer, director, and screenwriter, with nearly all making wholesale changes--Mina Harker, for instance, is NOT the reborn lost love of Count Dracula as Francis Ford Coppola would have us believe. Many others who have \\"read\\" Dracula have done so through abridged texts that distort the story through omission. Pick up and read the story that started it all in its intended format... Bram Stoker's Dracula. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This book is much better than I expected it to be.It might take some time to get used to the 19th-Century language, but what amazed me is how modern the pacing and atmospheric imagery is in a book written in the late 1800s. Except for the language pointed out above, it really feels like it's a film script completed last week. I also like having it written from different characters' perspectives through their various journals, diaries, and letters. The one thing that I thought could have been better is the ending. It's simply very abrupt, and I felt, unsatisfying. With so much buildup, I thought there could have been, and should have been, A LOT more action at the end. Still, that should not keep you from reading the book. You've probably seen dozens of Dracula movies through the years, and this is in large part the genesis of all of that, and the reason why to this day people are obsessed with this fascinating character."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"My only real gripe is that it is so freaking long, and I don't mean the number of pages.

This was truly how vampires should be."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This is such a wonderfully written, horrible tale. I love the voice of this writer, so polite and cultured, which only makes the goings on seem more real and insidious. It lifts the work above some of the more current horror simply because of that interesting tone. Right from the start there is a tension that builds and carries through to the end. This may be the abridged version, but it is still very enjoyable. Recommended."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

In an era where every second pulp romance novel in your local bookstore involves supernatural liaisons, it is refreshing to read a proper gothic horror story. The vampire in Bram Stoker's tale is without a shadow of a doubt evil, awful and deeply mysterious. Presented as a series of diary entries, journals and papers, the unfolding story is both realistic and claustrophobic."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I was surprised by the story. You may think you know the story, but you don't. The book is different than most of the movies. The story is told from the journals of the characters. The battle with Dracula is much more real than any of the movies portrays. He is pure evil, he is not the handsome devil that the movies show.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"\\"Dracula\\" was the first adult novel I ever read. It had a tremendous impact on my writing, and deeply influenced my 2007 sci-fi/fantasy novel \\"The Unreals.\\"Stoker uses the journals of various characters in order to tell his story, thus changing the first person perspective on a continuing basis. This was an unusual method, but one I found challenging and perfect for the plot. The reader is immersed with geographical details, and must remain focused in order to receive the full impact of this delicious slice of literature.While Hollywood has been fascinated by Stoker's vampire saga for over a century, there has yet to be a truly faithful adaptation of his work filmed. I don't know why that is, because a literal interpretation of \\"Dracula\\" would make for an unforgetable cinematic experience.Bram Stoker never really produced any other memorable literary work, and from most accounts was a rather cold, unfriendly person who was unhealthily obsessed with his boss, tyrannical actor Henry Irving. Some historians believe that Stoker based the Dracula character on Irving. Regardless, Stoker's classic novel never leaves you; it's a work that has stood the test of time and is essential to any library."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

I cannot imagine many people being disappointed in this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Looking for a vampire who is something other than the focus for the crush of a teenage girl or a thinly veiled political statement? Return to the source and pick up Dracula.Dracula, the original vampire novel, opens with a young, English lawyer traveling deep into Eastern Europe to meet with a mysterious count who had hired his law firm to arrange the purchase of an estate in London. The lawyer quickly learns that Count Dracula is even more sinister than he initially appeared and that he has his sights set on London.Readers more familiar with modern vampires will be surprised by Dracula's abilities; vampire canon has evolved away from Bram Stroker's vision (based heavily on eastern European legends). I would say more, but there is a definite advantage to not fully understanding the dark force the protagonists must face.Dracula is structured as an epistolary novel, with the chapters made up of diary entries and letters written by the various characters, as well as newspaper clippings. Unfortunately, this structure is antithetical to suspense. Stoker does once create suspense by switching POV at just the right moment, but it is left unexplained so long it becomes annoying.Dracula only has a couple female characters, but both are strong by Victorian standards. The characters tend to be a bit on the flat side, though. Some of the thicker English accents are nigh incomprehensible and Van Helsing's accent inexplicably changes from chapter to chapter.I'll still take Dracula over a teen paranormal romance any day of the week."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

I'm just 80% through with this book and every page is an effort. I try to read one chapter every day (about 10 pages), but it's very easy to put down before I get to the end of the chapter. It is wordy, repetitive, boring. I hate the half-page sentences and page-long paragraphs. On the plus side, it does have a story that follows logically and doesn't have daisies blooming in January. My perception is that the theme is good vs. evil although I'm aware that there are other views. The book is sprinkled liberally throughout with bits of wisdom, and it contains numerous Biblical references. The good guys are bound by a sense of duty. Count Dracula is evil personified.

And although I don't know English deeply, it seems only a regular novel, mediocre in strict literary sense.But a novel isn't only literary language, and \\"Dracula\\" has some valors not to disdain.First, there are a collision between old delayed continental Europe, origin of Dracula, symbol of evil, and modern England in full industrial revolution. Gramophones, telegraphs and other machines hardly exits in Transylvania, but abounds in Britain. It's said Bram Stoker wrote this novel with a typewriter, by then a novelty.But Stoker lacks romanticism. In this sense, some of the several films about Dracula surpasses this novel in that.However, the author does hit in some facets; one is disquieting: Dracula only is able to enter in your house if you invite him to do.Another is the forces of goodness, as professor Van Helsing, Lucy, never resource to official authorities as police.

The story, too, while containing some admirable elements, is not as exciting as, say, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; or &quot;Great Expectations&quot;.

The story is boring to me and for the first time ever I considered the movie \\"Dracula\\" by Francis Ford Coppola much better than the book by a big stretch."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula is an interesting book, but it does have its flaws. First of all, the Dracula character is only a peripheral figure in the book. After the tense beginning, there is only mere mention of the vampire now and again. There is no development of the Dracula character, no motivation for his actions, and only the slightest hint of a personality. Secondly, the Count only attacks two people throughout the whole book. Both are the female characters, Lucy and Mina. Is that really very realistic? I mean, if there was a vampire in our midst, would he not strike randomly among the masses? Would not random murders take place that would alert the police? Would his arrival in London not only affect two female characters who happen to be the protagonists of the book, but also others outside the realm of the author's tight circle of personalities? I think, most assuredly, yes.Nowhere in the book is the police ever alerted to the vampire's existence. Even if they didn't believe he could be a vampire, he would surely be pursued as a murderer and fiend. But the only ones to pursue Dracula are the five male protagonists. The author succeeded in producing a neat, little package of friends who are attacked and then pursue the hated vampire. But how realistic is this scenario? The police never know what is going on and only two people attacked. Surely, a vampire of the stature of Dracula would have grander designs.The book is really divided into a meeting with Dracula at his castle, his traveling to London, attacks and remedies, and the pursuit of the vampire. There are many lulls in the book, and is told through the use of diary entries, news clips, and dictation devices. All in all, a credible story but not without its shortcomings.Meanwhile, most of the sexual themes are muted, and exist mostly in Stoker's repeated use of the word, voluptuous. The religious themes are more prominent, and are still a part of the vampire lore. The most striking religious theme is redemption of the soul, and the triumph of good over evil.I really can't criticize Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" too much for it really is the basis of all vampire novels that have come after it. It truly is the mother of all vampire stories, and for that alone, deserves a special place on anyone's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"i am a freshmen in highschool reading at a colledge level i have read atlas shrugged,frankenstein and many books by shakespear but this confuses me but still a good book"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker's Dracula is, hands down, the greatest horror novel ever written. In addition, it is also an enduring classic of literature. You may have seen every Dracula movie ever made, but you do not know the real Count Dracula until such time as you have read Stoker's book. Of course, unless you have been living under a rock, you will know the general plot line, but I assure you there is a wealth of rich material buried throughout the text that is sure to excite, intrigue, and surprise you. Perhaps the ending is a slight anticlimactic, yet I, having read this novel before and being quite familiar with the Count, read the final pages with bated breath, an anxious mind, and the sense of exhilaration that only the most talented of writers can induce.The most striking characteristic of Stoker's masterpiece is its solid grounding in late 19th-century Victorianism. This may prove frustrating to some readers. It is far from uncommon for the men in the tale to weep and bemoan the dangers threatening the virtuous ladies Lucy and Mina; virtue and innocence of women are hailed rather religiously. Mina, for her part, assumes the role then deemed proper for women, accepting and praising the men for their protection of her, worrying constantly about her husband rather than herself, shedding tears she must not let her husband see, etc. Yet, it is most interesting to see Mina rise above the circle of a woman's proscribed duties; she in fact becomes a true partner in the effort against Dracula, expressing ideas and conclusions that the men, with all of their wisdom, could not come up with themselves.Another thing I find interesting is the lack of a clear protagonist in Dracula. Technically, I suppose, Jonathon Harker is the protagonist, but Mina, Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and the Count himself basically operate on an equal plane with him. It is Van Helsing who can be described as the anti-Dracula; he plans the moves by which he and his friends seek to thwart the Count's plans and destroy him; the second half of the novel can be compared to a chess match between two equally strong competitors. Minor characters such as the lunatic Renfield are also drawn clearly in our mind's eye by Stoker's incredible gift of characterization. While the format is unusual--the novel consisting fully of diary and journal entries by different characters--you cannot help but be drawn in closely to the group of heroic souls who pledge their very lives to one another as they take it upon themselves to combat a centuries-old evil.One could expound upon a number of themes in this novel (and many literary critics have certainly done so), so I will just quickly mention a few. Is this an erotic story? Certainly, to some extent, but there is certainly nothing overtly sexual in these pages. Is it really horrible? One might wonder how much blood one would encounter in this product of the Victorian age, but there are indeed some rather shockingly gruesome descriptions of events--nothing to shock modern readers but probably quite surprising to Stoker's contemporaries. There are also subtle overtones of religion in these pages. Aside from the Christian objects that have the power to keep vampires at bay, the most striking scene in the novel is Dracula's perversion of the Lord's Supper in his own most nefarious deed.I cannot recommend Stoker's masterpiece highly enough. The impatient reader may encounter sections that move too slowly than he/she would like, but such lulls are always wiped away by sudden spurts of activity and drama. Feminists will dislike the Victorian characterization of the women but can find unexpected pleasure in the strength and intellect of Mina. Literary critics will surely find in these pages a deep ocean of issues ripe for analysis. Of most importance, the common reader will find an absorbing storyline which may horrify him/her to some degree in places but which will certainly offer great rewards of enjoyment. I think most individuals would be won over completely by the great humanity of these characters and the unexpected richness and complexity to be found in this story of a fiend they thought they already knew."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

The use of multiple professional voice actors is the key. While most audio readings are done with one person reading all the parts, male as well as female, Brilliance employed numerous actors and cast them exceptionally well. Sheila Hart's portrayal of Mina is particularly good. This is a performance - not just a verbatim reading.

Even the letters and diaries are written in different styles; for example, Seward's is restrained and analytical, while Mina's is exuberant and bright.This edition also has a foreword by Elizabeth Kostova, writer of a hit historical novel about Dracula/Vlad Tepes.

Be patient with this one and you may find yourself rewarded."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"One of the scariest books in history, DRACULA is nevertheless misunderstood. Our civilization is removed from the Victorian era. We think of it as somehow distant and quaint, and ourselves as modern. But when Bram Stoker published DRACULA in 1897, the Victorian era _was_ modern. Stoker meant to make the book more frightening than most books by bringing an ancient horror into a modern, anti-superstitious world. He uses typewriters and phonograph disks the way a modern writer would refer to the internet and e-mail. DRACULA's first readers might've looked out of their town or country houses and expected to see Dracula's gaunt figure emerging through the fog.He tells the story through a series of diaries, letters, clippings. Normally this is an unweildy method of storytelling, but in this case it is most effective.The novel is divided into three broad sections. In the first, young Jonathan Harker and Dracula have the stage almost alone. Though Harker's diary we learn details of his journey through eastern Europe to meet a Count who wants to travel to England, and Harker carries him certain important papers. Count Dracula's character comes across very strong and well-defined, and grows ever menacing as Harker slowly learns he is not going to be allowed back to England, but will become food for Dracula's vampiric harem.The second part of the book, set in England, deals with Mina Murray, who is going to marry Jonathan; Mina's friend Lucy; three men who are in love with Lucy; and a good-hearted but mysterious Ductch doctor, Abraham van Helsing. The bulk of this part deals with Lucy's mysterious disease, her decline to death, and her transformation into a vampire that her suitors must destroy out of love. Dracula appears only fleetingly through the book, but the reader knows what happens, and suspects the cause of Lucy's decline.In the last part, Jonathan, Mina, and Lucy's three lovers band with Dr. von Helsing in a pact to destroy Dracula before he can spread his contagion throughout England; and meanwhile, Dracula wreaks his vengeance on them for taking Lucy from him.Stoker uses many ways of approaching his subject. Occasionally the horror is direct; but once it is established, he makes it subtle, working behind the scenes, in a way that may be even more frightening. Though he also uses different voices, his prose is invariably fine. And as each character has to overcome his aversion to ancient superstition and face Dracula with a mind open to the fact that there's more in the world than science and technology and late-Victorian materialism can contain, the book becomes eerily meaningful for the twenty-first century.Modern purveyors of vampiric fiction dispense with the blatant Christian symbolism used to fight Dracula's ilk, such as a crucifix or sanctified host, or prayer. They also turn the evil of Dracula topsy-turvey and somehow invent sympathy for soulless monsters who view living humans as food. Stoker doesn't hesitate to show Dracula as an evil, totalitarian horror; as a contagion that must be eradicated; as an enslaver of women, like Lucy, and men, like poor Renfield. And Stoker has reason enough to realized that only Supernatural agencies could fight the supernatural. The saving Blood of Christ on the Cross, blood of which a soulless terror like Dracula cannot drink, is the most effective symbol for fighting and defeating this brand of evil. It was part of the novel's consistency that as the characters have to come to grips with the reality of ancient evil, they must also return to the symbols of good that they also have rejected in a narrow-minded embracing of the modern.Dracula, the strongest character in Victorian fiction, does not weaken himself by the need to be &quot;understood&quot; or &quot;pitied&quot;. He will destroy or be destroyed. And the worst destruction that could happen to him would be mitigation.DRACULA may be the scariest book ever written; it's certainly the best of the classic horror stories. It's well-crafted and exquisitely constructed enough that it stands as a great novel even without genre pigeonholing."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This is the original Dracula, the one that started it all. However, after years of Hollywood movies showing us what the Count \\"should\\" look like, reading this book can come as a little bit of a shocker as there are many (and I do mean *many*) differences from this story to the ones that the movies portray.The Count is physically very different from the debonair looking, eyebrow rising, cow-licked hairstyle, tuxedo wearing vampire that Bela Lugosi made famous. He looks more like Count Orlock from the F. Murnau film 'Nosferatu'.If you have seen Francis Ford Coppola's film, you have seen the closest approximation to the story the novel tells, as many of the events are portrayed similarly to those on the book, yet, the usual 'creative liberties' are taken in order to make the film more fluid.Be warned that the book is written as a number of diary entries or letters from the different characters of the story, and that this being a book written at the waning years of the 19th century, the language used can sometimes seem confusing.It's not as fluid a reading as you would expect from the first vampire story, but nonetheless a great book and certainly one of the classics that everybody should include in their collection."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

If Van Helsing hadn't thwarted him, he probably would have taken over the world -- not the Victorian audience's ideal ending.This particular edition has been made to look almost exactly like the very first edition, down to the illusively-tattered dust jacket and distinctive title print. It also contains an early, gushing newspaper review -- as well as a couple short chapters from Dacre Stoker's forthcoming sequel, \\"Dracula the Un-Dead.\\"The excerpts in question are rather different from Bram's work (third person narrative) and takes place a couple decades later.

K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Surprisingly \\"Denn die Toten reiten schnell\\" or \\"For the dead travel fast\\" is more than an opening line to this tale of love in the dangerous moon light. After watching several Drac movies and a few Nosferatu's, I pretty much though I had a handle on the genera. Little did I know what a wonderful world of mystery and suspense that Bram Stoker opened up for me.The story is told mostly third party though the papers, diaries, and phonograph recordings (on wax cylinders) of those people involve in a tale so bizarre that it almost defies belief. The general story line is that of a Count that plans to move to a more urban setting (from Borgo Pass to London) where there is a richer diet. There he finds succulent women; something he can sing his teeth in. Unfortunately for him a gang of ruffians (including a real-estate agent, asylum director, Texas cowboy and an Old Dutch abnormal psychologist) is out to detour his nocturnal munching. They think they have Drac on the run but with a wing and a prayer he is always one step ahead.Of more value to the reader is the rich prose chosen by Stoker as he describes the morals and technology of the time. We have to come to grips with or decide if we can perform the rituals that are required to eliminate vampires verses the impropriety of opening graves and staking loved ones. The powers in the book differ from the movie versions in that they are more of persuasion and capabilities to manipulate the local weather.

This gives the story an especially eerie quality.You are immediately drawn into Jonathon Harker's journal, which is written in incredible detail. All the while you are reading his journal, you sense that you are reading the journal of a man who is now dead. This creates quite a compulsion to find out all the details of what happened to this poor gentleman.This book is very, very long. If a contemporary author wrote it, I would have given the book four stars instead of five for lack of editing. But more slowly unwinding stories were in vogue when Stoker wrote Dracula, so we let the book keep the five stars.The most fascinating part of the book is how journal entries, letters, newspaper clippings and so on are used as a device for framing the overall story. It's A very creative and effective frame."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This book is great. It had me hanging onto every word, wondering what would happen next. If you like the new fad going around with vampire books then you have to read Dracula, the original."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"\\"Dracula\\" was not the first vampire novel, nor was it Bram Stoker's first book. But after years of research, Stoker managed to craft the ultimate vampire novel, which has spawned countless movies, spinoffs, and books that follow the blueprint of the Transylvanian count.Real estate agent Jonathan Harker arrives in Transylvania, to arrange a London house sale to Count Dracula. But as the days go by, Harker witnesses increasingly horrific events, leading him to believe that Dracula is not actually human. His fiancee Mina arrives in Transylvania, and finds that he has been feverish. Meanwhile the count has vanished.And soon afterwards, strange things happen: a ship piloted by a dead man crashes on the shore, after a mysterious thing killed the crew. A lunatic talks about \\"Him\\" coming. And Mina's pal Lucy dies of mysterious blood loss, only to come back as an undead seductress. Dracula has arrived in England -- and he's not going to be stopped easily.\\"Dracula\\" is the grandaddy is Lestat and Jean-Claude, but that isn't the sole reason why it is a classic. It's also incredibly atmospheric, and very well-written. Not only is it very freaky, in an ornate Victorian style, but it is also full of restrained, quiet horror and creepy eroticism. What's more, it's shaped the portrayal of vampires in movies and books, even to this day.Despite already knowing what's going on for the first half of the book, it's actually kind of creepy to see these people whose lives are being disrupted by Dracula, but don't know about vampires. It's a bit tempting to yell \\"It's a vampire, you idiots!\\" every now and then, but you can't really blame them. Then the second half kicks in, with accented professor Van Helsing taking our heroes on a quest to save Mina from Dracula.And along the way, while our heroes try to figure stuff out, Stoker spins up all these creepy hints of Dracula's arrival. Though he wrote in the late 19th-century manner, very verbose and a bit stuffy, his skill shines through. The book is crammed with intense, evocative language, with moments like Dracula creeping down a wall, or the dead captain found tied to the wheel. Once read, they stick in your mind throughout the book.It's also a credit to Stoker that he keeps his characters from seeming like idiots or freaks, which they could have easily seemed like. Instead, he puts little moments of humanity in them, like Van Helsing admitting that his wife is in an asylum. Even the letters and diaries are written in different styles; for example, Seward's is restrained and analytical, while Mina's is exuberant and bright.Intelligent, frightening and very well-written, \\"Dracula\\" is the well-deserved godfather of all modern vampire books and movies -- and arguably among the best."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Have you ever witnessed the horror of a tale such as Dracula? So many know the name, but few have actually read it. This book begins with a warning from Jan Needle. \\"The stuff of nightmares\\", he calls Dracula. This is a horror story you won't forget.The central character of the book is not the Count Dracula, despite the title. It's starts with a young man by the name of Jonathan Harker. He is visiting the Count for business, his employer having given him the job of completing the sale of some property to Dracula. On his trip to Transylvania, he encounters strangers blessing him and warning him not to go where he is headed. An old lady gives him a crucifix and begs him to wear it. All Jonathan wants to do is fix the sale and get back to his fianc&#65533;e, Mina Murray as soon as possible so he does not take time to ponder the meaning of these events. Jonathan soon realizes that the Count is not normal and that he is trapped inside his castle. He knows he needs to escape. Viewpoints shift as the story continues. They change around from Jonathan, to Mina, to Dr. Van Helsing (a specialist in vampires), to Lucy Westenra (Mina's unfortunate friend), to Dr. Jack Seward (a suitor of Lucy). They, with Quincey Morris (another suitor of Lucy) and Arthur Holmwood (Lucy's eventual fianc&#65533;e) are in a fight to save lives and souls. Dracula must be defeated no matter what the consequences and complications are.I truly enjoyed this book despite the fact that I didn't really think I would. I always thought that scary stories were no more than ways to spook or thrill people, but the story of Dracula is more than that. There are character relationships and emotion. This story brings you on a roller coaster of fright, love, sadness, and desperation. This haunting piece has become one of my favorites. I do have one word of warning though: avoid reading before bed."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I just reread this book for the fourth or fifth time, and I never get tired of it. \\"Dracula\\" is probably the greatest horror novel ever written, and it's also a great example of a solid 19th-century Victorian novel. The story begins in Transylvania, where a young man pays a visit to one of his clients, Count Dracula, and makes a horrifying discovery. When disturbing incidents begin to unfold in England, a small group of friends ban together to put an end to the evil that threatens their sustenance.There are so many people out there who are vaguely familiar with this story, but I assure you that there is much more to Dracula that is waiting to be discovered within the pages of this amazing novel. One of the most interesting things about the book is the description of Dracula himself, which differs dramatically from the way that Hollywood has portrayed him in the past. I think most readers will be surprised to learn how things unfold in the original story, but rest assured that the book is even more enjoyable than any of the movie versions available.This edition of the book is definitely the best out there. The Edward Gorey illustrations are striking, and this is a must-have purchase for any Dracula fan or avid book collector. (Note: my copy of \\"Dracula\\" has a different Gorey illustration on the cover...it's a picture of the Count himself, not a bat. Perhaps there are several different versions available?)"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Stoker's classic is certainly worth the read. It's tame by today's standards for a horror tale but there are still quite a few moments of strong suspense. The young solicitor Jonathan Harker is sent to Transylvania to help Count Dracula with the paperwork necessary to purchase an estate in London. Dracula initially seems like a nice enough guy, but Harker soon discovers some terrifying details of his lifestyle. This first section of the book contains some of the best horror ever written! The second part of the book takes place in Yorkshire, where the Count has alighted after leaving Transylvania. The action continues as a new bunch of characters put their heads together to finally establish what the Count is. In addition, we see firsthand what happens to a vampire's victim. The rest of the book takes place in London and then eastern Europe.The characters are well-developed but don't really have any flaws, which seemed quite unrealistic to me. Dracula is portrayed very well but only appears in a handful of dramatic scenes. I wish Stoker had made him show up a few more times, perhaps focusing a bit on his character during the day when he isn't out for blood. The story is told entirely in hindsight through journal entries by the major characters. This unique style of narration has its merits (e.g. it's easy to describe the same events with different points of view) and Stoker handles it very well, but on the whole I would have preferred straight single viewpoint narration or perhaps third person omnicient.Dracula is a fairly long book, with the Penguin edition weighing in at nearly 500 pages. Though the story never really dragged for me, I feel that a couple parts of the novel could have been condensed, e.g. the mission in London to find and destroy the Count or the events dealing with Dr. Seward's wacko mental patient. Minor nitpicks aside, Stoker's writing and plotting are first-rate and easily allow this one to attain the status of \\"classic\\". Overall, a gem of a novel!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I was not prepared for &quot;Dracula&quot; when I decided to read it ten years ago: the movies on the subject had spoiled my expectations and maybe even skewered my perspective. I gave it a shot mostly because I was snowed in that weekend in Virginia. That was one hell of a weekend. &quot;Dracula&quot; proved to be far better than any of the film adaptations had even insinuated: dark, eerie, very effective in epistolary style, unabashed in its thesis of the Easterner who threatens the good Victorian (Western) ways of decent people, and seduces young women who are, mostly, very willing to be led astray. The topic of Eastern menace-Western defense is an old one (&quot;The Iliad&quot; is one example, &quot;Medea&quot; another), but Stoker creates a singularly powerful character in his Transylvanian Count who must drink human blood to stay alive for centuries. The author got his inspiration from Countess Bathory and Vlad Tepes &quot;The Impaler&quot;, this last one a true hero in Romania. The originals were far bloodier than the literary creation, but Dracula's grip on our imagination is due to Stoker's way of dealing with his peculiar vampire: this is a truly evil being. None of the redeeming qualities presented in films are in the book. Dracula simply charges ahead and, when things turn out badly, retreats to his land. The romantic hero is a creation of screenwriters and filmmakers. Count Dracula, as Stoker made him, is a gothic horror character, and one of the most memorable ones. Unfortunately, Stoker became a hostage to his creation. But in writing &quot;Dracula&quot; he created more than a horror story, or a memorable character: he managed to create a lasting monster that has gone far beyond the horror genre to become a cultural phenomenon. Do not let the unusual (for us) epistolary style throw you off this excellent work: When compared to most of today's popular literature, &quot;Dracula&quot; rules."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula, by Bram Stoker, is one of all times greatest horror novels. Within its 417 pages it manages to stun its readers with it's amazing frightening and suspense filled storyline. It is a classic tale of a vampire, Count Dracula, who is hungry for blood. He first victimizes his lawyer's fianc&eacute;'s friend, Lucy Westenra, turning her into a vampire. This brings the tragic death of Lucy. Seeking revenge, Dracula's lawyer, Jonathan Harker, his fianc&eacute;, Mina Murray and a few of Lucy's close friends, set out on a mission to end the life of the vicious Count Dracula. During this time the Count manages to feed on Mina, making her yet another on of his victims. As she slowly starts changing into a vampire herself, the rest succeed in killing the count using silver knives. The death of the Count saves Mina. The reason I chose this book to read was because I had heard that it was really good. I had no idea how good I was. It is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. It brought chills to body every time I would pick up the book. Bram Stoker's choice of words and excellent imagination colored the book. I thought this book is a very intriguing book to read especially for adventure lovers who like a good scare. Like all books, Dracula had its strengths and weaknesses. Some of its strengths were the fact that you were able to imagine yourself in the story making it easier to understand. Its descriptions were very graphic and detailed, enough to help the reader picture exactly what was happening. Even the characters were described so thoroughly, that it felt as if you knew them by appearance and personality. Also, the story keeps you attached so that you don't want to put it down. Each chapter has something new and interesting to offer to help capture your attention over and over again. Slowly everything links together and you slowly find your self near the end of the book. I can't remember ever being bored throughout the book. Its weaknesses are a few in number. Every now and then you can get lost because there is so much being told and sometimes it's hard to follow. Also it jumps a lot from one setting to another and one characters point of view to another's. I would probably recommend this book to teens 14 years of age and older, because of the graphic descriptions, it would truly scare children younger because of it's violent scenes. In general this is one of the best classic novels I have read. This is the type of novel that satisfies most tastes. It includes: love, triumph, adventure, sorrow, mystery, horror, friendship and satisfaction after an accomplishment. In other words this would be the book I would recommend to all types of readers, especially those who want a good scare."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Through Jonathan, Dracula travels to London and preys upon the people there--including several who are of importance to Jonathan and the people he loves. Dracula, in all honesty, was the scariest book I have ever read. I could never read it at night because of the intense desciptions and even during the day I found myself at the edge of my seat. It is a very captivating and is very thought provoking on the matters of goodness in man. But in all of that, there was something that was missing. I felt that the climax of the story could have been better and more dramatic--or maybe something believable could have happened. Dracula was just one of those books that you read where everything is so great in the beginning and middle, and you expect so much from the end, but you end up getting nothing. I still recommend it to classic horror fans, though. And I do warn people who tend to be on the sqeumish side. There are parts that can be quite graphic."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Unfortunately, it is difficult with so much Dracula imagery going around in my mind to read it as a first timer. I knew what was going to happen. There were really no surprises for me. I kept hearing Winona's voice every time Mina opened her mouth! That could be slightly distracting, especially since my goal was to read the book without any preset images or thoughts raging through my head. Well, I could not achieve that sort of mindset. I was raised on Saturday Monster Movie Matinee and Chiller Theatre so Dracula and I are old friends, however, despite my knowledge of the storyline, characters and the ending itself, I enjoyed this read immensely. I love how it was written using journal entries, and not just from one voice, but from many. These characters came to life not only from their own perspective, but from the characters surrounding them. It was a brilliant idea, and found I couldn't put the book down, despite knowing of Dracula's impending and expected destruction. I say read the original. Everything else was based upon it, and I give it 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Read this book not with your wise new 2010 eyes, but with the 1897 eyes of Bram Stoker's first readers. First, note the unique literary style, sequences from journals and letters of the protagonists. This would have enhanced the realism to the book's early readers. Also, note the power of the crucifix and the communion wafer. The world of a hundred years ago adhered to a religious fundamentalism that is now found principally among those whom civilization has left behind. The supernatural elements are portrayed as perfectly realistic and the reader is genuinely terrified of the Count and his converts. If you cannot discipline yourself to put on those one hundred year old eyes, however, you may find this book to be little more than an interesting entrant in the history of science fiction, without the tension. Now, if you really want to feel terror, try warding off a hoard of modern fiction's monsters with a crucifix."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Vampires are hotter then ever and this Victorian masterpiece will not let you down. I literally had trouble turning my kindle off- I loved this story. This book is so well known that a short review can not do it justice. The book is written in letter format as characters write to each other or write in their diaries. The opening chapters are atmospheric and chilling as the character Jonathan Harker travels to Transylvania to conduct business activities for the Count. The descriptions of Castle Dracula and Harker's dilemma are excellent. The ensuing action will sweep you up as will the conclusion as the main characters leave England to track Dracula down in his mountain lair. This truly is a classic tale and this kindle version is first rate. I would have liked a table of contents and some expert commentary, but this is first rate story telling.\\"There seemed a strange stillness over everything. But as I listened, I heard from below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count's eyes gleamed and he said. Listen to them, the children of the night. What music they make....

Hall (Large Print))","review":"Being somewhat familiar with the story of Dracula, and his historical basis, Vlad Tepes Dracul of medieval Romania, it seemed appropriate to finally read the original source material, inasmuch as it is a celebrated classic of English literature. I was not disappointed, though somewhat surprised that the majority of the action takes place in London, not the Count's castle in Transylvania.While I enjoyed the story and the style of writing, I must say that I was quite put off by the edition of the classic which I read. The Enriched Classics Series contains voluminous commentary and interpretation which I found at times, ridiculous. Of primary irritation, was the \\"commentator's\\" insistence that all things within the book be read through the prism of England's treatment of Ireland. Every reference in the book is footnoted, many in an attempt to argue that Transylvania is somehow a metaphor for Ireland. For example: \\"Harken rides a tardy train from Germany to Hungary\\" (footnote: There were tardy trains in Ireland as well.) I'm not making this up. \\"There are four ethnic races present in Romania\\"(footnote: There are actually more, but the author has reduced it to four in order to equate with the four in Ireland). Really? Most absurd, our literary critic argues that the name Dracula is some bastardization of two Irish words meaning \\"bad blood\\". Gee, and all these years I thought it was a reference to Vlad the Impaler, of family Dracul. After all, the cover art displays a field of impaled corpses beneath Castle Dracul.Preceding the book is a lengthy discourse on the meaning of blood in Dracula, and how, over the years, literary analysts and commentators have evolved their theories on such meaning. I don't know, perhaps Stoker viewed blood as merely a bodily fluid. Maybe Stoker's work is full of hidden meaning. Perhaps he merely wrote an entertaining Gothic horror novel. In either case, it seems silly to presume the former simply because there were late trains in both Ireland and Transylvania.I suspect that some readers may be put off by the style of the writing, inasmuch as it was written in the late 19th century. There are stretches in the novel (primarily in the absence of The Count) where the going gets a little slow, and the Victorian prose becomes a little tedious, but by and large, it is an immensely entertaining read."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

For me, this kept the story moving along at a quick pace. If you enjoy vampire legends and stories about vampires, this is a must read. Modern stories take this classic myth told eloquently by Stoker and change or explain vampire lore to meet their needs, so reading the \\"original\\" was very interesting.And although I rated this book a 5 star and absolutely loved it, the first 20 or so pages dragged a bit for me and the last 20 pages likewise were not as page-turning as I'd like.

I have to be honest that I thought that since it's such an old book, written in the Victorian era, that I might not like it that much and would find it a bit staid. Not so! It is a great read and really holds up to it's contemporary counterparts. For me, it was a real page turner and one of those books that once I picked up and started reading, I had to keep. I won't say too much about the plots because I, for one, hate spoilers. All I can say is that this is a classic and it's a classice for a reason. Read it and see what I mean.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"Surprisingly \\"Denn die Toten reiten schnell\\" or \\"For the dead travel fast\\" is more than an opening line to this tale of love in the dangerous moon light. After watching several Drac movies and a few Nosferatu's, I pretty much though I had a handle on the genera. Little did I know what a wonderful world of mystery and suspense that Bram Stoker opened up for me.The story is told mostly third party though the papers, diaries, and phonograph recordings (on wax cylinders) of those people involve in a tale so bizarre that it almost defies belief. The general story line is that of a Count that plans to move to a more urban setting (from Borgo Pass to London) where there is a richer diet. There he finds succulent women; something he can sing his teeth in. Unfortunately for him a gang of ruffians (including a real-estate agent, asylum director, Texas cowboy and an Old Dutch abnormal psychologist) is out to detour his nocturnal munching. They think they have Drac on the run but with a wing and a prayer he is always one step ahead.Of more value to the reader is the rich prose chosen by Stoker as he describes the morals and technology of the time. We have to come to grips with or decide if we can perform the rituals that are required to eliminate vampires verses the impropriety of opening graves and staking loved ones. The powers in the book differ from the movie versions in that they are more of persuasion and capabilities to manipulate the local weather. At one point the Dutch Dr. Van Helsing, is so overwhelmed by a beautiful vampire laying in the grave that he almost for gets why he is there and may become vamp chow.All in all the story is more in the cunning chase. And the question as to will they succeed or will Dracula triumph. Remember \\"For the dead travel fast.\\"Dracula"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula is a gothic epistolary novel set in the nineteenth century, told mostly from the points of view of five protagonists: Jonathan Harker, a young English solicitor, Mina Murray his fianc&eacute;e, Lucy Westenra, Mina's closest friend, Dr. John Seward, a friend of Lucy's and administrator of a lunatics asylum in Carfax, and Professor Abraham Van Helsing of Amsterdam, Dr. Seward's former medical science teacher and mentor.In the first hundred pages we follow Jonathan Harker on his trip to Transylvania, where he goes to meet his client, Count Dracula, who is in the process of acquiring some real estate properties in and around London. It won't be long until the young lawyer notices the Count's strange behaviour, and realizes he's a prisoner in his host's Castle. Only when Dracula finally makes for England can Jonathan escape.Then until halfway through the book, we are told of Lucy's declining health since the arrival in Whitby during a tempest of a strange ghost ship, and of the struggles of her fianc&eacute; Arthur Holmwood, his American friend Quincey Morris, and Drs. Seward and Van Helsing to save her life... and when this fails, to save her soul.In the second half, all the protagonists unite, putting their diaries and reports together, also gathering clues from Dr. Seward's delusional patient R. M. Renfield, in order to obliterate this great evil.Of course my first encounters with vampires, and especially the legend of Dracula, was through the numerous films based (some remotely) on this novel. I remember being very obsessed as a child with a vial that froze people still in the French spoof \\"Les Charlots contre Dracula\\", and later charmed by the eerie atmosphere in Polanski's Fearless Vampire Killers. But the one that made the most lasting impression on the then 19-year-old me, was Coppola's most romantic version, which also became my favourite film for some time. As a result, I must say that while reading (for the second time), Jonathan Harker had Keanu Reeves's face, Mina Winona Ryder's and Van Helsing Anthony Hopkins's. However, Count Dracula himself was too unlike Gary Oldman for him to take his features."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Although I believe the last third of the book is somewhat anticlimactic and disappointing, the story and the characters are so brilliant (the first seventy pages had my hair standing on end) that I will forgive Mr. Stoker that small incongruity.

Very, very highly recommended, especially for those like me who are rarely impressed."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I agree with all the other 5 star reviews and would add that this book should be read in its historical context. Dracula was published in 1897 and does a fantastic job of playing off the changing societal norms in the Victorian era. For example, the old scientist who does not want to rule out supernatural explanations for Count Dracula versus the young scientist who believes only what logic tells him he can believe.The tension between logic and the supernatural is a great theme that runs throughout Victorian literature such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's, The Hound of the Baskervilles (1902) and Robert Louis Stevenson's, Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde (1886). But Stoker takes changing societal norms one step further and plays with the changing role of women perfectly, for it is only the less virtuous ones who fall victim to the Count. This theme is also present in Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde but is not as pronounced.In short, this is a great piece of literature that should not be missed."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Of course, this novel has had an enormous influence in subsequent reinterpretations, in literature and cinema. The first part is the creepiest, the story of Jonathan Harker's tribulations at the mysterious castle of Dracula, in Transylvania. That was really great. The rest of the story, which happens in England (except the finale) is also creepy and enigmatic, with a different flavor: the Victorian idiosyncracy and the tightening plot are very good, even though I understand those who complain about Lucy's story being long and somewhat repetitive.Of course, the best thing about the book is the literary technique: the fragments of diaries, the letters and newspaper clippings add much to the mystery. Also, this narrative techinque allows for variety of points of view and sources of information, which round it up pretty well. The tone and athmospheres are successively creepy and hysterical, creating a tense and dark environment.Even if it has some flaws, &quot;Dracula&quot; should be considered a great novel. The entertainment it provides is exciting, and its influence makes it transcendental. Besides, it's always cool to go to the &quot;original&quot; source of a myth."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

The story is told through the characters journals, memos, letters, etc. I also think this novel was ahead of its time, but the novel was lacking something that I can't quite put my finger on. I would like to say the novel dragged, but I'm not sure that it did. I think the whole story of Lucy, and what happened to her lasted too long. It was more than half of the novel, and she was the only focus, and I did not find it rather exciting. Everything seemed too long and drawn out, and Stoker's attempt to keep me guessing left me bored and uninspired. I kept turning the pages because I wanted to finish the book. I also felt the love story between Mina and Jonathan was boring. Jonathan was overly sensitive, and Mina seemed to wear the pants between the both of them. During the novel, not much was said about Dracula. He was just the villian who appeared out of nowhere to hunt Jonathan, and the gang. If history on Dracula was provided, the novel would have had a better feel. Overall this is a book you should read because it is the basis for most vampire themes. While watching the movie the Lost Boys last week, I found the history through that movie was centered on this book. Dracula is not a page turner, but more of a history lesson on the beginning of our obsession with Vampires, and creatures of the night.

In what is one of the most influential novels ever, Stoker haunts the reader with his most famous creation, Dracula."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula by Brian Stoker is a nail-biting thriller that kept you at the edge of your seat. The book starts off slowly, but towards the third chapter the book gets extremely interesting with facts about the character that you would never expect. The book is about this man who got an invitation from Dracula explaining to him that he needs some business from him. This poor man does not know who Dracula is, and you can just predict what was going to happen. The book is the diary that the protagonist wrote about his experience with the count, and what he saw when he was at Dracula's house. This book would not be appropriate for kids under fourteen. It is more a book for good readers because of the older language that it was written in. This would be great for someone who is looking for a thrill or who loves the stories of goblins and ghosts. If you liked Snake's Pass or Under the Sunset, you will also like Dracula. If you want a good book that you cannot put down, I recommend this thriller for you. Do not waste anymore time reading this junk go buy the book now!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"The original Dracula. All others are poor imitators. As a red-blooded vampire lover, I was entertained. A little slow for modern tastes, but a good solid story nonetheless."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Chock one up to the Europeans for understatement. This book is possibly the most frightening I've ever read, while being the least gruesome.Forget everything you've ever seen and read about Count Dracula (including Coppola's film version, which is a oversexualized bastardization of the book)--Stoker's Count is at once fascinating and horrifying, compelling and abhorrent. My only regret is that the reader doesn't get a close enough glimpse at the &quot;monster&quot; (that, and the author's anti-American attitudes, which are quite prevalent throughout).Looking for a quick and scary read? This is your book."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Think of the word &quot;horror classic&quot; and &quot;Dracula&quot; almost instantly springs to mind. Bram Stoker brings the ancient vampire lore vividly to life in this epistolary novel of the Transylvanian count who comes to London in search of new blood and new victims. Much more than Frankenstein (a kind of boring monster, when all is said and done), &quot;Dracula&quot; inspired a whole genre of horror stories based on vampirism, of which Stephen King's &quot;Salem's Lot&quot; is one of the best. Some readers have complained of the epistolary style the book is written in but I thought it helped carry the story along excellently. And with the exception of Lucy (all that fainting and whining does kind of get on one's nerves), the characters are far from weak. The book works on all levels, as a great novel as well as a hellacious humdinger of a horror story."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

As the book goes on you'll meet new characters and thats really the main reason that the book is so great. You'll love Professor Van helsing, a man who really gets the plot to stir.

A satanic night-dweller who is centuries-old, he is evil incarnate and a threat to the well-being of human society.Bram Stoker's _Dracula_ is essentially a suspense novel that will, at times, terrify the reader and make a person scared of walking alone late at night. Enjoyable and entertaining, _Dracula_ is a book written in diary form, from the perspective of various human characters.

While I was reading the one negative review of the book here, I was reminded of the story of the person who just recently saw Hamlet for the first time. After the play when asked how he liked it he replied, &quot;It was alright, but it had too many cliches.&quot; To complain about how Dracula met his end in the original book, is like reading North and South and wondering who's going to win the war. Or watching Titanic and being surprised that the ship sinks. In my mind the flowery Victorian style only adds to the horror. By todays standards many will find the book lame and unexciting, but it caused a minor sensation when first published. The fact that it is still in print over 100 years later is a testament to its literary merit."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

It's a pitty that with all the movie remakes that have been made, not one was a good retelling of Bram Stoker's classic tale. There have been horrible films, decent films, but not one really good film that brings the story to life or is as terrifying as the novel. Whether you're a fan of vampire lore or just want a good horror story, then this is the novel for you. Unlike so many of the movie remakes, Dracula in this novel is not romantic, he is pure evil with only one thing on his mind: human blood! And that's what makes it good. He is characterized as a monster no better than the devil himself. Oh, and did I mention this is also more terrifying than any of the movie remakes!The Plot:English solicitor Jonathan Harker tavels to Transylvania to meet the mysterious Count Dracula who is interested in buying a house (more like castle) near London. But when Jonathan meets the Count, it isn't long before he becomes a prisoner, trapped inside a house of horrors. And it isn't long before the Count threatens the people closest to him. When Dracula arrives in England and begins preying on the local residents (Joanthan's fiance included), it's up to one Professor Van Helsing to destroy this evil with the help of some friends and Jonathan Harker who later manages to escape from Castle Dracula and the bloodlust of Dracula's brides.An exciting and terrifying tale, and the best way to enjoy Bram Stoker's timeless classic!

It brought light to darker worlds and different lifestyles. Abraham Stoker, an advocate of censorship in his time, would have been shocked at today's perception of sexuality in his novel. Dracula was Stoker's masterpiece, but the work itself is somewhat flawed. The flow is meandering and the characters are static. It is best to read this book as a means of better understanding the modern mind and the affect the myth of vampires has had on it. No film portrayal has capture the true feel of this book. At his best, Stoker presents everyday people thrust into bizarre and harrowing circumstances that touch on a tapestry of dark beauty that causes the spine to ache as much as throb."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

The vocabulary is superior.Many of the words describe horrendous phenomena of a nightfiend who preys on victims for their blood. There are manyscenes depicting nature in the vicinity of Transylvania.Here is a sample of Stoker's writing:&quot; As we wound on our endless way and the sun sank lower andlower behind us, the shadows of the evening began to creepround us. This was emphasized by the fact that the snowymountaintop held the sunset and seemed to glow out with adelicate cook...&quot;AND THERE IS MORE&quot;By the roadside were many crosses and as we swept by, mycompanions all crossed themselves.&quot;My purpose here is to whet the literary appetite .

Hall (Large Print))","review":"When faced with the difficult decision of which undead monster to write about, a writer is best served by choosing vampires, whose awesome abilities and vestiges of human nature -- better conversationalists than zombies and mummies, more civilized than ghouls -- allow them to function as substantial literary characters.Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\", however, is less about its title character than it is about the people who are trying to destroy him. Because the story is narrated by the hunters in a variety of first-person accounts, we get only their perspectives and not that of Dracula himself. It would have been nice to hear from someone who was once alive about what it's like to be cursed with an eternal undead existence, to be able to climb walls and turn into a bat at will, whether having to feast exclusively on human blood gets monotonous, and if all blood tastes the same. (I'd imagine some is saltier than others.)The \\"living\\" characters in this novel are, in typical Victorian fashion, wound extremely tight. First we meet Jonathan Harker, an English solicitor whose firm has been hired by the infamous Transylvanian Count to help him buy a house in England. After finding himself imprisoned in Dracula's castle, noticing that the Count spends the daylight hours asleep in a coffin in an underground crypt, and being accosted by three female vampires under Dracula's command, Harker guesses that something about his apparently genial host is not quite right.Eventually making his passage to England, Dracula proceeds to feast on a girl named Lucy Westenra, whose friend Mina happens to be Harker's fiancee. As Lucy lies in bed ailing and becoming paler by the day, a team of highly skilled experts, including the psychiatrist John Seward, the Dutch physician Abraham van Helsing (who speaks in enthusiastic bursts of pidgin English), Lucy's fiancee Lord Godalming, and a \\"laconic\\" Texan named Quincey Morris, is assembled to discuss the problem. Van Helsing's conclusion: We've got vampires.The novel is more an exercise in suspense than in horror, especially since there is a time element involved -- Mina, also bitten by Dracula, will become a vampire under his power unless he is destroyed. The descriptions of the Count's desolate mountain castle, the morbid scenes of profuse bloodletting, and the concept of a nearly invincible villain are the very essence of horror, though, and Stoker puts them to as much use as he can. Many critics have commented on the novel's erotic symbolism, and if these views are valid, all I can say is that Stoker wouldn't be the first or the last author to associate sex with death."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

Bram Stroker did a marvelous job at switching the journal entries at just the right times. He only gave enough information to the readers as needed. This helps keep the reader on the edge at all times. The begining of the book started off well, and gave this reviewer the initial information needed to start the story. As the reader of this story, one could actually feel themselves trying to be in the same place and time as the characters in the story. The suspense is unbeleivable,the waiting and expectations are exciting. When this reviewer thought something was about to happen, the story changed and left me on the edge. After reading the book, this reader feels the author did a splendid job of moving the story along by using different characters at just the right time. As the story progressed, I had the feeling of excitement and of fear from the characters.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"I had had Dracula on my read list for many years until I saw this version on Kindle for free and couldn't resist. I quickly got engrossed in the book as Jonathan Harker, one of the central protagonists, travels deeper and deeper into the remote regions of Europe. The tension mounts throughout his journey as the locals he meets along the way express a mixture of fear and sorrow for him, though unable to tell him directly because of the language barrier. The scenes in Dracula's castle are indeed terrifying and lonely, like something out of Lovecraft. Things become increasingly desperate, driving Harker to take riskier and riskier chances. The appearance of the women in the castle presages a motif which will become central to the subtext of the story. The corruption of female virtue to its basest and most vile form is genuinely disturbing. Dracula is not content to remain in remote regions of the world, but seeks to set himself loose on the \\"teeming masses\\" of London, England. His arrival I felt was one of the most interesting in the book and the reader begins to understand the extent of his potent and growing powers. In an unsuspecting London, Dracula has a largely free hand to spread his evil. The suspense builds as the reader understands more through the journals of the central characters than they do themselves, keeping information to themselves, much to their detriment. It's clear that Stoker aims to unseat his Victorian audience's sense of security even in their own homes and families as the vampire slowly increases his grasp. Once the women succumb to Dracula's control they are both disturbing and enticing to the heros. At this point things become gruesome. Just about anything macabre is in this single story as Stoker gives his audience a full dose of terrifying scenes. Terrible storms, remote lonely castles, wolves, bats, graveyards and cemeteries with overnight stays, home invasions, trances, insane asylums, beheadings, impalings, child abductions, and of course, vampires. The journal-istic nature of the narrative can be frustrating at times and takes some getting used to but also serves to enhance the suspense, giving us no sense of whether the character will live to write the next entry. Overall the book is quite scary and suspenseful with plenty of creepiness. I did find the mens' efforts a bit hapless at times but the author uses this to build suspense, delaying action until it is perhaps too late for them to respond. Dracula himself I found to be more powerful a foe than I had anticipated but retains some weaknesses.Reading this on my Kindle I found the formatting good but without a table of contents to allow the reader to jump to those sections. However, I found the story engaging enough that I didn't require such a feature. I can see why the horror of this book endures. It's a must-read for any fan of horror and this is a good copy of one of the classics."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

All due lauding.The format is completely readable with only a few minor mistakes and the occasional odd line break.Definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"On the one hand, this books reads like a wordy, late 20th century action novel. The reader forgets the fact that this book is 100 years old--a credit to the author's skill and timelessness. The characters are well-treated, Mina is an excellent heroine, Van Helsing is unique and easy to like. The plot speaks for itself, with twists and turns to keep the reader entranced.On the other hand, this is a work not be missed. Read metaphorically, evil is personified in Vampirism--particularly notable for the pop culture obsession nowadays. The origins, actions, effects--and release--of the worst evil imaginable are well drawn and worth contemplation. This is not a novel to address garden variety evil; Stoker's metaphor treats the most hair-raising extreme evil to its personification in Dracula, and the far-reaching effects to the sweet, determined Mina. Strange as it may sound, Dracula is a must-read for Christians, who will understand why after the last page is read. Moreover, this book is for anyone who asks how a just God can allow evil things to happen to innocent people, and should immediately be followed with Boethius'The Consolation of Philosophy: Revised Edition (Penguin Classics). There are some spiritual questions that can only be answered by metaphor; these two works should go a long way.Interestingly, this book parallels Lord of the Rings in the banding together of friends to overcome unthinkable and insurmountable evil. Regardless of what level this classic is read on, it should be read! However, take my advice: Don't read it at night. :)"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

However, this glaring deficiency in my literary repertoire has been remedied and I can now emerge from my cloud of shame. I really did enjoy this book and since everyone else in the world has likely already read it, I do not feel it necessary to go into all of the plot details. Here is the short version without spoilers: when Count Dracula decides to expand operations to London after centuries of being relegated to Transylvania, it becomes problematic for British mortals. Luckily there is a group of people, captained by Professor Van Helsing, who make it an objective to eradicate the vampires from society.I found \\"Dracula\\" a surprisingly quick read for a 400 page book and can understand how it made a splash in Victorian England. However, there are a number of grammatical errors and typos in the text that did hinder my reading process somewhat and were rather distracting. Further, the outpouring of emotion, especially from men, struck me as rather odd for the time period - I just cannot imagine Queen Victoria enjoying that much crying. Though a traumatizing adventure (I would surely be shaking in my boots after butting heads with Count Dracula), some scenes seemed a little affected to me. Still, I do have great respect for this novel in its departure from the more typical works of its day and for bringing vampire myths together into a medium that would serve as a springboard for similar works in the future. \\"Twilight\\" may have had a more appealing family of vampires, but I am glad to have this canonical vampire story on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"&quot;Dracula&quot; is the novel that started it all. Of course, vampire legends had existed for many years previous to Stoker writing the book, but Stoker's tale of the bloodthirsty Count Dracula and his plan to move to new feeding grounds in London has entered the popular mythos like no other creature except Dr. Frankenstein's monster and the werewolf. No mean feat.The plot is fairly straightforward. Jonathan Harker, a young British attorney, is called to Transylvania by the mysterious Count Dracula to arrange the purchase of a property in London. What Harker doesn't know is that the Count is a vampire and plans to use this new mansion as a home base for feeding on London's hapless population. Harker, along with the help of the trustworthy Dr. Van Helsing, must now hunt down the Count; not only to save London but also to save the life of his wife, Mina.Hollywood has made endless versions of this novel, yet not one lives up to the original, printed version. &quot;Dracula&quot; is a definite must-read."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

And falling in love with Dravcula has the side effect of death.I am Team Dracula.And by the way, who the heck is this sparkly pants, Eddie Cullen? Sounds like a faker poising for the scene to me. A regular Fangbanger, if I may borrow a term from the excellent Stachouse series by Harris. (By the way, if you like Count Drac, the True Blood vamps aren't at all shabby)Could this be the best gothic novel ever? Possibly. Is it the best vampire novel you will ever read? Me thinks. I only know my own reaction to finishing this book. I was exhausted, but in a good way. My eyes were practically bleeding as I raced towards the end, but when that end came I felt hollower than an empty casket. I stayed this way for about three days or so, longing to be able to read the book again for the first time. Empty because, once again, I was plauged by that miserable, pathetic feeling that nothing will ever compare to what I've just read. (BTW, this has only happened with The Stand, and Harry Potter for me, so that feeling is rare)Eventually, my vampire loving, lovesick puppy heart mended and I moved on to another book. But I have never, and will never, forget Dracula. It was my first vampire love, and as so, deserves an elevated status in my mind. So yes, I do love Sookie Stackhouse and her vamp escapades, and yes, eventually I will get around to the sparkly, glittery vampire mess that is Twilight, but Dracula implanted the stake in my heart first, and the splinter is still there.Where to begin on this book? First, it took me a couple weeks to plough through the long segmented of Johnathon's entrapment in the castle. Luckily, I whipped myself into gear, then found the book was actually gaining speed. By the time I was half to three quarters, my hands were glued to the book, and it lay on my nightstand, haunting me in my dreams to get back into vamp world(Who needs sleep there anyways??)I love the characters. I love Van Helsing, and Seward. I love the whole chivalry of the Victorian era, where the men will fight for the ladies to the death(but not in a psychopathic way)Dracula is exciting, without being overly bloody. Suggestive, I guess. (You can read the attached footnotes, if you want to know about the sexy undertones of the Count's interactions with the ladies)Very Victorian, very descriptive in style,so you have to be patient, but if you read this book, I can almost promise you will never see vamps the same way again."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

This novel is very cleverly written, and can be taken in two different ways: either as a christian allegory or a gothic adventure. I think the main problem people have with this book is they expect it to be like some cheap Dean Koontz or Stephen King novel, but this is definetely not one of those. What we have here is a very controversial and innovative book for its time. Not only does it use a clever narration format, but it also uses much dark and sexual imagery, which was not as common for that time as it is today. The greatest thing about this book is that it is timeless. It doesn't matter what century you live in.

The format used is a collection of journal entries and letters which makes this book unique for its time and helps heighten the suspense and make it seem more real.

A Yale Professor treats the reader to an informative introduction and provides background facts throughout the book in footnote form. Our Yale Prof is obsessed with the idea that 'Dracula' is a cautionary tale about the \\"Irish Problem\\" in Victorian Britain. He proposes that the name Dracula is from the Irish for 'bad blood'...skipping over the fact that the Transylvanian noble, Vlad The Impaler, was from the Dracula clan. But it's all great fun.And the novel itself!! A masterpiece. Truly magnificent.

It has everything a good book should have: sex, intrigue, a love triangle and \\"that creepy guy\\". Renfield makes the book for me. He is just this creepy guy that doesn't get a whole ton of back-story, but it is fascinating. Every time that I read the book, I get new dimensions from his character. Many of the movies really make his character unimportant, but since this is how Dracula basically views humans, I believe that his character is one of the most important in the book.In summary, Dracula is bad. And, he's good at it. And, he doesn't care that he's bad. Which makes him very, very awesome."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

This book is told from several differnt perspectives of people. Mr. Jonathan Harker goes to Transylvania to to discuss selling real estate for Count Dracula. Mr. Harker has no idea what Dracula is or what he is capable of. Mr. Harker soon discovers things he couldn't even dream imaginable. He tells the story by writing all the events that take place in his journal. After this, much more disturbing events start to take place and Mr. Harker along with others go on a quest to rid the world of Dracula and his kind.It was interesting to see the way vampires were perceived then as opposed to now (with Twilight and other sereies out now).

I reread Mr. Stoker's greatest work for a class studying gender roles in literature, where I approached this work in a very different manner than when I first read it several years ago. In this class, I specifically focused my efforts on the idea of an overly \\"feminine\\" Victorian woman, who was emotional, and submissive in all manners, and particularly in the realm of sexuality. Mr. Stoker, however, explores sexuality in a very different way. Instead, he describes the female vampires using \\"hyper-sexualized\\" diction, while describing Dracula using more neutered diction. It is a fascinating method of exploring the classic work.Mr. Stoker's work can be read in so many ways, but regardless of the method, it should be thoroughly enjoyed!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

But he managed to craft the ultimate vampire novel, which has spawned countless movies, spinoffs, and books that follow the blueprint of the Transylvanian count. Eerie, horrifying and genuinely mysterious, \\"Dracula\\" is undoubtedly the most striking and unique vampire novel yet penned.Real estate agent Jonathan Harker arrives in Transylvania, to arrange a London house sale to Count Dracula. But as the days go by, Harker witnesses increasingly horrific events, leading him to believe that Dracula is not actually human. His fiancee Mina arrives in Transylvania, and finds that he has been feverish. Meanwhile the count has vanished -- along with countless boxes filled with dirt.And soon afterwards, strange things happen: a ship piloted by a dead man crashes on the shore, after a mysterious thing killed the crew. A lunatic talks about \\"Him\\" coming. And Mina's pal Lucy dies of mysterious blood loss, only to come back as an undead seductress. Dracula has arrived in England -- then the center of the Western world -- and intends to make it his own...\\"Dracula\\" is the grandaddy of Lestat and other elegantly alluring bloodsuckers, but that isn't the sole reason why this novel is a classic. It's also incredibly atmospheric, and very well-written. Not only is it very freaky, in an ornate Victorian style, but it is also full of restrained, quiet horror and creepy eroticism. What's more, it's shaped the portrayal of vampires in movies and books, even to this day.Despite already knowing what's going on for the first half of the book, it's actually kind of creepy to see these people whose lives are being disrupted by Dracula, but don't know about vampires. It's a bit tempting to yell \\"It's a vampire, you idiots!\\" every now and then, but you can't really blame them. Then the second half kicks in, with accented professor Van Helsing taking our heroes on a quest to save Mina from Dracula.And along the way, while our heroes try to figure stuff out, Stoker spins up all these creepy hints of Dracula's arrival. Though he wrote in the late 19th-century manner, very verbose and a bit stuffy, his skill shines through. The book is crammed with intense, evocative language, with moments like Dracula creeping down a wall, or the dead captain found tied to the wheel. Once read, they stick in your mind throughout the book.It's also a credit to Stoker that he keeps his characters from seeming like idiots or freaks, which they could have easily seemed like. Instead, he puts little moments of humanity in them, like Van Helsing admitting that his wife is in an asylum. Even the letters and diaries are written in different styles; for example, Seward's is restrained and analytical, while Mina's is exuberant and bright.Even Dracula himself is an overpowering presence despite his small amount of actual screen time, and not just as a vampire -- Stoker presents him as passionate, intense, malignant, and probably the smartest person in the entire book. If Van Helsing hadn't thwarted him, he probably would have taken over the world -- not the Victorian audience's ideal ending.This particular edition has been made to look almost exactly like the very first edition, down to the illusively-tattered dust jacket and distinctive title print. It also contains a couple short chapters from Dacre Stoker's sequel, \\"Dracula the Un-Dead.\\" It's a promising start, but believe me -- don't bother with the sequel. It will only send you running back to Stoker's original novel, sobbing hysterically.Intelligent, frightening and very well-written, \\"Dracula\\" is the well-deserved godfather of all modern vampire books and movies -- and its unique villain still dwarfs the more recent undead."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Reading Dracula was time well spent. The book was easier to read than I thought it would be given the time in which it was written. There were some parts that aged the book and Bram could have done without a lot of the character praise, but other than that, Dracula made a good vampire."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula, by Bram Stoker, is a superb book to read. It is filled with adventure, excitement, love, and pain. I am a fairly conservative reader, by that I mean that I do not typically read for long periods of time, but Dracula was one book that I couldn't put down once I was fully engulfed by the story.Written like a true novelist, Bram Stoker takes a different approach to how books had been typically written. The book is a conglomeration of journals, diaries, memorandums, and newspaper clippings. As if the events actually occurred in real life, and Jonathan Harker, one of the main characters, actually brought together the papers and published them. Or, better yet, you, the reader, happen to stumble upon a collection of diaries that had been kept in safe keeping for years and years; hidden from the world, because the world is safer in ignorance from the horrid monster Dracula. Dracula is by far one of the most classic villains that fiction has yet seen, and it is terrible - yet exciting - to see his terrible deeds at work throughout the story.I like the story a great deal, and recommend to everyone that they read it if they want an exciting story to keep their imagination going throughout the night."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula, a 19th century horror book, is holding true to its genre, despite its age. This book had me at the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. The book is set up in a journalistic/letter written style, making it more suspensful. You may find that the letter you are reading is a simple entry in the character's life, or the last letter/entry that they'll ever write. This book takes its time by showing the characters emotions and lives than rushing through it like most movies. This is Dracula, in his freakiest form...his first."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"When I first started reading the book it was confusing but as time went on the plot became clear to me. My favorite part of the novel is when Dracula takes his first victim, Lucy, to the darkside. Mina went looking for her in the middle of the night and found her outside with a creature on top of her. Another one of my favorite scenes in the novel is when Jonathan Harker meets Dracula for the first time and experiences the strange occurences around the house. For example, when he is shaving in the mirror and Dracula walks upbehind him and Jonathan did not see his reflection. I also liked the end of the novel, though Mina lost her love caused by his death it was death of true love and Dracula had had his many years in eaternal life and to get his true love back broke the spell that he had cast upon himself that ungreatful day so many years ago."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I recently finished reading Bram Stoker's Dracula and found it to be a very enticing. I was filled with much misconception before reading this novel because of all of the movies out there that never seem to quite follow the book they are basing it on. I thought the book gave a lot of feel and it almost seemed personal, as though the letters in the character's journals really are personally for each reader. I normally am not a fan of books that are written in that way, but I seemed to forget quite often that I was reading someone's journal. The story line is very creative, and I especially enjoyed it because I believe that Bram Stoker got his idea to write about Dracula, from Vlad Tepes II who took on the name Dracula after his father had taken the nickname Dracul. To me, it made the book far more interesting. Some things were just a tad bit too dark for my taste, but other than that... the characters were developed very well. It is a fantasy, so everything is going to be unrealistic, such as the characters not having many flaws to show forth. I was curious to know more about Dracula, and how he became the way he did. Overall this is a great book and I encourage anyone who doesn't mind lots of gore, to really dig into this book. It is suspenseful and it sends chills up and down your spine.I personally think that although this story will remain an unforgettable classic... there should be something written about the real Dracula, Vlad Tepes."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker's Dracula came as a nice surprise. I expected a dull, dreary period piece with a small amount of horror thrown in; instead I was treated to a fine tale of monstrous terror lit by a backdrop of Victorian gaslights.As you know, Dracula is a vampire. A vampire's lot in life (or unlife) is to exist with a wanton need for human blood, living forever while feeding upon the souls of its victims. Vampires are immortal; or can be as long as they consume human blood, which is their primary form of sustenance. They can turn themselves into a foggy mist. They can change their shape to resemble bats or wolves, among other things. They have the power to hypnotize their prey, and even have the power to turn their victims undead as they are, cursing their victims for eternity. For the vampire is not alive as we know it; they live in a state of undeath. Their bodies appear human, yet the uniquely human qualities of the vampire are long dead.Vampires routinely scheme for power, or failing that they scheme simply out of boredom. Humans are their unwitting pawns.Dracula begins with the journals of Jonathan Harker, who has been hired by the Count Dracula to prepare the Count's legal affairs for the purpose of an extended trip to London the Count wishes to take. While in Dracula's castle, Harker is tormented by the Count and various other fiends within the walls of the castle. Harker is prohibited from exploring the castle during his stay, yet his curiosity gets the better of him and Harker finds himself plunged into a supernatural pit of despair. Dracula intends to bind Harker within the castle until the arrangements for the London trip are finalized, and mostly succeeds; Harker finally leaves, but is mentally scarred and in no position to challenge the Count's behavior.Fast forward a bit, and we meet Dr. Seward, a \\"modern\\" psychologist working in an asylum, Mina, Harker's fianc&eacute;e, playing the womanly role of helpless victim (yet one of the most clever and quick witted characters in the book), pining for his return and worrying about his whereabouts, and Lucy, Mina's friend and confidant who seems to be having trouble sleeping...Lucy, you see, has been having bouts with sleepwalking and Mina has become concerned. She calls upon Dr. Seward, and he in turn calls his mentor, Dr. Van Helsing, to assist in his examination of Lucy's mental state. Lucy begins to feel physically ill, complaining of extreme weakness and is perpetually tired. Van Helsing is getting suspicious, and calls for blood transfusions to assist poor Lucy and her weakness.Van Helsing is the best character in the book. He plays the part of the imminently respected doctor who still has respect for the old ways and traditions. His speeches are loaded with bombastic, Victorian charm, and never is he at a loss for words. Melodramatic might be a nice word for him, but I don't think it's strong enough. Imagine a player who can speak for pages at a time, yet for every 500 words of apology, politeness, and trying to \\"protect\\" his acquaintances from the unspeakable truth, he might speak 10 words which get to the POINT. I found him charming in the same sense as an actor over-dramaticizing their role to the max; think of William Shatner playing the role in all his over-the-top glory.The story moves along with a bit of a slow pace, but the language Stoker uses and the tension-building skills he possesses shine through. Other characters, such as Lucy's husband Arthur, are well drawn and each has a clear personality of their own. The personalities shine through in Stoker's use of journals and diaries by the players throughout Dracula.We learn that Van Helsing has used his years of background studies to conclude that Lucy's ailments are the result of numerous \\"feedings\\" by a nightmarish creature in their midst - the vampire! The plot snowballs from there, and the band of confidants develop a plan to rid their nights of the vampire menace. That's enough plot for now; I don't want to be a spoiler!The supernatural fear that Stoker invokes is quite real. For each incredible ghoulish power Dracula holds, the solutions are equally supernatural in nature. Mostly, the weapons to ward off vampires include Catholic symbols such as the Crucifix and pieces of the Host. For me, the solutions are every bit as frightening as the problem; it seems to me that using faith as a weapon vs. the very real fear of death can be an intimidating prospect. What happens if you are an unbeliever? These characters are believers, but there is no doubt that they too question (not in so many words) placing their lives in the hands of mystical wards against evil. Harrowing stuff, if you read between the lines.The essence of Victorian life is used as the perfect backdrop to our story. Van Helsing understands too well that the \\"modern\\" world no longer wishes to accept such creatures as vampires. Dr. Seward, a man of the times, is forced to admit that Van Helsing is on the right track; even though it was Van Helsing's teachings that brought Seward to the top of his profession. The teacher didn't tell him everything, and with good reason.Dracula doesn't make too many personal appearances within these pages. He is used as a phantom, and fleeting glimpses out of the corner of your eye are all you see of him. Foe me, this accents the horror of this unnatural \\"man\\". Often, Stoker will allude to the terror, and just when you think the writer will refrain from placing the horror before your eyes, he goes for the throat. This was cutting edge material when it was new, and reads very well today. Certainly the readership 100 years ago were shocked out of their skin when reading about the three sisters, or asking themselves what exactly did Dracula do to that poor woman...?An outstanding novel, and easily convinced me why it's been so popular over the years. A must for any fan of horror fiction."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"\\"Dracula\\" was not the first vampire novel, nor was it Bram Stoker's first book.

K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I know it's blasphemy, but hear me out! Did I enjoy this book? Yes. Do I recommend it? Yes. However readers need to be warned about the Van Helsing diatribes. Even those who are fans of flowery victorian prose will find this trying. It's this alone that hinders the pace of this book and had I been warned ahead of time, I think I would have enjoyed Dracula more than I did. That aside, let's get to the good points.The journal entries as a form of telling the story are unique and work for the story. Stoker is quite capable of providing each character a distinctive voice making them personable and the reader that much more involved. Especially with Harker and Mina. But it can lag due to the reasons stated above.Some of the scenes are downright scary! When the pace picks up, the descriptive writing combined with years of media perception surprisingly adds to the enjoyment of reading this. Not to mention Renfield is a force to be reckoned with in the book wheras he is parodied in most movies. I found myself getting goosebumps and that's saying something for a book written about a century ago.And lastly the major theme of the book is a sheer delight. Science over mysticism. The 1800's must have been an interesting time. It's the century that invented psychology and yet people were still being arrested for witchcraft. This is Stoker's master stroke. He captures the excitment and conflict of these elements perfectly. More so than Frankenstein, which is more of a scientific morality tale. Here they embrace it and save for Coppola's half-hearted attempt, none of the movies have bothered to touch on it.Dracula is a good book, but I just couldn't get into Van Helsing. Highly recommended though. A classic that captures it's time and doesent wane with it."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Although I'm not much of a horror fan, I decided to read Dracula since it was considered a classic and was hopefully pretty good. I'm glad I read it. It was a very interesting story. It wasn't what I was expecting. The whole novel is written as if you're reading someone's diary, telegram or news article. It starts with Jonathan Harker(a lawyer if I remember correctly) who is summoned to Count Dracula's castle to help Dracula obtain a home in London. He soon realizes Dracula is no ordinary man, but some kind of beast. This section takes about 1/4 of the book and then, after some deaths surrounded with unusual and frightening circumstances, Jonathan, along with some other interesting characters commit to not only prevent Dracula's move to London, but to kill him. This book was interesting in the fact that it was almost as if Dracula is not the main character of the novel, and I suppose in some ways, he's not. The book focuses much more on this group of people's attempts to hinder Dracula's actions and to cause his demise. Also, I liked reading the book and discovering the original story behind Dracula, not just all of the spoofs and parodies one sees today. I liked finding out that besides not liking garlic, crosses and sunlight, vampires also can't pass running water and can turn into wolves as well as bats. Although I can't say I was ever particularly scared reading this novel(probably because I don't really believe in vampires), I did find this novel to be very good, especially considering horror isn't one of the genres I'm particularly fond of. I definitely think it's worth picking up this book and reading it."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

So, with the repeated reference to Bram Stoker's Dracula, I thought it a good idea to simply pick it up and perhaps give it a bit of a browse. I could not put the book down and you won't either. It is a gothic thriller that plays exquisitely with the reader's imagination so much more than any more recent work could ever do. The book did not give me any nightmares either - it isn't some cheap bit capitalizing on fleshy gore and disgusting goo. Instead, this book is an awesome exploration of how humanity both defines and fights evil.

All one has to do is look at the proliferation of vampire novels on the shelves to know that. Bram Stoker created a creature so hideous,unnatural and undead, yet so alluring that young beautiful women were unable to resist his call. His very bite is sensual yet deadly. Well done is Stoker's use of journals and diary's from his main characters to build tension and suspense as the novel moves along. The story begins with Jonathan Harker's visit to Castle Dracula and his unfortunate experience with the Count. Through his journal we learn of the Count's plans for the future. His fiance Mina who embodies in this novel, all that is good, waits patiently for him to return home. A mysterious boat lands ashore in England and the Count's plans are set into motion. His unholy meeting with Lucy Westerna, at once sensuous as it is hideous propels the story from grimness to horror as the characters slowly realize what is happening to her. Unbelievably but with the help of Dr. Abraham Van Helsing, they realize that poor Lucy is being victimized by a vampire and is herself at risk of becoming one of the undead. It is Van Helsing who guides the group who is bound together by their knowledge of who Dracula really is and ultimately propels the main characters into the exciting climax between good and evil. Readers may find the stilted language and role of women somewhat off putting until they remember what era it was intended for. As stated before, there is a reason, Dracula is still in print, it still has the capacity to make your heart beat just a little more rapidly and sleep come a little more slowly as you make sure you shut your window tightly against any breeze or whatever will blow in."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"\\"Dracula\\" was not the first vampire novel, nor was it Bram Stoker's first book. But after years of research, Stoker managed to craft the ultimate vampire novel, which has spawned countless movies, spinoffs, and books that follow the blueprint of the Transylvanian count.Real estate agent Jonathan Harker arrives in Transylvania, to arrange a London house sale to Count Dracula. But as the days go by, Harker witnesses increasingly horrific events, leading him to believe that Dracula is not actually human. His fiancee Mina arrives in Transylvania, and finds that he has been feverish. Meanwhile the count has vanished.And soon afterwards, strange things happen: a ship piloted by a dead man crashes on the shore, after a mysterious thing killed the crew. A lunatic talks about \\"Him\\" coming. And Mina's pal Lucy dies of mysterious blood loss, only to come back as an undead seductress. Dracula has arrived in England -- and he's not going to be stopped easily.\\"Dracula\\" is the grandaddy is Lestat and other such vampires, but that isn't the sole reason why it is a classic. It's also incredibly atmospheric, and very well-written. Not only is it very freaky, in an ornate Victorian style, but it is also full of restrained, quiet horror and creepy eroticism. What's more, it's shaped the portrayal of vampires in movies and books, even to this day.Despite already knowing what's going on for the first half of the book, it's actually kind of creepy to see these people whose lives are being disrupted by Dracula, but don't know about vampires. It's a bit tempting to yell \\"It's a vampire, you idiots!\\" every now and then, but you can't really blame them. Then the second half kicks in, with accented professor Van Helsing taking our heroes on a quest to save Mina from Dracula.And along the way, while our heroes try to figure stuff out, Stoker spins up all these creepy hints of Dracula's arrival. Though he wrote in the late 19th-century manner, very verbose and a bit stuffy, his skill shines through. The book is crammed with intense, evocative language, with moments like Dracula creeping down a wall, or the dead captain found tied to the wheel. Once read, they stick in your mind throughout the book.It's also a credit to Stoker that he keeps his characters from seeming like idiots or freaks, which they could have easily seemed like. Instead, he puts little moments of humanity in them, like Van Helsing admitting that his wife is in an asylum. Even the letters and diaries are written in different styles; for example, Seward's is restrained and analytical, while Mina's is exuberant and bright.Intelligent, frightening and very well-written, \\"Dracula\\" is the well-deserved godfather of all modern vampire books and movies -- and arguably among the best."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"While this novel, is, of course, about the Count, it is the ghost busters in the novel that tell the story, even if that is not what they are to start with. Except in the case of the important character in the history and tradition of ghost busting and monster hunting, in Van Helsing.Dracula is an important enough novel to include from that point of view, here, as he educates and motivates the group of poms and a yank to get down and stakey."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"After getting into some The Undead and Philosophy: Chicken Soup for the Soulless (Popular Culture and Philosophy), I decided that I had been greatly remiss in not reading Bram Stoker's classic \\"Dracula\\".Surprisingly, this was only one of many novels written by Stoker, though by far the most popular. It has not once been out of print since it was published. Not a bad achievement, really.The book is written through documents, and covers a large range of changing viewpoints. Those documents include journals of the main characters, (such as Jonathan Harker), letters, telegrams, newspaper reports, and so on. I thought it strange, but this style of writing works exceptionally well and is a mark of Stoker's ability. It gives a greater air of authenticity to the plot, which is creepy enough, in itself.The basic plot is a creepy tale of Count Dracula who decides to move to England and start a new \\"life\\" there. Buying up properties, Jonathan Harker has to travel to the Count with the papers. What follows is a series of strange and mysterious events that leave people puzzled and wondering. Dracula is hatching his own vile plans for the land of England.The narrative flows along very well, and keeps the right level of tension. In some places, things just get freaky, but it all adds up to a very eerie and tense tale. This is among the best books of the type I have read.Set in later Victorian England, the heavy duty sexuality that exudes from the book was something of a surprise. Never crossing the line into crass obscenity, Stoker weaves a sexuality throughout the vampire encounters that is almost palpable and would have been shocking in his day. One can see where the inspiration for Lestat and more modern vampires comes from, (if one had missed the obvious, that is!).There was one thing that made the book a little tough to get through in places: the dated and very 19th century English. Of course, to change it into a more modern dialect would be verging on sacrilege, but a potential reader would need to be aware of it. Some parts I found a little tough and I had to really think about the meaning. However, in some ways, this added to the charm of the book as the language is actually quite nice for the most part.\\"Dracula\\" is truly a classic, and definitely comes with this reviewer's unreserved recommendation. It is simply a great read and it is a pivotal book for all the immitations that it spawned."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Thank you for the smooth, fast transaction.

It is not, really, engrossing."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"i love this book so much the movie was great but i have to say i love the book just a little more .if your a vampire lover this book is for you .its everything you would wont in a vampire romance novel."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I'm not sure I'd call this classic a true \\"horror\\" novel, even given the subject matter and reputation. It's more a novel of impending dread, which doesn't rely on actions as much as atmosphere. While the Victorian writing style takes some effort, Stoker's skill at dialogue and characterization brings everything to life.So much has been inspired by 'Dracula' that I wonder what movies or other books we would lack if he'd never written it. Granted, he wasn't the first to write the 'fellowship quest' narrative, but you'll see the echoes in most any book with a cast of disparate characters trying to achieve a common goal. Because Dracula stays off the page for most of the book, he's a threat more than a villain. That helps build the tension, but readers expecting fights on every page would be disappointed. But, that's why the story succeeds - the threat of what's coming, and the stakes that the team of heroes are fighting for.The Victorian writing style holds up very well, even in the present day where there is much less appreciation for language. But, it does take work. I love Stephen King, but he's someone whose books I can blaze through because the care for each word just isn't there. There's no skimming Stoker. You have to really put the effort in to read each sentence, because it might take a few paragraphs for the meaning to become clear. It's definitley a different reading experience than I think most of us are used to.The ending remains a little abrubt, and without the clear payoff that a contemporary author would probably work toward.Overall, it holds up as a classic novel of suspense and dread, and certainly a horrific subject."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"After reading The Historian by Elizabeth Kostova - a modern day re-telling of the Dracula legend, I just had to follow it with the Bram Stoker original. It's been awhile since I read a classic piece of literature (back in January, I delved into Guy de Maupassant's Bel Ami), and it wasn't until about 50 pages in that I was able to adjust to the 19th century vernacular. While it took me longer to finish (about a week), it was well worth the extra effort to become immersed in a Gothic masterpiece.Before delving into the pages, my perception was tainted by the Dracula caricature distributed by Hollywood, most notably the immortal 1931 Bella Lugosi performance of a wild-eyed, cape-wearing villain lurking in the shadows. I didn't know much about Stoker's actual storyline, and I was surprised at how fleetingly the count appears in the novel. Even though his motivations dictate the majority of the action, Dracula plays more of a supporting role letting a host of other characters take the lead.It's funny, but in both The Historian and this earlier rendition, Dracula comes across as cartoonish. For Stoker's 1897 audience, the limited development can be attributed to the fact that the subject of vampires was considered quite shocking for the time period. Yet as one of the main contributors to the horror genre canon, the writing style is nevertheless quaint and antiquated for 21st century sensibilities. Much of the dialogue comes across as affected with overly exaggerated emotion. It's like watching a silent movie filled with fluttering eyelashes and arched eyebrows with melodramatic lines such as, \\"On your living soul I charge you that you do not die - nay, nor think of death - till this great evil be past.\\"I was not steeped in vampire lore and only recognized the name Van Helsing from the 2004 movie starring Hugh Jackman. Needless to say, the vampire hunter of Stoker's creation is an elderly Dutch physician who speaks in stilted English and proceeds against his foe more through trial and error than any definitive knowledge. He employs the superstitions he encounters in his research to combat Dracula - garlic, a crucifix, even wafers of the Holy Eucharist. He comes across partly as a comedic figure who is bumbling through his investigation, but in the end through happenstance or luck ends up on the right track.Interestingly, Dracula is written in letter/journal format much like the technique used in The Historian. The main characters each lend a hand to advance the narrative. Jonathan Harker, an English clerk, begins the tale as a prisoner in Dracula's Transylvanian castle. Mina Murray, his fiancee, begins to the see the connection between Jonathan's tale of captivity and her friend Lucy Westenra's strange behavior. Leading Lucy's three suitors to be drawn into the mix- her betrothed, Arthur Holmwood, a titled nobleman; Dr. Seward, the caretaker of an insane asylum and Quincey Morris, a plain-speaking, adventure-loving American. After Lucy's tragic \\"death,\\" they all band together under Van Helsing's leadership to put an end, once and for all, to the undead entity named Dracula.Stoker excels in setting a scene. He is a master at creating atmosphere. It feels as if you are sitting in the horse-drawn carriage with Jonathan Harker as he ascends the Carpathian Mountains to the very heart of Dracula's lair. You can feel the mist in your face. You can hear the wolves howling in the distance. You can see the terror in the eyes of his fellow passengers. The aura of foreboding is palpable. Another captivating scene is the arrival of Dracula's ship at the English port of Whitby. A horrific storm heralds the vessel's appearance on the horizon. Battling the wind and waves, it runs aground of its own accord without a crew. The body of the dead captain is tied to the wheel, a crucifix in his lifeless hands. Horror writing doesn't get much better than this.Overall, a thrilling journey back to the Victorian beginning of popular culture's vampire obsession."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I was taking an English class called the Victorian Novel this past spring, and I had heard from my professor and another that I was TA-ing for that it was a very good book, but that it was not like the vampire books of today. One said, \\"It's not exactly the sexy vampire of Twilight.\\" It seemed as though they were trying to let me down easy, or let me know that I may be disappointed. I had been super excited, but after speaking about it, my excitement had dulled down and I felt forced to not expect too much . . .The effect was that I loved it. There were of course times that I wanted to just skip whole pages of description, a Victorian era novel will do that too you, but overall I really enjoyed it. I'm not into the whole sparkly skinned version of vampire that Twilight pushes, I'm more into the realistic (if you can use the term realistic in association with vampires) version of vampires that Anne Rice paints. I have to admit the end was a bit of a let down, I was expecting it to be much more intense than it actually was, but I can't complain too much because afterall, good prevailed.One of my teachers told me, before I started reading, to pay close attention to Quincey Morris. He said that after I read it I should come talk to him about whether or not I thought Morris was good or evil. I have my own opinion, but I encourage everyone who may read this book to consider this question. Be open minded(young readers!) about the book that started the vampire fad, and to really consider the characters. There maybe a tad too much description, but like I said it goes with the Victorian territory. Also look for pro-female moments and very sensual scenes that the readers of the time may not have been able to pick up on, but that modern day readers certainly cannot ignore."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"The influence of Bram Stoker's famous novel is unmistakable, spawning countless film adaptations about Dracula and vampires and planting the seeds of popular vampire legends and myth in books and movies the past 200 years. Being that many of us have been exposed to so many of these tales of vampire lore in one way or another, it is easy to read Stoker's and feel like we've \\"been there, read that.\\" After all, creepy castles, blood sucking vampires, supernatural occurrences, and sinister villains have been repeated many times in stories. Some seem to quantify Dracula's greatness--of lack of greatness-- in terms of its level of \\"scariness.\\" However, I think the book's significance and relevance outweighs any level of frights or literary perfection. The book has its flaws, and it drones on at points, and even becomes too preachy and melodramatic; but, when it does have its share of frights and mood, it is really on its game.Exceptional atmospheric moments clearly demonstrate the novel's strength, and really emphasize an ominous, supernatural, unearthly feel to the book, and its main villain. It is a strange argument, but I would say that the scenes with Dracula meticulously in the background weaving his mischief are stronger than the ones where he is actually present. A vindictive quality exists within Dracula that makes him a little atypical: he doesn't need to be there physically to have his sinister presence felt. Seemingly invisible from most of the plot, he still controls characters, the mood, and to a certain extent, the plot. Dracula's sheer evilness does not lie only in his willingness to do harm on others, but his ability to control. He is almost ghostly or transparent in these moments, and can seemingly control thoughts, and take on many forms. Jonathan Harker, in the novel's first part, feels Dracula's presence, and a terror comes upon him as he finds out his is a prisoner; but there is a sort of mental terror that he absorbs from his experiences that he takes with him the rest of the book. There is one bizarre scene when Harker believes his reason is failing him because he seemingly sees Dracula scaling a wall like an animal. When he comes back to Mina, she clearly thinks Jonathan must be under some form of temporary mental illness, but others will soon see what Jonathan saw--and felt-- also. Renfeld, Dr. Seward's patient in the asylum, is the best example of Dracula's vindictiveness and empowering effects. Renfeld raves on madly about the coming of some sinister being, chases down lives in the forms of flies and other insects, and seems to hear and see what others can't. Seward is at wit's end trying to figure this out in his patient. Dracula also influences superstitions within those in Transylvania, and controls both Mina Harker and Lucy Westerna, two main female characters in the novel.In many respects, Dracula is bigger and badder when he's not there physically, but lurking in the character's conscience, residing in the dark.However, as much as I appreciate Stoker's novel, it is the flaws which make the book less than enjoyable, and render it less than a favorite. It fails is in its overly drawn out monologues by various characters such as Van Helsing and Dr. Seward, and its overly melodramatic moments when the male characters become nauseatingly emotional and genteel. Another issue was the second half of the story, which seems to plod along at a very slow pace with plenty of \\"filler\\", and, as one reviewer noted, makes the resolution somewhat anticlimactic. Van Helsing begins a quest to go after Dracula, and gets the male characters involved, but it seems that this takes forever to actual materialize.Still, I think this is a book that has much importance, and should be read. I've actually read it twice, but each time it was a chore to get through. Read it for its fantastic atmosphere, which still resonates and has influence in many scary movies today."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Ever so often during reading you may find it difficult because he writes it in a sort of journal fashion. Once I was finished reading I decided to rent the movie. The movie I rented was copywrited for 1931, watching the movie realy helped me sort out what was happening in the book. The movie was quite different in parts it often left the plot of the book.

You don't get the story from his point of view, but you do see it from his victims points of view. I don't see Dracula romanticized in the book, the way he is in the films. In the book, he is nasty, and just plain evil.All in all, this was a good book. I'm glad I read it. My only problem with it was that it was toooo long.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula wasn't either the first or the best vampire story, but it was the first that was wildly popular. There are many reasons for its popularity, among other things because it was pretty racy for the time. Also, the vampire theme was and still is a very compelling and manifold subject. However, I suspect there is another reason for its popularity. Stories like &quot;La morte amoureuse,&quot; by Th&eacute;ophile Gautier, and &quot;Carmilla,&quot; by Joseph Sheridan LeFanu, preceded Dracula by many years, and, from the point of view of literary quality, they both leave Dracula eating dust, but few people have read them. The fact is, these are pretty ambiguous stories: good and evil are not separated by neat and precise borders. They are not merely scary, they are disturbing. On the other hand, Dracula is very straightforward and simplistic. On the one hand, you have Dracula, a totally evil force, on the other, the &quot;brave men&quot; and Mina, who represent the forces of civilization and &quot;therefore,&quot; they are perfectly good. In this picture, Lucy and Renfield are the most interesting characters, because they are the only ones that stand in a grey area. The &quot;message&quot; of the story is that you can always defeat the forces of darkness, as long as you have the right technology and the right money, and as long as the powers of civilized life are on your side. This is simply not the way it works, however.Most movie Draculas are more interesting than Stoker's Dracula. In the movies, correctly I think, they have generally tried to make Dracula more seductive, and sometimes even charming. In the book, Dracula is more like a rapist, and utterly disagreeable. You might end up rooting for him, though, disagreeable as he is, because the good guys are so nerve-grating. They are more like caricatures than real people. Harker, Seward and Lord Godalming are Ye Olde Stolid Englishmen. Mina, the &quot;New Woman,&quot; is too much like the &quot;Old Woman,&quot; only typing instead of sewing. But we know that they all are wonderful, because they themselves tell you so, all the time. Let's say there are some books that are important because they are good books, and others are important because of their influence: Dracula enters in the second category. I think it is still necessary to read it, for educational purposes, but not really for pleasure."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"Now that vampire stories are popular again (and thank God for that), it's easy to forget what they were like before Anne Rice got her hands on them. That's not to say anything bad about Rice, incidentally--she's the reigning contemporary vampire queen, and many vampire writers follow her lead these days (or try to). But when Bram Stoker invented this genre with this iconic novel, the vampire was a thing of pure dread and pure evil. There's precious little reader seduction here (which is the characterizing difference of Anne Rice's creations); no, in Dracula, when the characters are seduced, the reader cringes, turns on another light, and drinks more heavily into the succeeding chapters ...Some who have reviewed this book have called it slow, boring, Victorian in the extreme ... well, they say there's no arguing taste, but I think I'll have a try, anyway. The fact is, most of what passes for \\"scary\\" these days has to do with instant fright gratification (which, by the way, I'm all in favor of), splashing gore, vividly-described mutilations. Stoker works his flame of fear up from the embers, burning slowly, until by the time you hear the rising scream, you've scarcely realized it's your own. There's a lot that happens \\"off camera\\", you might say, hinted at in the journal writings. The reader must infer for full effect; the terror is not served up on an easily handled tray, like cafeteria food. Dracula is literature, enjoyed at several levels, but it is also an excellent pulp horror story, told in the traditions of its time. It's lack of universal appeal in this modern age simply shows that it has not ... aged well, I suppose. But I loved it.For myself, when I write, I'm a creature of this age, an unapologetic purveyor of in-you-face, vividly described scary stories. But the classics have, for me, a distinct and pleasing flavor virtually unimitable by the modern writer. And keeping in touch with your roots is, I think, a good thing.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire book \\"Teeth: a Horror Fantasy\\".)"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Written in 1897, Stoker's Dracula is a classic of British fiction, fascinating for its subject matter and still the subject of films a hundred years later. Count Dracula, the epitome of evil, is exotic enough to keep even the most jaded reader of his exploits interested in their outcome, and grounded enough in the reality of evil to make even doubters wonder whether evil can be transmitted from one person to another against one's will.The novel begins with the arrival of Jonathan Harker, a lawyer representing a London real estate agency, at the Transylvanian castle of Count Dracula to clinch the deal by which the count will move to a British estate. Details about Harker's arrival by coach, his greeting at the castle, which has no doors except the front door, his reception by the count (who has hair on the palms of his hands), and his instructions regarding where he may go or not go within the castle set the tone and establish the mysterious background of the count and a sense of dread regarding the outcome for Harker.By the time that Harker recovers from a long and mysterious illness and returns home, the count, already in London, has turned Lucy, a lovely ingenue, into a vampire. Dr. Van Helsing, a German expert on vampires hired by her family, saves her several times from what appears to be severe anemia and recommends ringing her room with garlic and making sure that she has crucifixes around her. When Dracula then turns his blood-thirsty attention to Mina, fianc&eacute;e of Jonathan Harker and friend of the unfortunate Lucy, the scene is set for a showdown regarding Dracula's power vs. the power of goodness and traditional religion.Stoker takes his story beyond sheer melodrama, eliciting sympathy for the afflicted victims of Dracula while also recreating the religious atmosphere of the period and the beliefs and doubts of average citizens. The novel is far more compelling than I expected, creating suspense at the same time that it develops the character of the count with his supernatural powers. The climax in which the forces of good are ranged against the forces of evil in the shape of the count, whose long history is detailed in the novel, is truly a conflict between traditional religion and evil in the form of Satan personified. Fun to read and surprisingly affecting. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This year is the 110th anniversary of the publication of Dracula. Dracula, or Count Dracula, is probably the most famous vampire of them all. After one hundred years, Dracula is so ingrained into vampire mythology that when we think vampires - we think Dracula.You could argue that the reason for this began with F.W. Murnau's film Nosferatu. Although the main character, wonderfully portrayed by Max Schreck, is referred to as Count Orlok - the viewing public were not fooled! Thousands of fans knew Murnau was telling the Dracula story! And so began a phenomenon, Dracula is now the most portrayed character in the horror genre - beating the likes of Frankenstein - and notching up over 160 portrayals. Most notable of these, apart from the previously mentioned Max Schreck, include those by: Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee and, more recently, Gary Oldman.So, does this explain the unbelievable success of the Dracula novel? Are the scores of portrayals serving as huge advertising campaigns? Is this the reason why one hundred years on thousands of copies of Dracula are still being sold? Of course not!Bram Stoker's Dracula completely captured the imagination of the reading public. One of the reasons for this is that it is not written like a novel - one unknown voice telling you a story. Stoker's Dracula is told to us by many voices all of which are characters within Dracula. The protagonists tell us the story through diary entries, newspaper clippings and letters. This style of story telling adds to our fear while reading, as it immerses us in the character's plight and gives us the impression that these events could be based on truth. You may think this last statement ludicrous and it probably is, but the fact that we have never found the burial place of Vlad Dracula (Vlad the Impaler), only adds to an air of uncertainty. When you are alone at night, a copy of Dracula on the bedside table, the wind and rain pelting against the windowpane, what seems ridiculous in cold light of day seems only the more real with the unexplained noises that occur during the night.One of the most interesting reasons why Dracula has survived the test of time is quite simply; it is the ancestor of all vampire novels. All other vampire stories are descendants of it, even Anne Rice, who refers to Dracula in one of her novels as the, \\"vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman,\\" cannot dispute that her novels are descended from it.How do we know that every vampire novel is descended from Bram Stoker's? The reason is simple, Stoker set down a list of vampire rules, and every book that followed after has used these rules. These rules may have been reinterpreted but still today, most stay remarkably true to Stoker's original vampire laws. Stakes through the heart, fear of religious symbols, sleeping in coffins- these are all Bram Stoker's ideas. All modern portrayals of vampires and vampire slayers use Stoker's story as a benchmark, or something to aspire too. You could even argue that Buffy the Vampire Slayer's watcher is a modern interpretation of Van Helsing.Stoker was also the first person to coin the term \\"Un-Dead,\\" used to this day by fiction writers to refer to vampires or zombies. Not many writers have ever achieved the accolade of inventing a word that becomes automatically absorbed into the English language.In conclusion, if you are a avid reader looking to read one of the classics, you can't go wrong with Bram Stoker's Dracula, and like wise if you are aspiring horror writer- make it first on your list of books to read and inspire you."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

I want to give this book as many stars as possible because it was one of the most amazing books I have ever read! I am not sure that I would feel the same if I read it instead of listening to it but I am pretty sure I would have.I have never read this book because I am not a huge fan of Vampires and it usually takes a great story for me to read one but I kept hearing \\"I am shocked you have never read Dracula before\\" a lot so when I seen and audio book with a full cast I had to give it a try! :)I don't know that I would say it is a horror book because non of it is super scary but all of it is suspenseful and makes you want to keep reading. Loved the way they talked and described everything it makes you feel like you are teleported back in time.Great classic and now one of my favorite all time books."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

It pretty much gave birth to the genre, and for that reason at least it demands respect.But, in short, and putting all literary pretension to one side; the meandering plot told as phlegmatic diary entries from umpteen different perspectives and the dawdling pace at which the now overly-familiar (to a modern reader) events unfold make this a crushing bore of a gothic novel."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

I just loved it!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This is not an audiobook. It is a dramatic \\"adaptation\\" of the book. While listening, you will note that it has a large cast and this makes the characters distinguishable, which is its strength. However, the adaptation does not include the non-dialog portions of the book. There is no narrator. So you have no idea where the action is taking place, what is happening in terms of action, and only hear the dialog between the cast members. It is as if you are hearing only the audio portion of a play or a movie (of course without any visuals). Since the settings include locations all over Europe, there is no hint that the setting is changing at any time. The listener is completely disoriented. There are lots of sound effects, and those are sometimes useful in figuring out some of the action, but portions of the sound effect channels are so loud that it is difficult to understand the dialog you are trying to hear over them. I am disappointed in this as an audiobook, and do not recommended it to anyone looking for one."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"The vampires in this book are nasty. They aren't shiny and sparkly. Don't know who this Bram Stoker thinks he is but these vampires are not hot like vampires are supposed to be.There is one main one Dracula as you'd guess and then his hos. I think there were three of them.Anyway they wear old out of style loose fitting clothing and live in a moldy dirty-ass old castle.They also use some old school 50 cents words like a bunch of nerds.I like the plot though. It was pretty good. This guy is going to solicit real estate appraisals or something, door to door salesman I guess, and he gets all caught up in the head vampire trying to come to England. I don't wanna spoil it, but he's a tricky vampire. He is just nasty though, so you are forewarned."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"Although Stoker is not the greatest at creating sympathetic human characters, I really enjoyed his now infamous monstrosities, Dracula and the weird sisters. The Transylvanian setting is commendable as well. Unfortunately (and this is terrible), it seems that Bram Stoker did not realize his true talent. The rest of this story is mostly about his flat human characters from London, the most annoying of which is Mina, who tries to act mysterious by giving Van Helsing an unintelligible diary as a joke. The most redeeming aspect of the rest of the novel is Lucy's suspenseful struggle against death, but after she finally dies, the author really has nothing left going for him. This is the trendsetting vampire novel however, so I highly recommend it nonetheless."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"As awesome as Dracula started out and as amazing some sections were within the first half, the book as a whole is a huge yawn. I saw this on a few lists of best horror novels of all time (even on a list as one of the scariest books of all time) and I could not disagree more. As I approached the end of the book, I began to wonder \\"how could this end yet, only fifty more pages to get to the climax of the book and start on the gore by the Count or to the Count?\\". Fifty pages turned into thirty, then twenty, then ten, and alas Bram got to the climax (if you can call such a disastrous ending) and began and ended it within a paragraph. No gore, no horror, no nothing. I wanted this to be something of horror lore, but it signifies only a waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I give this 1 star because the book arrived damaged, the red page edges had alot of damage, corners was damaged badly, It had a bad scratch down the middle of the pic on front, the back looked like it had been rubbed around on the floor and the binding was broke. I returned it got a 2nd copy and it was just about as bad. To me, Both copies looked USED not new."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I don't especially care for scary movies or books, so I've avoided this book over the years. However, with the preponderance of vampire lit in our culture I thought I'd finally crack the binding of this book. I didn't find it particularly spine-chilling or evocative-- perhaps I'm deadened to such paltry imagery summoned here compared with our modern mediums. Still, the plot was decent and as the progenitor of so much culture within the hoi polloi it is consistent with the recommendation of a must read."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Written in 1987 by as-of-then little-known author Bram Stoker, DRACULA has become the quintessential horror among British literature. Whether you call it 'Victorian' or not, this book is written in such a powerful and sublimely graphic fashion that you'll remember episodes and scenes for the rest of your life. Real and lovable characters, vividly drawn settings, high adventure, dark mystery, and a deliciously evil antagonist, DRACULA has very little to disappoint. Whether or not you think you're 'into' vampires or horrors, this classic novel is not one to be missed.By telling the story in the form of diaries, notes, and recollections from the main characters, Stoker succeeds in giving the book a very personal and 'real' feel. It does, however, limit the story to be told exclusively in the past tense, something Stoker was able to negotiate with skill. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the book to me was the continuity and appropriateness in which each characters 'writing' was accurately reflective of their individual personalities. This required Stoker to literally write in five unique and quite different styles, and gave the book much more appeal as the reader comes to know each of the narrators through their own writings and thoughts.DRACULA is certainly a product of its time. By today's standards, the over-chivalrous men would certainly be considered sexists, and the meek and mild-mannered women the product of some husband's brutality. Whatever the common attitudes are about such portrayals of men and women, the result was admittedly rather refreshing to me. Not that I'd rather men and women act like this today, but that something about it is nonetheless attractive. Also, the continual pleas to God for aid and salvation reflect the nearly universal spiritual beliefs of the time. Indeed, 'holy' sacraments are the protagonists' most effective weapons against Dracula. \\"In the name of the Father, the Son, and the --\\", is one of the most powerful and unforgettable scenes I've read in a while.As is commonly the case with many of the classics, this book is extremely predictable. That isn't to say that many parts of the book don't hold you in anticipation and suspense, but that the overall direction and outcome of the plot are easy to imagine. Also, the ending of the novel left me somewhat disappointed. To have so much build-up, so much preparation, fear, and suspense, come down to what it does can't help but to be somewhat of a let-down. While the triumph of the characters, who had gone through hardship and heartache, is great, I just couldn't help wishing that Dracula could have put up more of a fight (sorry if spoiler).Overall though, this excellent icon of British literature is highly entertaining and provocative. Memorable scenes and characters, suspense, and vivid descriptions make this one book to make time for. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.
