Studying fiction, plays, and poetry, she found a way to meld theoretical political philosophy and concrete personal commitment to action. Among her literary resources, the epics and plays of ancient Greece provided the ideal balance of politics and culture. In Hannah Arendt and the Politics of Tragedy, Pirro focuses especially on the influence of Greek tragedy on Arendt's political writings. Pirro casts Arendt's political thought as tragic storytelling, crafted to inspire her audience both to appreciate political freedoms and to act on those freedoms by participating in public life. Echoing an affinity for Greek drama common in the tradition of German philosophy and letters, Arendt draws on tragic characters, scenes, and dramatic conventions, as well as theories, to assess the maddening and often fatal contradictions of political life in modern times. Classical narratives of heroic achievements and failures shape the structure and content of Arendtian thought, as when she compares Jewish refugees' attempts to confront their stateless condition during the 1930s and 1940s to Ulysses's mythical quest. Turning her attention in the postwar years to the promise and limits of political freedom in American life, Arendt invokes Sophocles's last drama, Oedipus at Colonus, in an attempt to outline an alternative, aesthetic sense of political authority in the American Republic. In providing this new avenue of approach to Arendt, Pirro shows how elements of Greek tragedy helped her grapple with the problems of modern politics in the chaos of a universe without rules. Arendt enthusiasts and readers interested in the classics and politics will find fresh ideas to consider in Hannah Arendt and the Politics of Tragedy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MLNxQgAACAAJ&dq=Hannah+Arendt+and+the+Politics+of+Tragedy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Card Games for One","description":"Describes how to play one hundred and one varieties of solitaire, grouped according to difficulty in categories ranging from easy games, through moderate and challenging games, up to tough games.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SjRFAAAACAAJ&dq=Card+Games+for+One&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nonparametrics: Statistical methods based on ranks (Holden-Day series in probability and statistics)","description":"This reprint of a classic reference describes rank tests and estimating procedures derived from them, and gives an account of their properties.

For the rest of the decade, he alternated unsuccessful theatre ventures with increasingly important movies. Though he was a conscientious objector, he became one of England's biggest stars during the World War II era. When he moved to Hollywood after the war, success initially eluded him. But he eventually won an Academy Award nomination for A Star is Born (1954) and had steady work as an actor in nearly 50 films between 1963 and his death in 1984. During that time, he earned two additional Oscar nominations and was voted Cinema Actor of the Century by a panel of international critics in 1967. This reference book provides comprehensive coverage of his life and career. The volume begins with a brief biography and chronology, followed by an extensive annotated bibliography of works by and about him.

A searing, post-apocalyptic novel about a father and son's fight to survive, this \\"tale of survival and the miracle of goodness only adds to McCarthy's stature as a living master. It's gripping, frightening and, ultimately, beautiful\\" (San Francisco Chronicle). A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don't know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food and each other. The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, \\"each the other's world entire,\\" are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PfmjWho_zOAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"David Blaize","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Why I am a Zionist: Israel Jewish Identity and the Challenges of Today","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k2UvL2Jzl-gC&dq=Why+I+am+a+Zionist:+Israel+Jewish+Identity+and+the+Challenges+of+Today&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bushido Code","description":"Bushido: the samurai code of Japan is one of the most influential books ever written on \\"the way of the warrior.\\" A classic study of Japanese culture, the book outlines the moral code of the samurai way of living and the virtues every warrior holds dear.

The popular myth of Hippocrates being the father of medicine is dispelled by the fact that Hippocrates studied the works of Imhotep, the true father of medicine, and mentioned his name in his Hippocratic oath. Eleven famous African scholars who preceded Greek philosophers are profiled: Ptahhotep, Kagemni, Duauf, Amenhotep, Amenemope, Imhotep, Amenemhat, Merikare, Sehotepibre, Khunanup, and Akhenaten. These scholars' ideas on a variety of topics are discussed, including the emergence of science and reason, the moral order, books and education, and the clash of classes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C0O--JcdWxoC&dq=The+Egyptian+Philosophers:+Ancient+African+Voices+from+Imhotep+to+Akhenaten&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"While They're at War: The True Story of American Families on the Homefront","description":"Many Americans will never experience the gut-wrenching act of sending a loved one off to war, or the joy and stress of welcoming him or her home.

While professionally successful, Ani feels like the  traditional  route to female happiness (marriage, children, etc.) is rapidly passing her by. As a self-proclaimed modern-day feminist and independent woman, Ani is mortified that she even cares about this issue. But to her chagrin, try as she might (and she tries!), Ani just can t seem to push the issue out of her mind. Uninspired by the current plethora of books and TV shows depicting the ups and downs of the modern single female in witty, lighthearted tones, Ani decides to take matters into her own hands. The Other Side of Thirty chronicles Ani s efforts to ride the rapids of single life in the 21st century and figure out how to move forward and address head-on the issues that tug at her on a daily basis: dating, marriage, body image, self-confidence, careers and personal finances, and last but not least, building a life rich with simplicity, creativity, and small joys.

While Ani starts off thinking her problem is being single in her 30 s, she eventually comes to recognize that the root issue with which she is grappling is something much broader than that. As a result readers of all types singles, women, and none of the above will find wisdom and humor in Ani s tale about trying to move forward in life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Gox3bhOzVrAC&dq=The+Other+Side+of+Thirty:+Musings+of+a+Modern+Day+Bachelor+Gal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Escalation : Metaphors and Scenarios","description":"In this widely discussed and influential book, Herman Kahn probes the dynamics of escalation and demonstrates how the intensification of conflict can be depicted by means of a definite escalation ladder, ascent of which brings opponents closer to all-out war. At each rung of the ladder, before the climb proceeds, decisions must be made based on numerous choices. Some are clear and obvious, others obscure, but the options are always there. Thermonuclear annihilation, says Kahn, is unlikely to come through accident; but nations may elect to climb the ladder to extinction. The basic material for the book was developed in briefings delivered by Kahn to military and civilian experts and revised in the light of his findings of a trip to Vietnam in the 1960s. In On Escalation he states the facts squarely. He asks the reader to face unemotionally the terrors of a world fully capable of suicide and to consider carefully the alternatives to such a path. In the never-never land of nuclear warfare, where nuclear incredulity is pervasive and paralyzing to the imagination even for the professional analyst, salient details of possible scenarios for the outbreak of war, and even more for war fighting, are largely unexplored or even unnoticed. For scenarios in which war is terminated, the issues and possibilities of which are almost completely unstudied, the situation is even worse. Kahn's discussion throws light on the terrain and gives the individual a sense of the range of possibilities and complexities involved and are useful.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oku1mwEACAAJ&dq=On+Escalation+:+Metaphors+and+Scenarios&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Know Your Bird Sounds, Volume 1: Yard, Garden, and City Birds","description":"A text and audio guide to the songs and calls of 35 common birds of residential settings, city parks, and urban areas in eastern and central North America.

Nanochemistry: A Chemical Approach to Nanomaterials is the first textbook for teaching nanochemistry and adopts an interdisciplinary and comprehensive approach to the subject. It presents a basic chemical strategy for making nanomaterials and describes some of the principles of materials self-assembly over 'all' scales. It demonstrates how nanometre and micrometre scale building blocks (with a wide range of shapes, compositions and surface functionalities) can be coerced through chemistry to organize spontaneously into unprecedented structures, which can serve as tailored functional materials. Suggestions of new ways to tackle research problems and speculations on how to think about assembling the future of nanotechnology are given. Primarily designed for teaching, this book will appeal to graduate and advanced undergraduate students. It is well illustrated with graphical representations of the structure and form of nanomaterials and contains problem sets as well as other pedagogical features such as further reading, case studies and a comprehensive bibliography.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DXUoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Technologies of the Self: A Seminar with Michel Foucault","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_3wOAAAAQAAJ&dq=Technologies+of+the+Self:+A+Seminar+with+Michel+Foucault&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft, (Morley's Universal Library, No.12)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3NP39y6V0bMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Grandfathers' Clock","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t2uBiqyQNU8C&dq=My+Grandfathers%27+Clock&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Forgotten Planet / Contraband Rocket","description":"The renowned novelist and critic s private journals, spanning from his years as a high school student in the Bronx to early adult life in San Francisco. For fifty years Samuel Delany has cultivated a special relationship with language in works of fiction, criticism, and memoir that have garnered critical praise and legions of fans. The present volume the first in a series reveals a new dimension of his genius. In Search of Silence presents over a decade s worth of Delany s private journals, commencing in 1957 when he was still a student at the Bronx High School of Science, and ending in 1969 when he was living in San Francisco and on the verge of reconceiving the novel that would become Dhalgren. In these pages, Delany muses on the writing of the stories that will establish him as a science fiction wunderkind, the early years of his marriage to the poet Marilyn Hacker, performances as a singer-songwriter during the heyday of the American folk revival, travels in Europe, experiences in a New York City commune, and much more and crosses paths with artists working in many genres, including poets such as Robert Frost, W. H. Auden, and Marie Ponsot, and science fiction writers such as Arthur C. Clarke, Michael Moorcock, Roger Zelazny, and Joanna Russ. Delany scholar Kenneth R. James presents the journal entries alongside generous samplings of story outlines, poetry, fragments of novels and essays that have never seen publication, and more; James also provides biographical synopses and an extensive set of endnotes to supply contextual information and connect journal material to Delany s published work.  This is a tremendously significant and vital addition to the oeuvre of Samuel Delany; it clarifies questions not only of the writer s process, but also his development to see, in his juvenilia, traces that take full form in his novels is literally breathtaking.

That task is very difficult, however. Refocusing curricula on funda mental concepts, producing new teaching materials, and designing teaching units based on 'mathematicians' common sense' (or on logic) have not resulted in a better understanding of mathematics by more students. The failure of such efforts has raised questions suggesting that what was missing at the outset of these proposals, designs, and productions was a more profound knowledge of the phenomena of learning and teaching mathematics in socially established and culturally, politically, and economically justified institutions - namely, schools. Such knowledge cannot be built by mere juxtaposition of theories in disci plines such as psychology, sociology, and mathematics. Psychological theories focus on the individual learner. Theories of sociology of education look at the general laws of curriculum development, the specifics of pedagogic discourse as opposed to scientific discourse in general, the different possible pedagogic rela tions between the teacher and the taught, and other general problems in the inter face between education and society. Mathematics, aside from its theoretical contents, can be looked at from historical and epistemological points of view, clarifying the genetic development of its concepts, methods, and theories. This view can shed some light on the meaning of mathematical concepts and on the difficulties students have in teaching approaches that disregard the genetic development of these concepts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S895oAEACAAJ&dq=Mathematics+Education+As+a+Research+Domain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conservatism in America since 1930: A Reader","description":"Legal ethics should be far more than a set of rules on professional responsibility; they can serve as a means for changing power relations, empowering the disenfranchised, and advocating progressive social change.

First published in 1975, this finely wrought exploration remains as urgent as ever, presenting a mode of living that pervades the countries of the West and yet is excluded from much of its culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1upOEAAAQBAJ&dq=A+seventh+man:+Migrant+workers+in+Europe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Last Great Victory: The End of World War II","description":"Recounts the final thirty days of the war, focusing on the momentous meeting of President Truman, Churchill, and Stalin at Potsdam to end the war, the last-minute diplomacy with the Japanese, and the decision to drop the atomic bomb. 25,000 first printing.

Bradlee s intimate biography of President John F. Kennedy and his Camelot years. Conversations with Kennedy is legendary reporter and executive Benjamin C. Bradlee s account of his intimate dialogues with JFK a man he counted as a confidante and friend. Beginning in 1958, when Kennedy was a US senator running for president, and continuing until 1963, the year that Kennedy died, Bradlee shared a close professional and personal relationship with the charismatic politician. Both men were war veterans, idealists, and up-and-coming American leaders, and they shared values that drove their friendship. Kennedy was a politician equally at home with the bruising intellects he appointed to government posts and his working-class constituents. He respected his complicated father, understood his brothers, admired women, and had few illusions about human nature. Bradlee s eye for detail reveals JFK s views on everything from Communism to conservatism to freedom of the press. From parties at the White House to weekends at Palm Beach to JFK s enduring influence on Bradlee s own life, this is an in-depth, behind-the-scenes look at the man behind a myth, written by a giant of American journalism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QSTtAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Easy & Elegant Home Decorating: 25 Stylish Projects for Your Home","description":" A haunting peek at the life of a teenage girl in 1950s New Orleans. --Entertainment Weekly It s 1950, and as the French Quarter of New Orleans simmers with secrets, seventeen-year-old Josie Moraine is silently stirring a pot of her own.

Such data may be intercorrelations of test items, ratings of similarity on political candidates, or trade indices for a set of countries. MDS attempts to model such data as distances among points in a geometric space. The main reason for doing this is that one wants a graphical display of the structure of the data, one that is much easier to understand than an array of numbers and, moreover, one that displays the essential information in the data, smoothing out noise. There are numerous varieties of MDS. Some facets for distinguishing among them are the particular type of geometry into which one wants to map the data, the mapping function, the algorithms used to find an optimal data representation, the treatment of statistical error in the models, or the possibility to represent not just one but several similarity matrices at the same time. Other facets relate to the different purposes for which MDS has been used, to various ways of looking at or \\"interpreting\\" an MDS representation, or to differences in the data required for the particular models. In this book, we give a fairly comprehensive presentation of MDS. For the reader with applied interests only, the first six chapters of Part I should be sufficient. They explain the basic notions of ordinary MDS, with an emphasis on how MDS can be helpful in answering substantive questions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NYDSBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Janet Evanovich Box Set","description":"Three complete novels: One for the Money, Two for the Dough, and Three to Get Deadly, from the New York Times #1 bestselling author, Janet Evanovich! Here s where it all began the three novels that first brought us Stephanie Plum, that bounty hunter with attitude who stepped out of Trenton s blue-collar  burg  and into the heart of America. One for the Money: Stephanie s all grown up and out on her own, living five miles from Mom and Dad and doing her best to sever the world s longest umbilical cord. Her mother is a meddler and her grandmother is a few cans short of a case. Out of work and out of money, Stephanie blackmails her bail-bondsman cousin Vinnie into giving her a try as an apprehension agent. Stephanie knows zilch about the job requirements, but she figures her new pal, el-primo bounty hunter Ranger, can teach her what it takes to catch a crook. Her first assignment: nail Joe Morelli, a former vice cop on the run from a charge of murder one. Morelli s the inamorato who charmed Stephanie out of her virginity at age sixteen. There s still powerful chemistry between them, so the chase is interesting. Two for the Dough: Stephanie takes to the mean streets of Trenton, armed with attitude (not to mention stun guns and defense sprays), to find Kenny Mancuso, who recently shot his best friend and is on the run. Aided by the enigmatic Ranger, who knows a thing or two about bounty hunting, and by her irrepressible Grandma Mazur, Stephanie forms a shaky alliance with her favorite cop, Joe Morelli, for a tumultuous chase through back alleys and Grandma's favorite funeral parlors. Three to Get Deadly: Stephanie is having a bad hair day for the whole month of January. She s looking for Mo Bedemier, Trenton s most beloved citizen, who was charged with carrying concealed and skipped bail. To help her, she s got Lula, a former hooker turned file clerk. Big, blonde, and black, Lula s itching to lock up a crook in the trunk of her car. And Morelli, the cop with the slow-burning smile, is acting polite even after Stephanie finds more bodies than the Trenton PD has seen in years. That s a bad sign for sure. Funny and fabulous, Janet Evanovich is at her sparkling best in these three novels that launched a bestselling phenomenon.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yv9kavaIDOgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Werewolf in London (Science Fiction & Fantasy)","description":"In the years since Georges M li s s Le voyage dans la lune (A Trip to the Moon) was released in 1902, more than 1000 science fiction films have been made by filmmakers around the world.

His many-faceted work was an elegant expression of European civilization at its zenith. This is the first comprehensive, scholarly work to place Boberg's contributions within an international context. The text and several hundred illustrations, including a considerable number in full color, cover the entire range of his output, from architecture and interiors to his especially noteworthy designs for major expositions in Turin, Chicago, and Paris. Boberg, one of the most widely traveled architects of his time, was instrumental in transmitting the contemporary designs of the American innovators H. H. Richardson and Louis Sullivan into Swedish architecture. A large number of his important buildings remain in central Stockholm. They are designed in what might be called the \\"Queen Anne\\" style, with a great sense of three-dimensional form, classicizing details, bold massing, and symbolic as well as whimsical decorative details a manner that is much in vogue among contemporary architects. In collaboration with his wife, painter Anna Boberg, his approach to domestic architecture in terms of an overall integration of plan, design, and crafts can be seen as a precursor to the vital Scandinavian modern design traditions. Boberg was also a talented artist, which is reflected not only in his architectural renderings, many of which are reproduced here in color, but also in a very large production of charcoal and pencil drawings and etchings.

This book investigates the role of the particles in talk-in-interaction with the aim of providing a comprehensive understanding that accounts for their pragmatic properties and sequential functions and that provides a sound basis for second language pedagogy. This study starts by setting up an original particle function hypothesis based on the figure/ground \\"gestalt,\\" and then tests its validity empirically with unmarked, marked and native/non-native talk-in-interaction data. The analysis illustrates not only expectable but also unexpected or strategic use of particles, as well as the problems posed for native speakers by non-native speakers whose use of particles is idiosyncratic. The study demonstrates that the proposed hypothesis is capable of accounting for all the uses of particles in the extensive and varied data set examined. This book will be of interest to students and scholars in pragmatics and CA and to teachers of Japanese as a foreign language.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O3FwSqq9YfoC&dq=Interactive+Japanese+1:+An+Introductory+Course+(Pt.1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theory of Constraints and Its Implications for Management Accounting","description":"Presents the first in-depth evaluation of the theory of constraints (TOC) based on investigations at 21 US and European companies.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. By 1960, psychology had come to be dominated by behaviorism and learning theory, which emphasized the observable stimulus and response components of human and animal behavior while ignoring the cognitive processes that mediate the relationship between the stimulus and response. The cognitive phenomena occurring within the \\"black box\\" between stimulus and response were of little interest to behaviorists, as their mathematical models worked without them. In 1960, the book \\"Plans and the Structure of Behavior,\\" authored by George A. Miller, Eugene Galanter, and Karl H. Pribram, was published. In this volume, Miller and his colleagues sought to unify the behaviorists' learning theory with a cognitive model of learned behavior. Whereas the behaviorists suggested that a simple reflex arc underlies the acquisition of the stimulus-response relationship, Miller and his colleagues proposed that \\"some mediating organization of experience is necessary\\" somewhere between the stimulus and response, in effect a cognitive process which must include monitoring devices that control the acquisition of the stimulus-response relationship. They named this fundamental unit of behavior the T.O.T.E. for \\"Test - Operate - Test - Exit.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZabJngEACAAJ&dq=Plans+and+the+structure+of+behavior&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angel Eyes","description":"Once you ve seen, you can t unsee.

Such prophetic language often differs from other parts of Scripture, employing highly figurative details. God in His wisdom has imparted these clued to various prophets spanning centuries of time, civilizations and social levels, thus providing the modern-day reader a highly complex, yet complete prophetic puzzle pointing us forward to final days in earth's history. Therefore, a complete study is necessary to understanding Bible prophecy as the act of overlooking one prophet or vision will render an incomplete understanding. William miller was a simple New York farmer when God called him to become one of the cornerstones of the great revival movement that eventually formed the foundation of the Seventh-day Adventist church. A self-proclaimed agnostic, Miller had little to do with God or the bible for much of his adult life. However, as the Holy Spirit worked on his heart, Miller began an extensive study of the Scriptures where he found Christ as his personal friend and Saviour. Evidence From Scripture and History explores into the heart of many Bible prophecies both known and ambiguous. Backing up all claims wich Scripture and references, Miller takes the reader on an exhaustive study of Bible prophecy in this modern-day repring of an early advent study. - INTRODUCTION. LECTURE I.

Today s young feminists are wary of being labeled. They are media-savvy, hyper-aware of being categorized and marginalized, and are here to tell the world that feminists are feminists   diverse in age and experience   and that it s time to drop the labels in favor of proactive agendas and united goals. Topics that matter to young feminists range from lighter issues, such as DIY culture and craftivism, to heavy-hitting issues that feminists have struggled with for generations, including abuse, rape, shame, and self-hatred. The young writers in this collection band together under the banner of feminism to share the message that the F-word is a good thing, and that feminists are breaking new ground while still valuing the traditions and achievements of their sisters and foremothers. We Don t Need Another Wave brings a message of unity and a message to get beyond subcategorizing a movement that needs cohesiveness and strives on strength in numbers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2voUAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love That Jesus","description":"Based on Kurt Bennett's popular-ish blog God Running, Love Like Jesus begins with the story of how after a life of regular church attendance and Bible study, Bennett was challenged by a pastor to study Jesus. That led to an obsessive seven-year deep dive. After pouring over Jesus' every interaction with another human being, he realized he was doing a much better job of studying Jesus' words than he was following Jesus' words and example. The honest and fearless revelations of Bennett's own moral failures affirm he wrote this book for himself as much as for others. Love Like Jesus examines a variety of stories, examples, and research, including: -Specific examples of how Jesus communicated God's love to others. -How Jesus demonstrated all five of Gary Chapman's love languages (and how you can too). -The story of how Billy Graham extended Christ's extraordinary love and grace toward a man who misrepresented Jesus to millions. -How to respond to critics the way Jesus did. -How to love unlovable people the way Jesus did. -How to survive a life of loving like Jesus (or how not to become a Christian doormat). -How Jesus didn't love everyone the same (and why you shouldn't either). -How Jesus guarded his heart by taking care of himself--he even napped--and why you should do the same. -How Jesus loved his betrayer Judas, even to the very end. With genuine unfiltered honesty, Love Like Jesus shows you how to live a life according to God's definition of success: A life of loving God well, and loving the people around you well too. A life of loving like Jesus.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FZBTzQEACAAJ&dq=Love+That+Jesus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Navajo Textiles Pocket Address Book","description":"Spinning, carding, and dyeing yarns, constructing a loom, tension, and the weaving processes are discussed in this guide to the art of blanket and saddleblanket weaving","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JfOEDwAAQBAJ&dq=Navajo+Textiles+Pocket+Address+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Babies by the Bay: The Insider's Guide to Everything from Doctors and Diapers to Playgrounds and Preschools in the San Francisco Bay Area","description":"Based on extensive surveys of local parents, this guide offers comprehensive up-to-date information on the best doctors, hospitals, childcare, and preschools, as well as parents' top picks of pre- and postnatal exercise facilities, parents' groups, baby gear retailers, and kid-friendly restaurants.

The controversy affects national and local policy, influences education, and, some argue, could degrade our way of life if scientific advancement or religious belief and practice are stifled. The conflict is being waged on two levels. The public level is a continuing war among relatively few activists. We see warring books and articles, contentious town meetings, lawsuits, legislative efforts, private schools, and other efforts by each side to win and make sure the other loses.The other level of the debate, like the submerged portion of an iceberg, is larger, more insidious, and ultimately more hurtful to society. This conflict is within the hearts and minds of a vast number of people who sense an  either/or  conflict between the religion they believe and the science they see, hear, and experience. This conflict has no clear battle lines and no obvious winner or loser, but a high mortality rate that includes all those people, particularly young people, who simply opt out. Some check out of religion and become  de-facto agnostics  who claim a faith when the chips are down, but don't practice it or get anything from it. Others check out of science and reason. They allow their faith and their views about the Bible to kill their intellectual curiosity, and they look scientific truth in the face but refuse to see it. For the most part, this conflict boils down to different beliefs among people of faith about scripture, evolution, and the  isms  that each has spawned. Most interpret the Bible and understand science in ways that make finding an intellectually satisfying resolution to the presumed conflict frustrating and even scary. Any attempt to reconcile the two requires learning new words that initially sound like so much gobbledygook, reading an array of books and articles that usually present only one side of a multi-faceted issue and tend to obfuscate rather than enlighten, and making judgments without all the facts. The purpose of Reconciling the Bible and Science: A Primer on the Two Books of God is to take the fog out of the controversy by telling in simple language the story of the  Book of Scripture  and the  Book of Nature.  The work is aimed primarily at Christians and seekers who don't need proof of God but do seek a better understanding of the relationship between their faith and science. It will be helpful to those who are having difficulty reconciling their faith with what they learn about science, those whose faith prevents them from fully exploring science with an open mind, those who oppose the teaching of evolution because they feel it is a threat to faith, or others who just don't know where to turn. Reconciling the Bible and Science is based on a college level course that Lynn Mitchell has taught for many years in colleges, churches, and on television. It explains that faith in God and a belief in the Bible do not preclude acceptance of science, and that the two can in fact co-exist perhaps even complement one another. It does not try to convince readers of the validity of evolution or of a particular approach to religious practice, but maintains that we all should be free to make our own judgments about faith in God without being constrained by anything science can discover, and about science unfettered by presumed constraints of the Bible.

Celebrating the Southern Seasons showed how the traditional European festivals we inherited can be a more profound experience if they are in tune with the seasons, how they can be adapted for Aotearoa, and how rewarding an appreciation of longstanding Maori festivals can be. In 2005, ten years after the book's first publication, New Zealanders are much more inclined than previously to consider how various traditions can enrich our celebrations here and now. Matariki, the New Year celebration at Winter Solstice, has undergone a massive resurgence - and other seasonal festivities are springing up all over the country. The time is ripe for an updated and expanded edition of Celebrating the Southern Seasons. In the tenth anniversary edition of this unique work, author Juliet Batten sheds more light on customs, symbols and meanings attached to seasonal changes. She reports not only on forms of celebration that New Zealanders have inherited and found but also on those we have devised and adapted. And she suggests readings, myths and stories to enrich our high days and holidays, strengthening the book's role as a valuable resource.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1_CFAAAACAAJ&dq=Celebrating+the+Southern+Seasons:+Rituals+for+Aotearoa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Happy Prisoner","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_z0anwEACAAJ&dq=The+Happy+Prisoner&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death In Provence: Detective Lauriant Mysteries (WorldKrime)","description":"Set in the pastoral ambiance of 1960s France, Detective Lauriant Investigates contains two hardboiled novellas.

Why did American geologists reject so adamantly an idea that is now considered a cornerstone of the discipline? And why were their European colleagues receptive to it so much earlier? This book, based on extensive archival research on three continents, provides important new answers while giving the first detailed account of the American geological community in the first half of the century. Challenging previous historical work on this episode, Naomi Oreskes shows that continental drift was not rejected for the lack of a causal mechanism, but because it seemed to conflict with the basic standards of practice in American geology. This account provides a compelling look at how scientific ideas are made and unmade.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EEQdk9GRfkoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jonny Double","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SxN3AQAACAAJ&dq=Jonny+Double&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Grandmothers' Drums: A Portrait of Rural African Life & Culture","description":"Successfully navigate the rich world of travel narratives and identify fiction and nonfiction read-alikes with this detailed and expertly constructed guide.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2cCAUaQylGIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Structure and Function in Primitive Society","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qLn1twEACAAJ&dq=Structure+and+Function+in+Primitive+Society&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Disabled & Their Parents: A Counseling Challenge","description":"An expert in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), Rachel Shaw is the foremost executive-level human resources compliance trainer in the country.

In his seminal study Christianity as Mystical Fact he turned his esoteric genius to interpreting the Christ event as the turning point in the world's spiritual history--an incarnation whose significance he saw transcending all religions.\\" --Bishop Frederick H. Borsch, professor of New Testament and chair of Anglican Studies, Lutheran Theological Seminary, Philadelphia \\"As simultaneously mysticism and fact, Christianity is a breakthrough in the historical development of humanity for which the mysteries, with the results that they brought about, form a prior evolutionary stage.\\" --Rudolf Steiner During the fall and winter of 1901-1902, Steiner gave a series of lectures called \\"Christianity As Mystical Fact\\" to members of the Theosophical Society. The lectures were rewritten and issued as a book later that year. They mark a watershed in the development of Western esotericism. Steiner wrote of the idea behind his book: \\"The title Christianity As Mystical Fact was one I gave to this work eight years ago, when I gathered together the content of lectures given in 1902. It was meant to indicate the special approach adopted in the book. Its theme is not just the mystical side of Christianity in a historical presentation. It was meant to show, from the standpoint of a mystical awareness, how Christianity came into being. Behind this was the idea that spiritual happenings were factors in the emergence of Christianity, which could only be observed from such a point of view. It is for the book itself to demonstrate that, by \\"mystical,\\" I do not in any way imply a vague intuition rather than strict scientific argument. In many circles, mysticism is understood as just that, and therefore it is distinguished from the concerns of all 'genuine' science. \\"In this book, however, I use the term to mean a 'presentation of spiritual reality'--a reality accessible only to a knowledge drawn from the sources of spiritual life itself. Anyone who denies the possibility of such knowledge in principle will find its contents hard to comprehend; any reader who accepts the idea that mysticism may coexist with the clarity of the natural sciences, may acknowledge that the mystical aspect of Christianity must be described mystically.\\" This is a fundamental book, in Steiner's own development, in that of Western esotericism, and for our understanding of the Christ event. Readers will find the evolutionary development from the ancient Mysteries through the great Greek philosophers to the events portrayed in the Gospels. Included are an informative introduction and annotated notes by Andrew Welburn and an afterword by Michael Debus, a priest of the Christian Community, who summarizes the book and places it in context.

We all have our ups and downs depending on how our day or week is going. The transition from bad day to rut to clinical depression can be gradual and leave even the strongest person thinking, \\"What is wrong with me? I just have to try harder! Why am I so lazy? Why can't I get out of bed?\\" Clinical depression is a medical illness similar to pneumonia that even the strongest person cannot overcome without treatment. Clinical depression is similar to heart disease and cancer in that all of us have a susceptibility to each. If we have a family history of one of these illnesses, our susceptibility Increases. This explains how some develop a clinical depression only after extraordinary stressors and others develop clinical depression seemingly out of the blue. Clinical depression is a very common illness that affects approximately 3-5% of the population at any one time.

A Law of Blood, first published in the early 1970s, led the way in an additional newly emerging academic field: American Indian history. As the field has flourished, this book has remained an authoritative text. Indeed, Gordon Morris Bakken writes in the foreword to this edition that Reid's original study  shaped scholarship and inquiry for decades.  Forging the research methods that fellow historians would soon adopt, Reid carefully examines the organization and rules of Cherokee clans and towns. Investigating the role of women in Cherokee society, for example, he found that married Cherokee women had more legal authority than their counterparts in Anglo-American society. In particular, Reid explores the Cherokees' revolutionary attitudes toward government and the unique relationship between the members of the tribe and their law. Before the first European contact, the Cherokee Nation had already developed a functioning government, and by the early nineteenth century, the first Cherokee constitution had been enacted.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K-vvSAAACAAJ&dq=A+Law+of+Blood.+The+Primitive+Law+of+The+Cherokee+Nation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Color in Outdoor Painting","description":"Experts in color and painting techniques from Benjamin Moore & Co. offers a stylish and comprehensive guide to painting the exterior of one's home, with helpful tips on selecting a main color, accent and trim colors, how to use the color wheel, and more.

Inspired by a true story of a child s demonic possession in the 1940s, William Peter Blatty created an iconic novel that focuses on Regan, the eleven-year-old daughter of a movie actress residing in Washington, D.C. A small group of overwhelmed yet determined individuals must rescue Regan from her unspeakable fate, and the drama that ensues is gripping and unfailingly terrifying. Two years after its publication, The Exorcist was, of course, turned into a wildly popular motion picture, garnering ten Academy Award nominations. On opening day of the film, lines of the novel s fans stretched around city blocks. In Chicago, frustrated moviegoers used a battering ram to gain entry through the double side doors of a theater. In Kansas City, police used tear gas to disperse an impatient crowd who tried to force their way into a cinema. The three major television networks carried footage of these events; CBS s Walter Cronkite devoted almost ten minutes to the story. The Exorcist was, and is, more than just a novel and a film: it is a true landmark. Purposefully raw and profane, The Exorcist still has the extraordinary ability to disturb readers and cause them to forget that it is  just a story.

Includes spiritual techniques, prayers, poems, and meditative chants to bring each of us into deep, personal, intimate, living relationship with God Of the many names of God commonly used in the Bible and other sacred literature, none is God s real name. Every God-name, including YHWH, reflects only one of God s many aspects, such as the loving creator, the militaristic authoritarian, or the all-knowing judge. None embodies the wholeness, the totality, the full Essence of God. Who then are we to speak to when we seek God? If you can t truly know something until you know its name, how can we truly know God? The culmination of years of translation research and etymological investigation, Rabbi Wayne Dosick s work digs through many layers of presumption and deeply ingrained beliefs to reveal the real name of God hiding in plain sight in the Bible: Anochi. He shows how this sacred name unites all religions--both of the West and the East. The name Anochi enables us to finally meet the whole, complete, real God--both the grand God of the vast universe and the God of breath, soul, and heart who dwells within each of us.

With exponential growth of the global population and marked rises in meat consumption per capita, demands for animal-source protein are expected to increase 72% between 2013 and 2050.

A lack of activity increases the risk of heart disease, colon and breast cancer, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoporosis, anxiety and depression and others diseases. Emerging literature has suggested that in terms of mortality, the global population health burden of physical inactivity approaches that of cigarette smoking. The prevalence and substantial disease risk associated with physical inactivity has been described as a pandemic. The prevalence, health impact, and evidence of changeability all have resulted in calls for action to increase physical activity across the lifespan. In response to the need to find ways to make physical activity a health priority for youth, the Institute of Medicine's Committee on Physical Activity and Physical Education in the School Environment was formed. Its purpose was to review the current status of physical activity and physical education in the school environment, including before, during, and after school, and examine the influences of physical activity and physical education on the short and long term physical, cognitive and brain, and psychosocial health and development of children and adolescents. Educating the Student Body makes recommendations about approaches for strengthening and improving programs and policies for physical activity and physical education in the school environment. This report lays out a set of guiding principles to guide its work on these tasks. These included: recognizing the benefits of instilling life-long physical activity habits in children; the value of using systems thinking in improving physical activity and physical education in the school environment; the recognition of current disparities in opportunities and the need to achieve equity in physical activity and physical education; the importance of considering all types of school environments; the need to take into consideration the diversity of students as recommendations are developed. This report will be of interest to local and national policymakers, school officials, teachers, and the education community, researchers, professional organizations, and parents interested in physical activity, physical education, and health for school-aged children and adolescents.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yd6MAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christ the Eternal Tao","description":"\\"Christ the eternal Tao shows Lao Tzu's Tao Teh Ching as a foreshadowing of what would be revealed by Christ, and Lao Tzu himself as a Far-Eastern prophet of the Incarnate God.\\"-- Back cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3QV5AAAAMAAJ&dq=Christ+the+Eternal+Tao&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Milet Mini Picture Dictionary: English-French","description":"Illustrated by Sally Hagin.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zOPNAAAACAAJ&dq=Milet+Mini+Picture+Dictionary:+English-French&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Triumph of the Market: Essays on Economics, Politics, and the Media","description":"**** The third edition (1990) is cited in Brandon-Hill.

McKinley","description":"In 1903, aspiring journalist Robert Dunn joined an expedition attempting the first ascent of Mt. McKinley, the highest mountain in North America. Led by explorer Frederick Cook (who would later win infamy for faking the discovery of the North Pole), the climbers failed to conquer McKinley, but they did circumnavigate the great peak-an accomplishment not repeated until 1978. The trek also spawned a book unique in the literature of exploration: Dunn's frank, sardonic, no-holds-barred look at day-to-day existence on an Alaskan expedition. Before Dunn, most such accounts were sanitized and expurgated of anything unflattering. Dunn, however, a protege of the muckraker Lincoln Steffens, endeavored to report what he saw, with panache. And what Dunn reported was a journey rife with conflict, missed opportunity, incompetence, privation, and danger. By showing men reduced to their rawest state, the young journalist produced a compelling, insightful, and oddly amusing book that disturbed and riveted his contemporaries. As Hudson Stuck-the Episcopal archdeacon of the Yukon who completed the first ascent of Mt. McKinley in 1913-observed, \\"[Dunn's] book has a curious undeniable power, despite its brutal frankness. ...

As the case progresses, clinical reasoning is explained in detail. The differential diagnosis for that particular case is summarized in tables that highlight the clinical clues and important tests for the leading diagnostic hypothesis and alternative diagnostic hypotheses. As the chapter progresses, the pertinent diseases are reviewed. Just as in real life, the case unfolds in a stepwise fashion as tests are performed and diagnoses are confirmed or refuted. Completely updated to reflect the latest research in clinical medicine, this fourth edition is enhanced by algorithms, summary tables, questions that direct evaluation, and an examination of recently developed diagnostic tools and guidelines.

Also disappointing was the tendency of the captured images to fade over time. Photographers, ever eager to please their public, began \\"painting\\" their photographs with substances ranging from water colors and oil to chalk and crayon. Images were enlarged, enhanced, and framed, to simulate the splendors of the traditional portrait. With its rich variety of illustrations in color and duotone, The Painted Photograph is the first comprehensive history of overpainting, from its origins to World War I. The 131 illustrations featured draw upon original nineteenth- and early twentieth-century sources, most from America and Britain, but also representing Japan, Turkey, Austria, Germany, Poland, Canada, Bohemia, India, Australia, Norway, Holland, and Russia. In describing a multitude of early techniques, the authors survey overpainting on various types of photographs, including daguerreotypes, tintypes, and imprinted porcelain, milk glass, enamel, magic lantern slides, and textiles. Particularly fascinating are discussions of overpainted death portraits, most commonly those of children, and the origins of popular \\"picture postcards\\" featuring overpainted landscape scenes. The Henisches address also the eager acceptance of the painted photograph throughout the world, despite the hostility of the art-critical establishment. The Painted Photograph will appeal to a wide public interested in photography, history, sociology, social anthropology, folk art, popular fashion, and antiques.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QexTAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Painted+Photograph+1839-1914:+Origins,+Techniques,+Aspirations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to stay in love","description":"Hard-hitting divorce lawyer James J.

With remarkable clarity, he makes the Six-Session Guruyoga practice accessible to all practitioners, and deepens our understanding and appreciation of this sublime teaching of the Buddha. Gen Lamrimpa begins this eminently practical explanation by emphasizing the importance of a compassionate motivation for spiritual practice. He then explores the nature of suffering and the cycle of existence that traps all living beings, and concludes with a detailed account of the Six-Phase Yoga, which is meant to be recited and contemplated three times during the day and three times at night.

His 1980 book Negara analyzed the social organization of Bali before it was colonized by the Dutch in 1906. Here Geertz applied his widely influential method of cultural interpretation to the myths, ceremonies, rituals, and symbols of a precolonial state. He found that the nineteenth-century Balinese state defied easy conceptualization by the familiar models of political theory and the standard Western approaches to understanding politics. Negara means \\"country\\" or \\"seat of political authority\\" in Indonesian. In Bali Geertz found negara to be a \\"theatre state,\\" governed by rituals and symbols rather than by force. The Balinese state did not specialize in tyranny, conquest, or effective administration. Instead, it emphasized spectacle. The elaborate ceremonies and productions the state created were \\"not means to political ends: they were the ends themselves, they were what the state was for.... Power served pomp, not pomp power.\\" Geertz argued more forcefully in Negara than in any of his other books for the fundamental importance of the culture of politics to a society. Much of Geertz's previous work--including his world-famous essay on the Balinese cockfight--can be seen as leading up to the full portrait of the \\"poetics of power\\" that Negara so vividly depicts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZOUXEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Juice: The Real Story of Baseball's Drug Problems","description":"Looks at the use of steroids in professional baseball, discussing the impact on the game, how the drugs work, and the athletes who use them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bBlBAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Juice:+The+Real+Story+of+Baseball%27s+Drug+Problems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The steppe, and other stories,","description":"The first of Chekhov's works to be published in a serious literary journal, \`The Steppe', with its masterly account of a spectacular thunderstorm, signifies his maturation as a writer of short stories.

Intelligent and heartfelt, Faith and Feminism offers a perceptive look at the lives of five spirited and spiritual women of history, women who combined their undying faith with feminist beliefs and who made the world a better place by doing so. ? St. Teresa of  vila, a woman whose bravery in confronting her shadows gave her the strength to connect with the world and live a life of divine action. ? Lucretia Mott, a Quaker minister, who rose from her quiet upbringing to become a passionate speaker and activist working tirelessly on behalf of justice and peace. ? Sojourner Truth, a Christian slave, who spoke out with unwavering courage to claim her God-given rightful place as an African American and a woman. ? Emily Dickinson, an extraordinary poet, who touched the world with her ability to capture and transform the experience of suffering. ? Dorothy Day, a radical journalist, who lived a life of voluntary poverty as a way of expressing her passion for the Christian faith and care for those in need. A remarkable book that focuses on the idea that spirituality and feminism are really different expressions of the same impulse to make life more whole, Faith and Feminism offers a powerful catalyst for reflecting on our sense of self -- and for living and loving according to our deepest values.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zZ4JuLj4vZIC&dq=Faith+and+Feminism:+A+Holy+Alliance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ancient Hebrew Language and Alphabet: Understanding the Ancient Hebrew Language of the Bible Based on Ancient Hebrew Culture and Thought","description":"The Hebrew Bible, called the \\"Tenach\\" by Jews and \\"Old Testament\\" by Christians, was originally written in the Hebrew language using an ancient pictographic, or paleo-Hebrew, script.

As an infant, Daniel entered the foster care system as a result of severe neglect, which manifested in violence and aggression later in his childhood after he was adopted by Jim and Toni Hoy. Desperate to get him into a residential treatment center and keep their other children safe, Jim and Toni were given two options by the state of Illinois: either keep him in a psychiatric hospital or be charged by the Department of Children and Family Services with child endangerment for failure to protect their other children. Mental health professionals recommended abandoning Daniel at the hospital after the state denied all viable sources of funding for his treatment. So Daniel re-entered the foster care system for no other reason than he was mentally ill. A year later, Daniel s mother discovered that his treatment was covered by a funding source that he was awarded as part of his special needs adoption. How could they get the state government to understand the federal law and re-gain custody of their son? Second Time Foster Child is the story of parents who never gave up on their son, despite being prosecuted and persecuted in exchange for his medically necessary treatment.

In the early afternoon of Monday 4 October 1999, wracked with Parkinson's, and unable to paint because of a fall in which he had broken his wrist, Bernard Buffet calmly placed a plastic bag over his head, taped it tight around his neck and patiently waited the few minutes it took for death to arrive. Bernard Buffet:The Invention of the Modern Mega-artist tells the remarkable story of a French figurative painter who tasted unprecedented critical and commercial success at an age when his contemporaries were still at art school. Then, with almost equal suddenness the fruits of fame turned sour and he found himself an outcast. Scarred with the contagion of immense commercial success no leper was more untouchable. He was the first artist of the television age and the jet age and his role in creating the idea of a post-war France is not to be underestimated. As the first of the so-called Fabulous Five (Francoise Sagan, Roger Vadim, Brigitte Bardot and Yves Saint Laurent) he was a leader of the cultural revolution that seemed to forge a new France from the shattered remains of a discredited and demoralized country. Rich in incident Buffet s remarkable story of bisexual love affairs, betrayal, vendettas lasting half a century, shattered reputations, alcoholism, and drug abuse, is played out against the backdrop of the beau monde of the 1950s and 1960s in locations as diverse as St Tropez, Japan, Paris, Dallas, St Petersburg and New York, before coming to its miserable conclusion alone in his studio.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yvYfCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting Lucky","description":"How do you change your luck?

Kroll tells how college students in the late 1980s responded to his course on the Vietnam War in literature. Kroll designed the course to engage students  hearts and minds in the processes of connected and critical inquiry. He argues that students should be personally absorbed in a topic emotionally connected to key issues and texts if inquiry is to be more than a perfunctory exercise. Kroll raises a number of important critical questions about texts and meaning, particularly concerning the nature of authority and the reader s role in creating meaning. He focuses on students  efforts to think reflectively about literary representation, historical truth, and moral justification. Drawing on John Dewey s concept of reflective inquiry, Kroll asserts that his course did not challenge his students to \\"acquire\\" information, but rather to \\"inquire\\" to explore, probe, and query.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=adK3_NXFfI0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Green Lantern Archives, Vol. 5 (DC Archive Editions)","description":"Reprinting for the first time some of DC Comics' rarest publictions from the Golden Age of comics, including three early anthology titles in their entirety.

Whether in recent popular culture, or back across countless centuries, angels have perpetually enthralled, mystified and even terrified us. 'Every single angel is terrible,' wrote the German Romantic poet Rilke: 'and so I hold myself back from the dark bird-cry of my anguished sobbing.' For some in the sceptical, post-Enlightenment West, angels may be no more than metaphors: poetic devices to convey, at least for those with a religious sensibility, an active divine interest in creation. But for others, angels are absolutely real beings: manifestations of cosmic power and energy with the capacity either to enlighten or annihilate those whose awestruck paths they cross. Valery Rees here offers the first comprehensive history of these beautiful, enigmatic and sometimes dangerous beings, whose existence and actions have been charted across the eons of time and civilizations. From the ancient Sumerian and Akkadian winged figures, to Egyptian representations of Ma'at, Persian genii, Arab djinn, biblical cherubim, daemons of Hermes Trismegistus and Milton's defiant fallen angels, From Gabriel to Lucifer reveals a mesmerising trajectory of angelic belief. Whether exploring the feverish visions of Ezekiel and biblical cherubim; the Islamic archangels Jibra'il, Azra'il, Mika'il and Israfil; the austere and haunting icons of Andrei Rublev; or Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, and the more benign idea of the ever-watchful guardian angel, the author shows that the very ubiquity of these implacable celestial messengers reveal something fundamental, if not about God and the devil, then about ourselves: our perennial preoccupation withhow to depict the transcendent.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PbiKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cracking the AP Statistics Exam, 2004-2005 Edition (College Test Prep)","description":"Provides techniques for achieving high scores on the AP statistics exam and includes two full-length practice tests.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GG1Kug-0P8UC&dq=Cracking+the+AP+Statistics+Exam,+2004-2005+Edition+(College+Test+Prep)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Underwater Photography Handbook, The","description":"The only comprehensive guide to Underwater Photography.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dfW2xRM_06oC&dq=Underwater+Photography+Handbook,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Superconscious meditation","description":"A master guide to your inner journey  a book you deserve!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fXZPH3MjE4kC&dq=Superconscious+meditation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Midnight Magic (Arabesque)","description":"Interior designer Elise Taylor and her husband Garrett, a pediatrician, a couple who had once shared everything with each other, journey to a secluded Caribbean island where they reveal their secrets to each other in hopes of reigniting passion and love.

It is a land of rich pastures and teeming flocks and herds, a land of rolling mesas and precious running waters that at length unite in the Currumpaw River, from which the whole region is named. And the king whose despotic power was felt over its entire extent was an old gray wolf. Old Lobo, or the king, as the Mexicans called him, was the gigantic leader of a remarkable pack of gray wolves, that had ravaged the Currumpaw Valley for a number of years. All the shepherds and ranchmen knew him well, and, wherever he appeared with his trusty band, terror reigned supreme among the cattle, and wrath and despair among their owners. Old Lobo was a giant among wolves, and was cunning and strong in proportion to his size. His voice at night was well-known and easily distinguished from that of any of his fellows. An ordinary wolf might howl half the night about the herdsman's bivouac without attracting more than a passing notice, but when the deep roar of the old king came booming down the canon, the watcher bestirred himself and prepared to learn in the morning that fresh and serious inroads had been made among the herds.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DigqAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Universal Health Care: What the United States Can Learn from the Canadian Experience","description":"A powerful argument for a new health-care system.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZrFJPQAACAAJ&dq=Universal+Health+Care:+What+the+United+States+Can+Learn+from+the+Canadian+Experience&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psychopathia sexualis (A Greenleaf classic)","description":"Investigating and reimagining the origin story of the sex doll through the tale of the sailor s dames de voyage. The sex doll and its high-tech counterpart the sex robot have gone mainstream, as both the object of consumer desire and the subject of academic study. But sex dolls, and sexual technology in general, are nothing new. Sex dolls have been around for centuries. In Sex Dolls at Sea, Bo Ruberg explores the origin story of the sex doll, investigating its cultural implications and considering who has been marginalized and who has been privileged in the narrative. Ruberg examines the generally accepted story that the first sex dolls were dames de voyage, rudimentary figures made of cloth and leather scraps by European sailors on long, lonely ocean voyages in centuries past. In search of supporting evidence for the lonesome sailor sex doll theory, Ruberg uncovers the real history of the sex doll. The earliest commercial sex dolls were not the dames de voyage but the femmes en caoutchouc:  women  made of inflatable vulcanized rubber, beginning in the late nineteenth century. Interrogating the sailor sex doll origin story, Ruberg finds beneath the surface a web of issues relating to gender, sexuality, race, and colonialism. What has been lost in the history of the sex doll and other sex tech, Ruberg tells us, are the stories of the sex workers, women, queer people, and people of color whose lives have been bound up with these technologies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=drxNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Psychopathia+sexualis+(A+Greenleaf+classic)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coffee, Vol. 1: Chemistry","description":"The term 'coffee' comprises not only the consumable beverage obtained by extracting roasted coffee with hot water, but also a whole range of intermediate products starting from the freshly harvested coffee cherries.

The scientific and technical study of coffee in its entirety therefore involves a wide range of scientific disciplines and practical skills. It is evident that green coffee is a natural product of great compositional complexity, and this is even more true for coffee products deriving from the roasting of coffee.

Franz Jakubowski set out to reintroduce the centrality of the Hegelian dialectic into Marx's method and to elaborate the concept of praxis.In the same period, only Lukacs and Korsch attempted to deal systemically with these problems, and it is they who are generally recognised as the main inspiration behind what is called Western Marxism, yet Franz Jakubowski is a key figure in the development of Marxist thought. And, unlike the others, Jakubowski was also an activist, and for this reason avoids the unnecessarily dense language of his fellow theoreticians.Ideology and Superstructure is rare in that it successfully conveys complex problems in a simple and straightforward form. At a time when the literature on Marx has become excessively obscuranist, Jakubowski's work serves as a useful antidote, and is an ideal text for introducing novices to the basics of Marxist theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Tr4fAAAAMAAJ&dq=Ideology+and+Superstructure+in+Historical+Materialism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Happy Halloween, Biscuit!","description":"DIV align=centerWooof!

It tells the story of the Reformed tradition from its birth in the cities of Switzerland to the unraveling of orthodoxy amid the new intellectual currents of the seventeenth century. As befits a pan-European movement, Benedict s canvas stretches from the British Isles to Eastern Europe. The course and causes of Calvinism s remarkable expansion, the inner workings of the diverse national churches, and the theological debates that shaped Reformed doctrine all receive ample attention. The English Reformation is situated within the history of continental Protestantism in a way that reveals the international significance of English developments. A fresh examination of Calvinist worship, piety, and discipline permits an up-to-date assessment of the classic theories linking Calvinism to capitalism and democracy. Benedict not only paints a vivid picture of the greatest early spokesmen of the cause, Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin, but also restores many lesser-known figures to their rightful place. Ambitious in conception, attentive to detail, this book offers a model of how to think about the history and significance of religious change across the long Reformation era.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JKj_x3W01hoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Indian cookery","description":"\\"Chef\\" magazine called this book's author \\"the best-known ambassador of Indian food in the United States\\" . . . and the \\"Boston Herald\\" referred to her as \\"the renowned author and actress who] teaches home cooks about the sophistication and infinite diversity of Indian fare.\\" \\"The New York Times\\" described her simply and succinctly as \\"the Indian cuisine authority.\\" For many years a best-selling cookbook, Madhur Jaffrey's seminal title on Indian cuisine now has been totally revised, redesigned, enlarged, and enhanced with 70 brand-new full-color photos.

He closely examines historical culture and conscience in nineteenth and twentieth century Romania, particularly concentrating on the impact of the national ideology on history. Boia's innovative analysis identifies several key mythical configurations and shows how Romanians have reconstituted their own highly ideologized history over the last two centuries. The strength of History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness lies in the author's ability to fully deconstruct the entire Romanian historiographic system and demonstrate the increasing acuteness of national problems in general, and in particular the exploitation of history to support national ideology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RM6MRPWXxQYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faith, Text, and History: The Bible in English (Studies in Religion and Culture)","description":"The scholarly study of the Old Testament is now marked by a rich diversity of approaches and concerns. In the last two decades, an interest in the text and the implications for its interpretation is no longer the preserve of a single scholarly community, while the reconstruction of the history of the people from whom it derived has been transformed by new methods. This new book published under the auspices of the Society for Old Testament Study reflects these new approaches anddevelopments, and has a particular concentration on literary and historical study. Thus, it not only clearly recognizes the diversity now inherent in 'Old Testament study', but also welcomes the integration into its field of the wide range of approaches available in current literary and historicalinvestigation.The study of the biblical text and how it is received and interpreted by its various readerships has a certain logical priority over the study of its historical background and authorship. Yet an ongoing investigation of issues relating to the latter cannot await definitive conclusions on the former. So, essays on the text and its reception discuss primary issues which arise in Old Testament study, while those on background and authorship reflect the continued vitality of, and the freshperspective possible in, more traditional scholarly concerns.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dL8RDAAAQBAJ&dq=Faith,+Text,+and+History:+The+Bible+in+English+(Studies+in+Religion+and+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Absolutely Positively Not (Sid Fleischman Humor Award)","description":"There is one thing Steven knows for sure: He's absolutely, positively NOT gay.

And if you can't, just think of your kids--all the time they have to spend in tight spaces--like cars, planes, trains, the doctor's office, the grocery store, being sick or housebound, waiting in line. Kids need room to move around, but there are many times when they just plain can't have it. While raising two exuberant boys, teaching preschool, leading Cub Scouts, and running a birthday party business, Carol Stock Kranowitz came up with savvy, creative ways to keep kids content in tight spaces. In 101 Activities for Kids in Tight Spaces, her activity ideas combine old standbys with new ones born of desperation and cramped quarters. They follow a philosophy that helps kids develop their different skills and abilities while entertaining themselves and interacting. You'll find great projects for every imaginable small space parents and children encounter: Fun Food for Tiny Kitchens: Ants on a Log, Footprints in the Snow, and Aiken Drum Faces In the Urban Community: Windowsill Garden, Bug Jar, and Corn-on-the-Sponge When the Walls Seem to Be Closing In: Pillow Crashing, People Sandwich, and Teeter-Totter When what you've got is a small space and a restless child, what you need are 101 ingenious solutions--right away.

He repeatedly insisted that the differences between humans and others were a question of degree only. Sciences were, however, taken in the opposite direction, where these differences cannot have been generated by the natural processes of biological evolution. In The Animal in the Secret World of Darwin, author Michel Bergeron discuses the effects on the sciences caused by the presence of questions on humanity only answerable with religious beliefs. His investigation suggests that significant elements of perceived humanity have remained sufficiently narrowly defined to continue to agree with religious beliefs over the entire period starting with the scientific revolution centuries ago and reaching the present. Instead, he questions, could we be the simple animal who can only live on the belief not to be a simple animal? To alleviate these biases on the sciences of life, Bergeron advocates a different synthesis between Darwinism and Lamarckism. He further asks: How can sciences pretend to a cosmology neutral in term of religious influence since all of its complex mathematical developments were made under the constraint that we can link the present directly to the Big Bang?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nFhR9tJLPyEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trapped in the Mall (Unicorn Club)","description":"Locked in the mall after closing time, the Unicorns decide to take full advantage by going crazy at their favorite places, from taking photos at the modeling shop, to trying on forbidden high heels, to ransacking the ice-cream shop.

Unjustly suspected of having had a hand in the murder of a young girl, Augustine takes refuge in the remote castle of Bavarian relatives. There his hopeless love for his devout cousin Mitzi blinds him to the hate that will lead to the rise of German fascism. The book reaches a climax with a brilliant description of the Munich putsch and a disturbingly intimate portrait of Adolph Hitler.

Submarine skippers reported that most of their torpedoes were either missing the targets or failing to explode if they did hit. The United States had to work fast if it expected to compete with the Japanese Long Lance, the biggest and fastest torpedo in the world, and Germany's electric and sonar models. Hellions of the Deep tells the dramatic story of how Navy planners threw aside the careful procedures of peacetime science and initiated &\\"radical research&\\": gathering together the nation's best scientists and engineers in huge research centers and giving them freedom of experimentation to create sophisticated weaponry with a single goal& winning the war. The largest center for torpedo work was a requisitioned gymnasium at Harvard University, where the most famous names in science worked with the best graduate students from all around the country at the business of war. They had to produce tangible weapons, to consider production and supply tactics, to take orders from the military, and, in many cases, also to teach the military how to use the weapons they developed. World War II grew into a chess match played by scientists and physicists, and it became the only war in history to be won by weapons invented during the conflict. For this book, Robert Gannon conducted numerous interviews over a twenty-year period with scientists, engineers, physicists, submarine skippers, and Navy bureaucrats, all involved in the development of the advanced weapons technology that won the war. While the search for new weapons was deadly serious, stretching imagination and resourcefulness to the limit each day, the need was obvious: American ships were being blown up daily just outside the Boston harbor. These oral histories reveal that, in retrospect, surprising even to those who went through it, the search for the &\\"hellions of the deep&\\" was, for many, the most exciting period of their lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hiwd4xsBGu4C&dq=Hellions+of+the+Deep:+The+Development+of+American+Torpedoes+in+World+War+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thinking for Yourself: Developing Critical Thinking Skills Through Reading and Writing","description":"THINKING FOR YOURSELF: DEVELOPING CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS THROUGH READING AND WRITING offers a unique integration of composition, reading, and critical thinking.

I've learnt so much from her'  DIANA HENRY Pam Corbin is the expert who professional cooks consult when they want to make jams, jellies, marmalades, chutneys, pickles or anything else to do with preserving. They know her as 'Pam the Jam', and this book is the culmination of her years of experience, distilled into more than 100 tried-and-tested recipes. Her jams, marmalades and fruit spreads contain far less sugar than traditional recipes, which means that they taste astonishingly fruity and delicious. Likewise, her chutneys and pickles are lighter and sprightlier than the old-fashioned kind. Pam will show you how to make more unusual preserves too  such as glossy fruit cheeses to serve with everything from Stilton to manchego (which calls for her classic quince membrillo). Or creamy yet zesty fruit curd: there's a recipe for classic lemon curd, and also a wonderfully light lime and coconut one. If you have an array of Pam's preserves in your store cupboard, you can transform any meal in an instant. She'll inspire you to dig into your jars of preserves to make spin-off recipes such as scrumptious lime cheesecake, cherry pie or spicy sausage rolls. Packed with detailed instructions, explanations and tips, this is the only preserve-making bible that you will ever need.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w26MDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gene Conspiracy or \\"Sorry--The Genes Made Me Do It\\"","description":"A daring expose' on how our genes shape our personality and. pull the strings on our actions, all part of a dark conspiracy that results in a myriad of dilemmas in modern multi-racial/multi-cultural societies.

Leroi-Gourhan (1911-1986) was an anthropologist and paleontologist whose theoretical endeavors extended well beyond those realms to encompass the culture of the twentieth century and its most advanced developments. His bold and coherent revision of both analytic and archaeological methods revolutionized the study of prehistoric culture. His adoption of the structuralist method for the analysis of prehistoric art enabled a radical rethinking and clearer understanding of its nature, with resulting implications for the understanding of the art of our own times, and for a broad range of contemporary issues.Leroi-Gourhan was, for example, concerned with questions of communication, particularly the ways in which new techniques of communication reshape our understanding of language and writing. His work in this field has proved catalytic for the thinking of other major theorists, among them Jacques Derrida. Gesture and Speech combines in one volume Technics and Language and Memory and Rhythms, which are the cornerstones of Leroi-Gourhan's comprehensive theory of human behavior and cultural development. In Technics and Language, Leroi-Gourhan looks at prehistoric technology in relation to the development of cognitive and linguistic faculties, expanding on the cultural ramifications of erect posture, a short face, a free hand during locomotion, and possession of movable implements.Memory and Rhythms approaches its subject from the standpoints of sociology and aesthetics. Here Leroi-Gourhan addresses the problems of instinct and intelligence. He defines the relationship between aesthetic behavior, on the one hand, and species attitudes and the personalization of ethnic groups, on the other, and undertakes a sweeping aesthetic analysis from visceral perception to figurative art, including a discussion of the \\"language of forms\\" that makes figurative art an abstract expression of language.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0rdNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Gesture+and+Speech+(October+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guide to Derech eretz","description":"The delicate interactions involved in relationships are described, using classical sources.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LLvIpHFAG5EC&dq=Guide+to+Derech+eretz&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Aught-Sixers","description":"Howard Hambone Hamblin, Hal Peterson, and Charles Belcher, three retired working-class heroes who are dismayed by the onset of globalization and the illegal immigration that goes along with it, set out to do something to rectify the situation.

The sad truth is that many cooks today do not know enough of the basics of foods and cooking to translate recipes to cook with confidence, let alone creatively. My Cooking Coach is a 500 page cornucopia of cooking knowledge that provides, as its slogan states, Cooking Knowledge at Your Fingertips. All of this cooking knowledge comes from a revised version of The Essential Cook, by Charles Delmar, winner of the prestigious Writings award from the International Assn. of Culinary Professionals (IACP). This new edition has been re-named and re-formatted in bite-sized pieces so it can be read as a quick reference from its Glossary/Index of more than 1,000 cooking terms, an important consideration for today's cooks who don't seem to have the time or the patience to read a textbook. Of course, it can also be read as a book that one reviewer for the first edition described as A really good, and informative, read. From Part One, First You Steal a Chicken: How to Plan, Select, Store, Prepare, Cook, Flavor and Serve most foods, through Part Three: How to Set a Dining Table and Other Facts of Life, with How Good Cooks Do It: Basic Cooking Methods and Techniques in between, My Cooking Coach uses clear, direct language and more than 400 informative illustrations, along with Master Recipes, to explain the basic Whats, Whys and How-tos of foods and cooking. There are no conventional recipes in My Cooking Coach.

The importance of the international flow of factors has grown in recent decades, primarily because of increasing returns, imperfect competition, multinational corporations, and labor migration; theories of factor mobility and trade in goods can no longer be lumped together. Using sophisticated techniques, as well as simple economic intuitions and easy-to-follow diagrams, Kar-yiu Wong systematically presents within unified frameworks all the basic analytical techniques involved in the theories of international trade and factor mobility. Wong also provides extensive coverage of such issues as interactions between international trade in goods and capital movement, external economies of scale, monopolistic competition and differentiated products, oligopoly, welfare economics of international trade, and policy analysis for various models, and he devotes two separate chapters to multinational corporations and international labor migration. New techniques and approaches to these issues are suggested, and new results obtained for many of them. For instance, the discussion of intra-industry trade in the presence of positive transport cost and arbitrage is new, as is the systematic examination of the relationship between international trade in goods and factor mobility with external economies of scale, monopolistic competition, and oligopoly. Of particular importance to trade theorists, these issues serve as the link between neoclassical and imperfect-competition models.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0GeFQgAACAAJ&dq=International+Trade+in+Goods+and+Factor+Mobility&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Custom of the Castle: From Malory to Macbeth","description":"\\"Custom, according to Ross, may be examined as the reflection of knotty moral situations and problems and contradictions . . . the occasion for pondering the ways in which arbitrary rules and virtuous behavior collide and interfere with each other.

Through research and writing, participants will come not only to a better understanding of their faith, but will have a summary of that faith written in their own words.To help participants find answers to the questions in the workbook, each question has been referenced to paragraph numbers in the Catechism of the Catholic Church and to page numbers in the popular catechism This is Our Faith by Michael Pennock.Like the Catechism, which is divided into four pillars (creed, sacraments, morality, and prayer), Questions of Faith is also organized into four sections: Profession of Faith (creed), The Celebration of the Christian Mystery (liturgy and sacraments), Life in Christ (morality), and Christian Prayer. Each section begins with a brief introduction and is followed bythe writing questions for that section, which appear two per page. In addition to the writing questions, personal thought questions are included to help participants make connections between the Church's long, living tradition and their own experiences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_mKqPQAACAAJ&dq=Questions+of+Faith%3B+A+Workbook+Companion+to+the+Catechism+of+the+Catholic+Church&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The seekers of Shar-Nuhn (Doubleday science fiction)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kVMW3SkE1w0C&dq=The+seekers+of+Shar-Nuhn+(Doubleday+science+fiction)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sewing Beautiful Pillows (A Sterling/Sewing Information Resources Book)","description":"Since its founding in 1798, the city of Hamtramck, Michigan has evolved from a dusty farming community on the edge of Detroit into a nationally recognized town of culture and character. The Dodge Main factory, founded in 1910, drew thousands of immigrants to the city of Hamtramck, and a vibrant, multi-cultural community began to grow. Over the course of the next 90 years, the people of Hamtramck developed a landmark educational system, a strong devotion to church and family, a fiery political scene, and labor-organizing activities with national reverberations. In this book, author Greg Kowalski uses a unique collection of historical photographs to document Hamtramck's incredible growth throughout the years, and reveal the unmatched integrity, commitment, and independence of its people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EsoyFaWIjSoC&dq=Sewing+Beautiful+Pillows+(A+Sterling/Sewing+Information+Resources+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holy Man: Father Damien of Molokai","description":"\\"An absolutely fascinating book.\\" --Washington Post \\"Beautifully written, deeply perceptive.\\" --Los Angeles Times \\"Superb.

Instead, I found myself falling into the hands of one of the great writers and thinkers of our time. Chanel Miller is a philosopher, a cultural critic, a deep observer, a writer's writer, a true artist. I could not put this phenomenal book down.\\" --Glennon Doyle, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Love Warrior and Untamed \\"Know My Name is a gut-punch, and in the end, somehow, also blessedly hopeful.\\" --Washington Post She was known to the world as Emily Doe when she stunned millions with a letter. Brock Turner had been sentenced to just six months in county jail after he was found sexually assaulting her on Stanford's campus. Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed, where it instantly went viral--viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case. Thousands wrote to say that she had given them the courage to share their own experiences of assault for the first time. Now she reclaims her identity to tell her story of trauma, transcendence, and the power of words. It was the perfect case, in many ways--there were eyewitnesses, Turner ran away, physical evidence was immediately secured. But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life. Know My Name will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. It also introduces readers to an extraordinary writer, one whose words have already changed our world. Entwining pain, resilience, and humor, this memoir will stand as a modern classic.

Our nation has become dispirited and divided because we are looking the wrong direction for help. Some are looking to the right, even as far as the Tea Party. Others are gazing to the left toward those behind the Occupy moments. Many of the remainder are looking toward a future where their children and grandchildren will have a lower standard of living. The reason for such poor vision is that we have stopped looking up to the truth. Gary Moore, Wall Street veteran, commentator, and founder of The Financial Seminary skillfully uses Scripture, an experienced understanding of the economy, and artful insight into the political environment to issue the call that help comes when we look up. Tony Campolo says Gary Moore \\"transcends the easy answers of what is wrong with America being provided by those on the political right and finds that real sources of trouble lie in a moral deficit that has emerged in our nation over the past fifty years. Tapping into the rich treasure house of scripture he endeavors to explore what Jesus prescribed as the cures for our economic maladies.\\" \\"Look Up America\\" will give you hope. You will realize that, even though it is a concern, the federal debt is not on the verge of bankrupting our nation. You will be encouraged to look at what God has done for us rather than fearing what we are doing to ourselves. The information found in \\"Look Up America\\" should be read and understood by every candidate running for office and every politician who purports to comprehend our nation's economic needs. It is a book of refreshing good news. Never one to shy away from controversial matters, Gary Moore also offers a valuable word to the church about the failure to teach and practice real stewardship. He calls the church to move beyond the singular emphasis of getting out of debt and begin to proclaim a message that he calls \\"stewardism.\\" This simply means that we should build an economy and practice on morality rather than corporate profit alone. Financial expert Jim Blasingame says, \\"America needs the wisdom Gary Moore delivers in his new book, Look Up America. As you're drawn into these pages, here's what you will learn about my friend: He's an intellectual, delivering these big ideas in plain English.

In the last two decades, an interest in the text and the implications for its interpretation is no longer the preserve of a single scholarly community, while the reconstruction of the history of the people from whom it derived has been transformed by new methods. This new book published under the auspices of the Society for Old Testament Study reflects these new approaches anddevelopments, and has a particular concentration on literary and historical study. Thus, it not only clearly recognizes the diversity now inherent in 'Old Testament study', but also welcomes the integration into its field of the wide range of approaches available in current literary and historicalinvestigation.The study of the biblical text and how it is received and interpreted by its various readerships has a certain logical priority over the study of its historical background and authorship. Yet an ongoing investigation of issues relating to the latter cannot await definitive conclusions on the former. So, essays on the text and its reception discuss primary issues which arise in Old Testament study, while those on background and authorship reflect the continued vitality of, and the freshperspective possible in, more traditional scholarly concerns.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dL8RDAAAQBAJ&dq=Faith,+Text+and+History:+The+Bible+in+English+(Studies+in+Religion+and+Culture+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introductory physics: A problem-solving approach","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TMDFPwAACAAJ&dq=Introductory+physics:+A+problem-solving+approach&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forever Sad the Hearts","description":"When Kate Shea works as a nurse in war-torn Viet Nam, she tries to hide from the war's horror in a love affair with a young soldier","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9g8DAgAACAAJ&dq=Forever+Sad+the+Hearts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Robert Powell's the Great Awakening: Reflections on Zen and Reality (A Quest book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oUzyswEACAAJ&dq=Robert+Powell%27s+the+Great+Awakening:+Reflections+on+Zen+and+Reality+(A+Quest+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doctor Kate, angel on snowshoes: The story of Kate Pelham Newcomb, M.D","description":"Doctor Kate, Angel on Snowshoes, which was first published in 1956, tells the inspiring story of a woman doctor whose faith and selfless devotion to her community saved hundreds of lives and built a church and a hospital a woman who won the respect and love of all who knew her.

Symptoms of the crisis are a dramatic decrease in the number of students, financial difficulties and the resulting closures of German Departments. Furthermore, the language skills which finally emerge from universities are not always satisfactory.

It has offered a generalized techne with only limited categories, appropriate for all discursive situations, at least for those that were not excluded from the realm of rhetoric. Nonetheless, from its beginnings, rhetoric limited its interests to certain activity fields such as law, government, religion, and most important, the educators of leaders in these activity fields. This collection presents landmarks showing where the Writing-Across-the-Curriculum (WAC) and Writing in the Disciplines (WID) movements have gone. They have opened up a number of prospects that were impossible to see when rhetoric and composition confined their gaze to relatively few discursive activities. This suggests that the rhetorical landscape is becoming more complex and interesting, as well as more responsive to life in the complex, differentiated societies that have emerged in the last few centuries. This volume will reveal to scholars and researchers a range of possibilities for the study of disciplinary discourse and its teaching, and suggest to them new prospects for the future -- and for the better.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1GIPEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Book for Preachers: One Hundred and One Ideas for Better Sermons","description":"Preachers communicate God s word by fully considering their context and their congregation.

As a professor of psychology at the University of Washington and the founder and director of the Seattle Marital and Family Institute, he has studied the habits of married couples in unprecedented detail over the course of many years. His findings, and his heavily attended workshops, have already turned around thousands of faltering marriages. This book is the culmination of his life's work: the seven principles that guide couples on the path toward a harmonious and long-lasting relationship. Straightforward in their approach, yet profound in their effect, these principles teach partners new and startling strategies for making their marriage work. Gottman helps couples focus on each other, on paying attention to the small day-to-day moments that, strung together, make up the heart and soul of any relationship. Being thoughtful about ordinary matters provides spouses with a solid foundation for resolving conflict when it does occur and finding strategies for living with those issues that cannot be resolved. Packed with questionnaires and exercises whose effectiveness has been proven in Dr. Gottman's workshops, The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work is the definitive guide for anyone who wants their relationship to attain its highest potential. The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work is the result of Dr. John Gottman's many years of closely observing thousands of marriages. This kind of longitudinal research has never been done before. Based on his findings, he has culled seven principles essential to the success of any marriage. Maintain a love map. Foster fondness and admiration. Turn toward instead of away. Accept influence. Solve solvable conflicts. Cope with conflicts you can't resolve. Create shared meaning. Dr. Gottman's unique questionnaires and exercises will guide couples on the road to revitalizing their marriage, or making a strong one even better.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8IWOxW1VEIYC&dq=Your+marriage+can+work:+A+practical+guide+to+marriage+happiness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ready-to-Use Revision and Proofreading Activities: Unit 5, Includes 90 Sequential Activities for Improving Written Language Skills in Grades 6 through 12 (v. 5)","description":"This comprehensive guide will prepare candidates for the test in all 50 states.

Hearers accept that, as individuals, they possess a lifetime of experiences and actions which inform, but may also undermine, their aspirations in gaining political capital. Additionally, as representatives of a political party and its ideology, these actors do not exist in isolation; they are members and, at times, potential candidates of a particular party with its own agenda which may, in turn, cause them to modify their personal speech to align with espoused policies of the party. The various contributions contained in this volume examine the discourse of political actors through the lenses of positionality and stance. Throughout its chapters, clearly defined theoretical perspectives and specified social practices are employed, enabling the authors to elucidate how political actors can situate themselves, their party, and their opponents toward their ostensive public. This book successfully demonstrates how espoused perspectives relate to, or reflect on, the nature of the individual political actor and their truth, the party they represent and its ideology, and the pandering to popular public opinion to gain support and co-operation. This book will hold particular appeal for postgraduate students, researchers, and scholars of discourse studies, pragmatics, political science, as well as other areas in humanities and the social sciences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=goDUDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CMOS Analog Circuit Design","description":"This text presents the principles and techniques for designing analog circuits to be implemented in a CMOS technology.

How do we answer the question posed by the Apostle Thomas when he asked how can we know the way (Jn. 14:5)? In other words, how should we fill that parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity, which James Joyce (Ulysses) maintained, demarcates each of our lives? The Bible has often been put forth as a supposedly infallible guidebook charting the correct path to an authentic existence (e.g. 2 Tim. 3:16-17). According to its proponents, Scripture is an absolutely dependable life-manual because it is the word of God (Summa Theologica, First Part, Q. 1, Art. 10). However, close inspection of the Bible calls into question its divine authorship; and, thus, its reliability as an accurate roadmap for the soul. In fact, under close examination it proves to be nothing more than a mundane and cobbled together collection of archaic superstitions beginning with the outlandish speculations of Moses concerning the creation of the world and ending with the maniacal ravings of John regarding its destruction. Exposing the true nature of Holy Writ was the main purpose for writing Unholy Writ. The modus operandi for this expos involved a thoroughgoing critical analysis of Scripture. The results from such a careful consideration of its contents clearly demonstrated that any claim that the Bible is some sort of sacrosanct ethical vade mecum is completely invalid. Specifically, the multiple contradictions and absurdities contained in the Bible confer an unreliability upon it that undermines its function as a guide for anything, let alone as some sort of moral map for the journey through life. Furthermore, many of the ideas that are promoted in Holy Writ are actually spiritually harmful. In addition, unless the condoned misogyny, violence, intolerance, injustice, and cruelty can be removed, then it is difficult to view the Scriptures as anything like an unwavering celestial beacon that clearly lights the way through the moral fog that at times engulfs our lives. Moreover, the many errors that it contains, including those about the natural world, undermine the pivotal claim that the Bible is divinely inspired.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4zFBaBpsp3EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NKJV Gift and Award Bible","description":"With its affordable price and beautiful design options, the NKJV Gift and Award Bible is a great choice for celebrating milestones and special achievements.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YQ3GAQAACAAJ&dq=NKJV+Gift+and+Award+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Where Have All the Flowers Gone","description":"One of the most important and influential figures in American music offers his autobiography in words and songs.

Noting the resemblance of the new, oddly shaped district to a well-known amphibian, a local newspaper dubbed the creation a \\"gerrymander.\\" Less well known about this oft-recounted episode of American history, writes political scientist Mark Rush, is its outcome: in the ensuing election, the Federalists won the district anyway. Today, politically divisive redistricting--gerrymandering to some--still causes bitter reapportionment disputes, renewed threats of class action lawsuits, and legislative wrangling. In Does Redistricting Make a Difference? Rush offers a skeptical inquiry into this controversy and a critical assessment of the assumptions underlying current analyses of the redistricting process. He focuses on long-term voting results in redrawn districts and concludes that redistricting--at least given present criteria and guidelines--has little impact. By showing how difficult it is to perpetrate a successful partisan gerrymander, Rush challenges the notion that an electorate can be organized into Democratic and Republican \\"groups.\\" He further questions the validity of current political research--and highly paid political consulting--undertaken on the assumption that such organization is feasible. Certain to provoke discussion and debate, Does Redistricting make a Difference? is a timely look at a topic as controversial today as it was in the days of Elbridge Gerry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AgioqiRbFykC&dq=Does+Redistricting+Make+a+Difference%3F:+Partisan+Representation+and+Electoral+Behavior&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Navaho Weaving","description":"DIVFirst in-depth technical study of Navaho weaving dyes, looms, other aspects.

Foremost of these was Frank Minis Johnson, Jr., of Montgomery, Alabama, who presided over some of the most emotional hearings and trials of the rights movement--hearings brimming with dramatic and poignant testimony from the black people who cried out for the freedoms that are the legacy of all Americans. Beginning with Judge Johnson's coming-of-age in the hill country of Winston County, Alabama, this book covers many of his notable cases: the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the Freedom Rides, school desegregation, the Selma-to-Montgomery march, and the night-rider slaying of Viola Liuzzo, as well as Johnson's work for prisoners, women, and the mentally ill. Much of the book is comprised of interviews and direct quotes from Johnson himself, making this recounting of Judge Johnson's life dynamically autobiographical.

Jockey Willie Simms won in 1896, bringing his horse in at two minutes and seven seconds. James Winkfield was the winning jockey in both 1901 and 1902 with winning race times of two minutes and seven seconds and two minutes and eight seconds, respectively. Each of these men possessed the skill and power necessary to spur a horse to glorious victory. All are members of the small, select group of Derby-winning jockeys who were African Americans. The stakes were high: Black jockeys who won a race in the late 1700s and 1800s sometimes won freedom from slavery as well. This work examines the presence of black jockeys in the Kentucky Derby, from the first instance of slaves working as stable hands and tending their masters  horses to the first black jockey to win the prestigious Kentucky Derby in 1875 and the continued participation of black jockeys in the Kentucky Derby. Black owners and trainers in the Kentucky Derby are also discussed.

A masterful and encompassing book, Holding the Center develops from the fulcrum of the self in the natural world. Many of Heckler s lessons arise from his life as a householder and father. Community is a larger family we make alliances to  take care of what matters to us.  But, as Heckler teaches, that takes listening to others with an open heart, and learning what the needs of others are.The world can be a sanctuary, if we find a balance between instinct and choice.

I feel this is a very significant resource. One of the great challenges of taking on this issue is that it is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, we have to focus on the extent of the damage, but on the other hand, we can't feed into the great trick of the Soton of making ourselves feel like a failure. This book does a great job of walking that line. It is on target, clear, uplifting, and real. It wasn't written from an ivory tower - it was written by one who has been there fighting the fight of our generation. It has been a long time since I was so impressed by a book.

It is widely held that spoken and written Japanese require separate efforts by the student, as if these two aspects were in fact distinct languages. A first step toward alleviating this situation was taken by Yasuko Mitamura in 1985 with the publication of Let's Learn Hiragana and Let's Learn Katakana, which continue to help thousands of students every year to master these two forms of Japanese script. Now, Let's Learn Kanji goes to the heart of the problem: the learning of kanji (i.e., Chinese characters as they are used in Japan). Not simply a brilliant exposition but also a workbook, it teaches the student how to write the basic strokes, how to put these together into full-fledged kanji, and how kanji function in the context of example sentences. Progress is continually checked, and the student is encouraged through quizzes and exercises. The result: 250 fundamental characters learned almost painlessly.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xZ1NEAAAQBAJ&dq=Let%27s+Learn+Kanji:+An+Introduction+to+Radicals,+Components+and+250+Very+Basic+Kanji+(Kodansha%27s+Children%27s+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fire Beneath The Ice (Arabesque)","description":"Embracing marriage with Kenneth Maxwell, the man of her dreams, champion figure skater Omunique Philyaw is surrounded by happiness until a devastating tragedy strikes, forcing Omunique to question her seemingly perfect life.

On July 15, 1926, the Connecticut Light and Power Company's board of directors approved a plan to create a lake for the purpose of producing electric power, a decision that changed the face of the valley forever. Plans moved quickly, and the company bought the valley land and built several dams to contain the water. On February 25, 1928, the fill-up began, and in a mere seven months, Candlewood Lake was born.

These myths are all of remarkable beauty and exceptional value; among the more noteworthy is \\"Olelbis,\\" containing an account of the creation of the heavenly house in the Central Blue, the highest point in the sky above us. In this mythis described also the great World Fire which was extinguished by a flood; and next a reconstruction of the face of the earth, which gave the form existing at present. In addition to their intrinsic beauty, these masterpieces of the primitive human mind in America antedate by many ages the earliest forms of thought represented to us in the records of Egypt and Assyria, hence their value may be easily inferred; they explain to us things which had become unintelligible to the priests of Egypt and Assyria in the religious systems which they themselves taught and studied.

It has been estimated that as many as thirty percent of children typed as \\"epileptic\\" when presenting with loss of consciousness, falls or other paroxysmal episodes have, in fact, non-epileptic attacks. Yet because of the stigma attached to this label, and the frequent side effects of anti-epileptic drugs, it is important that the alternative etiological mechanisms be recognized. The most common of these conditions, the vagalmediated anoxic seizure or fainting fit, is so frequent that it will be encountered by anyone involved in the practice of clinical medicine in its widest sense. These seizures are discussed in depth using original data and extensively reviewing the literature. Many other less common, but nonetheless important, varieties of fits, faints and \\"funny turns\\" are self-induced by a Valsalva maneuver, and motor events ranging from day-dreaming to the effects of suffocation and brain swelling. As Jean Aicardi writes in his foreword to this volume: \\"Over 140 case histories...bring the flavor of real life into an exhaustive, yet highly readable account...This monograph is undoubtedly the most comprehensive source of information available about the various types of anoxic attacks, their clinical and EEG features, mechanisms and prognosis...This is a delightful book that anyone involved in clinical medicine in general and child neurology in particular will enjoy reading.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C4wuZqqqc4sC&dq=Fits+and+faints+(Clinics+in+developmental+medicine)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introductory quantum mechanics","description":"This book presents a basic introduction to quantum mechanics. Depending on the choice of topics, it can be used for a one-semester or two-semester course. An attempt has been made to anticipate the conceptual problems students encounter when they first study quantum mechanics. Wherever possible, examples are given to illustrate the underlying physics associated with the mathematical equations of quantum mechanics. To this end, connections are made with corresponding phenomena in classical mechanics and electromagnetism. The problems at the end of each chapter are intended to help students master the course material and to explore more advanced topics. Many calculations exploit the extraordinary capabilities of computer programs such as Mathematica, MatLab, and Maple. Students are urged to use these programs, just as they had been urged to use calculators in the past. The treatment of various topics is rather complete, in that most steps in derivations are included. Several of the chapters go beyond what is traditionally covered in an introductory course.

Chittadhar H?daya, a master poet from Nepal, wrote this tour de force while imprisoned for subversion in the 1940s and smuggled it out over time on scraps of paper. His consummate skill and poetic artistry are evident throughout as he tells the Buddha s story in dramatic terms, drawing on images from the natural world to heighten the description of emotionally charged events. It is peopled with very human characters who experience a wide range of emotions, from erotic love to anger, jealousy, heroism, compassion, and goodwill. By showing how the central events of the Buddha s life are experienced by Siddhartha, as well as by his family members and various disciples, the poem communicates a fuller sense of the humanity of everyone involved and the depth and power of the Buddha s loving-kindness. For this new edition of the English translation, the translators improved the beauty and flow of most every line. The translation is also supplemented with a series of short essays by Todd Lewis, one of the translators, that articulates how H?daya incorporated his own Newar cultural traditions in order to connect his readership with the immediacy and relevancy of the Buddha s life and at the same time express his views on political issues, ethical principles, literary life, gender discrimination, economic policy, and social reform.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GV-UDwAAQBAJ&dq=Buddha:+His+Life+and+Teaching&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real Life Guide to Graduate & Professional School: How to Choose, Apply for, and Finance Your Advanced Degree!","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Spyro the Dragon: Prima's Official Strategy Guide","description":"SPYRO is a go anywhere, real-time 3D fantasy adventure that casts the player in the role of a fire-breathing dragon named Spyro.

Anne Moody s autobiography is an eloquent, moving testimonial to her courage.  Chicago Tribune Born to a poor couple who were tenant farmers on a plantation in Mississippi, Anne Moody lived through some of the most dangerous days of the pre-civil rights era in the South. The week before she began high school came the news of Emmet Till s lynching. Before then, she had  known the fear of hunger, hell, and the Devil. But now there was . . . the fear of being killed just because I was black.  In that moment was born the passion for freedom and justice that would change her life. A straight-A student who realized her dream of going to college when she won a basketball scholarship, she finally dared to join the NAACP in her junior year. Through the NAACP and later through CORE and SNCC, she experienced firsthand the demonstrations and sit-ins that were the mainstay of the civil rights movement and the arrests and jailings, the shotguns, fire hoses, police dogs, billy clubs, and deadly force that were used to destroy it. A deeply personal story but also a portrait of a turning point in our nation s destiny, this autobiography lets us see history in the making, through the eyes of one of the footsoldiers in the civil rights movement. Praise for Coming of Age in Mississippi  A history of our time, seen from the bottom up, through the eyes of someone who decided for herself that things had to be changed . . . a timely reminder that we cannot now relax.  Senator Edward Kennedy, The New York Times Book Review  Something is new here . . . rural southern black life begins to speak. It hits the page like a natural force, crude and undeniable and, against all principles of beauty, beautiful.  The Nation  Engrossing, sensitive, beautiful . . . so candid, so honest, and so touching, as to make it virtually impossible to put down.

Selling Out America traces the whole story of Bill Clinton s corrupt relationship to Communist China as president, from the reporter who broke these stories and ultimately ran for the United States Senate to bring greater awareness to the dangers facing America. \\"I have spent much of the past six years investigating the Clinton administration's sell-off of our military technology to Communist China. During this time, I learned more about corruption than I ever would have believed possible. \\"But the corruption was not limited to the White House, or even to a single political party: it spread throughout the upper echelons of American society, reaching Members of Congress, intelligence community analysts, top business leaders, and the media. \\"When a Congressional commission uncovered evidence that China had gained access to U.S. nuclear secrets through espionage, the Washington Post assigned a journalist to cover the story whose wife was a Clinton administration political appointee. \\"China's nuclear espionage and the way it was misreported by the main media is part of a deeper and ultimately more dangerous trend: China's concerted efforts through corruption, trade, and investment to entwine U.S. interests so thoroughly with those of the PRC that no future President will dare to contain China's military might, because of the unacceptable military and economic costs to America. The emergence of Communist China as a world power, armed with U.S. help, will be President Clinton's ultimate legacy.

In April 1997 Reynolds Price received an eloquent letter from a reader of his cancer memoir, A Whole New Life. The correspondent, a young medical student diagnosed with cancer himself and facing his own mortality, asked these difficultQuestions. The two began a long-distance correspondence, culminating in Price's thoughtful response, originally delivered as the Jack and Lewis Rudin Lecture at Auburn Theological Seminary, and now expanded onto the printed page as Letter to a Man in the Fire. Harvesting a variety of sources -- diverse religious traditions, classical and modern texts, and a lifetime of personal experiences, interactions, and spiritual encounters -- Price meditates on God's participation in our fate. With candor and sympathy, he offers the reader such a rich variety of tools to explore these questions as to place this work in the company of other great tetsaments of faith from St. Augustine to C. S. Lewis. Letter to a Man in the Fire moves as much as it educates. It is a rare combination of deep erudition, vivid prose, and profound humanity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1lC8aaY-4eYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dream Realized: A Collection of Poems By Cowboy Mike Bright","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3P4diJUlENsC&dq=A+Dream+Realized:+A+Collection+of+Poems+By+Cowboy+Mike+Bright&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Volume 16","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Revelation: The Road to Overcoming","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YyE6tAEACAAJ&dq=Revelation:+The+Road+to+Overcoming&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magic of Krynn: Tales, Volume I (Dragonlance Tales)","description":"Nine short stories and a novel journey to the magical world of Krynn and feature the strange creatures and races of Krynn, along with an appearance by the Companions of the Lance and the twins Caramon and Raistlin.

Better care is possible now, but current methods of organizing and financing palliative, end-of-life, and bereavement care complicate the provision and coordination of services to help children and families and sometimes require families to choose between curative or life-prolonging care and palliative services, in particular, hospice care. Inadequate data and scientific knowledge impede efforts to deliver effective care, educate professionals to provide such care, and design supportive public policies. Integrating effective palliative care from the time a child's life-threatening medical problem is diagnosed will improve care for children who survive as well as children who die-and will help the families of all these children. The report recognizes that while much can be done now to support children and families, much more needs to be learned. The analysis and recommendations reflect current knowledge and judgments, but new research and insights will undoubtedly suggest modifications and shifts in emphasis in future years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GfA4_UdTK8IC&dq=When+Children+Die:+Improving+Palliative+and+End-Of-Life+Care+for+Children+and+Their+Families&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cuentos de Andersen","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mvOwNAEACAAJ&dq=Cuentos+de+Andersen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Logic Machines & Diagrams","description":"Traces the development of logic machines from diagrams of logical statements to modern computers and discusses the fundamentals of mathematical logic","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g3hhxgEACAAJ&dq=Logic+Machines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flight To Freedom","description":"Writing in the diary which her father gave her, thirteen-year-old Yara describes life with her family in Havana, Cuba, in 1967 as well as her experiences in Miami, Florida, after immigrating there to be reunited with some relatives while leaving others behind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UrK0myfDcqUC&dq=Flight+To+Freedom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Computerized Running Training Programs","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nYcfvwEACAAJ&dq=Computerized+Running+Training+Programs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kalevala: The Land of the Heroes (European thought)","description":"Translation of the great Finnish epic of ancient life in the Far North first published in 1907.

Entertainment Weekly A funny and profound story about family in all its strange forms, joyful and hard-won vulnerability, becoming who you're supposed to be, and the limits of love. Benson and Mike are two young guys who live together in Houston. Mike is a Japanese American chef at a Mexican restaurant and Benson's a Black day care teacher, and they've been together for a few years good years but now they're not sure why they're still a couple. There's the sex, sure, and the meals Mike cooks for Benson, and, well, they love each other. But when Mike finds out his estranged father is dying in Osaka just as his acerbic Japanese mother, Mitsuko, arrives in Texas for a visit, Mike picks up and flies across the world to say goodbye. In Japan he undergoes an extraordinary transformation, discovering the truth about his family and his past. Back home, Mitsuko and Benson are stuck living together as unconventional roommates, an absurd domestic situation that ends up meaning more to each of them than they ever could have predicted. Without Mike's immediate pull, Benson begins to push outwards, realizing he might just know what he wants out of life and have the goods to get it. Both men will change in ways that will either make them stronger together, or fracture everything they've ever known.

It is widely held that spoken and written Japanese require separate efforts by the student, as if these two aspects were in fact distinct languages. A first step toward alleviating the problem of learning Chinese characters, or kanji, was taken by Yasuko Mitamura in 1997 with the publication of Let's Learn Kanji, which introduced the student to the fundamentals -- strokes, radicals, components -- and 250 basic kanji. Now, Let's Learn More Kanji goes one step beyond: the learning of complex kanji and the formation of compounds of more than one character. Not just a brilliant exposition but also a workbook, Let's Learn More Kanji teaches the student how to analyze difficult characters in terms of radicals, components, and basic kanji, how to put kanji together into compounds, and how to recognize and learn any kanji not introduced in this book. Progress is continually checked, and the student is encouraged through quizzes and exercises.

A richly tapestried epic  (Kirkus Reviews). An inventive reimagining of the story of Jason and the Argonauts, this novel by renowned poet and classicist Robert Graves brings heroic figures of Hellenistic myth to life. Graves s Jason is belligerent, energetic, and full of life, and the society Graves builds for him is outlandish and deeply invested in ancient cults. Against this primitive, religious backdrop, the charismatic Jason assembles a crew and sets out to retrieve the sacred gold-trimmed fleece that is sacred to Zeus, and that has been stolen by worshippers of the Triple Goddess. Accompanying him is Hercules, a brave warrior known more for his brawn, and his astonishingly good luck, than his brains. Robert Graves builds a compelling world that sets Hellenistic magic and mystery in a surprisingly gritty, realistic setting, a fascinating read for fans of Greek mythology.  A witty historical novel with much insider s lore on cult and ritual.

Much of this development work resides in industrial reports, feasibility study papers and the reports of advanced collaborative projects. The series offers an opportunity for researchers to present an extended exposition of such new work in all aspects of industrial control for wider and rapid dissemination. Operating plant as close as possible to constraint boundaries so often brings economic benefits in industrial process control. This is the conundrum at the heart of this monograph by Tommy Gravdahl and Olav Egeland on stall control for compressors. Operation of the compressor closer to the surge line can increase operational efficiency and flexibility The approach taken by the authors follows the modern control system paradigm: -physical understanding, detailed modelling and simulation studies and finally control studies.

Stewart '26 Series on Eastern Europe)","description":"The recent war in Chechnya, despite all the media coverage, remains a confusing tangle for many people. The war was the result of many conflicting political, economic, judicial, and military issues that had been fermenting for decades. Only the most fundamental goals became clearly visible: for Moscow, the preservation of its territorial integrity; for Chechens, the struggle for national independence. In this carefully researched and extensively documented study, Stasys Knezys and Romanas Sedlickas examine the Chechnyan war from a military viewpoint. As they evenhandedly depict the strengths and weaknesses of both the Russians and Chechens, the authors consider how and why Russia, with one of the world's largest armies, failed to subdue the Chechens, and how the Chechens fought among themselves, yet also fought off the Russian Goliath. One reason the Chechens had the success they did was the expansion of the relationship of \\"politics and war\\" to the triangle of \\"politics, war, and terrorism.\\" Knezys and Sedlickas examine this question: \\"Is military terrorism . . . a new tactical element, ensuring the success of a small country's resistance to a powerful army?\\" The War in Chechnya does not answer all the questions raised by this war, but it presents comprehensive, objective, impartial information about the military strategy and nature and conduct of operations on both sides to allow the reader to begin to answer some of those questions. Military analysts and historians, political scientists, and Eastern European scholars will find The War in Chechnya an illuminating analysis of the military operations there and a valuable source of information for further studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iThpAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+War+in+Chechnya+(Eugenia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Pure Corn Whiskey: A Professional Guide For Amateur And Micro Distillers","description":"A comprehensive home-distilling book that specifically addresses the small-scale production of whiskey.

I was in jail a long time, you know. I m paying for my sins. Now I live in a dingy apartment. I get to watch my neighbors  kids play and have a normal life that I ll never have. I smell their barbecues. I m already in hell, believe me.  Joe turned to go back to the car.  You don t know what hell is. You have no idea.  When Jos  Francisco Verguerio Silva arrives at LAX, fleeing the brutal dictatorship in his native Brazil, he is determined to become Americanized at all costs. He lands a job driving a Hollywood tour bus and posing as Ricky Ricardo. He marries a blonde waitress and becomes the father of twins. Yet happiness remains elusive for Joe as he is haunted by flashbacks of prison torture. And soon a torrid affair with Rosea Socorro Katz, the crazed daughter of Hollywood s Brazilian star Carmen Socorro, proves to be even more dangerous than the life he has fled. Rosea spent her childhood watching her mother unravel as the celebrity system toyed with and eventually destroyed her career. Carmen had always claimed to be descended from Amazons, the woman warriors of legend, but she was tamed by Hollywood. Not Rosea. She has just finished serving jail time for setting fire to the home of her ex-husband in an attempt to destroy his collection of Brazilian artifacts and sets out to salvage her life. Along the way, she manages to tear down the lives of everyone she meets. The Brazil of the imagination is shattered in this novel of two tortured souls wrestling with the myths of movies, politics, and the American Dream. Laced with fantastic tales of bird-boys and cannibal rituals, it spins a compelling story of desperation as it reminds us that American freedom and the myth of unbridled opportunity can also consume and destroy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aj9zEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Italy Today The Beautiful Cookbook : Contemporary Recipes Reflecting Simple, Fresh Italian Cooking","description":"First published in 1988, Italy the Beautiful Cookbook (200,000 copies sold) set the standard for exquisite presentation of Italy's authentic cuisine, combining recipes with scenic photography and details of each region.

Among all aspects of Jefferson's renowned life, it was perhaps the most hotly contested topic. The publication of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings intensified this debate by identifying glaring inconsistencies in many noted scholars' evaluations of the existing evidence. In this study, Gordon-Reed assembles a fascinating and convincing argument: not that the alleged thirty-eight-year liaison necessarily took place but rather that the evidence for its taking place has been denied a fair hearing. Friends of Jefferson sought to debunk the Hemings story as early as 1800, and most subsequent historians and biographers followed suit, finding the affair unthinkable based upon their view of Jefferson's life, character, and beliefs. Gordon-Reed responds to these critics by pointing out numerous errors and prejudices in their writings, ranging from inaccurate citations, to impossible time lines, to virtual exclusions of evidence especially evidence concerning the Hemings family. She demonstrates how these scholars may have been misguided by their own biases and may even have tailored evidence to serve and preserve their opinions of Jefferson. This updated edition of the book also includes an afterword in which the author comments on the DNA study that provided further evidence of a Jefferson and Hemings liaison.00 Possessing both a layperson's unfettered curiosity and a lawyer's logical mind, Annette Gordon-Reed writes with a style and compassion that are irresistible. Each chapter revolves around a key figure in the Hemings drama, and the resulting portraits are engrossing and very personal. Gordon-Reed also brings a keen intuitive sense of the psychological complexities of human relationships relationships that, in the real world, often develop regardless of status or race. The most compelling element of all, however, is her extensive and careful research, which often allows the evidence to speak for itself. Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy is the definitive look at a centuries-old question that should fascinate general readers and historians alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hk86gGtn8sUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wildflowers Of Wisconsin","description":"Describing more than 1,100 species, this is a comprehensive guide to wildflowers in Wisconsin and parts of Minnesota, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Ontario.

Transcending disciplinary boundaries, contributions to this volume focus on the political significance of recent advances in the biological sciences and explore the possibility of public participation in scientific discourse, drawing on research and practice in art, biology, critical theory, anthropology, and cultural studies. After framing the subject in terms of both biology and art, Tactical Biopolitics discusses such topics as race and genetics (with contributions from leading biologists Richard Lewontin and Richard Levins); feminist bioscience; the politics of scientific expertise; bioart and the public sphere (with an essay by artist Claire Pentecost); activism and public health (with an essay by Treatment Action Group co-founder Mark Harrington); biosecurity after 9/11 (with essays by artists' collective Critical Art Ensemble and anthropologist Paul Rabinow); and human-animal interaction (with a framing essay by cultural theorist Donna Haraway).

Although aikido is often thought of as a nonviolent, noncompetitive martial art, the use of weapons was introduced by the art's founder O'Sensei Morihei Ueshiba. In fact, aikido techniques that use wooden weapons can enrich all aspects of your practice, helping you to understand both basic and advanced aikido technical tactics as well as conceptual strategies and skills. Building on the authors' belief that no empty-hand system is complete without weapons training, Aikido Weapons Techniques: The Wooden Sword, Stick, and Knife of Aikido demonstrates weapon use both as a training tool to better illustrate aikido principles, and as a self-defense against weapon attacks, focusing on the three primary weapons used in aikido: Ken the wooden sword Jo the wooden staff Tanto the wooden knife A complete discussion of each weapon is included, with descriptions of the stances, grips, techniques, forms, defenses, and training appropriate for each. With over 200 step-by-step photographs and detailed instructions, this aikido book provides an in-depth exploration of weapons use in aikido from its spiritual implications to technical theory and practical use.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DgbQAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"After the Kiss","description":"Lauren Layne kicks off her Sex, Love & Stiletto series with a delightful short novel!

A myriad of forces shape and fashion human action, reaction, thought, and feeling, and these are not always well understood. Norman L. Farberow argues that culture itself provides structure for its members, developing in a well-defined way the rules to which they will conform. Such rules find expression not only in written laws and regulations but include, and most often stem from, unwritten folkways, customs, and especially taboos, the subject of this book. The researchers reporting in this volume take no position on the nature of a taboo itself, but concentrate on the difficulty in investigating taboos. As members of society and human beings, they do make judgments and personal investments. Thus, when taboos continue or develop without useful society-enriching functions or facilitate self-destructive activities, they raise questions about why they persist. Such topics include many areasa??some social, such as sex, death, and peace; others more academic, such as parapsychology, graphology, religion, and hypnosis. Peace and the public are included in the discussion because they are emotion-laden areas and powerful and important factors in a shrinking world and expanding universe. Peace, especially, has begun to be looked upon with suspiciona??perhaps a real commentary on our times. This probing collection will be sure to interest sociologists, anthropologists, and all other social scientists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A-_-AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Music of Jesus: From Composition to Koinonia","description":"This book examines four large questions: Do we need a theology of music? (And if so, why?) What is the place of art music ('classical' music) in a postmodern world? What are the characteristics of 'the music of Jesus'? How can this music be manifested in the Christian community? Each question is addressed on the basis of building a consistent Biblical worldview which includes adequate respect for the powerful force of music. Although the book focuses on the role of composers, its aim is to encourage serious musical examination, support, and action from within the entire evangelical Christian community, with an eye to affecting the culture at large. The author asserts that in the area of music the Church has become a cultural follower rather than a leader, adopting the dangerous postmodern tendency to define musical choices as matters of mere personal preference rather than seeking to define them on the basis of what God has revealed in the Word, by the Son, and through the Spirit. Specific suggestions are made by which the contemporary Christian community may resist such a tendency, even while building a dynamic, new, Christ-centered musical practice which can flourish in our postmodern world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J1oZHx0ENnkC&dq=The+Music+of+Jesus:+From+Composition+to+Koinonia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Louis L'Amour: Four Card Draw, Keep Travelin' Rider, Dutchmans Flat, His Brothers Debt","description":"Collection Includes: Lit a Shuck for Texas, Mistakes Can Kill You, Dutchman's Flat, Big Medicine, Keep Travelin' Rider, Dead Man's Trail, Four Card Draw, Law of the Desert Born, His Brother's Debt, Trap of Gold, Desert Death Son, & I Hate To Tell His Widow.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rRkzcgAACAAJ&dq=Louis+L%27Amour:+Four+Card+Draw,+Keep+Travelin%27+Rider,+Dutchmans+Flat,+His+Brothers+Debt&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nothing Like It in the World - The Men Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad 1863 - 1869","description":"Chronicles the race to finish the transcontinental railroad in the 1860s and the exploits, sacrifices, triumphs, and tragedies of the individuals who made it happen.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TZp_GT7PscIC&dq=Nothing+Like+It+in+the+World+-+The+Men+Who+Built+the+Transcontinental+Railroad+1863+-+1869&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The emigrants' guide to Oregon and California (The American scene)","description":"Originally published 1845, this is one of the most collectible books about California and the Westward movement.

The opportunity to tour Israel came at a good time. For months, my life has been a mindless plodding through necessary routine, as monotonous as an all-night shift on an assembly line. Life gets that way sometimes, when nothing specific is wrong but the world around us seems drained of color. Even my weekly worship experiences and daily quiet times with God have felt as dry and stale as last year's crackers. I'm ashamed to confess the malaise I've felt. I have been given so much.

At the centre of this myth is the story of the chalice containing the Holy Blood of Christ, shed when Longinus pierced his side at the crucifixion. The search for the Grail has inspired artists and mystics for hundreds of years. Many churches and cathedrals were built on sites that claimed their part in this sacred mystery. IMBUED WITH THE SPIRIT OF the ancient quest and aware of its power as an antidote to our modern spiritual malaise, Ean and Deike Begg travelled throughout Europe, researching sites of the Holy Grail, the Precious Blood and their associated myths. This book is an illustrated account of their search and a practical, informative guidebook for travellers and seekers. It is full of fascinating information, such as the name of the Spanish cathedral that holds the cup of the Last Supper, the story of how a fig tree carried the Precious Blood to France and the secrets of the Grail castles of Germany. 'I believe that Ean and Deike Begg have done something of great importance in exploring the myth of the Holy Grail that played such a vital part in the deeps of Jung's spirit, and in re-establishing how now it is still one of the most dynamic elements in the search of the lost and bewildered modern soul for wholeness.'-Sir Laurens van der Post 'Deike and Ean Begg have revitalized the idea of pilgrimage.'-Michael Baigent 'An exemplary and vividly written guide to the many strange and beautiful sites associated with the Grail quest throughout Europe.'-Count Nikolai Tolstoy","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K__8UkhGioAC&dq=In+Search+of+The+Holy+Grail+And+The+Precious+Blood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great War, 1914-1918","description":"The course of events of the Great War has been told many times, spurred by an endless desire to understand 'the war to end all wars'. However, this book moves beyond military narrative to offer a much fuller analysis of of the conflict's strategic, political, economic, social and cultural impact. Starting with the context and origins of the war, including assasination, misunderstanding and differing national war aims, it then covers the treacherous course of the conflict and its social consequences for both soldiers and civilians, for science and technology, for national politics and for pan-European revolution. The war left a long-term legacy for victors and vanquished alike. It created new frontiers, changed the balance of power and influenced the arts, national memory and political thought. The reach of this acount is global, showing how a conflict among European powers came to involve their colonial empires, and embraced Japan, China, the Ottoman Empire, Latin America and the United States.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t6SsAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Basic Sailing Skills","description":"Basic Sailing Skills is a perfect manual to help anyone starting out in learning to sail. The original Basic Sailing Skills was written in 1974 by Don Giffin, an active instructor, Albacore racing competitor and dedicated volunteer. Over the next seventeen years it was used extensively by over 30,000 sailors as they were introduced to the jargon and theory of sailing. In 1990 the Learn to Sail Committee of the Canadian Yachting Association decided to have Basic Sailing Skills rewritten to reflect changes which had taken place with national sail training standards over time. Sven Donaldson, a Vancouver based sailing writer, was commissioned by the Canadian Yachting Association to write this next version of Basic Sailing Skills. Sven has two other sailing books to his credit (A Sailors Guide to Sails and the New Sail Theory) as well as many articles in Pacific Yachting Magazine, Sail, and Cruising World. In Basic Sailing Skills, Sven has simplified terminology so the reader gets a hands on appreciation of the enjoyment of sailing. Cedric Burgers, formerly a CYA senior sailing instructor and University of British Columbia architecture student from Vancouver drew the illustrations. The illustrations provide a level of detail rarely shown in other sailing instructional books.

I loved every page and laughed my socks off at some bits.\\" ~ The Word Is Out Now \\"The writing is addicting. I had trouble putting this one down and it was easy to be hooked.\\" - Jessica Belmont Book Description: Two communities. One flower competition. So much dead-heading! Aldermaston s having a bad day. A falling hanging-basket has killed the town s mayor, and a second narrowly missed him. His wife wants him to build her new greenhouse in three days, and someone is sending him death threats. This isn t the quiet life he expected as the new Marquess of Mortiforde. It s the annual Borders in Blossom competition, and Mortiforde is battling with Portley Ridge in the final. But this is no parochial flower competition. The mayor s mishap looks like murder, and there s another body in the river. Someone desperately wants Portley Ridge to win for the fifteenth successive year. So when a mysterious group of guerrilla gardeners suddenly carpet bomb Mortiforde with a series of stunning floral delights one night, a chain reaction of floral retaliation ensues. Can Aldermaston survive long enough to uncover who is trying to kill him, and why? And can he get his wife s greenhouse built in time? Blooming Murder is the first book in the Marquess of Mortiforde Mystery series. If you love the eccentricity of MC Beaton s Agatha Raisin and Hamish Macbeth books, and the humour of ITV's Midsomer Murder television series, you ll love this first instalment of the Marquess of Mortiforde mysteries.  I loved this book and laughed such a lot at the going-ons in the village. A brilliant tale of jealousy, revenge and green-fingered criminality.

Every company wants to grow, and the most proven way is through innovation. The conventional wisdom is that only disruptive, nimble startups can innovate; once a business gets bigger and more complex corporate arteriosclerosis sets in. Gary Pisano's remarkable research conducted over three decades, and his extraordinary on-the ground experience with big companies and fast-growing ones that have moved beyond the start-up stage, provides new thinking about how the scale of bigger companies can be leveraged for advantage in innovation. He begins with the simply reality that bigger companies are, well, different. Demanding that they \\"be like Uber\\" is no more realistic than commanding your dog to speak French. Bigger companies are complex. They need to sustain revenue streams from existing businesses, and deal with Wall Street's demands. These organizations require a different set of management practices and approaches--a discipline focused on the strategies, systems and culture for taking their companies to the next level. Big can be beautiful, but it requires creative construction by leaders to avoid the creative destruction that is all-too-often the fate of too many.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ioRaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Light Emerging: The Journey of Personal Healing","description":"Barbara Ann Brennan continues her ground-breaking exploration of the human energy field, or aura the source of our experience of health or illness.

It also offers an intimate portrait of a creative artist: his compulsive self-presentation and self-reproach, his moral and artistic dilemmas, his dedication and his accomplishments. John Berryman occupies a central place among the outstanding poets of recent times. The course of his life ran between the extremes of personal degradation and artistic ecstasy. He suffered the early suicide of his father, the dominance of his mother, poverty and professional setbacks, psychiatric treatment, alcoholism, and sexual and spiritual vexation.

The years brought him spells of deep personal joy and artistic fulfilment, but all too heavy a hand of terrible suffering.

He noticed that it was the men who comforted others and who gave away their last piece of bread who survived the longest - and who offered proof that everything can be taken away from us except the ability to choose our attitude in any given set of circumstances. The sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision and not of camp influences alone. Only those who allowed their inner hold on their moral and spiritual selves to subside eventually fell victim to the camp's degenerating influence - while those who made a victory of those experiences turned them into an inner triumph.

There is no such thing as brute factuality, but rather only interpreted factuality. The historian's report is always the report of a perspective, a context, a framework; man is not, like God, beyond time and circumstance, condition and place. Man is neither a prime mover nor a prime viewer, but, to deny to man the status of a first cause and a first view is by no means to deny the validity or function of secondary causes and secondary viewers. The writing of history is always in terms of a framework, a philosophical and ultimately religious conceptual structure in the mind of the historian. To the orthodox Christian, the shabby incarnations of the reigning historiographies are both absurd and offensive. They are idols, and he is forbidden to bow down to them and must indeed wage war against them. A Christian historiography and a Christian revisionism are thus for him moral imperatives. For Christian revisionism, there is thus an incarnation that stands as the central point in history, Jesus Christ, and, this incarnation was without confusion of the eternal and the temporal, the divine and the human. This requires a denial of any coming, continuing, or possible incarnation in any historical order or institution. The divinization of church, state, school, or any other institution, or its absorption into the incarnation, is thus a sign of paganism. These essays are studies in Christian revisionism. There purpose is to call attention those aspects of American history currently neglected. Originally published in 1965, these essays were a continuation of the author's previous work, This Independent Republic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V6dfDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living Inspired","description":"Shows how an understanding of some of the deeper ideas and patterns of Torah thought can illuminate our everyday experiences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lFk8TeSgkR8C&dq=Living+Inspired&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Naked Among Cannibals: What Really Happens Inside Australian Banks","description":"Australia's banks have gone from being revered to reviled in a relatively short space of time.

Dallemagne-Cookson tells what sounds like a very tall story about crocodile hunting with convincing relish. She had not been long at her new job when she accepted the challenge to take a plunge into the jungle to track down the formidable 175-year-old crocodile El Diablo. The sassy young New Yorker takes him on and lives to tell the tale. The cover photograph shows her with a gun in one hand, and her foot on El Diablo's scaly back. \\"Not for her the local zoo. \\"'A zoo? Here?' I was incredulous. \\"The whole place is a zoo. The entire country.'\\" But her guide explains that \\"most of the Belgians living in Leopoldville never get out into the countryside. They're too scared.\\" So by going to the zoo they can get to see at least a gorilla or two, a lion and a few monkeys before they leave for home.\\" (Xlibris, 26.70 Euro. Waterstone's Brussels) The Red-Eye Fever is about crocodile hunting in the former Belgian Congo the author's first African adventure. Fresh from New York, she begins by slaying El Diablo, a famous 175-year-old, eighteen-foot crocodile that had been preying on the people for many years and was known to have consumed at least fifty inhabitants during its reign of terror. This adventure was followed by many others in the company of several extraordinary people she met at the time the Congo was preparing to take its place in African history as the first country, south of the Sahara, to gain independence from its colonial rulers.

Erikson's insight into the nature of the interrelationships of the psychogenic development of an individual and the historical development of the times. This insight, present in all his work beginning with Childhood and Society, and particularly examined in Young Man Luther and Gandhi's Truth, finds full and mature expression in the present book. Just as Erikson's notion of the identity crisis has been obscured and confused as it has passed into everyday speech, so too have glib popularizers misused his notions of psychobiography and psychohistory. Thus, this book is of supreme importance, not merely to set the record straight, but more especially to make these vital ideas, central to our time, fully available. \\"To deal with life history and history psychoanalytically,\\" Erikson points out, \\"means to engage in a kind of circular chronology: our inquiry always points to selected periods in the past which, in throwing new light on the present, suggest new forays into the more distant past.\\" Consequently, this book opens with autobiography; ranges through discussions of Freud and Gandhi and of the meaning of ideas on womanhood; and concludes with an examination of the role of psychoanalysis in the evolution of ethics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YWI4AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Force and Touch Feedback for Virtual Reality","description":"A comprehensive treatment of force feedback the hottest area of research in virtual reality Can interactivity in virtual reality (VR) extend to include our sense of touch?

Aswirl with waking dreams and phantom memories, The Late Parade is a triumph of poetic imagination. To write about one thing, you must first write about another. In Adam Fitzgerald's debut collection, readers discover forty-eight poems that yoke together tones playful and elegiac, nostalgic and absurd. Fitzgerald's shape-shifting inspirations \\"beckon us to join an urban promenade\\" (McLane) with a multiplicity of chimerical stops: from the unreal cities of Dubai to the former Soviet Union, from Nigerian spammers and the Virgin Mary to Dr. Johnson and Cat Power. \\"The glory of this volume is the long title poem, which carries the primal vision of Hart Crane into a future that does not surrender the young poet s love of the real,\\" writes Harold Bloom. Mash-ups of litanies, monologues and odes, these poems spring from a modernist landscape filled with madcap slips of tongue, innuendo, archaisms and everyday slang. Though Fitzgerald's lines often hallucinate meanings that feel open-ended, they never ignore the traditional pleasures of poetic craft and memory, their music an ambient drone part Technicolor, part nitrous oxide. Even so, what glues these fantasies together is more than the charm of the maddeningly chameleon rhetoric. Fitzgerald's sonorous voice is unabashedly that of a love poet's: melancholic, baroque and visionary. The Late Parade is a testament to the powers of confusion, which may disguise our sense of loss but offer in return that eloquent tonic known as poetry. As Richard Howard writes, \\"When the new poet turns up the heat, he gives us just the necessary outrages which make us understand what we never knew we could say.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h45YFOmZjPwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classic Ships","description":"Drawing upon Arabic literary sources, iconographic evidence and archaeological finds, this book examines trade, port towns, ship construction, seamanship, ship typology and their historical development in the Western Indian Ocean, focussing on the Medieval Islamic period but including earlier sources.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bMewCQAAQBAJ&dq=Classic+Ships&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poetics of music in the form of six lessons","description":"One of the greatest of contemporary composers has here set down in delightfully personal fashion his general ideas about music and some accounts of his own experience as a composer.

Then savage Roman soldiers swept across Europe, killing and enslaving. The Celts did not succumb without a fight. Their Old Ways survived centuries of ruthless domain until another menace loomed: a tortured god worshiped in cold stone buildings. The sacred shores of Avalon began to drift away, the mists threatened to hide the island from mortal eyes forever. Against the bleak backdrop of war, the gorgeous Scottish Highlands stood tall, sheltering its inhabitants from greedy invaders. Yet the reach of the eagle banners was long and the highlanders turned to the Goddess for protection. However, the sacred groves felt silent and grim as Avalon faded away. Once sad, pealing bells began to sound strangely comforting while the high walls of monasteries offered an alluring barrier from violence. Caught in the middle of this centuries-old war, a young High Priestess might be Avalon's last chance. Wise beyond her years and powerful like no other Priestess in her lifetime, Rowen had served the Goddess faithfully, forsaking her family and the company of her soulmate. When the Lady of the Lake asks for another sacrifice, it might be one too many for her scarred heart. How could she obey the Goddess without betraying Caddaric? Could she trust Eochaid, who embodied everything she despised and hated? Would she be able to fulfill her duties without losing her soul? Caddaric had been Rowen's companion in countless lives; but, now, they existed in different realms. Beautiful Rowen lived in the mortal world while sweet Caddaric remained in the sacred isle of Avalon, watching over her. Could he step aside to allow another man - a flesh and blood man - to become her protector? Eochaid had sworn to protect the Old Ways. The rude warrior never quite understood his faith yet his loyal heart belonged to the Goddess. A gorgeous, fiery High Priestess was not in his plans. He would risk his life to protect Rowen; but, would the Goddess safeguard his heart? Could he defend the bewitching maiden from himself? When stakes were so high that a simple mistake could cost their very world, a priestess, a Druid, and a warrior must learn to trust one another and the mysterious ways of the Goddess. Their success would save Avalon. Their failure would tear the island from the human realm forever, condemning it to oblivion. Failure was not an option. This is a standalone, historical/paranormal romance. Its mature themes - sexual violence, religion, and pagan rituals - might not be appropriate for audiences under 18.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ywZAMQAACAAJ&dq=THE+CELTS:+Peoples+of+the+Past+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SPARTAN PLANET.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zjeNwwEACAAJ&dq=SPARTAN+PLANET.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"They Go to Sea: The Story of an American Merchant Ship and the Battle of the Atlantic in Wwii","description":"A novel that brings to life the courage of our American merchant seamen and Naval Armed Guard gun crews on convoy duty to England.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6yrHkTdNlWcC&dq=They+Go+to+Sea:+The+Story+of+an+American+Merchant+Ship+and+the+Battle+of+the+Atlantic+in+Wwii&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Classroom At The End Of The Hall","description":"Strange things are happening in the classroom at the end of the hall, like a chalk dust genie that appears while the erasers are being cleaned, and the new art teacher who resembles a stick figure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3HdaAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Classroom+At+The+End+Of+The+Hall&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alcoholism Myths and Realities: Removing the Stigma of Society's Most Destructive Disease","description":"More than 100 widespread myths about drug and alcohol abuse are enumerated and then dispelled in this book about the reality of addiction.

A broad overview, it deals with the various types of abuse, the various effects of abuse, and the means of healing. Abuse can be sexual, physical, neglect, spiritual, and verbal. The chief arguments pursued throughout the book are: (1) abuse is far more rampant than most Christians realize, but due to human depravity and satanic influence, widespread abuse is predicable. (2) All types of abuse create profound, long-term soul damage due to the way abuse perverts various aspects of the image of God. (3) God is the healing redeemer. Human salvation came through horrible physical abuse. (4) Healing must take place in the context of relationships. Humans are deeply impacted by others due to being made in the image of God. Just as surely as abusive relationships have tremendous power to wound the soul, so healthy relationships have tremendous power to nurture and heal the soul. Questions answered in the book include: - How can a genuine believer abuse a child? - Why would someone abuse a child? - How can parents and childrens  workers identify abusers? - How can abuse victims heal? - What does genuine healing look like? - Is anger appropriate or hurtful for abuse victims? - Where does forgiveness fit in? Helpful sample child protection policy, application, screening interview, and warning signs of potential abusers equip ministry leaders. Illustrations, case studies, and art therapy drawings.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lLK4-8cfApcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ready to Lead?

Courage is not the absence of fear, says Osho. It is, rather, the total presence of fear, with the courage to face it. This book provides a bird s-eye view of the whole terrain where fears originate, how to understand them, and how to call on your inner strength to confront them. In the process, Osho proposes that whenever we are faced with uncertainty and change in our lives, it is actually a cause for celebration. Instead of trying to hang on to the familiar and the known, we can learn to enjoy these situations as opportunities for adventure and for deepening our understanding of ourselves and the world around us. Having courage is more than just heroic acts in exceptional circumstances. It s a necessity to lead authentic and fulfilling lives on a day-to-day basis. This is the courage to change when change is needed, the courage to stand up for our own truth, even against the opinions of others, and the courage to embrace the unknown in spite of our fears in our relationships, in our careers, or in the ongoing journey of understanding who we are and why we are here. Courage also features meditation techniques specifically designed by Osho to help people cope with their fears. Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the Sunday Times of London as one of the  1000 Makers of the 20th Century  and by Sunday Mid-Day (India) as one of the ten people along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Wt-tvDQ2HS0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sakura Wars 2: Original Sound Track (Sheet Music)","description":"To what extent can music be employed to shape one culture's understanding of another? In the American imagination, Japan has represented the \\"most alien\\" nation for over 150 years. This perceived difference has inspired fantasies--of both desire and repulsion--through which Japanese culture has profoundly impacted the arts and industry of the U.S. While the influence of Japan on American and European painting, architecture, design, theater, and literature has been celebrated in numerous books and exhibitions, the role of music has been virtually ignored until now. W. Anthony Sheppard's Extreme Exoticism offers a detailed documentation and wide-ranging investigation of music's role in shaping American perceptions of the Japanese, the influence of Japanese music on American composers, and the place of Japanese Americans in American musical life. Presenting numerous American encounters with and representations of Japanese music and Japan, this book reveals how music functions in exotic representation across a variety of genres and media, and how Japanese music has at various times served as a sign of modernist experimentation, a sounding board for defining American music, and a tool for reshaping conceptions of race and gender. From the Tin Pan Alley songs of the Russo-Japanese war period to Weezer's Pinkerton album, music has continued to inscribe Japan as the land of extreme exoticism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t5KwDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dad- This Joke's For You: The Best Dad Jokes from the Funniest Comedians","description":"Jokes and humorous stories relating to dads","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U-dy_FWk2ngC&dq=Dad-+This+Joke%27s+For+You:+The+Best+Dad+Jokes+from+the+Funniest+Comedians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foundations of Christian faith: An introduction to the idea of Christianity","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jkgiuAEACAAJ&dq=Foundations+of+Christian+faith:+An+introduction+to+the+idea+of+Christianity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Un Mundo Sin Miedo / a World Without Fear (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IqfEtAEACAAJ&dq=Un+Mundo+Sin+Miedo+/+a+World+Without+Fear+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guide to Cults and New Religions","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Compromising Traditions: The Personal Voice in Classical Scholarship","description":"First published in 1996.

Maligned and misunderstood, the nation has long been blamed by many for its own wretchedness. But as acclaimed historian Laurent Dubois makes clear, Haiti's troubled present can only be understood by examining its complex past. The country's difficulties are inextricably rooted in its founding revolution the only successful slave revolt in the history of the world; the hostility that this rebellion generated among the colonial powers surrounding the island nation; and the intense struggle within Haiti itself to define its newfound freedom and realize its promise. Dubois vividly depicts the isolation and impoverishment that followed the 1804 uprising. He details how the crushing indemnity imposed by the former French rulers initiated a devastating cycle of debt, while frequent interventions by the United States including a twenty-year military occupation further undermined Haiti's independence. At the same time, Dubois shows, the internal debates about what Haiti should do with its hard-won liberty alienated the nation's leaders from the broader population, setting the stage for enduring political conflict. Yet as Dubois demonstrates, the Haitian people have never given up on their struggle for true democracy, creating a powerful culture insistent on autonomy and equality for all. Revealing what lies behind the familiar moniker of \\"the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere,\\" this indispensable book illuminates the foundations on which a new Haiti might yet emerge.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=drU3HlesN5kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The art teaching of John Ruskin,","description":"An understanding of John Ruskin's aesthetic theories is important in providing the influences to the discussion of photography as art and the idea of the appropriate purpose of photographic education.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WAw4AAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oxford Companion to Politics of the World (Oxford Companions Ncs)","description":"A COMPANION TO THE HISTORY OF THE BOOK A COMPANION TO THE HISTORY OF THE BOOK Edited by Simon Eliot and Jonathan Rose  As a stimulating overview of the multidimensional present state of the field, the Companion has no peer.

Dr. David Heber's groundbreaking book What Color Is Your Diet? introduced us to the Color Codebuilding a healthy diet based on colorful fruits and vegetables. His new book, The LA Shape Diet, combines the sound nutritional basis of the Color Code with his newest research from the UCLA Center for Nutrition, which shows you how to analyse your body shape, personal protein needs, and metabolism and not only lose weightbut also change your body shape. This has major appeal to the millions of Americans who may be able to lose weight but are still dissatisfied with the look of their bodiesand end up gaining the weight back anyway. Dr. Heber maintains that everyone is born with a particular shape and that this shape makes a huge difference in how you should approach weight loss. Dr. Heber teaches the difference between the shape you can change and the shape you cannot, and how to do this with the right amount of dietary protein. Based on over 3500 measurements made by his researchers at UCLA, Dr. Heber has come up with tables that estimate how much protein you need in your diet at a given height and weight, and how many calories you should consume every day. Then Dr. Heber helps you build your own ideal diet, starting with protein, then 7 colorful servings of fruits and vegetables (providing 25 grams of filling fiber), and finally whole grains. Dr. Heber explains not only glycemic index (how fast blood sugar goes up) but glycemic load (glycemic index + how much carbohydrate a food provides), which determines how a particular food affects the overall diet. He groups foods into four tables to make it easy for readers to navigate their dinner table. In a world of dietary fads and \\"one size fits all\\" pseudomiracle diets, The LA Shape Diet is the most effective, easytofollow, scientifically sound dietary plan you'll find.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OKJRpu1azgoC&dq=La+Dieta+L.A.+Shape:+El+plan+para+controlar+su+peso+en+tan+solo+14+dias+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To The Lighthouse, A Harvest Book","description":"An English family's complex lives are followed and picked up again after a ten year hiatus in order to explore the effects of time","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ng0Tg0FhRggC&dq=To+The+Lighthouse,+A+Harvest+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jkd Conversations","description":"The Author of this title has read every single book on Bruce Lee and JKD that he could get his hands on.

There is little in these verses to suggest the settings, the characterizations, the unforeseen twists and turns of Mr. Sendak's fantastical picture-stories. They extend the boundaries of the short rhymes and add surprising dimension. The many admirers of Where the Wild Things Are and The Nutshell Library will recognize in Hector Protector and the seafarer of As I Went Over the Water the same pugnaciousness, love of mischief, and derring-do that characterize Max and Pierre. And they will agree that Mr. Sendak has created a true picture book of astounding originality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OFrWnQEACAAJ&dq=HECTOR+PROTECTOR+AND+AS+I+WENT+OVER+THE+WATER&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Web Usability and Navigation: A Beginner's Guide","description":"This is a comprehensive introduction to the theories and principles that drive Web usability and interface design.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AW1wQgAACAAJ&dq=Web+Usability+and+Navigation:+A+Beginner%27s+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"European Union Law in a Nutshell (Nutshell Series)","description":"It covers the history and growth of the European Union, its legislative procedures, and case law of the European Court of Justice.

Bush has launched a revolution in American foreign policy. He has redefined how America engages the world, shedding the constraints that friends, allies, and international institutions impose on its freedom of action. He has insisted that an America unbound is a more secure America. How did a man once mocked for knowing little about the world come to be a foreign policy revolutionary? In America Unbound, Ivo H. Daalder and James M. Lindsay dismiss claims that neoconservatives have captured the heart and mind of the president. They show that George W. Bush has been no one's puppet. He has been a strong and decisive leader with a coherent worldview that was evident even during the 2000 presidential campaign. Daalder and Lindsay caution that the Bush revolution comes with significant risks. Raw power alone is not enough to preserve and extend America's security and prosperity in the modern world. The United States often needs the help of others to meet the challenges it faces overseas. But Bush's revolutionary impulse has stirred great resentment abroad. At some point, Daalder and Lindsay warn, Bush could find that America's friends and allies refuse to follow his lead. America will then stand alone a great power unable to achieve its most important goals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g3hBKBRovXQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants: The Official Scrapbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t2AJRQAACAAJ&dq=The+Sisterhood+of+the+Traveling+Pants:+The+Official+Scrapbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Archko Volume: or, the Archeological Writings of the Sanhedrim and Talmuds of the Jews","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OHcNAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simple Truths: The Real Story of the Oklahoma City Bombing Investigation (Oklahoma Horizons)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Audubon: Life and Art in the American Wilderness","description":"A profile of the Haitian-born French artist recounts Audubon's arrival in New York, his expeditions into the American wilderness, and his portraits of native American birds and animals. 20,000 first printing. $20,000 ad/promo.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HCMgAQAAIAAJ&dq=Audubon:+Life+and+Art+in+the+American+Wilderness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real Estate Business and Investment Opportunities: The Complete Guide to Starting a High-Profit Business","description":"This book review and explains over 40 unique, home-based real estate investment and real estate business opportunities.

The distance of East and West Ship Island, Horn Island, Cat Island, and Petit Bois Island from the mainland has sheltered them from extensive development. The inclusion of all in the roster of protected places in the Gulf Islands National Seashore Act has assured that they will remain close to their natural state long into the future. For those who love the seashore, the Mississippi Gulf Coast is an ideal place for adventure. The wilderness islands, the back bays and coastal rivers, and the Gulf of Mexico itself offer pleasure for boaters and nature lovers. This book will guide them to special places in these relatively shallow waters. Filled with detailed descriptions of many alluring settings, along with directions for navigation to secluded coves and coastal bayous, this book gives tips and pointers for a wide range of boaters, whether their preferred craft is a canoe, a sea kayak, or a luxury yacht. What are the best and safest routes? What are the weather patterns? How does one select the perfect craft? Here from an expert who has explored the coastal waters during a period of fifteen years are the answers, rich in anecdotes, along with information on charter boats, excursion boats, and other options for exploring and fishing. Scott B. Williams has been exploring Mississippi's marine waters and islands for more than fifteen years in sea kayaks and a variety of sailboats and has published numerous articles in Sea Kayaker. Williams builds wooden boats and does custom yacht and residential woodwork, dividing his time between Biloxi and Brandon, Mississippi.

A newly discovered masterpiece.   Alex Kershaw, New York Times bestselling author of Avenue of Spies Previously unpublished, this German postwar classic is one of the best books of this major writer, who died in 2014. The last summer before the end of World War II, Walter Proska is posted to a small unit tasked with ensuring the safety of a railway line deep in the forest on the border with Ukraine and Byelorussia. In this swampy region, a handful of men stunned by the heat, attacked by mosquitoes, and abandoned by their own troops in the face of the resistance must also submit to the increasingly absurd and inhuman orders of their superior. Time passes, and the soldiers isolate themselves, haunted by madness and the desire for death. An encounter with a young Polish partisan, Wanda, makes Proska further doubt the validity of his oath of allegiance, and he seeks to answer the questions that obsess him: When conscience and duty clash, which is more important? Is it possible to take any action without becoming guilty in some way? And where is Wanda, this woman from the resistance he can t forget? Written in 1951, The Turncoat is Siegfried Lenz s second novel. Rejected by his publisher, who thought that the story of a German soldier defecting to the Soviet side would be unwelcome in the context of the Cold War, the manuscript was forgotten for nearly seventy years before being rediscovered after the author s death.

Our heroine Lady Anna is the daughter of the old Earl Lovel and her incredibly ambitious mother, Josephine Murray. A union without love, shortly after the wedding the Earl revealed that he already had a wife, making the marriage invalid and casting doubt over Anna s inheritance and future. When the Earl dies, the legitimacy of his claims are investigated and what follows is a tale of broken engagements, insatiable ambition and true love. Anthony Trollope (1815  1882) was a Victorian writer and author of 47 novels. He also wrote an autobiography, short stories and plays, travel articles, reviews and lectures. A prolific writer, he made no secret of the fact that money was his motivation for writing  an admission which raised eyebrows among his literary contemporaries at the time. The amount of works Trollope authored are testament to his belief in hard work. His first successful novel was The Warden followed by its sequel, Barchester Towers. The Chronicles of Barsetshire are perhaps his most well-known series of novels, though many of his works have been adapted for TV and radio, starring many familiar faces such as Alan Rickman, David Tennant, Bill Nighy and Tom Hollander. Alongside his literary career, Trollope also worked for some time for the Post Office and is credited with the introduction of the iconic post box to Britain.

On the occasion of the Centennial of the University of Chicago and its Press, we take pleasure in reissuing this complete work in a handsome four-volume slipcased edition as well as in redesigned versions of the familiar paperbacks. For the Centennial Edition two of the original translations have been replaced. In the original publication David Grene translated only one of the three Theban plays, Oedipus the King. Now he has added his own translations of the remaining two, Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone, thus bringing a new unity of tone and style to this group. Grene has also revised his earlier translation of Prometheus Bound and rendered some of the former prose sections in verse. These new translations replace the originals included in the paperback volumes Sophocles I (which contains all three Theban plays), Aeschylus II, Greek Tragedies, Volume I, and Greek Tragedies, Volume III, all of which are now being published in second editions. All other volumes contain the translations of the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides for the most part from the original versions first published in the 1940s and 1950s. These translations have been the choice of generations of teachers and students, selling in the past forty years over three million copies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QeAgAQAAIAAJ&dq=A+History+of+the+Art+of+War+in+the+Middle+Ages:+Volume+One:+378-1278+AD+(Greenhill+Military+Paperbacks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American Heritage Thesaurus, First Edition","description":"Presents synonyms and antonyms for thousands of slang and regional words along with the more stable lexicon of English words, all in an A-to-Z format.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hhubzgEACAAJ&dq=The+American+Heritage+Thesaurus,+First+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"National Lampoon Presents True Facts: the Book","description":"Now, for the first time, fans of National Lampoon's popular True Facts books can enjoy the complete True Facts collection in one hilarious edition.

The work is an epic sea story of Captain Ahab's voyage in pursuit of Moby Dick, a great white whale. A contemporary commercial failure and out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891, its reputation rose during the twentieth century. D.H. Lawrence called it \\"the greatest book of the sea ever written.\\" Jorge Luis Borges praised the style: \\"Unforgettable phrases abound.\\" Today it is considered one of the Great American Novels and a leading work of American Romanticism. The opening line, \\"Call me Ishmael,\\" is one of the most recognizable opening lines in Western literature. Ishmael then narrates the voyage of the whaleship Pequod, commanded by Captain Ahab. Ahab has one purpose: revenge on Moby Dick, a ferocious, enigmatic white whale which on a previous voyage destroyed Ahab's ship and severed his leg at the knee. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and the process of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. Melville uses a wide range of styles and literary devices ranging from lists and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies, and asides.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9lNoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rock Lyrics: 50'S, 60'S, 70's Trivia Quiz Book (Rock Lyrics Trivia Quizbooks)","description":"Party Rock and Roll lyrics quiz book. 250 Rock Lyrics Questions and 250 Rock Titles Questions.

In the border town of El Paso?better known to its Mexican American residents as El Chuco?dramas unfold in humdrum households every day as working-class men come home from their jobs and as their wives and children do their best to cope with life. Christine Granados now plumbs the heart of this community in fourteen startling stories, uncovering the dreams and secrets in which ordinary people sometimes lose themselves. Many fictional accounts of barrio life play up tradition and nostalgia; Brides and Sinners in El Chuco is a trip to the darker side. Here are memories of growing up in a place where innocence is always tempered by reality?true-to-life stories, told in authentic language, of young women, from preteens to twenty-somethings, learning to negotiate their way through troubled times and troubled families. In the award-winning story  The Bride,  a young girl recalls her sister as a perennial bride on Halloween, planning for her eventual big day in a pink notebook with lists of potential husbands, only to see her dream thwarted at the junior prom. In another, we meet Bobbi, the class slut, whose D-cup chest astounds the other girls and entices everyone?even those who shouldn?t be tempted. Granados? tales boldly portray women?s struggle for solidarity in the face of male abuse, and as these characters come to grips with self-discovery, sibling rivalry, and dysfunctional relationships, she shows what it means for Chicanas to grow up in protective families while learning to survive in the steamy border environment. Brides and Sinners in El Chuco is an uncompromising look at life with all its hard edges?told with enough softness to make readers come back for more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MxAJp4XYJOkC&dq=Brides+and+Sinners+in+El+Chuco+(Camino+del+Sol)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Go, Team, Go!

What promises, what trends does its future hold? Through the reflections of 70 of the world's leading statistical methodologists, researchers, theorists, and practitioners, Statistics in the 21st Century answers those questions. Originally published in the Journal of the American Statistical Association, this collection of vignettes examines our statistical past, comments on our present, and speculates on our future. Although the coverage is broad and the topics diverse, it reveals the essential intellectual unity of the field as we see the same themes recurring in different contexts. We see how the development of statistics has been driven by the unprecedented and still growing range of applications, by the explosion in computer technology, and by the new types of data that continue to emerge and advance the discipline. Organized around major areas of application and leading up to vignettes on theory and methods, Statistics in the 21st Century forms a landmark record of the progress and perceived future of the discipline. No student, researcher, or practitioner of statistics should miss this extraordinary opportunity to view the past, present, and future world of statistics through the eyes of its foremost thinkers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LHrLBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Layman's Guide to the New Testament","description":"The Layman's Guide to the New Testament is an honest, objective approach to all the books of the New Testament.

It tells the story of one man drifting through America, east coast to west, main stem to side street, endlessly searching for \\"three hots and a flop\\"--food and a place to sleep. Kromer scans, in first-person voice, the scattered events, the stultifying sameness, of \\"life on the vag\\"--the encounters with cops, the window panes that separate hunger and a \\"feed,\\" the bartering with prostitutes and homosexuals. In \\"Michael Kohler,\\" Kromer's unfinished novel, the harsh existence of coal miners in Pennsylvania is told in a committed, political voice that reveals Kromer's developing affinity with leftist writers including Lincoln Steffens and Theodore Dreiser. An exploration of Kromer's proletarian roots, \\"Michael Kohler\\" was to be a political novel, a story of labor unions and the injustices of big management. Kromer's other work ranges from his college days, when he wrote a sarcastic expose of the bums in his hometown titled \\"Pity the Poor Panhandler: $2 an Hour Is All He Gets,\\" to the sensitive pieces of his later life--short stories, articles, and book reviews written more out of an aching understanding of suffering than from the slick formulas of politics. Waiting for Nothing remains, however, Kromer's most powerful achievement, a work Steffens called \\"realism to the nth degree.\\" Collected here as the major part of Kromer's oeuvre, Waiting for Nothing traces the author's personal struggle to preserve human virtues and emotions in the face of a brutal and dehumanizing society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iTJHJlHfx2oC&dq=Waiting+for+nothing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Competition Can Be Murder (Charlie Parker Mysteries)","description":"Praise for USA Today bestseller Connie Shelton and the Charlie Parker mysteries: \\"Connie Shelton gets better with every book she writes.\\" --The Midwest Book Review \\"Charlie is slick, appealing, and nobody's fool.

The best story I know of in a long, long time  (Vanity Fair). As a boy, Claude Rawlings looks up through the grated window of his basement apartment to watch the world go by. Poor, lonely, supported by a taxi-driver mother whose eccentricities spin more and more out of control, he faces the terrible task of growing up on the margins of life, destined to be a spectator of that great world always hurrying out of reach. But there is an out-of-tune piano in the small apartment, and in unlocking the secrets of its keys, as if by magic, Claude discovers himself. He is a musical prodigy. Body & Soul is the story of a young man whose life is transformed by a gift. The gift is not without price the work is relentless, the teachers exacting but the reward is a journey that takes him to the drawing rooms of the rich and powerful, private schools, a gilt-edged marriage, and Carnegie Hall. Claude moves through this life as if he were playing a difficult composition, swept up in its drama and tension, surprised by its grace notes. Music, here, becomes a character in its own right, equaled in strength only by the music of Frank Conroy s own unmistakable and true voice. Bristling with character and invention, Body & Soul is Dickensian in its range and richness.

But somehow we feel that we just don't \\"get it.\\" Author Mary Lou Redding reminds us that the disciples were with Jesus continually, and still they had to ask him for help in learning how to pray. That should reassure us, she says. Because the Lord's Prayer is so familiar, we run the risk of praying it by rote without really thinking about the meaning of the words. Redding explores this ancient prayer phrase by phrase and helps us see how it can be a model for all of our praying. This insightful, practical study of the Lord's Prayer features six brief chapters that can be read in 10 to 15 minutes brief daily scripture passages reflection questions for each chapter suggestions for weekly group meetings Rather than approaching scripture from a scholarly standpoint, Redding invites us to consider passages with our hearts. She encourages us to make connections between the scriptures and our daily lives.

Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. The tragedy of the Donner party constitutes one of the most amazing stories of the American West. In 1846 eighty-seven people men, women, and children set out for California, persuaded to attempt a new overland route. After struggling across the desert, losing many oxen, and nearly dying of thirst, they reached the very summit of the Sierras, only to be trapped by blinding snow and bitter storms. Many perished; some survived by resorting to cannibalism; all were subjected to unbearable suffering. Incorporating the diaries of the survivors and other contemporary documents, George Stewart wrote the definitive history of that ill-fated band of pioneers; an astonishing account of what human beings may endure and achieve in the final press of circumstance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lZfTAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Decorated Page","description":" Diehn opens up a new dimension the artist s vision of visual memories.

To the Know-Nothings of the 1850s, the enemy was Irish immigrants. To the Ku Klux Klan, it was Jews, blacks, and socialists. To groups like the Michigan Militia, the enemy is the government itself -- and some of them are willing to take arms against it. The Party of Fear -- which has now been updated to examine the right-wing resurgence of the 1990s -- is the first book to reveal the common values and anxieties that lie beneath the seeming diversity of the far right. From the anti-Catholic riots that convulsed Philadelphia in 1845 to the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City, it casts a brilliant, cautionary light not only on our political fringes but on the ways in which ordinary Americans define themselves and demonize outsiders.

Since the late 1960s the Internet has grown from a single experimental network serving a dozen sites in the United States to a network of networks linking millions of computers worldwide. In Inventing the Internet, Janet Abbate recounts the key players and technologies that allowed the Internet to develop; but her main focus is always on the social and cultural factors that influenced the Internets design and use. The story she unfolds is an often twisting tale of collaboration and conflict among a remarkable variety of players, including government and military agencies, computer scientists in academia and industry, graduate students, telecommunications companies, standards organizations, and network users. The story starts with the early networking breakthroughs formulated in Cold War think tanks and realized in the Defense Department's creation of the ARPANET. It ends with the emergence of the Internet and its rapid and seemingly chaotic growth. Abbate looks at how academic and military influences and attitudes shaped both networks; how the usual lines between producer and user of a technology were crossed with interesting and unique results; and how later users invented their own very successful applications, such as electronic mail and the World Wide Web. She concludes that such applications continue the trend of decentralized, user-driven development that has characterized the Internet's entire history and that the key to the Internet's success has been a commitment to flexibility and diversity, both in technical design and in organizational culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E2BdY6WQo4AC&dq=Inventing+the+Internet+(Inside+Technology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rescuer (The O'Malley Series #6)","description":"Overwhelmed by the loss of his sister and by his work as a paramedic, Stephen O'Malley is still happy to help his friend Meghan, and when her life is endangered, they find that faith may be the only thing to get them both out alive.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6oJSce62heIC&dq=The+Rescuer+(The+O%27Malley+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Living Principle: English' as a Discipline of Thought (Leavis)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_jYgAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Living+Principle:+English%27+as+a+Discipline+of+Thought+(Leavis)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Photoshop for Right-Brainers: The Art of Photo Manipulation","description":"For those who view Photoshop as a tool for creative expression rather than a piece of software, this is the book that will help them be original.

Former chief of the Seattle police force, Stamper goes on to expose a troubling culture of racism, sexism, and homophobia that is still pervasive within the twenty-first-century force; then he explores how such prejudices can be addressed. He reveals the dangers and temptations that cops face, describing in gripping detail the split-second life-and-death decisions. Stamper draws on lessons learned to make powerful arguments for drug decriminalization, abolition of the death penalty, and radically revised approaches to prostitution and gun control. He offers penetrating insights into the \\"blue wall of silence,\\" police undercover work, and what it means to kill a man. And, Stamper gives his personal account of the World Trade organization debacle of 1999, when protests he was in charge of controlling turned violent in the streets of Seattle.

When several experiments conducted by the 1976 Viking Mars Landers returned positive results regarding signs of life, NASA scientists dismissed them as false positives. According to DiGregorio, this was based on nothing more than a refusal to accept the possibility of life beyond Earth. To bolster this argument, he surveys the history of the idea that life might exist on other planets, invoking such names as Giordano Bruno and Galileo. As our understanding of both biology and astronomy grew, the notion that life is not unique to Earth took hold in the minds of many scientists. The recent rise of the new science of exobiology opened doors to an understanding of how life might have arisen on any planet with the right conditions. Dr. Levin and Dr. Straat, who designed and built one of the Viking experiments, contribute two chapters summarizing the current status of this fascinating debate. The author's detailed research, as well as extensive interviews with Dr. Levin and others, highlights the intriguing evidence pointing to life on the Red Planet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2zKEQgAACAAJ&dq=Mars:+The+Living+Planet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cyberforce: The Tin Men of War","description":"This extravaganza features a never-before-seen story and characters, essential Cyberforce character bio-files, special guest pinups, and the first earthshaking appearance of Stryke Force!","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pVhsEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Small Book about God","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dollars & Sense of Divorce","description":"Is it possible to read and relax your way into financial abundance? Can dollars flow to you even if you just sat quietly in your favorite armchair and did \\"nothing\\"? Is abundance and prosperity really our natural birthright, as claimed by so many spiritual masters and authors throughout the ages? In his latest book Dollars Flow To Me Easily, bestselling author and spiritual explorer Richard Dotts attempts something that he has never done before - to write a book that changes and transforms the reader's innermost perceptions about money as they read it. Richard explains that these spiritual principles have never been about \\"attracting\\" more money or stuff into our lives. Instead, these Universal truths all speak of recognizing the inherent abundance that is already there for our taking. Is it any wonder that traditional Law of Attraction techniques which focus on \\"doing\\" and \\"attracting\\" something from out there to fill a perceived lack in our lives do not create lasting results? But if all our abundance is already right here for our taking, why is it that our bank balance and physical experiences do not always reflect this truth? Is there something we have to do in order to welcome this abundance into our lives? Dollars Flow To Me Easily takes an alternative approach to answering these questions. Instead of guiding the reader through a series of exercises to \\"feel as if\\" they are already rich, Richard draws on the power of words and our highest intentions to dissolve negative feelings and misconceptions that block us from manifesting greater financial abundance in our lives. When these blocks are gently dissolved and let go of through absorbing the words in this book, what results are natural physical manifestations of abundance in our everyday experience. As Richard puts it, this technique is so counter-intuitive precisely because it flies in the face of everything we have been taught. We have been taught to tackle our financial issues head-on and to worry about them constantly in order to come up with solutions. But despite this, all our worrying and mental activity has still not resulted in everlasting peace-of-mind and a permanent resolution of the financial issues in our lives. Perhaps the real solution that we need is to simply correct our thinking on the inside, and to realize that there has been no issue and no lack in the first place. When we tend to our inner states and make it our priority... when we finally give up the need to do anything to make things happen... that is when the Universe can deliver our highest good to us. Dollars Flow To Me Easily takes you through the experiential journey of dropping all your worries, fears and blocks around manifesting money as you read. What remains at the end is the real you - a state in which dollars flow to you easily and a recognition of this truth that has always been a part of your being.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XVMBDQEACAAJ&dq=Dollars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Tokyo Bilingual Pocket Atlas","description":"This work presents Japanese architectural projects in which graphic design plays the leading role.

From her humble but proud beginnings in south Philadelphia to international vocal renown, the legendary contralto writes of triumph and adversity, of being grounded in faith and surrounded by family, and of the music that shaped her career. Anderson published My Lord, What a Morning in 1956 on the heels of her groundbreaking role as the first African American to perform at the Metropolitan Opera. In it are bittersweet reminiscences of a working-class childhood, from her first job scrubbing the neighbors' steps to the sorrow and upheaval of her father's untimely death. Here are the stories of a young girl with prodigious talent, and her warm remembrances of the teachers, managers, friends, accompanists, and fans who worked to foster it. Here is a veritable travelogue of her concerts across the globe and rare glimpses at the personal life of a woman more concerned with family than celebrity. An entire chapter devoted to the Easter concert at the Lincoln Memorial in 1939 reveals Anderson's immense respect for Eleanor Roosevelt, who resigned from the Daughters of the American Revolution when they refused to let Anderson perform at Constitution Hall. Supplanting sorrow and regret for anger and violence, Anderson demurely imparts her views on discrimination and on becoming an icon in the struggle for civil rights. With eleven photographs and a touching new foreword by Anderson's nephew, famed conductor and poet James DePreist, this new paperback edition of My Lord, What a Morning revives the classic portrait of a musical legend who was resilient in the bullying face of bigotry and gracious in the unfaltering glow of fame.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SA9_fJJcu38C&dq=My+Lord,+what+a+morning:+An+autobiography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selections from Chess","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-iW1tAEACAAJ&dq=Selections+from+Chess&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Creative Real Estate Investor's Notebook of 525 Rehab, Remodeling, Repair, and Maintenance Secrets (v 2.2)","description":"Now in a newly updated second edition, this guide covers all the ins and outs of buying, renovating, and reselling distressed properties at big profits.

Begun in England 150 years ago, it took more than 60 years to complete and, when it was finally finished in 1928, the British prime minister heralded it as a 'national treasure'. It maintained this image throughout the twentieth century, and in 2006 the English public voted it an 'Icon of England', alongside Marmite, Buckingham Palace and the bowler hat. However, this book shows that the dictionary is not as 'British' as we all thought. The linguist and lexicographer, Sarah Ogilvie, combines her insider knowledge and experience with impeccable research to show that the OED is in fact an international product in both its content and its making. She examines the policies and practices of the various editors, applies qualitative and quantitative analysis, and finds new OED archival materials in the form of letters, reports and proofs. She demonstrates that the OED, in its use of readers from all over the world and its coverage of World English, is in fact a global text.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IqvNTSuoH1EC&dq=The+Oxford+Dictionary+of+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writing with a purpose","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KMS7lsKOXEMC&dq=Writing+with+a+purpose&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Five-Minute Rule","description":"Throughout your life, you've had parents, coaches, teachers, friends, and mentors who have pushed you to be better than your excuses and bigger than your fears.

The Norseman Eyvind, a fierce and loyal Wolfskin, came to a new land on top of the world to find his destiny. With his priestess bride Nessa he saved the land and weathered the treachery that was caused by Eyvind's blood-sworn friend Somerled. After much pain and sorrow the two lovers have managed to create a society where the Norse warriors and the gentle folks of the Orkney Isles live and thrive in contentment at last. A decade and more has passed since the devastating events of the creation of the settlement and Eyvind and Nessa have watched their children grow and thrive in peace. But not all on the islands are content or at peace. Thorvald, the young son of Margaret, widow of the slain king and Eyvind's war leader, has always felt apart and at odds with all he knows. He learns upon his coming to manhood that he is not his father's son but that of the love that Margaret bore for the hated Somerled and that Somerled was not killed for his treachery but sent on a boat, adrift with little more than a knife and skein of water, doomed to the god's will. Thorvald is determined to find a boat and cast off to the West in a desperate bid to find a father he never knew...and to find out if he is made of the same stuff as the heinous traitor. The tragedy of this scheme would be horrific enough...if it were not for the fact that Creidhe, the winsome daughter of Eyvind and Nessa has loved Thorvald since birth and unbeknownst to him conspires to go along on this most perilous of quests. What happens to them on their journey of discovery will ultimately change the lives of all they know and love...and will doom (or redeem) an entire people.

The authors present their own unique integration of Ericksonian techniques, traditional models of hypnotherapy, and recent research in related areas.

The use of trance in training design, to unconsciously install the skills being taught to the participants, is also covered. The book developed from transcripts of a four day workshop, and the design of the book parallels the design chosen for the training itself. Individual exercises or those done in groups of two or three are offered so that the reader may practice the techniques and learn the skills.

But critics often suggest that she became a revolutionary despite her American background, not because of it. Bram Dijkstra challenges that point of view. In this searching reappraisal of O'Keeffe's work, the distinguished cultural historian shows that her art was decisively shaped by the America in which she grew up. In doing so, he casts new light on the facts of O'Keeffe's remarkable life and offers incisive new readings of many of her most important paintings. Art historians have largely accepted the view that O'Keeffe's art was shaped by Alfred Stieglitz and the work of the European modernists she encountered under his tutelage--a view actively encouraged by the famous photographer himself. Dijkstra counters this idea by taking us into the cultural environment of her childhood and by illuminating the details of her early education in art. He shows that O'Keeffe's mature style found its origin in such apparently unlikely sources as Edgar Allan Poe's speculations about the androgynous nature of the soul before industrialism, and in what Dijkstra calls the \\"transcendental materialism\\" of the tonalist movement in turn-of-the-century American art. Dijkstra also explores O'Keeffe's important--but until now widely neglected--identification with the feminist aims and artistic concerns of the radical periodicalThe Masses. And he shows that even the daring new styles of illustration featured there, and in other magazines of the period, significantly influenced her development of a personal style. Dijkstra argues, moreover, that O'Keeffe's very American search for an organic abstraction of form that would celebrate nature allowed her to develop a humanist style that deliberately challenged the early European modernists' emphasis on mechanistic constructions of formagainst nature. Beautifully written and painstakingly researched, Georgia O'Keeffe and the Eros of Placeis a major reassessment of O'Keeffe's place in American culture and a tribute to the artist's steadfast refusal to abandon her \\"provincial\\" belief in the shaping spirit of place.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=znR4QgAACAAJ&dq=Georgia+O%27Keeffe+and+the+Eros+of+Place&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FYI: For Your Improvement, A Development and Coaching Guide (3rd Edition)","description":"Provides a chapter of easy to follow and actionable tips for each of the areas identified as leadership competencies including: dealing with ambiguity, conflict management, and strategic agility.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-WZaAAAAYAAJ&dq=FYI:+For+Your+Improvement,+A+Development+and+Coaching+Guide+(3rd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"100 Ways To Take Better Landscape Photographs","description":"This guide is suitable for all levels of photographers. 100 Ways to Take Better Nature and Wildlife Photographs features 100 practical and inspiring tips on every aspect of the genre.&break;Guy Edwardes' breath-taking pictures accompany his eas-to-follow advice on a wide range of subjects from capturing the actions of large mammals to snapping wild birds and flowers in the garden.

During this time William R. Wright amassed a collection notable for its broad representation of twentieth-century Native American products. Focusing on the Southwest, he included contemporary Pueblo ceramics, Navajo and Hopi textiles,Navajo, Hopi, and Zuni jewelry, and baskets from some forty different Native American groups. The objects Wright gathered, which are now part of the collections of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, reflect developments in the intersecting worlds of makers, markets, and collectors, including the challenges faced by makers to successfully balance tradition and innovation in their work and their lives. This volume examines selected objects from the Wright collection to explore the market-influenced environment of modern Native American makers and their work, from what some consider the low end of tourist art multiples to the high end of unique, signed fine art objects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rpRlQgAACAAJ&dq=Makers+and+Markets+:+The+Wright+Collection+of+Twentieth-Century+Native+American+Art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GILDAEN: The Heroic Adventures of a Most Unusual Rabbit","description":"Having lost his memory, a boy with magical powers teams up with the rabbit Gildaen to search for his true identity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JY4fRGMxrqEC&dq=GILDAEN:+The+Heroic+Adventures+of+a+Most+Unusual+Rabbit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Special Situations (Practical Karate) (Bk.6)","description":" lt offers easy-to-learn karate responses in typical self-defense situations.

Ted Dekker has written an expos  on the death of pleasure within the Church. Because many of us have set aside hope and the inspired imagination that drives it, Dekker says we have been lulled into a slumber of boredom, even despondency. Our faith wanes, the joy at having been liberated fades, and we feel powerless. The Slumber of Christianity explores what robs us of happiness and how we can rediscover it and live lives that rekindle hope. The pursuit of pleasure is a gift to all humans-a function of the Creator himself, who is bent upon our happiness. It's time for Christians to reclaim our inheritance of pleasure. The Slumber of Christianity will inflame hearts toward full-fledged, mind-expanding encounters with hope, through the imagination.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gHUTbCfQ3SQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manhunt Official Strategy Guide","description":"BradyGames' Manhunt Official Strategy Guide features a complete walkthrough leading players through the entire game.

Fuzzy control is exceptionally practical and cost-effective due to its unique ability to accomplish tasks without knowing the mathematical model of the system, even if it is nonlinear, time varying and complex. Nevertheless, compared with the conventional control technology, most fuzzy control applications are developed in an ad hoc manner with little analytical understanding and without rigorous system analysis and design. Fuzzy Control and Modeling is the only book that establishes the analytical foundations for fuzzy control and modeling in relation to the conventional linear and nonlinear theories of control and systems. The coverage is up-to-date, comprehensive, in-depth and rigorous. Numeric examples and applications illustrate the utility of the theoretical development. Important topics discussed include: Structures of fuzzy controllers/models with respect to conventional fuzzy controllers/models Analysis of fuzzy control and modeling in relation to their classical counterparts Stability analysis of fuzzy systems and design of fuzzy control systems Sufficient and necessary conditions on fuzzy systems as universal approximators Real-time fuzzy control systems for treatment of life-critical problems in biomedicine Fuzzy Control and Modeling is a self-contained, invaluable resource for professionals and students in diverse technical fields who aspire to analytically study fuzzy control and modeling.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UqYeAQAAIAAJ&dq=Fuzzy+Control+and+Modeling+:+Analytical+Foundations+and+Applications+(IEEE+Press+Series+on+Biomedical+Engineering)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of the Art of War in the Middle Ages: Volume Two: 1278-1485 AD (Greenhill Military Paperbacks)","description":"The Grene and Lattimore edition of the Greek tragedies has been among the most widely acclaimed and successful publications of the University of Chicago Press.

For the Centennial Edition two of the original translations have been replaced. In the original publication David Grene translated only one of the three Theban plays, Oedipus the King. Now he has added his own translations of the remaining two, Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone, thus bringing a new unity of tone and style to this group. Grene has also revised his earlier translation of Prometheus Bound and rendered some of the former prose sections in verse. These new translations replace the originals included in the paperback volumes Sophocles I (which contains all three Theban plays), Aeschylus II, Greek Tragedies, Volume I, and Greek Tragedies, Volume III, all of which are now being published in second editions. All other volumes contain the translations of the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides for the most part from the original versions first published in the 1940s and 1950s.
