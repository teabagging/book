The first is that I am a Vietnam Combat Veteran and was interested on how the subject would be presented; the second is because I enjoy graphic novels, and they bring back memories of reading comic books when I was younger.The graphic novel follows the life of Ed Marks as he enters the U.S. Army in 1966 and goes through training and is sent to Vietnam. In Vietnam Pfc. Marks is assigned to the 4/23 Infantry, Mechanized. This is an actual unit that served with distinction in Vietnam with the 25 Infantry Division (Tropic Lightning) from 1966 until it left Vietnam in 1971. I served with the 4th Infantry Division, 2/8 Infantry Mechanized, Company A, 1st Squad from Oct 1968 till Jan 1970.For those interested 4/23 Infantry means 4th Battalion (Mechanized) 23rd Infantry Regiment.Mechanized Infantry had the ability to close in on the enemy faster and with greater fire power. Cav (Calvary) units also had this mobility with Huey's and gunships. Once contact was made the infantry always dismounted, the APC's (Armored Personal Carriers) were death traps.Mechanized infantry also walked a lot, and at times were sent in by chopper for an air assault.Considering the limitations placed on the publication of \\"The'Nam\\" by the Comic Code as expressed in the introduction by the editor, Larry Hama, I feel the people at Marvel have done a good job of trying to bring the Vietnam War to the attention of a readership that in all likelihood was not born during those years.There are exceptions I take to parts of stories included in this first volume, but there are also some very realistic points made. For instance; no one ever built a fire at night while out on patrol (it would give your position away) and few companies went back to base camps, we stayed in the bush for months. Also to my knowledge no one flew into Vietnam as replacements under a hail of gunfire as depicted early in the issue. The exceptions to that are the Marines who flew into Khe Sanh between January and April in 1968 when it was under siege. These are minor issues, after all this is a graphic novel.However, the author Doug Murray has done a good job tying in the different scenario of combat in Vietnam. The illustrators Mike Golden and Wayne Vansant have done excellent work in their representations of the military equipment and scenery considering again the restraints placed on them in adhering to the Comic Code.No one will ever know the true horrors of war by reading a graphic novel or any novel of war. All the same, I recommend this graphic novel for those who would like to know a little of that forgotten war and at the same time enjoy a terrific read with great graphics. I look forward to reading Volume 2."},{"Title":"The 'Nam, Vol. 1","review":"&quot;The 'Nam&quot; is an unusual way of looking at war--in comics. While anime does such things frequently, such a realistic look at war from an American company is rare, and serves as an interesting side note to other Viet Nam pop culture icons such as Billy Joel's &quot;Goodnight Saigon&quot; and Robin William's Adrian Cronaur in &quot;Good Morning Vietnam.&quot;"},{"Title":"From Normandy to the Ruhr: With the 116th Panzer Division in World War II","review":"Reviewer: Lou Witt, a WWII combat infantryman from Catonsville, MarylandIf you are looking for easy narrative reading, stick to Stephen Ambrose. If you are looking for WWII history glossed over, try Charles Whiting. However, if you are looking for an inside view of the almost daily operations of a German panzer division on the Western Front during the last year of the 3d Reich, Heinz G&uuml;nther Guderian's book 'From Normandy to the Ruhr' was written for you.This book is not light reading, but neither is it ever dull. It was written by an expert on the subject of armored warfare. Guderian was born into a military family, the son of the man considered to have been a leading proponent of modern combined arms warfare. The author served with the 16th Panzer Grenadier Division on the Eastern Front prior to his extensive experience in the west. After the war, he served as a Bundeswehr tank battalion and brigade commander, and finally, as a general officer, as Inspector of Armored Troops.Guderian served as the First General Staff officer of the 116th Panzer Division from its formation in early 1944, through its training in preparation for resisting the anticipated allied landings, and on until the division's destruction. As I was not familiar with the German title of &quot;First General Staff officer,&quot; I learned that his job was essentially a combination of the positions of division chief of staff and G-3 (Operations Officer) in an American division. As such, he was certainly an officer who was completely &quot;in the know&quot; about his division's combat actions from battalion level up, as well as the decisions at corps, army, and even army group echelons of command. Not only did this book provide me with an excellent, in-depth appreciation and understanding of the structure of a German panzer division, but the strategies and execution of battle plans as well. It has also inspired me to learn more about, among other topics, German tactics, equipment, and replacement training, and then to be able to compare them with those of the US Army with which I am more familiar.More than the author's style, it is the rich detail and important insights he provides that compelled me to read this book from cover to cover."},{"Title":"From Normandy to the Ruhr: With the 116th Panzer Division in World War II","review":"Sort of like Forrest Gump in the 60's, the 116th Panzer Div was in the middle of many of the famous and key battles in the Western Front in '44 and '45. This book is an excellent description of the battles from the German point of view. The writing and research are fair and scrupelous. If you've read the major histories by American or British authors, this one will fill any voids, correct a few misunderstandings, and explain the other side of the story. You might want to keep those major histories handy, because sometimes I got a little confused about the larger picture (though Guderian describes the action on either side of the 116th)."},{"Title":"From Normandy to the Ruhr: With the 116th Panzer Division in World War II","review":"The late General Heinz G&uuml;nther Guderian wrote the best division history I have ever seen, and I have read many. Every detail of the 116th Panzer Division's operations from its organization in the spring of 1944 through the end of the war in the Ruhr Pocket is covered in this amazingly detailed study. Moreover, the reasons for each tactical decision are laid out in clear terms, whether they were made for purely doctrinal rationale, unfortunate battlefield necessity, or from political influence. It is this richness of explanation that sets Guderian's book apart from all other division histories. In a genre (division histories) dominated by books which are often little more than keepsakes or souvenirs, filled with sentimental versions of the way the authors wish the war would have gone, From Normandy to the Ruhr stands out as an unemotionally recounted day-by-day, blow-by-blow account of how, despite being constituted late in the war and despite being virtually destroyed three times (Normandy, Aachen/The H&uuml;rtgen, and the Ardennes), a German panzer division repeatedly rose to the challenges posed by mission after mission. Written by the Division's 1st General Staff Officer himself, this book provides profound insights into how the German Army was able to remain a formidable foe until the spring of 1945.As the publisher's ad copy emphasizes, this is NOT a personal memoir by a private or sergeant, or lieutenant. There are some very fine books that fit the \\"memoir\\" category, including several by this book's publisher, The Aberjona Press, such as Black Edelweiss, Seven Days in January, The Good Soldier, and Five Years, Four Fronts. However, while exciting to the buff, educational to the student of battlefield actions and reactions, or even titillating to the \\"war porn\\" junkie, there is much more to military history than the combat recollections of those who saw action at the foxhole level. Normandy to the Ruhr is a much rarer bird: it is a brilliantly polished tactical history, written by a highly decorated staff officer, which explains the mechanics of war at the tactical level. It is supported by dozens of outstanding maps which allow the reader to follow all of the action, and a very robust photo section, which allows the reader to form a mental image of most of the characters mentioned in the book.From Normandy to the Ruhr is also a crucially important work because, almost uniquely, it explains the terrible influence of politicos-in this case, Nazi politicians, military and civilian-on the battlefield conduct of war. The meddling, political correctness, and downright blunders foisted upon commanders at all levels by political leaders with a wide variety of agendas other than battlefield success is brilliantly documented in this book.For readers who wish to know not just the \\"what\\" of combat which can be gained from junior soldiers' or leaders' memoirs, but the \\"why,\\" From Normandy to the Ruhr is a must-read. It is critical reading not only for the student of German operations on the Western Front, but for those interested in the many American and British units which fought the 116th Panzer Division...from Normandy to the Ruhr!"},{"Title":"From Normandy to the Ruhr: With the 116th Panzer Division in World War II","review":"An excellant account of one Div in the fight of WWII. As this unit fought on the Western Front it differs in the action accounts of the &quot;Fight to the Death&quot; that went on in the Eastern Front.Very descriptive accounts of battles fought and what went wrong on the German side and how they countered the Allied assaults. Sometimes successful and sometimes not....there are no one &quot;we won every battle&quot; descriptions but an honest account of how this division &quot;the Greyhound&quot; Division fought.Having been the only major unit to make it to the beaches on D-Day but not having the resources to consolidate their gains and then fight a continuous withdrawl action for the rest of the war, I found this book easy to follow. I was not lost and the maps made following the battles extremly easy to navigate which unit fought who.Well worth it."},{"Title":"From Normandy to the Ruhr: With the 116th Panzer Division in World War II","review":"For WWII enthusiasts, Heinz Gunther Guderian's _From Normandy..._ is a must! &quot;The little Guderian,&quot; who was the 116th's (1a) and awarded the Knight's Cross for leading the division's remnants out of the Falaise Gap, first published it in 1994, some twenty years after retiring from the Bundeswehr. Fortunately for those of us language hindered, Aberjona Press has just issued an excellent translation.This is much more than a book about panzer battles and includes astute observations about the political realities of 1944-45 and how they impacted on the German military. It's also a succinct revelation about the French and German cultures. For example, Guderian discusses some prevalent French thought about the Transportation Plan's relentless bombing of the Seine bridges and Normady's RR system. As one French woman told Heinz Gunther, &quot;they'll bomb us until we turn German,&quot; an observation I picked up on when living in Vernon(Eure), France in the 1950's.I adopted _From Normandy.._ &quot;cold&quot; (prior to publication) as a text for my American Military University World War II(ETO) course and am glad I did. However, I wasn't taking many chances since I had just used _Six Days in January, the 6th SS Mountain in NORDWIND_ and knew the quality of publications Abjerna puts out.

The Aberjona Press does an excellent translation to English. The selection of military terminology of both sides and explanatory comments by editor Keith E. Bonn are helpful for all readers.

Being the former chief of staff of the division he was well placed to give insite into the stenghts and weakness of the German defense on D-Day. His book includes some controversial personal reflections on Fieldmarshal Erwin Rommel and General Graf v. Schwerin.I gave this book 5-stars for the simple fact it is one of the few German army histories that gives a factual no-nonsense reflection on the performance of the German army in World War 2 but lacks the revisionst cliches'.This book I would recommend to those that are interested in the Allies on the western front as it gives unique insite into how and why the Allies were successful and the reason the Germans failed."},{"Title":"From Normandy to the Ruhr: With the 116th Panzer Division in World War II","review":"\\"From Normandy to the Ruhr\\" provides unique insights into the decision-making process of a Panzer Division. The 116th Panzer Division is of particular interest because it fought in just about all the most decisive battles of the Western Front in 1944-45.Guderian examines both victories and failures in an interesting way.The 26 maps will be much appreciated by armor pros and wargamers.An extra plus for the beautiful cover and general layout. There are portraits of all Knight's Cross holders of the division. My only negative comment would be that some of the photos should have been better reproduced and larger.If you are a professional armor officer, serious wargamer or Panzer warfare buff - this book is for you."},{"Title":"From Normandy to the Ruhr: With the 116th Panzer Division in World War II","review":"The real story of the 116.Panderdivision Windhund from the qualified point of view of Major Heinz G&uuml;nther Guderian (later General in the new reformed Bundesheer), son of that General Guderian father of the Blitzkrieg.Every aspect is discussed, as technical as human.Every battle is explained in detail, with a large use of military terms, maps and original documents.Also the difficult realtions between the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht and the subordinated units are analized, giving the exact sense of those difficult days at the end of World War Two.This is the point of reference about the 116.Panzerdivision, only a larger number of pictures should be needed to carry out an outstanding work."},{"Title":"From Normandy to the Ruhr: With the 116th Panzer Division in World War II","review":"Not an easy read, but the effort is well worth it. This book is a gem of craftsmanship, and provides a fascinating insight into the strategic, tactical and political considerations involved in the final defense of the Reich from the perspective of one of Germany's best Panzer divisions. It is not a foxhole book, with graphic descriptions of tactical conflicts, although reports are excerpted that are chilling, to say the least. The combat reports about Aachen, where my father fought, are one example. I vividly recall an excerpted report describing 54 American soldiers dispatched in a single day by two snipers during brutal house to house fighting.If you want the foxhole perspective, and the \\"jets of flames from the hatches of the Shermans\\" type of book, you will probably not be satisfied with this read. But if you want the perspective of a 1a, with incredible insight and writing skills, it is a book you will want to tackle.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"From Normandy to the Ruhr: With the 116th Panzer Division in World War II","review":"I had a hard time rating this book since it is so incredibly, teutonically dull, but at the same time I don't want to sell my copy since it is chock full of the kind of detail that serious students of the history of WW2 require. So as a reference book it is 5 star while as entertainment it has no stars, hence the compromise of 3 stars overall. Read &quot;Condemned to Live&quot; by Franz Frisch or Hans Von Luck's &quot;Panzer Commander&quot;, among many others, if you are interested in the experiences of German soldiers in WW2. Keep this one on the shelf along with Manstein's &quot;Lost Victories&quot; if you are a serious student of military history and need some heavy detail and your German isn't up to reading the original after action reports and reams of other documents that the Wehrmacht left behind."},{"Title":"From Normandy to the Ruhr: With the 116th Panzer Division in World War II","review":"I suppose this book is for the very serious military scholar or student, who wants a very detailed account of one particular Panzer division formed for the defense of the Allied invasion. It is amazingly dry and dull, however. You are not going to get any sense of what the war was like for the real soldier, but rather the chess piece movement of military units and political games of commanders.I know there was a lot of finger-pointing after the war and this book is no exception. It is filled with old woman bickering between commanders and it's fair share of Rommel bashing. If you are in military college I would recommend it, if just an enthusiast there are more enthralling books out there."},{"Title":"Expert Witnesses in Child Abuse Cases: What Can and Should Be Said in Court","review":"This is an excellent resource for the professional who has had no or limited experience in testifying regarding child sexual abuse matters (or, for those who have had negative experiences). The author provides background and recommendations for testimony. Like most books published by APA, I found that it safely balanced the scientific with the clinical. In doing so, I found that it provided a disappointing level of detail about abuse, the consultation process, evaluation, preparation, or testimony. For the clinician wishing greater information on the topic or for the clinician wishing for more useful information on the evaluation or testimony processes, I'd recommend augmentation with other relevant sources.

The main problem I see in its usage is the neglect of non-linear effects. An unknowledgeable material scientist or engineer calculates a stress or deflection and then thinks it can be applied to failure analysis. The component will take a far greater load before it fails due to the non-linear effects. For example, the initial force to deflect a trampoline 1 inch may be 1 lb, but at 24 inch it is 200 lb (not 24 lb, the linear answer). It's the same with structures when they start deforming."},{"Title":"Formulas for stress and strain, (Product development series)","review":"The content of Roark's Formulas is very handy for a desk reference type book and is referred to in many other works like Marks' Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers and Design of Weldments and Design of Welded Structures by Omer Blodgett.My copy of the 7th edition looks like the pages were crooked when they were cut to size. The text on left hand pages is tilted to the top left and the right pages are tilted to the top right. Most likely when the stack of printed material was in the size cutter it wasn't squared properly because every page is turned the exact same amount. It doesn't affect the readability of anything it just looks odd because you almost think you're holding the book crooked sine the text isn't parallel to the top and bottom edges.The paper isn't the slick, durable type used in McGraw Hill's other reference books like Marks' Std Handbook for Mechanical Engineers, so combined with the crooked page trim I would rate the physical appearance sub-par.

As this was from Bagoas's point of view I was initially reluctant to read it but I am VERY glad I did. I have come to love Bagoas every bit as much as Hephastion, much like Alexander did. Though of course this isn't a memoir penned by Bagoas himself, I do very much believe that Mary Renault did him justice and he would be proud. He deserves to have his story told just as much as Alexander does. Bagoas wasn't some weak, frightened, limp wristed eunuch by any stretch of the imagination. He not only survived Royal politics, which is in a feat in itself, but he survived the fall of Darius, the xenophobic Macedonians, an assassination attempt and an incredible and harrowing march through India and the desert. Many, many men (who actually did have balls) did not survive that particular campaign. To me, this just proves the point that being a man is less about what you look like physically and more about what you are made of inside. Cheesy sounding I know, but true. I highly, highly recommend this book, not just for Alexander-aphiles, but for anyone simply looking for something good to read - gay or straight."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"I read Mrs. Renault's \\"The Persian Boy\\" some years ago (1991 I think) I say read, but I actually listened to a \\"Books-on-Tape\\" unabridged version of the test thanks to my local library (Thank you Alachua County Public Library). In any case I believe that it was this book that turned me on to Mary Renault. I have never been disappointed by anything that I have read from Mary Renault, on the contrary her prose make for a luscious read. I highly recommend anything by Mrs. Renault.

I have read it 4 times in the last year and am currently reading Fire From Heaven because i hadn't known it was part of a series until a short while ago. Read this book and reccomend it to as many people as you can because it makes you LOVE these characters and has started for me a love affair with stories of Alexander the Great and his life.

This one is probably the best.Narrated by Bagoas, the Persian eunuch \\"inherited\\" by Alexander from the entourage of the defeated King Darius, PERSIAN BOY portrays the great Macedonian as both as demi-god and as all too human. He is at once gigantic, fearless, vainglorious, unstoppable,and ruthless on the one hand and tender, solicitous, sentimental (he names a city after his dead dog Perditas), compassionate, and loyal to a fault on the other. Friendship he seems to value above all else, evidenced by his reaction to the death of his boyhood companion and most trusted confidante, Hephaistion. He hangs the doctor who could not save his friend and then plunges into an orgy of despair. Still he never loses sight of his great ambition to remake the entire world in his own image and, like any truly great man, moves ahead despite grief and his own physical impairments.This is an amazing recreation of the ancient world. If any book succeeds in relaying the sights, sounds, smells, customs, dress, mating habits, etc., of a distant time and place, this is it. Bagoas makes for an engaging storyteller. He holds nothing back, and if he turns out to be a bit of a snob, well, what else would one expect from the world's most beautiful eunuch, one who can give no less than the King of the World such sensual fulfillment?Like any snob, Bagoas favors excellence over mediocrity, and in Alexander excellence is given human form. No wonder Bagoas loves him so! And that love story provides this novel its center, its tender heart. It is subtle, suggestive, and very real. Male writers should be as adept as Renault in their depictions of male male relationships, demphasizing the physical and giving more attention to the emotional.The novel bogs down in places and becomes repetitious, but it is well worth sticking with till the end."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"The Persian Boy is written in first person from the pov of Bagoas, a teenaged Pesian eunuch who had been the slave of Darius the Great, whom Alexander conquered. When I read this story, I felt as if my feet became dusty from hiking through the mountains behind Alexander. I thirsted in the desert with him and his troops and raged with them in battle. In viewing Alexander through the eyes of Bagoas, I came away with the impression of having dwelt with two of the most noble characters in history. I read this book the first time when I was about 30; I have had a fascination for all things Alexandrian in the nearly 20 years since. Masterful writing, sensuality without vulgarity and history not told from a 20th century mindset elevate this book to the superb. If this is not the actual history of Alexander as it unfolded - it should have been. I have judged all books about him by the standards set in this epic. I have re-read this book a dozen times and enjoyed new aspects with each one. The highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"I first ran across Mary Renault's work in a library in the usual way. I tend to look absently through book shelves until something jumps out at me. I read Fire From Heaven first. I was excited to see a novel about Alexander The Great because I had always admired this historical character since I first read about him as a child. I was blown away by this first book and ran out to get The Persian Boy.The impact of this book is doubled after reading the first one because by this point I had grown aquainted with Alexander as a child and now as a man. His portrayal through the eyes of Bagoas, the eunuch, was a fresh perspective and made the connection for the characters more intense. I read this book more than once and each time I was sobbing by the time I reached the end. Even though I knew what the book ended like, even though I KNOW the history of what happens I was reduced to a bundle of tears.Mary Renault has a unique gift in pulling you in and making you fall in love with the world she creates as if it were your own."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"The Persian Boy is one of the best books I've ever read. I loved Fire From Heaven but The Persian Boy is even better. It is a very compelling book by a master storyteller. I didn't know much about Greek,Macedonian,or Persian culture before I read these books but Mary Renault makes you feel as if you are an eyewitness at Alexanders conquests. I loved the character of Bagoas and was surprised to find that he was a real person. I fully recommend this book to anyone who loves great books. It is thrilling, beautiful, heartbreaking, and just plain wonderful."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Wow. This is definitely Renault's greatest book. Told from the point of Alexander's lover, Bagoas, you truly get to know another side of Alexander. At first, I was angry when I began to read. By making the story from Bagoas' point of view, it made it seem as if Alexander was a distant stranger even though I felt like I knew him after reading Fire From Heaven. But as the story progressed, Renault's choice of words totally took over me. I began to feel Bagoas's hate of Roxane and of Hephaistion. I felt Alexander's disappointment that his men did not love him fully. This novel truly shows the nature of Alexander."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Very few novels have moved me to tears in the end, but this was one of them. Mary Renault succeeds in capturing the depth and breadth of Bagoas's abiding devotion to Alexander, and brings history to life.Slow-moving as this story is, it nevertheless succeeded in capturing my imagination despite the fact that I knew more or less how the tale was supposed to go, and that there was no happy ending. And big-ass disclaimer: I don't think this story is going to be to everyone's taste. Perhaps what makes it the most for me is that we view imperfect characters (such as Alexander and his eternal love Hephaestion) through Bagoas's no doubt more than slightly rose-tinted glasses.Renault also gives the impression that Alexander incessantly made war because he was driven by the need to explore and dominate the world, and that conquering other nations was eventually his raison d'etre and the only thing that kept him motivated.Yes, the writing is textured and at times flowery, but it was absolutely everything that I enjoy in a story, with slow world-building. Renault brings across sensuality without letting the story become smutty. So, yes, this is a love story. As life is sometimes brutal, in which all story arcs do not tie up neatly, I understand that the novel itself, in remaining true to history, doesn't have an epic resolution.Alexander, it can be said, goes out with a whisper and a sigh, rather than the roar of battle. But I am awed, and my imagination has been captured. I shall definitely be reading more of Renault's works, and if I can capture even a part of her grace of style in my own writing, I shall consider myself fortunate."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"This is the most beautifully written book I've ever read. Every word and phrase draws you in and takes you back in time. The story absolutely captivated me from the first time I read it nearly 40 years ago, and it's still as magical today. As soon as I finished it the first time, I went right back to page one and started again. This book got me interested in the real Alexander, and I began to read non-fiction accounts of his life. I wrote a letter to Mary Renault (in care of her publisher) back in the 1970s telling her this. She replied (from South Africa) that nothing pleased her more than to know her books got people interested in real history. I wouldn't be surprised if the movie 'Alexander' took a lot of its story from this book. The character Bagoas is in the movie, and I doubt he would have appeared there if Mary Renault had not used him as the narrator of this wonderful tale."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"This is an excellent book and a very good compliment to the first book in the trilogy. I'm looking forward to reading the third."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"An exquisitely written book, unnerving and haunting but sweet and tender at the same time.I found this book even better than the first (Fire From Heaven). Bagoas is an excellent narrator and through his eyes Alexander is made out to be a god and a human in the same breath. I was inexorably drawn in by the tragic story, all the while dreading the inevitable end which was made even more agonizing by the feeling of reality created in the pages."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"The Persian Boy is one of the best novels I have read in quite a long time. Renault gives us a clearly defined character in Bagoas, her style making his voice realistic and relatable. Having become so drawn in by the style of writing and the depth of character development, I found myself saddened to find I had come to the end. This will most certainly be one the books on my shelves that I will read multiple times."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"The first time I read this book it made me cry - having read Fire from Heaven I had very much entered into the feelings of Hephaistion, Alexander's boyhood lover, and it was my appreciation of how he (if he was at all as the author portrays him) must have felt about the arrival of a new lover. This is Renault's strength, that she can make you feel so much as if this is not fiction but history, that it is real. So much so that on reading Robin Lane-Fox's Search for Alexander, I was pleased to read that there is no evidence that Bagoas was Alexander's lover, and that some historians have doubted his very existence! The society of ancient Persia is very little known and this book really makes you feel you know exactly what it was like. Do not read it (or indeed any of Renault's work) if you are homophobic. I also get the feeling she didn't have much time for women, but in the context of ancient Greece this is not surprising."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"I have been in love with History since I read my first history book, Alexander is one of my favorite characters, and thanks to &quot;The Persian Boy&quot; I get a glimpse to that man's life, the world that he conquered, and the people that lived in it most complete that trought sole anecdots in a history book. This has been one of those rare books that I force myself not to finish in one read, I feel grieve knowing that this book has an end that I didn't want to read, but I read it, and I'm glad, at least in the fiction of the book, that begoas was there."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"While there is no written historical evidence to confirm Alexander the Great as a homosexual, nonetheless he had very close relationships with two men, Hephaestion and Bagoas, a Persian eunuch. There is an interesting love triangle between the men portrayed in the book. This is a very touching autobiography of Bagoas from his beginnings forced into slavery up until the death of his lover Alexander. The scene of Alexander's death will move most to tears. Historical novelization doesn't get better than this."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"This is a wonderful historical novel set in the days of Alexander the Great. It's tender, firey, informative and interesting all at the same time."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"&quot;The Persian Boy&quot; was the first Mary Renault book I ever read and so began my obssession with Renault and all that is Alexander and ancient Greece. Brilliantly written---I felt as if I were there right along with the Great Alexander and his male concubine as he conquered Asia minor. I have never been so captivated by an author and her books and I've yet to read anyone who could rival Renault's command of history, human psychology and language. This was the best, most memorable journey a book has ever taken me."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"This is the story of the beautiful Persian boy who survives the murder of his parents the destruction of his home and the enslavement and mutilation of his body.

It brings the ancient world to life."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Breathtaking portrayal of two human souls."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"The late author had a way of making you feel that she lived in Greece during the time of the Great Alexander.

I love slash, and will read pretty much any book that focuses on a m/m relationship. So, I read &quot;The Persian Boy,&quot; because it is the slasher's equivalent to fantasy's &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;(By the way, if you haven't got a clue what I'm talking about, what with the slasher-talk and all, just skip this review.)The horrible truth of the matter is that just as every fantasy fan will swear that LotR was what got them into fantasy, and that it changed their life, yadda yadda yadda, every slash fan out there will declare that &quot;The Persian Boy&quot; is lush, beautiful poetic, the definative work on a real-life m/m relationship...so on and so forth. And, like LotR, half of them are lying through their teeth.Oh, yes. You know who you are. You think that LotR's only redeeming feature is that Orlando Bloom was in it. You utterly failed to see the grand mythic beauty in it. Instead, you saw the grand mythic boredom. Well, &quot;The Persian Boy&quot; is a lot like that. You pick it up thinking, &quot;Yay! Boysmut!&quot; and instead find an endless tale of Alexander the Great's military conquests and daily life in an army camp.Oh, the book TOTALLY has its moments. Bagoas, our protagonist, is very smart and a little bitchy, which of course makes for a great narration. And if you are interested in the history behind Alexander, then this is a fine book for you. The writing is gorgeous, if a little purple for my personal taste. The author clearly knows her stuff, and, more importantly, knows how to tell a good story, so the book is most definately enjoyable on that level.Basically, before you run out and buy this book, know why you want to read it, and, if you have any doubts, check it out in your local library first. I wish I had. I'm not sorry I read it, but it really wasn't to my usual taste."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Hollywood is probably the first one to introduce Alexander the Great into the public consciousness. Unfortunately, they are NEVER good at maintaining historical accuracy. This book respects the integrity of the man behind the legend. At the same time, it succeeds in telling an entertaining story."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"This book is very good. It is historical accurate about the fall of the Persian Empire. At the beginning of the book, it is very long but detail of the main character and his past life. It has a great detail of his new life and how he must live. You can really relate to the character because he has an array of emotions and other strong feelings. The book makes you feel that your are their because the main character describes all the battles and the palaces and the situation he in to survive and meet new friendsI give this book to thumbs up for being really detailed and a great connection with the main character"},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Among all the Renault's books, The Persian Boy is my least favorite. I don't know why Renault had put Bagoas in such an important position, which seems to me, belonged to Hephaistion. Moreover, such a perspective of a favorite eunuch narrowed the depiction of Alexander the Great. In this book we see much about how Alexander behaved in chamber, but lost more about how he fighted in battles, how he made decisions with his generals, as well as how he fulfilled his ambitions step by step. In my opinion, it might have been better if Renault had chosen Hephaistion as the focus of this book.&Egrave;&Eacute;&uacute;&Egrave;&Ouml;&Egrave;&Eacute;&Egrave;&iexcl;&Egrave;&auml;&Egrave;'&Egrave;&Auml;&Egrave;'&Agrave;&Egrave;&Auml;&Ograve;&auml;&iexcl;&Eacute;&Oacute;&uuml;&Agrave;&aacute;&Oacute;&Aacute;&Aacute;&Ouml;&iexcl;&Egrave;&iexcl;&Ograve;&Ograve;&Agrave;&Eacute;&Egrave;&Ograve;&iacute;&Aacute;&Ouml;&Egrave;&iexcl;"},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"I've always enjoyed Renault's novels, and though this one is not my favorite, its atmospheric and character descriptions hold up well. My real concern is over the depiction of Alexander. Renault is not to be blamed here--it is historians who created Alexander's image--but she further embellishes and glorifies Alexander's &quot;mystical&quot; image and his alleged humanitarian and cosmopolitan interest in various cultures and peoples. The historical evidence is not so pretty. In the last ten years or so, historians have begun to come clean about Alexander's real accomplishments and legacy, and the real character behind them. Alexander was a ruthless butcher of the highest order, slaughtering large numbers of people and depopulating whole areas he campaigned in. He probably killed well over 1.5 million people over his 10 years of campaigning (Julius Ceasar probably killed about 1 million Gauls out of an estimated population of 5 million in his 10 year campaign-he has never, however, had a popular image as a great mystical &quot;visionary&quot; and enlightened world leader). This killing was done without bombs, machine guns or poison gas--mostly close in with swords (and later famine due to destroyed crops). He was as harsh with his own people. His megolomania and overwheening will mixed with drunken, ungovernable rages led him to order the deaths of his closest friends and officers, one of which he strangled with his own hands. It was probably well for the ancient world that Alexander died at 33 (mostly attributable to his own excesses). Remember this when Renault's character portrayal of Alexander become misty and glowing."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"and an excellent introduction to Alexander himself. As another reviewer said, it's such a good book, you don't want it to end."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"This novel was perhaps a landmark at the time of its publication because of its home-erotic references to Alexander. Since then we have had much made of this aspect of his character, so i think the novelty has worn off a bit. Mary Renault is a gifted writer, and her prose is both picturesque and compelling, but this work is a hard go even for someone interested in Alexander! The story moves slowly. The narrator, a enuch who happens to be named Bagoas, provides a more sympathetic account of who this person really was. The real Bagoas was not killed by Darius, and he proved to be an evil, insidious influence for both Alexander and Darius. This Bagoas is full of longings and pathos, which gets really tiring after a while. Also, his/her longings for sex with Alexander, no matter how tastefully done, can be somewhat revolting to some readers. The constant references to his wearing sexy loin-clothes and long hair to perform errotic male dances is both annoying and disquesting at the same time!What this novel does show was how wide and perverse sexual habbits were at this time, and how women often featured very little in them! At least in the circles of the ruling elites. We do get some inferences of Alexander's character, which offer some interest, and this can be what makes good historical fiction worthwhile if it paints a convincing portrait of a famous person and his time. Still, no matter how you slice it this is slow, tedious read. This book is probably more suited to gay readers than those really interested in Alexander's life and times. For me Alexander has so many more fascinating aspects to his career besides just his sexual habbits which seem to be the real interest for the recent fascination in him lately. The equally slow moving Oliver Stone epic marches at about the same tedious pace as this novel. I'll bet the producers read it at their bedside."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"This book had its use, contained accurate macro historical accounts, but one has to sift through all the petty concerns of the gay eunuch's affections and jealousies towards Alexander the Great, all of which the homosexual readers will enjoy very much though. Not that there is anything wrong with that for those who play on the other team. Just that I wasn't able to enjoy it as they can since I don't play on that team. More like a dysfunctional soap opera in relation to contemporary western culture. Not much action in terms of battle scenes. The book makes a great reference on the topic of Boy Love in the ancient world."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Read all of the Alexander series but was always partial to this one. My heart went out to Bagoas and his dedication to Alexander was exceptional. A great read."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"I have been searching forever for a well-written book with gay romance, but it has proven more difficult than I thought at first.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"No other way to describe this treasure of a book. Her words are silk and fire and all the treasures in between.Very few authors, in my opinion, master the true beauty of a written word and make you feel as their heroes feel.Mary Renault does.Read this amazing book, you'll thank me when you do.\\"My namesake had died, as my father promised me; but he had died too late for me, and for all the sons of my sons.\\""},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"I'm not a big fan of Bagoas, but I really enjoyed reading this novel about the personal life of Alexander the Great from his triumphal entrance into Babylon until his death. The historical Alexander did indeed have a personal magnetism that inspired love in so many people. This novel fully explores that. Page 179 describes Alexander reading the Iliad to Bagoas and describing the love between Achilles and Patroklos, and Bagoas says, \\"He [Alexander] did not tell it with art, like the taletellers in the market, but as if he had been there and remembered everything. At last I knew where my rival [Hephaestion] stood, grafted into his spirit, deeper than any memories of the flesh.\\". Pages 328-329 describe what could have happened on the crossing of the Gredosian desert, when Hephaestion goes back to save Bagoas from death and asks Bagoas to look after Alexander. When Bagoas tells Alexander about it, the King says, \\"That is Hephaestion; it always has been.\\"; and it was as if he closed again the curtain guarding a shrine.\\" Pages 383 and 384 describe Alexander's grief after Hephaestion's death. \\"I [Bagoas] thought, He [Alexander] has rebuilt the legend in everlasting bronze. He will keep faith with it, if he lives to threescore and ten. Hephaestion's regiment is always to bear his name whoever may command it, just so he will be forever Alexander's lover; no one else will ever hear, \\"I love you best.\\" \\"The Persian Boy\\" also describes the love and respect that Bagoas felt for Alexander, and that is very touching. I don't read many novels, but this one is worth the time and money."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"The narrator of _The Persian Boy_ is Bagoas, once owned by Persian King Darius then later given to Alexander of Macedon, better known in history as Alexander the Great. Bagoas was granted to Alexander as a spoil of a battle won by Alexander. Bagoas is a eunuch, castrated as a young boy so that he would always retain his youthful beauty.Bagoas becomes Alexander's lover, companion, and advisor, in as much as Bagoas becomes the one individual Alexander can always trust. If Alexander desired to hear the truth no matter what the consequences, he could always turn to Bagoas. In return, Bagoas who greatly needed affection could usually depend upon Alexander for this. A huge rivalry forms between Bagoas and Hephaiston, Alexander's long time lover. It says much about Bagoas that he respects Alexander's primary relationship and never acts to betray Hephaiston. Alexander marries Roxane, whom Alexander meets as one of the female dancers who perform for him. Despite his lack of interest in women, as ruler of Macedon and other areas, there is the necessity of providing an heir to the throne were Alexander to die.Ms. Renault portrays Alexander as a very brave and loyal man, albeit a man with a huge temper. Alexander is also a heavy wine drinker, which later is a detriment to him. Alexander arranges for the granting of doweries to all the unmarried soldiers serving in his army. He also provides theatrical performances and funeral games for his men. Several very ornate funerals are portrayed in the book. Alexander also forms an alliance with the Persian leadership simply because Alexander grows to love the Persian people. We learn that Alexander has earned the love and loyalty of his men who wish to comfort Alexander during a particularly bad time for him.While the book is an easy read, it is often rather a slow-going read. Several battles occur in which Alexander is involved, but Ms. Renault barely recounts these battles to the reader. We know that Alexander has taken part in these battles only because Alexander receives a rather nasty lance wound in one of them. All in all, _The Persian Boy_ succeeds more as history but disappoints as a work of action."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Years ago, I discovered Mary Renault when we read The Nature of Alexander for a Greek History class. I marvled at her work then, and again, at this novel. Regardless of how much of it is &quot;historically accurate&quot; (which I believe is much more than some of these other reviewers think) the novel is amazingly well crafted and more than once brought me to the verge of tears just for the sheer joy it inspired. Many comment on the &quot;homosexual&quot; aspects and argue that it didn't exist, or wasn't true while neglecting to remember that in that time the onus of homosexuality didn't exist. It was a fact of life then and accepted readily. Renault does a fabulous job of doing this book and these characters justice. This is a definate must read."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"History tells us much about the conquests of Alexander the Great, whose military campaigns brought virtually all the world he knew under his domination. And history even hits of his relationship with Bagoas, a Persian slave who became the emperor's love! But it takes a work of imagination to breath life and passion into this age-old tale. Mary Renault has provided that imagination in a moving and convincing novel that follows Bagoas from the home of his honored father to a life of degradation and whoredom and finally to the bed of the most powerful man of the ancient era."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"I loved this book! I couldn't put it down, so I ended up reading from about 11 pm to 6 am. This is probably the first real historical fiction I've ever read, and it's made me hungry for more. ::grins:: The characters were believable, if Renaults portrayal of the times/societies were correct. I loved Bagoas' \\"voice\\", and his absolute devotion and love he develops for Alexander. You see Alexander's transformation from Macedonian 'boy' to Great King, and his devotion to his soldiers, the Persians, and his dream. The respect the Persians have for Alexander, because of his desire and attempts to keep them equal with the Macedonians, becomes more and more obvious later in the book. The story telling is lush and gripping for the most part. While sometimes the story pacing felt a little slow, it wasn't enough to damage my enjoyment of the book. I haven't got the first or third books yet, but I will as soon as I can scrape some money together. [Because so many of the sources that could have been considered mostly reliable have been lost or damaged beyond what current technology can fix, we can only speculate based on biased anti-Alexander sources (Like the Athenians) what Alexander may have really been like. But if you'd like a glimpse of what such a widely known historical figure may have been like, to see Alexander and the people he was involved with as real people, I highly recommend this book.]"},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"It's hard to know how to express how much I have enjoyed just readingthis marvelous book. It will always be one of my all time favorites;an experience I won't forget.The novel is highly educational, as it IS AN HISTORICAL one,and learning about the ancient peoples and geography it coverswas a real learning experience for me.The character portrayals and developments in the book made mefeel like I was with real people in real life, and I will remember them.After just finishing this book along with Barbara Olson's\\"The Final Days\\" (I highly recommend reading several booksconcurrently; a habit I learned from my great cousin who washead of a well known college's history department) I feel I havebeen exposed to the heights and depts of character qualities.Alexander was extraordinary in his leadership characteristics,and the extreme inversion of those ideals are painfully elucidatedin Barbara Olson's book.Rating: 5/5 10/10"},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"...and that, my friend, is saying something, because Mary Renault happens to be among the top writers of the 20th century, though her praises remain unsung in the Ivory Halls precisely because of her literary virtues. I love her prose for being crisp, concise, and clear; qualities which deny her laurels in academia because professors need cryptic symbolism to build thesises upon... a la James Joyce, ad nauseum.Yet for all her readability, Mary Renault is not without elegance or depth; subtle in turns, and with an often ironic sense of humor. She is no prude and does not blush at human sexuality and homosexuality, but neither does she dwell in these areas. She is a fully integrated human being, something rare for a 20th century writer. So many of our writers have been mad, hung up, obsessed, in the closet, or prudish, and frankly most of their output can be submitted to the flames with no net loss for world literature. Not so with Mary Renault: she is timeless.Her trilogy on Alexander the Great remains to be improved upon. So far she has no competitors, which is a taunting irony, considering she is a woman who wrote about a great military conqueror, ordinarily a masculine ideal. Alfredo Manfredi's feeble trilogy proved woefully inadequate to the task.\\"The Persian Boy\\" is about the best you can hope for in regards to ancient historical novels. Our hero/anti-hero Gore Vidal gave it a good review too when it came out decades ago.Alfredo Manfredi owes me $40 for ripping me off with his sorry, $45, half-buttock attempt at novel writing. I got a laughable $5 for his pathetic three book series on E-bay.Today's authors need to sit in a classroom for several months and study Mary Renault's prose, paragraph by paragraph. I have yet to find any that can match her."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Robert Lipsyte, who wrote some wonderful novels himself, said in a column that his father gave him this book to read one weekend. After putting it off, he finally gave in and was hooked from the first sentence. Mary Renault casts a spell from the first in \\"The Persian Boy\\", the pivot of her Alexandriad.Bagoas is born into an aristocratic family; the turmoil following the death of King Ochos claims his father, mother and sisters, and he himself is castrated and sold at the age of 10. The twin horrors are followed in time by another; Bagoas is himself sold by his master to other men as a prostitute. Procured for King Darius, Bagoas's lot changes only slightly; instead of being sold to many men, he is kept by one man, a King he holds in awe for his station, and not out of personal admiration.Darius has made the mistake of underestimating the young Macedonian King Alexander, who at 20 undertakes the reconquest of Greek cities in Asia Minor. But Alexander closes in on the Persian Empire, and Darius suffers one defeat after another until his own warlords lose faith in him. When a coup sees Darius taken prisoner, Bagoas escapes with only his life. In time he is rescued by one of those warlords, who decides to beg Alexander for clemency. Who does he bring to sweeten the plea? Bagoas--as a gift.Alexander is presented by Renault as a man capable of more than mortal feats who is still reassuringly human--more than that, he needs love desperately, from the hero-worship of the soldiers who follow him to the intimate devotion of his lover Hephaistion. Bagoas has never known love at all, only use. When Macedonian King and Persian courtesan meet, the inevitable happens--and this is where the enchantment begins.Renault's mastery is impeccable. With a few well-chosen words, she conjures the images of the great Persian palaces--the ruins at Persepolis, Susa, Ekbatana, and Babylon; she recreates the travels of the Macedonian army so well that any reader who picks up her companion book \\"The Nature of Alexander\\" will look at the pictures and exclaim, \\"I know this! This is--\\" and name the very scene. But it is her characters that truly live. Bagoas is keenly intelligent, charming, courtly, sarcastic, prey to jealousy and possessiveness when it comes to his lover; his growing maturity merely adds to the pain he experiences as the affair and Alexander's conquests progress. And Alexander is much more accessible here than in \\"Fire From Heaven,\\" which is a wonderful book but presents Alexander as all light and no fire. Here we get to see Alexander as preening boy, heroic warrior, pragmatic king, and devoted lover. It is a marvelous love story whether or not it actually happened.But the emotional payoffs of the affair are balanced by hideous tragedies, none more affecting than the death of Hephaistion. Bagoas' quiet desperation to keep Alexander with the sane and living is agonizing with the knowledge that Alexander did not survive his lover by more than three months. Renault foreshadows without laying it on too thick, but it's worth noting that the portents of Alexander's death were recorded by historians, and the ancients paid close attention to that sort of thing. The final quarter of the book is grim, with only a few moments of light, and the most poignant moment is when Bagoas, having kept watch over Alexander even after his death, finally gives way to the Egyptian priests who come to embalm the Macedonian.It isn't all romance and grief. Bagoas is, after all, only sixteen when the affair starts; he's prey to insecurity about his place in Alexander's heart, and his two antagonists are Hephaistion, Alexander's lifelong love, and Roxane, the legendary beauty who becomes Alexander's wife. With Hephaistion, Bagoas indulges in the sort of reverie that anyone who's ever had a romantic rival can identify with (stopping short of cutting him into little pieces and feeding him to the dogs). Roxane, on the other hand, earns Bagoas' hatred for good reason, and she is presented as everything Hephaistion isn't: clinging, vindictive, and devouring. Bagoas wryly notes that Alexander has, like most men, married a woman like his mother, and it's asides like this from him that make the story such an indulgent treat to read.Like other reviewers, I will say that if you despise homosexuality and homosexuals, don't pick up the book. But if you can put aside prejudices and read for the sheer pleasure of encountering excellence in writing and losing yourself in another place and time, \\"The Persian Boy\\" is still in print."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"\\"The Persian Boy\\" is the second book in Mary Renault's Alexander trilogy and it's by far the best of the three, probably because Renault did a total shift in narrative and style and continued the story in the first person. When Renault writes in the first person, something magical happens; we're so totally caught up in the action that we're inside the book, not only watching but feeling it come alive.Renault realizes that Alexander underwent a fundamental transformation on becoming Great King after defeating Darius at Gaugamela; he was no longer the king of Macedon but king of most of the known world, most of whose inhabitants were considered by Macedonians to be \\"barbarians\\", and she chose to tell her story through the eyes of one of them, the Persian eunuch Bagoas, an actual historical character of whom next to nothing is known except that he had been sold to Darius in childhood as a slave and after Darius's final defeat at Gaugamela was passed on to Alexander. He must have made the most of his position as the historian Aristobulos wrote about Bagoas six years afterwards, when he was evidently still in Alexander's good graces, and had probably seen and heard a great deal.Renault had to fabricate almost all of Bagoas's own story; we see him as the beautiful child of a Persian nobleman who was betrayed and executed; sold into slavery and castrated to preserve his exquisite good looks, and then presented to Darius, standing by his king and seeing him betrayed and murdered by his own men after his defeat by Alexander, and then being passed on to this strange young Macedonian who looked more like a barbarian than the Persians looked to the Macedonians. Renault's choice of a Persian narrator was inspired; who else could have told from a sympathetic viewpoint about Alexander's growing identification with his conquered subjects, and his insistence in finding excellence in people of all races and nationalities, when most Macedonians considered Persians as little more than subhuman? Bagoas's love for Alexander doesn't blind him to Alexander's faults; he gives us Alexander warts and all; his overwhelming ego and conceit which must have driven his best friends up the wall; his hot temper and intemperance which led him to kill a trusted officer in a drunken rage, and the lack of moderation which made him a candle burning at both ends and ultimately burned him out. And although Bagoas must have hated Hephaistion in real life and the feeling was probably mutual, he can still realize that Hephaistion's death removed a vital prop in Alexander's life and left him not only bereft, but with a vital part of himself gone without which he could no longer live.\\"The Persian Boy\\" brings us the ancient world from Asia Minor to India and makes it so incredibly alive that we hate to close the book and return, reluctantly, to the ho-hum present. It's a glowing, vivid work of art.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Mary Renault initially captured my attention with Fire From Heaven, the first of the Alexander novels, and gave new life to this revered warrior and hero. But with The Persian Boy, as told through the eyes of Bagoas, a slave boy who becomes confidant, advisor, and lover to Alexander, she humanizes this historical figure even further, and gives him attributes that the history books neglect, those of a man. She probes his mind, as witnessed by the eyes of adoring Bagoas, who first reveres Alexander as his master, and then dotes upon him as lover. Bagoas remains faithful to Alexander through months of separation during the conquest of Greece, and stands by his side despite treacherous efforts to discredit and dethrone his King, through Alexander's 'relationship' with his boyhood companion Hephaistion, and his 'marriage of convenience' to Roxane.This novel, while it appealed to me on a romantic level, also exemplifies the nature of love, be it between man and woman, or man and man, as a fevered, passionate longing for another, a sense of loyalty to them and to your relationship with them, during hard months of separation, and a desire to do anything to please and/or comfort them. However, the book also accurately recreates Alexander's journey of seige across Greece, and the hardships he and his followers endured. Readers would be hard pressed to find a more descriptive and honest look at Alexander the Great as a flesh and blood creature, and not just the conquering hero of many bloody battles which history books offer us."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"One of the reviewers said, &quot;excellent portrayal of two human souls&quot;. I fully agree.Alexander is interpreted differently today from historian to historian; I must confess that after reading Fire from Heaven and the Persian Boy, I'm forever captured. I've tried to read less adoring interpretations, only to get angry at the authors. This is not to say that Mrs Renault's view is the only legitimate one, but it is so powerful and convincing and human that it is hard to set aside.As always, the tale she tells rings true and has meaning. Bagoas isn't only a Watson, here to tell us about Sherlock Holmes. He is a deeply human character in his own light. For a hundred pages, we see Alexander only from what he hears about him, while he is enslaved and used as plaything, then comes to the service of Darius. It has been a long time since I have felt so strongly for a character's misery, and felt so happy when he found love, and as always, Mrs Renault does it beautifully, with a word here and there, never vulgar, never too close, always with that deep sense of decency all her major characters posess.I found this one vastly better than Fire of Heaven, by the way. As to the historical &quot;truth&quot; behind it all, it is well researched, and if you don't like her portrayal of Alexander's character (or if it rings too good to be true), you still get a wonderful book and a great story, and are treated to an excellent work that stands far above other historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Deeply moving, and unfailingly historically accurate, this story of the young castrated lover of Alexander the Great is surprisingly educational in today's world because it talks about East and West. Through the eyes of \\"the Persian boy,\\" we come to understand a gulf between mindsets that has not been bridged even to the present time. But you don't think about these things when you're reading Mary Renault's smooth and beautiful prose. You're swept up in the story and above all else, in her fully realized characters. Alexander the Great and his youthful brashness become completely real to you. You imbibe the history. That's how Mary Renault wanted it and she was marvelously accomplished at her task. You take away with you an emotional experience of this incalculably important period of time -- when Alexander through sheer will and conviction brought Hellenism, that is Greek philosophy and ideas to foreign territories all along the Mediterranean coast laying the ground for a way of life which we are still to this day enjoying -- and your comprehension of the sequence of events is forever deepened. Renault's The Last of the Wine brings to life ancient Athens in the same rich and unforgettable manner. Both are sad novels in a way, but sadness with Renault can be very sweet and very rewarding. Highly recommended. The best seller lists of today seldom include such literate and substantial and enduring novels."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Ahh, The Persian Boy!As most have stated: this book is sublime. Many more scholarly reviewers have discussed themes that bring this story up from the level of mere historical novel. We are treated to a story about fear, hatred, violence, revenge, honor, courage, devotion. But - most clearly - undiluted love. A marvel. And, its great fun too! A real page-turner. Where is the blockbuster Hollywood treatment?I chuckle at the references from my fellow readers about the homosexual content and how \\"it is not too offensive\\" to the gentle reader. Some people can be so silly.Surrounded by rape and pillage - this story of homosexual love is a joy to behold. Pity modern society could not be more like our so-called primative forebearers in this regard!(This paperback version is small enough to carry to the beach and on the bus yet beautiful enough to give as a gift.)"},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Not being a classicist at the time, I was a little discouraged when I first picked up _The Persian Boy_. Forty pages in, and I couldn't keep names like Nabarzanes, Orxines, and Oxathres straight in my mind. However, Renault's thoughtful, unpretentious prose and her ability to evoke that *perfect* image soon had me - to use a tired but appropriate term - hooked. Bagoas' narrative is infused with devotion and youthful foolishness, recounting Alexander's triumphs and blunders with a refreshing endearment. This book has occasionally come under fire from Alexander-buffs, who accuse it of being a rather romanticized account of the tale. But of *course* it's romanticized! What one must bear in mind, though, is that this is a romanticization that takes care not to transgress the facts. Renault has done her research, and her blend of humanity and historical detail resurrect - through the eyes of lovesick Bagoas - an Alexander both winsome and sad. This book is a humble gem, and one that leaves the reader with a comforting message, that yes, it's all right to believe in heroes."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Though a romantic vision of Alexander, it is well put together and closer to historical truth than most. Having read many of the ancient sources on Alexander, including Arrian, Plutarch, Curtius, it is evident that the negative accounts come from Curtius who shows himself to be unreliable as a historian, embellishing and fabricating wherever it pleases him (its bias shows In the Footsteps..., which is sadly not very reliably researched). Renault follows mostly Arrian who used Ptolemy I as his main source (and who was a member of Alexander's expedition). Alexander was insatiable and self-destructive in his quest for glory, competing with as his rival, the hero Achilles, and therein lies the human interest in his life's story. His passion for conquest should not be judged by today's moral standards. It is absurd to assume that Alexander if he were alive today would go about conquering nations - just as preposterous as it is to think that we would be prostrating ourselves in front of him, believing he was the son of Zeus. His conscience was shaped by Aristotle among others, who though one of the greatest thinkers of his day, was also subject to the era's ideological shortcomings. My only criticism of Renault would be that the role of Bagoas, should be credited to Hephaistion, but as a fictional device it works well to propagate the Persian side of things."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Alexander the Great, one of the world's most admired and respected military men and Great King of Persia, died at age 33. In the prime of youth, he conquered much of the then-known world, receiving homage and love from his subjects from India to Greece because of his justice and mercy, and respect and admiration from his men because of his military genius and remarkable ability to lead men of all nations and tribes. The Persian Boy tells his story, and that of the ancient world through the eyes of Bagoas, a boy captured and made a slave and eunuch at age 10. Bagoas's legendary beauty set him apart for advancement, and his intelligence and integrity made him a fitting partner for such a man as Alexander. Male relationships were accepted as natural in Alexander's times and his long connection with Bagoas is historical. Through Bagoas's eyes, we come to know Alexander and his world, to appreciate the sensual nature of one of history's greatest warriers. That man could be at once loving and ferocious, gentle and vengeful and be loved and admired by thousands hints at a crack in modern sensibilities that smacks of prejudice and fear. This is an interesting story both in the historical and narrative sense, It conjures images of opulence and glory unknown in modern times and modern warfare. Jewels and gold, spices and incense were prized gifts and treasures both for mortals and the Immortals. In a time when Greek gods, Mithra, and the Hindu trinity ruled the earth, religion was moral and ethical and structured by rules of omens and ritual sacrifice. The ancient world offers much to modern society in terms of moral and ethical thought and behavior. Perhaps it is time to look back instead of forward to learn the meaning of existence."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Let me just say that 'The Persian Boy' is a great book. Mary Renault is an excellent writer, and she managed to chew through the history of Alexander with excellent pacing and in such a way as to keep even war-wary reader entertained.However, I often felt frustrated while reading this book because of the set POV. In 'Fire From Heaven', Book I in her Alexander the Great series, we have a POV which jumps from character to character throughout the novel, giving a wide view of the events and a greater understanding of how different people came to see Alexander.In 'The Persian Boy' we get the POV of Bagoas, Alexander's eunuch lover, and after reading 'Fire From Heaven' the restricted experiences/opinions of this one character is extremely noticeable. I found myself frustrated at the \\"off camera\\" scenes in which we miss because Bagoas is not present, especially those involving Alexander and Hephaestion, his life-long best friend and lover.Because Bagoas is competition to Hephaestion, we get a new view of the relationship between these two men, but we also get a limited one. Of course Bagoas is not going to be present during the more intimate exchanges between Alexander and Hephaestion, so the book simply doesn't go over it - Alexander and Hephaestion's relationship is relegated to \\"and then he spoke with Hephaestion for a time\\" one-liners, giving us very little beyond the affirmation that Hephaestion still exists.I often had to put the book down and take a breath when certain pivotal moments occured within the novel that were wrongly glazed over because the character of Bagoas simply didn't care, or wasn't present.I suppose I went in with an Hephaestion-bias - I do love him so - but besides my grumblings, the book really was well written, though I wish a parellel novel existed telling the same story from Hephaestion's angle!"},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"The book took the reader on a vivid journey of love...lovers and beloved. Love for a living legend. He had so love to give and receive.It took the reader on a journey with Alexander through battles on the ground and battles in the heart.A deposed prince who was forced to become a eunuch. It was hard going in the beginning, but he found King Darius and it seems his good training was preparing him for the best years of his life and the last eight years of Alexander's life.Although he finally found love in Alexander's arms, he resented the fact that he had to share Alexander's love with Hephaestion... who took up the rest of Alexander's heart. At one point Bagoas thought about killing Hephaestion but his love for Alexander stopped him. He couldn't bear to think about Alexander being sad.When Hephaestion died, it was at that point that Bagoas wished it was him in order that he would not see Alexander's inconsolable grief.This kind of love for Alexander comes not only from Bagoa, Hephaestion, but his troops and other kings he conquered."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"I absolutely LOVE this book! I'm so glad I bought it. I became interested in Alexander the great recently and have been studying about him. Then a while ago, I watched the movie Alexander, I took an interest in the character Bagoas which led me to this book.I loved the way Mary Renault has written this book, he descriptions were so vivid it's almost like watching a movie, I can't help but feel sadness, pity, anger, amusement and embarrassment through Bagoas's own experiences.This book definitely worth your time!"},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"I have just been reading through reviews (positive & negative) of Oliver Stone's attempt to \\"do\\" Alexander the Great.

If you want to understand Ancient Greece, read Mary Renault.Oliver Stone does not even come close.\\"The Persian Boy\\" is one of the best romantic novels ever written. It is thrilling and exciting stuff from beginning to end. And it is, fundamentally, as true a story we can expect about a man who has been dead for almost three thousand years. This wonderful novel will expand your mind; watching the Oliver Stone movie will make it shrink. It's just that simple."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Mary Renault's The Persian Boy does much...it fills in many of the mysteries surrounding Alexander's love for Bagoas, the Persian manservant...and it also, in many ways, enriches the already rich Oliver Stone film of 2004. It's a beautiful read that puts you at once into the thick of battle and them, seemlessly, into the bed chambers and council chambers of some of antiquities great leaders. No one was, of course, there...so it is all somewhat speculation...yet this book takes what I like to call 'Educated Guesses' and runs with them. It's both moving and literate...and a nice quick read...or rather it seems a quick read...which is the best recommendation any book can have."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"This scandalous work, banned in many American libraries on first issuance (really!) because of its unflinching imaginary depiction of man/eunuch love is... unflinchingly windy. Really. Alexander conquers, and conquers. People love him. And really love him. He travels to India. He travels into a desert. He sees the sea. He is followed by someone with a goofy name who loves him, physically, somehow (although Mary never tells us how) with a love which will not tell its name, although it doesn't have to, as this was all several thousand years ago, and made up, anyway.So is it worth it? MR really can turn a phrase, and she, though not a classicist, read all that was translated into English (and perhaps French) about Alexander. But what we have is a travelogue disguised as a love story. I picked it up because it created such a stir in the '70's, and I was curious. It kept my attention through the end: MR was good at her craft. So... fun. But great literature, or inspiring, or even educational? I think not. Got twelve hours to spend on a plane, or its raining outside, or have the flu and can't concentrate on Spinoza (or Shakespeare?) Then pick it up and enjoy the guilty pleasure. Think your time would probably be better spent elsewhere? Well, it's up to you, but then, wouldn't you like to amaze your friends with a second-hand knowledge of the land of Hrykania? If so, find it here."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"If only other female writers had as much understanding of the gay male psyche as Mary Renault. This is a superb rendering of the life of Alexander the Great and like all of Miss Renault's historical novels is realised with consummate ease and supreme ability. Superb!"},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"The Persian Boy is a riviting narrative of the last seven years of Alexander the Great as told by the beautiful slave-eunuch Bogoas (a real historical person),who had been the plaything of Darias the Persian King until the Persian Empire crumbled with the brilliant invasion and victory of Alexander at the battle of Guagamela. After the King's death Bagoas is rescued by a rebel satrap who is out of favor with Alexander and uses the beautiful boy as a peace offering to get back in Alexander's good graces.Alexander, in spite of his military genius, is innocent in the ways of love and in profound need of affection, which Bogoas, who is irresistibly attracted to Alexander,and sophisticated far beyond his years, is more than happy to give.The saga is a vivid picture of the conqueror and his world, rich in historical detail as well as stirring human involvement. The beautiful eunuch's devotion to Alexander to the very end is deeply touching."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"I loved this book the first time I read it rwo years ago. I'm a hopeless romantic. I've always been fascinated by Alexander, and have managed to seperate Renault's idealist veiw from reality. Still, it is a wonderful book. For anyone else wanting to learn about the historical Alexander I suggest you read IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF ALEXANDER. I forget who it's by, but it goes along with a PBS documentary by the same name. Both are utterly fascinating."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"For me this has always been the weakest and least likeable of Mary Renault's Alexander trilogy, and for exactly the reason several other reviews touch on. Hephaistion in Fire from Heaven was such a real and vibrant character that my heart breaks every time he loses Alexander to Bagoas in the Persian Boy. I suppose it is a measure of how well written the book really is though that I still keep on reading it. This book, set in the middle years of Alexander's campaigns, manages to tell both sides of the story, recreating graphically both the crumbling civilisation of the Persian Empire, collapsing under its own weight and the onslaught of a terrifying and strange foreigner; and then the world of the Macedonians and Greeks, strangers in a land far from home, led only by the will of that same strange man, who most of them understand little better than the Persians do. Read this book, you will enjoy it, but make sure you read the other two parts as well, they're even better."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Pros: How can I list them all? The writing is eloquent, lush, and yet very readable. The story is gripping and the romance touching. The book somehow gets you to understand a supremely different time and different places without long explanations. Bagoas is a wonderful character.Cons: I can't think of much. The ending is very abrupt.I actually feel lucky to have discovered this book. \\"The Persian Boy\\" tells the story of Bagoas, a eunuch and the historical lover of Alexander the Great. In the book, he is taken in deadly attack on his family. At the age of ten, he is castrated and sold into slavery. He has a hard time of it until he becomes the kept boy of Darius and later the lover of Alexander. Bagoas is an incredibly loveable character. Both vulnerable and hard, he wishes for the life he could have had if he were not castrated even as he is grateful for his life with Alexander. He obeys Alexander unquestioningly even as he worries over some his decisions and mourns his relationships with Hephaistion and Roxanne. Bagoas is a beautiful and complex character and the fact that the story is narrated through his point of view gives it much of its charm.As a historical novel, The Persian Boy really shines. Somehow, the novel manages to make you understand ancient Greece and Persia, two cultures so different from our own, without dumping too much information on the reader. Mary Renault really has a talent for giving just the appropriate information as she goes. It is also worth noting that the author's attitudes are never intrusive in the story. Bagoas has most the prejudices of his era, though his relationship with Alexander and his status as a slave lessens some of them. Some will think the book far too sympathetic toward Alexander, but it is sympathetic because this is how Bagoas feels and actually makes a lot of sense. The first person point of view lends a lot to Bagoas' perspective and the style in general is just so rich.In the end, Bagoas' love for Alexander is at times touching and at times heartbreaking. Even if you love the Alexander/Hephaistion dynamic, it is hard not to sympathize with Bagoas who is so completely in love with a man who (at least in Renault's books) so deserves to be loved.I know that this is such a gushing review, but I truly mean it when I say that this is the best book I've read in years. The only problem I can think of is that the ending feels very abrupt -- like the story just stops instead of truly ending.I read \\"The Persian Boy\\" before \\"Fire from Heaven\\" and can tell you that it works very well as a stand alone novel. 5+ stars."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Before you see the two movies about Alexander the Great, especially the lush-looking Oliver Stone one (the exotic Angelina Jolie plays Alexander's mother), read this boo kas well as PLUTARCH'S LIVES, from which much of the good gossip about Alexander is taken.In Mary Renault's richly woven novel with words that conjure up ancient battlefields and royal boudoirs, Alexander the Great's sandal tracks come to us by way of his eunuch lover, Bagoas, who as a Persian has to contend with Greek arrogance, Alexander's marriage to Roxane, and most of all with Al's more educated lover Hephaestion--as Nathan Lane quipped in \\"The Birdcage,\\" \\"Talk about gays in the military!\\"Bagoas, torn from his family and without a formal education, nevertheless becomes a wise observer and chronicler of Alexander's exploits, and more importantly the very human side of the man.

It left an imprint in my mind, of the nature of love, heroism, honor, history, devotion, affection, and above all, talent. By talent, I refer to the author's: Renault has a gift for words that rivals Alexander's gift for war. Many writers are capable of telling interesting, engaging stories, and just as many are able to write lyrically and memorably. However, in my opinion, few writers are able to achieve both, and Renault belongs among this elite company. Her language resonates with beauty, grace, and vision. If The Persian Boy is hero worship, then so what. Whoever he was, Alexander is someone to be remembered, and Renault's novels are a lasting monument. If it is true that he possessed beauty, grace, and vision, then he deserves Renault's words."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"I wandered around in a library one afternoon and randomly picked up a book off the shelve.

Alexander, Bagoas, Hephaiston...are portrayed so vividly and so real that I could not put the book down until the very end. I can't help but wonder if there is such love in this age. If not, how unfortunate! Mary Renault's other books are just as romantic: Last of the Wine, The Nature of Alexander, Fire from Heaven, Funeral Games, The Charioteer...are all my favorites.

It is a fascinating story, rich in historical detail. Bagaos is a warm, vital character.

I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"This is a terrific book--certainly one of the best I have read in the past few years. It is the second (and best) book in Mary Renault's trilogy on the life of Alexander the Great. For people (like myself) who are largely ignorant of classical history, &quot;The Persian Boy&quot; is a user-friendly, extremely readable overview of the Greek world and the Hellenistic period. Readers should not be put-off by Alexander's homosexual relationship with his eunuch servant (who actually existed, by the way). Rather, enjoy this extremely compassionate and likeable character (Bagoas, the eunuch) and Mary Renault's artistry in bringing his love for Alexander alive. For military history fans, all the battles are here (the defeat of Darius at Issus, the Siege of Tyre, etc.), the famous quotes (&quot;So this is what it means to be king.&quot;), and the panoply of historical characters (Philip, Olympias, Ptolemy, Roxanne, and Oxhead the horse). &quot;The Persian Boy&quot; ignited in me a passion for ancient cultures; it is a very memorable book and I hightly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"I had to read this book for a research project and I loved it!

But whether Mary Renault's interpretation is the right one or not is beside the point. Her poertrayal is entirely convincing within the limits set by her, and her Alexander and his supporting caste is entirely convincing. Being true to the inner world of her novels makes her a great historical novelist. Hence I reccommend highly her trilogy (particularly this and the previous one). Those interested in a contrary interpretation should try Peter Green's biography 'Alexander of Macedon', also an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"I have not cried for 15 years. As I progessed with The Persian Boy, I could not stop crying. The perfect historical novel."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Mary Renault historical novels have achieved enduring recognition as a highly probably portrait of events in the ancient world. She was scrupulous in her research, and her novels remain faithful to all the known historical facts. She wrote a trilogy on the youthful conqueror, Alexander the Great. The first volume,Fire from Heaven, which I have previously reviewed, depicted Alexander's formative years. The third volume, aptly namedFuneral Games, describes the power struggles and division of Alexander's Empire after his death. This volume covers the period involving Alexander's military conquests which resulted in one of the largest empires the world has known, but only for a brief period. Renault utilizes one of the most unusual and amazing historical figures, the eunuch Bagoas, to tell this story.Bagoas drew one of the very bad cards in life, which regrettably happened with some frequency in the ancient world. In the turmoil of one of the power struggles in Persia, his family was on the losing side, and as punishment, the 10-year old Bagoas was castrated, and sold into prostitution. He was as \\"successful\\" as one can be in such a profession, becoming courtesan to King Darius. After Darius was defeated in battle, and killed, he managed the ultimate in transitions, becoming not only the courtesan, but the lover and confidant of Alexander. And this is at the age of 16. Imagine the deft footwork ( and more) in not only making the ultimate in transitions, but also managing to survive in the power struggles within Alexander's inner circle, which included two other lovers, Alexander's childhood companion, Hephaistion, as well as his wife, Roxane.Renault was a lesbian, and this trilogy was published shortly after the Stonewall riots in Greenwich village, in the late \`60's, which marked the beginning of a more tolerant view of homosexuality in the United States. Renault's carefully crafted portraits of homosexual love were embraced by the gay community, but she did not return the compliment since she did not want to be known, exclusively, as a \\"gay writer.\\" Pedophilia, of course, remains a matter of revulsion at virtually every level of American society, so it is truly to Renault's credit that she could tackle such a delicate subject, and portray the principals in a largely positive light.Sexuality though, is only a small part of the novel. The true achievement is the highly plausible, historically accurate recreation of the actions of Alexander and his inner circle in conquering much of the known ancient world. Concerning the issues that are not known with certainty, for example the causes of the deaths of Alexander and Hephaistion, Renault deliberately depicts them ambiguously in the novel. In the afterword, she states that Alexander probably was not poisoned, but, more prosaically, died of pneumonia. Hephaistion most likely succumbed to typhoid.Renault maintains a strong narrative thread throughout the novel. Her prose is concise and to the point. The trilogy has withstood four decades of scrutiny, and remains a valuable, essential tool for anyone seeking a better understanding of events towards the beginning of historical time. 5-stars."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"First of all, I could not identify with Bagoas. If I were castrated I would have wanted to kill myself. It gave me a feeling of disgust trying to read the sexual scenes. Why would a woman want to write about man-boy sex as though it were real love? I can't imagine. Man-boy love I can understand, but though it might involve admiration, I can not imagine it involving sexual desire. Ugh! Secondly, Alexander didn't come across to me as a real human being; he came across to me like one of those guys in one of the Harlequin romances, although as an unbelievable goody-goody. [...] Finally, I felt that I learned very little from this book as a 'historical' novel. After reading 150 pages, I decided there was no merit in reading any further. I decided to go to Wikipedia to look up about Alexander's homosexuality or bisexuality and it said that there was very little documentation of it, although it seemed surmisable that he was bisexual, that he loved women also, but that he was not highly sexed. [...]"},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"I had a hard time with this novel. To warn, I am extremely Hephaestion-biased. I love him to death. It took me a long time to pick \\"The Persian Boy\\" up at all because I felt like I was cheating. (silly, no?) Bagoas has his moments too and certainly this book stays true to his point-of-view. I knew that it would, being called \\"The Persian Boy,\\" but I wish it hadn't. Many things that were in my opinion very important were glossed over due to his limited POV. As another reviewer said, I wish there was a parallel from Hephaestian's POV or that the point-of-view shifted from character to character the way \\"Fire From Heaven\\" did - I found it a much more effective, well-rounded story. As for Bagoas himself, I too am fascinated by the idea of him... of what it must have been like to live his life, the ups and considerable downs of it. And I suppose that that was what so intrigued Ms. Renault into wanting to write \\"The Persian Boy\\" to begin with. So for what it is, \\"The Persian Boy\\" is very good - certainly extremely well-written and researched. But it left me wanting so much more than I knew it would be able to give me. So for people wanting to read a historical novel from a next-to-the-fly-on-the-wall POV, this would be it. And for those of you looking for a book that makes Bagoas come alive, this would definately be it, but if you've gotten that far, you probably already know that..."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Well, I liked \\"Last of the Wine\\" a whole lot more than \\"Persian Boy\\" because, for one thing, the gay characters in it were masculine and manly. Here, the principal gay character, Bagoas, is a young, feminine eunuch, gelded as a boy, and seems to represents some of the worst of gay stereotypes, present during Renault's lifetime and still existing today. True or not, this \\"pretty boy\\" does today's gay men no favors, and no one claims he should. How much of his characterization is merely a reflection of people Renault knew or of her reading of history no one also knows.However, and nonetheless, \\"Persian Boy\\" offers an intimate view into Alexander's quite public private life, and we can all be grateful to Renault for her carrying the correct banner about the truth of Alexander's persona: he was obviously homosexual. No, not bi-sexual --- homosexual.The entire book is first person, narrated by Bagoas, Alexander's personal Persian attendant and sex partner, perhaps his preferred partner, maybe even his beloved, the one who helped him most deal with his internal battles, apart from the wars of conquest. Hephaestion, of course, holds down the #1 \\"lover position\\" over the entire span of Alexander's lifetime, but Bagoas was a clear and present rival. Bagoas' jealousy and hatred of Hephaestion gives us a few genuine laughs in this story (kind of like an intemperate teenager, despairing over his prize man's other and true love interest). His despising of Hephaestion is mollified only when Hephaestion is either away on a war campaign or dead.I grew tired of the boy's conceit, his insecurities, his narrow Persian ethnocentricity, and his illiteracy. He is/was the classic \\"kept boy,\\" not really earning or deserving of his \\"keep,\\" except perhaps for his beauty and his skills as a sexual outlet for Alexander.What's good, though, in all this much too-long narrative are the following 2 points. 1) Bagoas is unabashed in his pointed defense of Alexander's drinking, carousing, temper, daemon-driven, uncompromising, charismatic persona. Bagoas forgives and admires Alexander, warts and all. 2) The novel provides some nice insights into the then-Persian ethos/character/customs, complete with misunderstandings that persist today.Since Bagoas never witnessed battles in this fictionalized history lesson, we are spared most of the descriptions of Alexander's conquering of Asia and India. So there isn't much blood, guts and gore in this book. Other writers muck around in the battles sufficiently. See Steven Pressfield's work.All-in-all, the book reads a bit slowly, and in the end I admit to not liking Bagoas, in contrast to my liking very much the main characters in \\"Last of the Wine,\\" which Renault apparently published at least 10 years earlier.The maps are helpful, portions of the story are very good, and all of it is well-written. But in the end, it is a so-so read. Read my review of \\"Last of the Wine,\\" and remember that this author is a woman writing in the 1960's about gay love in approximately 300 B.C. As to ratings, it's a 3."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Another outstanding book written by Ms. Renault.Bagoas was a lifetime companion to Iskander until the end.It is a book that you do not want it to end.However how much of it is real and how much is it fiction?"},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"I love this book. Mary Renault is a serious scholar of Alexander the Great but also writes historical fiction based on historical characters and events of the times. The Persian Boy is Bagoas, a Persian eunech. We follow Bagoas through his family's demise and his subsequent castration to his elevation as the Great King Darius' concubine. After Darius' assassination at the hands of traitorous friends, Bagoas is taken to meet Alexander. He becomes his lover and friend and follows Alexander until his death. This is a richly written novel, full of description and lively characters. It is one of my favorite novels of the last 10 years and I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"I read this in high school. I just read it again after 30 some years and it stands the test of time and aging. I just want them to go on loving each other forever."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"My hero in life is Alexander the Great. He was a fearless warrior king who united the Eastern and Western World. My fascination with him has inspired the reading of several books of historical fiction. None compare with Mary Renault's well researched, lyrical and eerily detailed accounts of his life in her novels Fire From Heaven, The Persian Boy and Funeral Games. Though the language and ancient names can take a few chapters to get your tongue around once immersed Renault spins a world around you in a way that you'd swear she was witness to the events.The Persian Boy is my favorite in the triad because it examines a unique time in Alexander's life. He and his life partner Hephaestion have an unbreakable bond and yet in Greek style he has taken a Persian Boy, Bagoas as a second lover. As fascinating as his adventures in the discovery of the East are the finely woven relations in this ancient love triangle between Alexander, Hephaestion and Bagoas. As one can imagine dating the King of the Known World at the time was ripe with both jealousy and love. A superb accomplishment and true labor of love."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"I adore this book! It's well written and the characters are believeable.

This will be one of those books that I will re-read many times over the course of my life."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"So I finally snatched this novel off my friend's shelf and read the old tethered paperback. It was a sloggish go at first. I tried three times, finally had enough time to sink my teeth into it. I'd say better about it if I didn't feel that I was being written down to. I suppose the erudite style might work for some seeking higher end literature--and I can certainly understand the desire for that with the slew of poorly written novels out there today--but this was the other extreme. Wish I could have liked it more."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"This second (because it wouldn't be like me to actually read books in their intended order, now would it?) in Renault's trilogy about the life of Alexander the Great. This novel is told from the point of view of Bagoas, his lover and servant. Bagoas, Persian king Darius' eunuch slave, was given to Alexander by a Persian noble to gain favor after they murdered Darius. Alexander sets him free but Bagoas chooses to stay and serve him, and then proceeds to fall in love with and seduce the king. Through his eyes we witness epic battles, treachery within the king's ranks, political intrigue, injuries and sickness, drama with Alexander's wives, rivalry with Hephaesiton for Alexander's affection, etc. until the king's mysterious death at the age of 32, just a month short of his 33rd birthday.Bagoas lost his family as a child to traitors and was sold into slavery after being castrated to retain his youthful and beautiful looks. He had been used by a few Persian households until he was bought to be trained to serve king Darius as one of his (hundreds? thousands? male and female) concubines. Alexander (and his father, Philip) at this point had already united the Greeks and had been crowned the Pharaoh of Egypt. Already a legend with an almost god-like reputation (or one of Zeus' son as proclaimed by the oracle of Delphi), he set out to conquer Persia.When Alexander received Bagoas as a gift, he let him stay as a servant if he wished or be free. It wasn't until Bagoas decided to seduce the king that the story took on mythic propitiations. Alexander, through Bagoas' narration, is presented as very human and flawed, a man who deeply craves love from everyone. Bagoas wasn't blind to his murders, ruthlessness in war, short temper, drunkenness, etc. He not only saw Alexander at his most vulnerable, as a man who loved and hurt and grieved, but also as a man who was larger than life, one who dreamt big and was fearless on the battlefield. It is such a unique look at Alexander's life that you can't help but fall in love with the king. Bagoas wasn't just a passive observer either. He loved Alexander but had his own insecurities. He questioned his status in Alexander's court, being seen as a Persian \\"barbarian\\" among, in his view, the \\"barbaric\\" Macedonians. He also questioned his place with Alexander among the king's wives and Hephaestion, Alexander's lifelong best friend and lover.Throughout, we see a version of Alexander that historical books, sparse on the details of his private life, can't provide. The author invented most of the details regarding Bagoas because he is only mentioned a few times in historical texts (the fact that a eunuch Persian slave boy was mentioned at all in relation to Alexander would seem to signify that he has had a significant role). The narrative does an amazing job describing the sights and sounds of the ancient world marred in war and ethnic conflicts. This novel is emotional, sorrowful and joyful, and will lead the reader from tears to laughter and back to tears again during the tragic and mysterious ending of the king's life. Renault may lay it on a bit thick at the end describing the omens of impending death but when taken into context, the Greeks did pay much attention to symbols and prophecies, in turn the descriptions provide yet another layer of depth.It is a marvelous, completely brilliant book based on all the facts available regarding Alexander's life and filled in beautifully with fiction by Mary Renault. Her words are almost poetic and draw you in from the start. She weaves history, realism, myth, and invention in such a way that it leads you to believe that these really were the details of Alexander's life, as written by Bagoas after the king's death (and the first person point of view is literary magic in her hands). This is truly a must read novel."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"\\"The Persian Boy\\" is a journey back in time, with it Mary Renault succeeds in both capturing the essence of a character and guiding us through the immense campaigns of Alexander The Great. Like \\"Fire From Heaven,\\" it is a brilliant mix of drama and history, written with a detail so vivid that there is no doubt that Renault is a serious historian who loves the subjects she writes about and has studied all aspects of the history and culture. Renault was always bold and with a wealth of character to choose from who travelled with Alexander she chose one of the most controversial and sexually charged, Bagoas the eunuch. Little is known of this gift offered to Alexander as part of a surrender and after the death of the Macedonian conqueror he disappears from the pages of history, what is recorded is that he was a favorite of Alexander's, and as was the custom at the time, a lover as well. Since the character is so murky, Renault has free will to invent as she pleases with his life and in the novel he comes from a well respected family destroyed by Persian traitors who sell Bagoas into slavery, castrate him and soon use him as an onject of pleasure. \\"Fire From Heaven\\" was a Greek novel, set almost entirely in the world of Macedon and Greece, but with \\"The Persian Boy\\" Renault offers us the oriental point of view. She captures the culture with perfection, displaying the lands and people that are now Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan with vivid details about the dress, customs, religion and habits. Once Bagoas is given to Alexander (after fleeing with the Great King Darius who is killed by his own commanders) the novel really becomes epic as Bagoas follows Alexander from Bactria to India and Babylon. It is a tale of humility and devotion as Bagoas realizes he is being treated as a human being for the first time in his life by this young conqueror who is more humble and understanding than any before or since. Renault's historical novels have always shined because they capture the humanity behind the events, behind the iconic figures and towering events. The world is changed by individuals with their own personal histories and Renault captures how hates, loves, passions, devotions and obsessions have changed the course of history. Some have accused Renault of deifying Alexander, but his faults also appear and he comes across as a brilliant thinker and commander who may also have slipped and fallen but always with a drive to discover. Classicists and Alexander students will enjoy how Renault includes famous passages from history with gusto and style such as when Alexander falls in love with the Bactrian princess Roxane one night as she performs a ritual dance after the Macedonians capture the Sogdian Rock. There are moments of passive thought and moments of great intensity and action, with drama that burns off the page. Alexander's travels are described with epic spirit as Bagoas too discovers the harsh rains of India and the horrors of crossing the desert to Babylon. \\"The Persian Boy\\" is one of the great historical novels, highly recommended because it has a real heart at its center. This is not a novel by someone who felt like writing about Alexander, this is a novel by someone who is an expert on the subject and has done her research with incredible detail. Her dramatic speculation is always smart and plausible, and goes with the evidence we have. This is a masterpiece, a timeless work of literature for the ages."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Normally I don't recommend books online, but after re reading this and getting ready to do a research paper and book review on Alexander's empire, I had to add my two cents worth.Read it. Yeah, it has homosexual themes, but as others have said, its not primary, its an afterthought of the writer. Bagoas is simply a fantastically written character. Taking a few historical bylines from people like Arrian and Plutarch, Mary Renault has created a fascinating figure in history. It wistfully makes you wish you could actually meet this eunuch and find out what his life was truly like.Renault also covers the story of Alexander's campaign with clarity, compassion and with a marvelous sense of adventure for her readers. The information on life in an ancient army camp is well-written, not over explained, and the campaigns themselves are only as a non-soldier like a former palace concubine could see it. Renault has a fantastic grasp of Alexander that, while it might not be spot-dead on, it has to be close.Everyone clearly comes to life. I'm just so disappointed that something like \\"The Continuing Life of Bagoas\\" was not written following the sequel to \\"The Persian Boy\\". Hints of Bagoas' life following Alexander's death is mentioned throughout the book....but oh, what I wouldn't give for more. I also highly recommend the sequel to \\"The Persian Boy\\", \\"Funeral Games\\" for the follow-up of Bagoas, though he's mentioned sporadically, it does have him as a bit of a plot point."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"there are many reviews of ms. renault's work here already, so i will keep this very brief: the reason mary renault is my favorite author is that she can bring the emotional and human quality of her characters to the surface. she makes these long dead people with strange names come alive. she gives them a quotidian life. she makes them human, and humane. true, her knowledge of the ancient greeks is encyclopedic. true, her descriptions are wonderous, but her deep empathy for the people in her novels is what separates her from other historical writers. she also handles homoeroticism/homosocial behavior with a sweetness and sensitivity that demonstrates the value of the delicate bonds that men should be encouraged to explore and nurture. her compassion for the human experience is sometimes overwhelming."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"First of all, don't grab this book if you are against homosexuality. If you are not prejudiced, or, better, if you are gay, this is THE book on love. You are going to laugh and get your eyes mist as persian Bagoas meets Alexander and little by little becomes enchanted by him and in turn enchants the King and earns his heart. Though we know Hephastion was the main,greatest love in Alexander's life,Bagoas, the persian boy, manages to keep a good part of the king's heart to himself. It is a briliantly written book, never boring, the kind you can't-put-down. Page after page is filled with emotion, adventure, romance and action. And if you, like me, happen to fall in love with Alexander while reading this book, thank Mary Renault's superb sensibility and astonihing knowledge of the male heart and feelings. It is no wonder that for many years many believed Mary Renault was a man. So, DO buy this book. You will not regret, you'll just look forward to the rest of the trilogy: Fire from Heaven (part1) and Funeral Games (part3)."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"This is a story that begins and ends in horror, with plenty more in between. There is also beauty, glory, triumph and tragedy in this story of Alexander the Great based on the historical record.But most of all there is love, and once we get over the nature of that love, we can surrender ourselves to enjoying the flow of the story as we follow Alexander the Great, one of history's most fascinating figures, on a journey of conquest through the known world.We follow him from the viewpoint of the Persian boy of the title, a narrator very different to the usual fictional protagonist. But this boy is not fictional, he really lived, and I venture to suggest that Mary Renault's tale is not half as colourful as the real thing must have been.I find it hard to lay a handle on this book. It's fiction, it's history, it's a romance, a war story, an epic adventure. It deals with the great themes of humanity and it's a ripping yarn.If you've read any of Mary Renault's other books, you won't need convincing. If you haven't, then enjoy this one as your first taste of her opus, because it is one of her very best."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"Here is a vivid portrait of perhaps the most extraordinary figure in human history: Alexander of Macedon - as seen through the eyes of his devoted servant, Bagoas. This is the young King who, nearly 2,500 years ago, sought to conquer the world. And though he did not achieve this end (an utter impossibility, as no one knew then what depths were in the oceans or what lied beyond the scope of their own earthbound horizons.) Yet all that he did achieve before his untimely death in Babylon at the age of 32, was amazing - likening him to almost a god, and one who would be known forever as Alexander the Great.Mary Renault gives Bagoas a fine voice - and a depth of passion for his King brilliantly interwoven with genuine adoration and love, so rarely seen in historical writing.This author's novels are a seductive blending of ancient historical fact and sweeping fiction that's meant only to tell the tale by force of bringing it vividly before your eyes. This history needs to be cherished. Go read this book, and hold it close to your heart."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"I read this book when it came out (no pun intended) in paperback in the 70s. I was a child to love (sex, yes), female or male, then of 26 years. I reread it a couple of weeks ago and loved it. I am 62 now. It is a story of love, not sex, for that is irrelevant. The First Edition hardbound dust jacket has these lines. \\"Alexander is a man with little experience of sensuality, but a profound need of affection. Bagoas' famous beauty has been much exploited, but his affection has been needed by no one. Their meeting is irresistible to both.\\" Whereas the first sentence is arguable, yet incapable of proof, if one imagines Hephaestion to be a sensual lover, the second is the crux of this beautiful tale of deep affection. Testicles do not automatically confer manliness, any more than their absence confers femininity. One can never doubt Alexander's manliness, yet his warring parents apparently wondered if his mutual obsession with Hephaestion, nay besottedness, was healthy for the boy. He/they were probably 15 or 16 years old then. Philip and Olympias even wondered if their boy was a \\"gynnis,\\" that is, a womanish man. So that raises another irrelevant question: who was top or bottom? Or both? Maybe they were both \\"versatile\\" in modern gay jargon. But then, who cares?! They were men and therefore sexual and very into a lifelong love. As there are only five references to Bagoas in all of the third hand (at best) ancient sources, we shall never know. Therefore this sensual, beautiful, and tender NOVEL should be judged on it's own merits and not pecked to meaningless pieces by modern labeling crows.So now for a bombshell. I am going to write a sequel to The Persian Boy. No, I'm not insane, just a romantic dreamer who weeps unabashedly and procrastinates reading this book's last 50 or so pages. I don't want Hephaestion or Alexander to die so young. Who ever does? Could it have been plausibly different? What could (and should) have intervened (no time-travel, aliens or such absurdist cheap devices) to change their lives and all of western history forever? One very small thing could have. I have the vision, or perhaps a mad delusion. Whatever! I shall write it!"},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"After reading so many glowing reviews of THE PERSIAN BOY and after being told that it could be read as a stand-alone book from Renault's Alexander Trilogy, I was anxious to jump right in. But at the last minute decided to read part one, FIRE FROM HEAVEN first. And I'm so glad I did. Not only does the first book give you a thorough grounding in the history of Alexander's youth and the conquests of his father Philip of Macedon, it also sets up the first leg of the romance triangle between Alexander, his boyhood soulmate Hephastion, and Bagoas, the \\"Persian Boy\\".While FIRE FROM HEAVEN is well written, fast-paced and thread through with betrayal, Oedipal intrigue, battlelust and romance, it really just lays the ground work for Renault's masterpiece, THE PERSIAN BOY. This book was an incredible read. Bagoas' narration makes this novel utterly engaging from the first sentence. (I DARE you to read the first paragraph of this book and put it aside!) Bagoas is, at turns heroic, petty, brave, self-preserving and selfless-- in sum: a fully fleshed out character with flaws and claws, and an absolute pleasure to know. This is a great read on its own, but you'll feel the joys and sorrows of the characters tenfold if you take the time to read Fire From Heaven first."},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"While under normal circumstances I find myself asleep in almost every history class and thus was rather doubtful when first getting this book, it not only kept me awake during the evening, but well into the night as well. This is one of very few books that I've finished in one sitting and not felt tired after. I love the way Renault has shaped her characters; these are not the cookie-cutter protagonists and antagonists you normally see. They have depth, a personality of their own, and many (though there are probably more without than with) with their own set of moral standards and honor; and though you hear mostly of Alexander's actions, you also learn about the lil Persian boy's character through what he admires and despises. Rich with details not only about the surroundings and whatnot, but about the various cultures at the time. You learn about soldiers, you learn about nobles, you learn about what makes simple men's names immortal. Jane Austen's books, after Pride and Prejudice, bored me because they became redundant. I think, however, if you are like me-rather picky and easy to bore-you will find The Persian Boy a refreshing breath of long-sought clean air. If you hated even vaguely-historical novels before, give it another shot with this book. You won't regret it. Cheers!"},{"Title":"The Persian Boy","review":"If you are looking for an exciting story, you can't go wrong with Alexander biographies and stories. Whether he is portrayed evil or good, his life was full of energy and events that simply amaze you. But of all the books I've read about him, this book is the one that captured my mind the most.First, she starts out with Bagoas's boyhood. Doing so she is successful in educating her reader about Persian people and their culture/customs, the environment and the way it was back then, to prepare us for deeper understanding of the future events. The first one-third of the book is about Bagoas's boyhood, mostly about his court life, which tells what had happened inside the Persian Empire before Alexander actually came into scene. This is a very smart start, because by the time Darius was killed, and his murderer Bessus was arrested by Alexander and executed, with nose and ears cut off, the reader is well prepared to understand why it had to be done that way. She also explains well the reason why Alexander became so Persianized, which created resentments and mutinies and lots of problems. Mary Renaults does the best job in making the reader understand this crucial point which cast shadow over him until he died.As for homosexuality and the love scenes, it is not as disturbing, since it is not graphic at all. Transparent, clean, and good taste.She also brings other characters to life. All that she mentions by their names, the reader will know what kind of person he/she was. Whether her portrayal of Alexander and the way she used the well-known events to develop the characters and story are factual or not, she will convince you effortlessly. Remarkable work, well-studied, well-reasoned, well-developed. You will not be able to put it down once you open the first page."},{"Title":"Endless Staircase","review":"Many of the most memorable pieces in Endless Staircase, Sandy McIntosh's fourth book of poetry are in blocks of prose. Whether to call them prose-poems with a strong plot or short stories is unimportant: McIntosh is a consummate story-teller with a gift for the rhythms of poetry and prose and le mot juste. At times verging on the surreal and at other times fastened to clear, direct speech and plain imagery, his work elegantly distills the wonder and absurdity of what one poem's title calls \\"The Brutality of Memory,\\" including the collisions of conflicting egos and psychic agendas in love and friendship, as well as the comic or horrific detonation of the best-laid life-plans. Not unlike Chekhov, McIntosh scrupulously crafts recollected suffering and laughter while refusing to churn platitudes out of it: \\"But no, nothing is clear, not before, not after.\\" In \\"Black Stone,\\" \\"Admonition (I),\\" and various other humorous pieces on love, men strain to impress women who see through every pretense or who are too busy with their own obsessions to notice. Nevertheless, in \\"Wedding Song,\\" amatory ideals are taken seriously and are projected with imaginative energy: \\"Let us become inseparable/ and spin through space/ and be anonymous as a comet/ that appears once a thousand years.\\" Much of the book is written under the sign of elegy. The most remarkable accomplishment of Endless Staircase is the title-sequence, in which McIntosh, with unsparing precision, charts the divergent paths that he and his brother, who died in his thirties of a drug overdose, took. The pathos of the long prose-section, which is framed by the extremely difficult trip to the morgue to identify the body, comes from the implication that the narrator was powerless to help his brother get beyond his \\"public swagger,\\" the stubborn insistence on self-destruction; he could do nothing but watch (and record) his brother's long, tragic decline from a troubling distance. Each carefully chosen detail of their lives resonates with other details, and the prose-section concludes with the narrator's need to shield his mother from the horror of the brother's appearance in death."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Wittgenstein (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)","review":"Wittgenstein is considered among the most important philosophers of the 20th century, he is certainly among the most difficult. But he is also among the most worthwhile. He was concerned, among other matter, with the relationship of language to the world, of the ontological status of mind and consciousness, and of showing how language itself helped create false philosophical problems. \\"When language takes a holiday,\\" as Wittgenstein puts it, we can create all sorts of philosophical problems - the mind-body problem may be one of these if Wittgenstein is correct.There are a number of good essays in this collection, but Hans Sulga's \\"Whose House is That?: Wittgenstein on the Self\\" may be the best. Sulga explores how Wittgenstein's analysis of language led him to a rejection of Cartesian substantialism - or the idea that consciousness, the soul, or the mind, was an immaterial substance - a \\"soul atamon\\" as Nietzsche would put it - tethered to a physical body and capable of existing independently of that body. But Wittgenstein also rejected opposing views such as materialism, behaviorism, and reductionism as well. Indeed, he shows how such opposing camps actually share some of the same underlying assumptions. All this leads Wittgenstein to a radical and important new way of understanding subjectivity. For those interested in an accessible introduction to Wittgenstein's thinking on these matters this volume is a good place to start - particularly Sulga's essay."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Wittgenstein (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)","review":"As an introduction to making sense of Wittgenstein's work (and his contribution to 20th C. Philosophy), or as a scholarly apparatus, this is a superb collection of articles. It places the reader square in the middle of current discussion in Wittgenstein studies, and this anthology is a good entry into the threshold of that research. With this, you enter into a world of pain [I just had to say that. Somehow it is appropriate to juxtapose W. with quotes from the The Big Lebowski (a film)].Wittgenstein is a difficult and at times obscure philosopher. However, this anthology and Crary's New W. (Routledge) makes the best case for W's relevance to the philosophy of math and the philosophy of mind.Some of the more important articles included here are: Stern, &quot;Availability of W's Philosophy,&quot; Cavell, &quot;Notes and Afterthoughts,&quot; Stroud, &quot;Mind, Meaning and Practice&quot; (excellent), Sluga (on W's subjectivism), Fogelin, Ricketts on W's Tractatus, and the following figures on math and math necessity: Diamond, Gerrard, and Glock.I highly recommend this anthology. I also recommend: Crary's New W; W. in America; McDowell's articles on rule-following; Stroud, Mind Meaning and Practice (Oxford UP); Dummett, Putnam, and Diamond's Realistic Spirit.

(Vol. 2 of a 2 vol. set)","review":"William Godwin in AN ENQUIRY CONCERNING POLITICAL JUSTICE argues that the rational being, man, must be given complete freedom to exercise his pure reason. All forms of government, being founded on irrational assumptions, are tyrannical and must be eliminated. Accumulated property as a means of exploitation must be abolished as well. Godwin asserts that the goal for humanity in general is happiness. The two traditional articles of personal liberty have been (1) security of our persons (2) security of our property. All through history all governments have had a corrupting influence on themselves and those under their domain. For government to improve, people must clearly define to themselves the genuinely good principles of life. He surveys the historical destructiveness and futility of war. Godwin sees three principles of moral improvement: literature, education, and political justice. The last can be strong only when the first two are weak. When political justice is equally addressed to all, it will impart virtue to all. He also points out the destructive passions engendered by the inequality of property, the magnificence accorded to enormous wealth, and the insolence and usurpation of rich people. Godwin believes that humanity can improve in stages or steps. If science and art can improve in time, then why can't people and society at large do the same? He distinguishes between society (which he calls a blessing since it is produced by our wants) and government (which is at worst a wickedness and at best a necessary evil). He defines justice as meaning that the individual should do all in his power to help those other men in society but nothing for those others in the state.

Avoid this book like the plague. I have given it one star only because zero is not an option.PS -- I passed! My views on this book remain unchanged: a grossly overpriced doorstop.

Overall there was good information that helped me pass the CISSP exam. If I had not gone through the first bookOfficial (ISC)2 Guide to the CISSP Examand a training boot camp before this book, I would not have noticed the lack of information in some chapters and occasional errors. There is a chapter or two that had very little value-add content and could have been left out if it wasn't for the fact that they needed to be there to complete the 10 domains of the CISSP.Another interesting thing I noticed was that the book is longer (in number of pages) than the guide to the CISSP Exam, but the glossary at the end is huge! This actually reduces the amount of content that you would read, unless you like reading glossaries.Pros:A book to round out your studies of the CISSP or review literature and an already certified CISSP.The chapters take a different angle to the CISSP profession than the EXAM guide published by ISC2.Cons:The editing was not terribly good.Additional SME reviews would have been a huge plus before this was published.I would like to see a polished 2nd edition."},{"Title":"Official (ISC)2 Guide to the CISSP CBK ((ISC)2 Press)","review":"I found the Shon Harris book easier to read, but I used this extensively as a reference when trying to strengthen my weaker areas."},{"Title":"Official (ISC)2 Guide to the CISSP CBK ((ISC)2 Press)","review":"This book was no better than the first version.

The test questions at the end of each chapter are poorly written. It also seemed to lack some of the critical details I found in other books. The best overall guide I have found so far is the All-in-One (no big surprise).

The questions from the CD included with the book are spot on in the style and difficulty of the questions in the real exam. In hindsight my best suggestion is to use the Shon Harris as your main study guide (due to the better explanations) and use this book as a supplement (for some details that Shon misses and for the questions on the CD).Review: If you want to get book to prepare your for the CISSP, this is a good one. Since it is from ISC2, you know it will give you everything you need and it maps to the new sections of the test (Tip: Be careful when looking at other study guides out there. The exam changed in 2007 and there aren't too many guides on the market based on the new test! If you buy something written before 2007, it is mapping to the old exam and you won't get the latest info on some of the technologies that you are expected to know for the exam). On the bad side it is not as easy to read as some of the other study guides. Since there is a seperate author for each chapter, the writing styles vary a bit. I also didn't like the questions at the end of the chapter, though the CD questions are better. On the good side, the actual reading material is straight to the point and only about 700 pages. The remaining pages of the book (approx 300) is a comprehensive glossary of terms (very useful).If you like something that is easier to read, the Shon Harris All-in-One Study Guide puts things in a simpler fashion but it is over 1000 pages (a lot more reading). (4th edition maps to the new sectionsCISSP Certification All-in-One Exam Guide, 4th Ed. (All-in-One)).It boils down to what is your reading style. If you don't mind reading something that reads like a college text book, this is the book for you. If you think that reading a text book is a cure for your insomnia or you want to have someone explain certain concepts in a simpler fashion then try Shon Harris.

This is not it.Bragg does mention bringing in experienced managers to help cope with fast growth (p. 54), but that is just one among a plethora of recommendations, most of which, if common-sensical, are not necessarily obvious. Indeed, I would say Bragg actually eschews \\"management-speak,\\" as in the following discussion of beginning to delegate authority in a growing company. The parenthesis is his:\\" . . . managers should consult with their subordinates before completing their budgets. This is not because management has any need to \\"empower\\" employees (one of the more overused and suspect words in the business vocabulary), but because employees are the ones who are now routinely using budget information . . .\\" (p. 62).The book covers over a dozen distinct topics (as you can see in the Table of Contents, above), from cash management to outsourcing to distribution and manufacturing to human resources.

Even when the colleague is as entertaining and erudite as Jon Dietz, I must confess that I began reading his book with a modicum of trepidation. What if I were bored or confused or angered by his writing? The Jerusalem Train sat on my nightstand for several weeks taunting me. Finally I could avoid it no longer and on Monday evening I picked it up with the internal command to give it at least 50 pages before putting it down permanently. Within ten pages I was hooked and ended up spending most of my Veteran's day engrossed in the tale. In fact, though my normal bedtime is 10 pm, I could not put the book down until I reached its conclusion somewhere around midnight. Dietz bills his book as a historical romance but I would quibble a bit with that description. In reality, this is an action-adventure novel doused with a healthy quotient of blood and sex. You need not know one whit of history or even be romantically inclined in order to enjoy this novel. The action revolves around a massive stash of gold and the attempts by the protagonists to liberate that gold from the clutches of the Tsar. The finest achievement of the author is the creation of a cast of memorable characters whose paths will all intersect by the time of the explosive finale.Quite simply, The Jerusalem Train is not a good book--it is a great one. I read three to four books a week and I have not been entertained like this in some time. . Review by Adam Tebrugge"},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Train","review":"This historical novel about the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 is more than just a riveting page turner. It is indeed a tremendous action-adventure-romance novel which involves both real and fictitious characters. Hero Alec Daniloff, an American expatriate, and the other diverse figures are driven, to varying degrees, by greed, lust, pride, nationalism, arrogance, hate, envy and (last but but not least) true love. That could be juicy enough.Dietz' eye-opening portrait of events leading up to the Russo-Japanese War is of equal or greater value to the reader. This was the 21st century's first major international conflict and Dietz sheds light on much-ignored events and social forces that shaped the three subsequent wars (WWI, WWII, Cold War). Those conflicts have dominated the attention of historians and the public. However, true understanding of history's cataclysms requires knowledge about the fuses and the people who lit them, not just views of the explosions themselves.The Jerusalem Train"},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Train","review":"The Jerusalem Train by Jon Dietz is quite good as a first novel and well worth reading. In fact,I have read far worse by some \\"experienced\\" novelists. The story was interesting and kept me engaged to the end. The story did seem to me to be historically accurate in setting and created a good atmosphere that made me feel I was there. The characters could have a bit more dialog, especially that of Christina, which would have contributed to their development and produced a novel that deserved five stars instead of four.

The first time I read it I was quite put off by it. But years later I was drawn to read it again and suddenly found it full of meaning.Most people speak of it as a book about sex, but really it's a book about spiritual awakening. It is not an easy read. It holds your face in the mud and asks you to see God. It's a book that makes you feel experiences, it wears you down, and then takes you into moments of satori."},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"Henry Miller was capable of brilliant story-telling and, as this book shows, he could also be a tremendous bore.There are big parts of the book where the story-telling is first rate. He gives a very vivid picture of the vulgar and rather brutal working class milieu in which he spent the first 3 or 4 decades of his life. He makes his experiences and the people he associated with come alive, though one wonders to what extent the experiences are real and to what extent they are made up. One can well imagine a working class male in Brooklyn in the early 20th century having the experiences and thoughts that Miller portrays himself and his associates having. The first and largest episode in the book is Miller's life as manager of a telegraph company's message delivery service. Then there are other episodes in Miller's life that are detailed, going back to his childhood.It helps Miller in his story-telling that he is completely un-restrained in his use of language. He uses every four letter word imaginable and describes sexual escapades in extremely graphic language. He uses the four letter word that begins with \\"c\\" to describe the private area on the lower front part of a woman's body. He frequently refers to this private area throughout the book and his fondness for accessing it. The account of the period when Miller was the messenger service manager is laced with constant references to the sexual encounters that Miller and his buddies pursued (even though most of them were married at the time). Miller portrays himself in this book as a raging sex maniac. Let me give a summary of some of the sexual experiences detailed in the novel. For instance there is his piano teacher. He is in his mid-teen years and she is in her mid-20's. He is seized with an intense desire to access this teacher's private area and one day while they are seated at the piano, he makes some groping gestures in the direction of the private area. She thoroughly rebukes him but not long after, she encounters him outside sitting down in an isolated area. He lunges at her again but she successfully resists him, saying she doesn't want to do it there. They walk to another isolated area, I believe near a lake, and there she attacks him and apparently the subsequent copulation is quite intense. Then there is Rita. Rita is the sister of his friend Maxie and Henry intensely wishes to have a sexual encounter with Rita but Maxie does not approve of that. Henry runs into Rita one day and they go back to the vestibule of her family apartment and have mind-blowing sex on the floor. Henry is very proud that he was able to fornicate with Maxie's sister \\"right under\\" the nose of Maxie. Miller provides fairly vivid description of the placement of his hands and some other details that occurred during this vestibule fornication. Then there is a young gal who I believe Miller calls Agnes. We are introduced to Agnes in a story that seems to take place during Henry's mid-to-late teen years. One day, Henry, Agnes and another girl play naked tag by the river. Agnes and Henry also have other experiences together. For instance, they copulate in various public places, including public telephone booths. Another activity of Henry and Agnes takes place on street cars. On the street-car, Agnes, wearing nothing under her dress, lifts up the dress and sits on Henry's lap and.....you get the picture. Agnes also tells Henry the story how she bullied her brother into running his fingers around her.....um........There is another more graphic allusion to incest in this book. Henry has a young friend/prot&eacute;g&eacute;, an aspiring teenage thief/con-man named Curley. Curley appears impressed with Henry's skill in hustling money from friends and acquaintances; Henry does this because he is always dead broke. Anyway, we learn that Curley is involved in a sexual relationship with his aunt. His parents were circus folk and apparently abandoned him and he was forced to live with this aunt and this aunt feels that.....etc.These brutal and nasty stories of life in working class New York in the early 20th century are not all related to sex though there is a lot of that. It is from the perspective of a working class male possessed of a chauvinism not untypical of the time. Women don't figure much in this story except as actors in sex scenes. There are episodes where sex plays no part, for example the story of Miller's father's embrace of religion in his elderly years as well as the excellent and vivid stories about some of Miller's childhood friends and acquaintances.The episodes are sometimes unpleasant and nasty but very real and it is unfortunate that Miller has to break up the power of this novel by placing long rambling incoherent mystical discourses in between the episodes of the book and especially in the last part of the book. These psychedelic tirades really get tiresome and almost completely ruin the book. Tropic of Cancer, thankfully, has little of this gibberish."},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"After Tropic of Cancer and 60 pages into this book I thought, 'He lost it'. I settled in and waited for the brilliant flashes of prose to trickle out of the day to day life of this Cosmodemonic Telephone Company employee.It was also at about that time I was picked up by the bottoms of my feet and placed on the shoulders of a drunken man who liked to run with the bulls of Pamplona.Oscillating between manic observations and eloquent prose Miller writes a treatise, dissertation and thesis on the love of living the moment. Nothing passes his eye or mind without inspection and you constantly find your 'normal' life the target of his thoughts.Your sensibilities enter the ring blind-folded against the whole history of heavyweight contenders ever to vie for a title.

Miller is probably the most cynical person in the universe.

And as a story of a man completely free in the modern world (1930's) with not a care in the world, it may even deserve some of its semi-classic stature! But it is not showing Henry'y best writing by any stretch!

Sure, blinding light would occasionally cut through the floating gray clouds of endless paragraphs, but for the most part this book seemed more like a literary endurance test. The beginning piqued my curiosity, but reading the rest of the book made me feel like I just wanted to get my money's worth. I think the most depressing thing about the book was toward the end when Miller was quoting the surrealists, ha ha, and I loved those quotes and it made me want to explore Breton and such, but they stood in harsh contrast to Miller's own writing. Miller seems like an interesting name dropper, a coach of literature that isn't so hot on his own two feet; but then again, I haven't read all of his work, but I'm wondering if it's worth the effort. Henry Miller seems to touch upon things that have already been done better by other writers: Dostoevski was a better rambling, ranting madman writing in a common vernacular; Rimbaud executed the dynamic between bitter nihilistic despair to innocence and hope better; and Lautreamont was much more obscene and capable of creating perfect, surreal, jarring imagery."},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"i've read several books of henry's,but it's the very best coz i'm moved by what he said,so frank so grey so sentimentaland so good. sometimes i jsut forget he wrote it so long time ago,his work is everygreen,so to speak."},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"In my opinion, it is essential that any budding writer read any Henry Miller book they can find.

I am exactly in the middle. There are times where Miller's story telling is completely engaging and there are other times when his rants are too cumbersome and egotistical. I told everyone how much I disliked the book and then realized that I was talking about this book more than most I have read. It definitely hits a cord and like most great books, it makes you think. This book is provocative and based on the period of time, it is amazing that Miller was so advanced. I will read this book again and see if it has a different impact on me...."},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"This book was way ahead of it's time. Written in the 1930's and banned for almost 30 years, it sounds like something written only yesterday.Miller is an amazing writer with real vision, insight and madness. The James Joyce of America.

It's a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"wow. reading henry miller is like taking an amazing roller coaster rider while on ecstasy. his writing is intoxicating, it would make a truck driver blush. miller transports you back to a world that we've only seen colored be history. his style is abrupt his sentences infinite and his poetry beyond compare. this is a work of literature in the true sense. constantly testing the limits of imagination and self examination. highly recommended. read this book and pass it onto others!!"},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"I may have a soft spot for this book because it's the first of his I read, but this comes off as no less than his finest hour. The first fifty or so pages are almost unbeatable. Miller nails the very essence of the American character down with an unflinching vitriol that hasn't really been matched in anything else I've read. Given how banal much of the literature that comprises the curriculum in public schools is, I was somewhat shocked and completely mesmerized by someone exposing the degradation and absence of ethics in the the modern workplace so openly. Reading it well after the year 2000, it still was spot on in spite of taking place in 1920s New York.Sure, much has changed since then. Racism and sexism have become more veiled and subtle, but are still present in oblique and diluted forms. On closer inspection, I have come to think that the book tacitly makes the point that racism always was partially a red herring. The real enemy was a system that treated people as mere statistics and robbed us all of our humanity.A lot of people like Cancer better, but I have to disagree. This book is everything he was trying to do in Cancer and then some. Whatever style he was trying to formulate in Cancer, which while still very good basically only described a sort of expatriate hipster aesthetic. That isn't without its merits, but Capricorn was the book that looked not only looked America right in its hideous face, but saw Miller making \\"the only true journey which is to the self\\" (paraphrased). The sexual aspect of the book gets overplayed again and again, but it was only part of a larger transparency in Miller's writing. He wrote graphically and directly about sex in a time when it was utterly unacceptable to do so in popular discourse. His ability with the English language is largely unmatched in American prose. It was in this book, where he wanted to lay out his thoughts in the most naked manner possible, that he hit full stride stylistically.Unsentimental, deliriously descriptive, and brilliant."},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"This book was fabulous. More bitter and disillusioned than Tropic of Cancer (you can figure that much out by page 5) this book is as good as the first one, if not more so. It's interesting how he'll talk about some kind of sexual episode and then he's off on a personal reflection of, say, his sickly father finding religion and becoming dependent on it. I agree with Miller himself--you don't want to reach the end of Tropic of Capricorn too fast."},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"Like Tropic of Cancer, Tropic of Capricorn is part autobiography, part memoir, part polemic, part fiction, part fantasy, and part poetry, written in near stream of consciousness as Miller experiences one epiphany after another.As with the prior book, Miller's ramblings are the source and the result of his efforts to define himself as an artist. Other contemporary American writers, for example, F. Scott Fitzgerald, seem fascinated by their significance as artists and by the future importance of their art. In the Tropic books, Miller makes his consciousness of himself as an artist the subject of his art. In some ways, reading the Tropic books is like watching someone obsessively paint his self-portrait over and over, all with the title, Self-Portrait of the Artist.According to Miller, \\"Life becomes a spectacle and, if you happen to be an artist, you record the passing show . . . The surface of your being is constantly crumbling; within, however, you grow hard as a diamond.\\" He says he \\"was perhaps the first Dadaist in America, and I didn't know it. Nobody understood what I was writing about or why I wrote that way. I was so lucid that they said I was daffy.\\" The focus is not on the art (what he is writing about) but on himself as the artist, with an anonymous readership (\\"nobody,\\" \\"they\\") who doesn't understand him. As if his own belief in himself as an artist were not enough to convince us, he quotes a series of friends who insist that he should become a writer.While Miller lacks objectivity and security, he has moments of insight into the current human condition. \\"Now we are eating of the same bread, but without benefit of communion, without grace. We are eating to fill our bellies and our hearts are cold and empty. We are separate but not individual,\\" following an anecdote about sour rye, is a brilliantly simple description of a world he sees as cold and mechanical, when progress and war have robbed men of their humanity. \\"The smell of a dead horse . . . is still a thousand times better than the smell of burning chemicals . . . the sight of a dead horse with a bullet hole in the temple . . . is still a better sight than that of a group of men in blue aprons coming out of the arched doorway of the tin factory . . .\\" Honest death and decay, \\"after life,\\" are better than \\"death from the roots, isolating men, making them bitter and fearful and lonely, giving them fruitless energy . . .\\"Superior to Tropic of Cancer, Tropic of Capricorn still shows a lack of discipline, or a contempt for it. Separating the poetic gems are long, rambling passages that are sometimes pointless and sometimes nonsensical. He continues the use of incoherent metaphors such as, \\"Inwardly they are filled with worms. A tiny spark and they blow up.\\" Sometimes his attempts to play with words and prose are more childish than literary or artistic, for example, \\" . . . deeper and deeper in sleep sleeping, the sleep of the deep in deepest sleep, at the nethermost depth full slept, the deepest and sleepest sleep of sleep's sweet sleep,\\" and so on.Tropic of Capricorn is uneven, ranging from the lively and the lovely to the self-conscious and tedious. It's unfortunate that Miller expended so much effort trying to convince the reader (and himself) of his status as an evil monster and artist (perhaps with the idea that they are synonymous) and so little culling the irrelevant and refining the rest. Miller's perspective and vision are interesting, even compelling, when not muddied by his fascination with himself and by his need to stand out."},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"Henry Miller captivates the reader from the first sentences, with his strong and astonishing philosophical thoughts and criticism of religion, of life in America.He is so daring, direct, sarcastic, obscene, cold, violent, cynical, erratic, passionate, that you feel as if bent, torn, whipped by a storm, a twister, crying and screaming, yet feeling marvelously alive.With his stunning surrealistic, nihilistic style, you endlessly fly from one world to another, delirious, chaotic, mad, free, ecstatic."},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"After reading &#34;Henry & June&#34; by Anaiis Nin I wanted to read something by Miller and heard that this was such a masterpeiece. maybe its the male point of view that turned me off but I find it crude and tasteless and at times demeaning to women.

Elliot's poem the Wasteland, Miller pours out his soul on the decay of industrialized America. Miller describes in an achingly beautiful stream-of-consciousness prose, the utter despair of life in a city with no soul. People that dwell on the sex and vulgar language are missing the bigger point as Miller describes the hypocrisy, racism, sexism, bureaucracy in a hopeless world. For all the despair Miller describes, I still find a hint of hope, even when he describes the lowest of low individuals, he does it in a lovingly way. In Capricorn, you can see Miller's heavy influence on the Beat Generation. Truly a masterpiece in literature."},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"I bought this because James Frey said it was such an influential book for him, but I just couldn't get into it.

Mr. Miller admits he loves words and he sure does, too bad he does not have the same love for plots. The second chapter is a teenager-like bragging of his sexual exploits, for which he loses his gift for words as the most common are 4-letters either to describe the act itself or the female anatomy. It's all about HIS pleasure. No concern about HERS. My guess is that his bragging is based on insufficient experience or he would find the long descriptions he reserves for the city buildings and cornices.

This book has absolutely no plot or even a story line, it is simply the ramblings of a sexually disfunctional person."},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"Tropic of Capricorn is the gretest book I have ever read. I read Tropic of Cancer first, and was interested and intrigued by it, but not until I read Capricorn would I truly call Miller one of the greatest American writers. Also banned from the U.S for 30 years, Capricorn goes beyong the sexuality and bitterness of one who has &quot;given up&quot; and lived for themselves as Cancer outlines autobiographically of Millers days in Paris. In Capricorn Miller looks to the roots of his childhood and life in New York and examines what made him the man he is and brought on his great change to &quot;a new way of life&quot;. It has elements similar to Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg Ohio, which may be its greatest moments, as it tells small &quot;grotesque&quot; character studies of the people that shaped his life. Miller combines ideas of Eastern mysticism with the chaos of an ever industrializing world. Capricorn goes beyond linear writing to pursue a dreamlike atmosphere: one of admitted Surrealist and Dadsist influence, whose influence in turn can be seen in the later beat writing of Kerouac and Burroughs among others."},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"I first read this book when I was 16. Today, I'm 30 but I still manage to read it every two or three years to remind myself to be true to my feelings. Miller's writings, in general, are autobiographical. Some of the events have actually occurred while some are his dreams/visions. However, all are real to the man and real to most anyone who truly knows themself. There's no candy-coating here. Some reviewers see only the sexuality of the book. While that's certainly a great portion of the book it isn't what the book is about. It's about being who we want to be and freeing ourselves from the reigns of &quot;normality&quot; and confinement. That's why it's so disturbing. He expresses himself through his character and the characters around him. He mocks society and himself simultaneously. He is truly &quot;human&quot;. My one desire, if I should ever be able to fulfill it, would be to write a novel that's worth ten percent of what this one is. Miller is the best friend one could possibly want to have because he doesn't cover-up his intentions."},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"\\"For there is only one great adventure and that is inward, toward the self, and for that, time nor space nor deeds even matter\\" (4).Miller's two tropics - CANCER AND CAPRICORN- are essentially manuals for the creative life. They present Miller's transformation from lay-schmuck working in the belly of the beast that is the American economy - jobs such as his position with the Western Union Telegraph company, which he refers to as the \\"Cosmococcic / Cosmodemonic Telegraph Company\\" - to his evolution as en expatriate writer living in Paris. The books are really designed to be read together to magnify the metamorphosis, the rite of passage. While CANCER chronicles the latter portion of Miller's experience abroad, the prequel, CAPRICORN, written five years later in 1939, is the more developed and more seminal of the two and elucidates with much greater detail the affects of his epiphany.Most artists will immediately recognize the struggle Miller endures. Married to the \\"wrong\\" woman and with a young child in tow - a relationship which he finds stifling to his creative development - Miller faces tenable employment situations to support this life. Those jobs he does find do little to allow him to prosper; rather he finds himself as a cog on a wheel of Hell. His transformation from the morass of what society deems sound and true is painful. Anyone who has ever made such sacrifices to pursue the unspoken dreams to create from what grows inside of them will sympathize with Miller's dilemma. To pursue a life of an artist is frightening enough: to do it behind the rancorous veil of the American dream is horrifying. Miller recognizes the banal existence of modern America with its machines, its backward corporate policies, its worship of the unthinking and mechanical and he also knows he must break from its fetters.Part of Miller's disenchantment with America is organic to his being just as much as it is experiential. As a child, Miller feels a unique disassociation with his peers and even his family. This self-possessed knowledge of his unique intelligence leaves Miller with a feeling of disorientation. As an adolescent, he sees his drunken father convert to piety when wooed by the charisma of a local minister. Miller, Sr. then falls from grace when the minister is called to another location and as a result of this perceived abandonment, cycles back to his earlier state of crapulousness. The event seems to have intimated to Miller the importance of being self-reliant upon a constant wellspring of inspiration so that disappointment in other people does not interrupt the flow of creativity.Miller describes the evolution of the artist as riding \\"on the ovarian trolley.\\" In fact, those very words are what preface CAPRICORN. For Miller there are really two births the artist experiences before his final descent into a world riddled with isolation, hunger and anticipation. Of course, there is the physical birth but this is more a symbolic representation than Miller's actual recognition of his square-peg, round-hole emotional relationship with the world at large: this is the first stage of birth. The second stage comes years later out of the \\"Land of F@ck\\" as Miller coins it, the place where the \\"spermatozoon reigns supreme\\" (198). These phrases, as they would first seem (and were seen for many years that the book was banned from U.S. publication), are not some sordid and gratuitous account of Miller's perceptions of the world or his conquests. Rather, he uses the extended metaphors and kennings to give the reader an understanding to the visceral almost primordial conditions from whence the artist arises. For Miller, spiritual ascension is a process biologic as well as intellectual.\\"Once this fact is grasped there can be no more despair. At the very bottom of the ladder, chez the spermatozoa, there is the same condition of bliss at the top, chez God. God is the summation of all the spermatozoa come to full consciousness. Between the bottom and the top there is no stop, no halfway station\\" (199).There is an almost funereal quality about Miller's cognizance here: this idea of exploring one's complete \\"ANNIHILATON\\" before metaphysical resurrection. Miller understands the need for an eradication of the former self before the rebirth of the artist as he moves from the \\"terra firma\\" to the \\"terra vague.\\" Along with this laying waste of the individual comes the erasure of connections to the self: friends, family, lovers - all abandoned to pursue the freedom to express unhindered utterance*. To this point, Miller's use of \\"Tropic of\\" in the titles of CANCER and CAPRICORN now begins to make more sense as he asserts himself to be on the boundary between this land of the physical and the spiritual; the place where men aspire to be God for a period of time just before the flash-point of creative impulse.He brings the idea of the \\"ovarian trolley\\" full circle when he talks about the importance of discovering Dostoevsky - this being the first glimpse of a man's soul - and then later in a book called CREATIVE EVOLUTION by Henri Bergson. He carries the latter book with him everywhere and extols its virtue upon any man or woman who would hear the new standard version on the gospel of solitude.TROPIC OF CAPRICORN should be standard reading for anyone in the arts, for any artist who has ever felt the pang of isolation, who truly believes in the necessity of sacrifice, a higher calling and commitment to one's creative endeavors. Miller's importance to world literature is vastly underrated and in many cases. Writers are simply too intimidated to face the truth in what he espouses. Miller operates as an Overman and as such, it is right that he should pose a certain condition of tremulousness in his readership: he has forged his own society, he has forged his own being into something closer to what history had intended for him since his first phone call into the horn of the fallopian. This is discomfiting for most and is intended to show how the application of introspection for an artist can lead to becoming an acolyte of unconventional philosophy: how a writer emerges as \\"e pluribus unum.\\" Henry Miller's doctrine is reserved for the initiate, the mad few who choose separation from the masses as a means for creative growth. Miller's epitaph should simply be, \\"My name? Why just call me God - God the embryo.\\"2005-06 Edward J.

If so then you know what to expect from Henry Miller. Tropic of Capricorn is an account of his life up to his trek to Paris in the 1930's. Mr. Miller allows us into his world of words and images that consume his mind and soul.In this semi-autobiographical novel, Miller gives us a glimpse into the breakdowns and revelations that brought him from the streets of Brooklyn and onto the pages of literature. From his first word, we follow him on the road to discovering his world and bringing to life the writer within. Through his free-flowing prose and vivid scenery we follow Henry from his many sexual exploits to the dark sided humor of life as only seen through his maddened eyes. This book is one of the few that truly changed my views of life and my purpose.If you have any taste like my own and the life of Henry Miller intrigues you to no end then definitely pick up Tropic of Capricorn. Like a morsel of bread to a starving man, Capricorn only left me hungrier for more Miller to chew on. Other books I adore are, of course, Quiet Days in Clichy, Tropic of Cancer by Miller, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"Capricorn is an absolutely unique and shattering novel. Miller's ability to write with great cynicism and bitterness about modern life and then instantly plunge to the deepest depths of the philosophy of being is astonishing. At times speaking in a kind of psychobabble, a line or two of this prose/poetry is sometimes enough for one sitting. A bitter novel about the death of the spirit amidst the inevitable continuation of life, Tropic of Capricorn is Miller's masterpiece and one of the twentieth century's greatest works."},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"\\"Once you have given up the ghost, everything follows with dead certainty, even in the midst of chaos.\\"Surely one of the greatest opening lines ever, and Miller doesn't let up from there. Its hard to know what to say about this book apart from that it will either disgust you or blow your mind. A few years ago, my reaction would have been the former -- but things happen. The fact is, different books matter to us at different periods in our lives, and it can be hard to explain why. I can honestly say, this book has a spiritual dimension that is powerful, and can speak to you during your low times.If the idea of a writer looking at the world using his own consciousness, with absolutely no objectivity, and with complete honesty, sounds good to you-- this is your book. You will find a kindred spirit in Henry Miller, and perhaps even a fatherly, wise (but always laughing) source of solace."},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"Out of idle curiosity and a desire to reread (third time) Miller's Tropic novels, I checked the consumer reviews of Tropic of CANCER first. I am interested in new generations discovering the stuff that I read going back to the early 60s. I found the reviews surprisingly dense, repeating the old cliches and personal prejudices.Those of TROPIC OF CAPRICORN, on the other hand, are pointed and intelligent. Moreover, they recognize one of Miller's great traits--- humor. One reviewer pointed out the book's \\"hilarity\\", an apt characterization. Another emphasized Miller's description of the Cosmodemonic messenger service at which he worked. This is one of the most memorable sections of any book I have read: hilarious, biting satire, and (before Miller departs) a great New York book.I have always thought Miller was, among other things, a parodist, and thus those who take him too literally (from Norman Mailer to the guy who showered after reading CANCER)are missing one of our outstanding writers, or certainly mistaking the author for the narrator."},{"Title":"Tropic of Capricorn","review":"Its amazing to me how many times I mention Henry Miller to people only to have them say: \\"oh right, the guy who was married to Marilyn Monroe. Lucky bastard!\\" Sheesh, that's really very sad. I couldn't think of two writers more fundamentally different than Henry and Arthur Miller. Henry Miller SHOULD have been the one married to Marilyn Monroe, that would have been a wonderful thing.That said, don't expect objectivity in this review. I am a massive, unabashed fan of Henry Miller, controversy be damned. I own nearly all his books and have read them all several times, particularly the key ones (Capricorn, Black Spring, Cancer, Sexus, Nexus, Plexus, Quiet Days in Clichy, the Air-conditioned Nightmare and Colossus of Maroussi.)Of them all, Capricorn is probably the grandest, the most 'hardcore' of all Henry Miller's work. And by hardcore, I dont mean the sexiest! (If the sex is all that interests you, read Sexus, I think that has more smut in it than all his other books put together.) Capricorn is hardcore HENRY MILLER. It's the rawest of his books, the most passionate and it contains for me, the quintessential joys of Miller: the humour, the anger, the joy of life, the scorn for the conventional world and the hatred of a nine to five existence. If these things appeal to you, then Capricorn is the book for you!When I innocently plucked it off the shelf of the public libary (because that is where I discovered Miller)I had NO IDEA what I was letting myself in for. The first page blew me away. I can truly say this is a book that changed my life. Of all the books I have read, this one, Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian, Norman Mailer's An American Dream and Stephen King's Christine were the ones that I lived most vividly. The words leap off the page and take possession of your mind and soul!It is a rollicking ride, a treat for the senses and one of the funniest books ever written. Yes, people associate H. Miller with smut, and to be sure he does that better than anyone, but he is also extremely funny, and you cannot fail to read one of his books and not find yourself chuckling along within a page or two. I find Capricorn and Black Spring to be Miller's most entertaining and laugh out loud books. There is pure joy of creation in every line.The other thing I love about Capricorn are the characters. It is packed with them. His time spent with the 'Cosmoccocic Telegraph Company' yields an absolute mine of memorable characters and one of Miller's best talents is rendering people, in all their warped glory, in exquisite detail. His powers of observation are unparalleled among writers. It is usually when he is in anecdotal form, recounting stories of his friends and acquaintances that Miller is at his best, and Capricorn is packed with these.It is also a book that is absolutely saturated with the essence of New York City. Much more so than Cancer is evocative of Paris, the sights, smells and sounds of New York are evident on every page of Capricorn. As much as he despised the city (although he loved his precious Ward 14 in Brooklyn), Miller was a product of it in every pore of his being. It is without a doubt one of the greatest works of literature to have emanated from that great city, and of course, there have been many.If you are new to Miller, I cannot recommend Capricorn as a starting point highly enough. It will leave you reeling and gasping, so electric are the words contained here. Miller was a unique writer, there will never be another like him.

The filling acts as a receiver for radio stations at first, then develops into mind reading. This is the story of a 14 year old boy who has big dreams to play football. Because of his size, the coach doesn't even consider putting him on the team. But with injuries and Elbert's own perserverance, his dream comes true."},{"Title":"Elbert: The Mind Reader","review":"Elbert was really having a bad day. He desperately wanted to be on the football team, but the coach said he was too small. Then after all that, he had to go to the dentist to have 2 cavities filled. Really depressing.On the way home from the dentist, his luck turned for the better. He discovered something really fantastic. When he gritted his teeth together he could hear a radio and it sounded as though it were playing inside his head. It was his new fillings acting as a radio receiver. He figured out how to make it louder and softer and how to change stations by rubbing his teeth together.What a great thing to have. You could listen to the radio in class and no one would know or even in bed before going to sleep.It wasn't until later when he was at home that he found out the most wonderful thing of all. He could hear people's thoughts.(I used this book for booktalks in the schools and the kids really were intrigued by it.)"},{"Title":"The Jungle Book : The Classic Tale","review":"Somehow I missed that this was a large picture book!

Through his remarkably detailed and beautiful artwork, Detaille has rendered a compelling look at this most dramatic era of warfare dominated by the French art of war, military organisation and uniform styles. This classic work has been known for over a century in its French edition and is now translated into English for the first time. This lavish reprint contains the entire two-volume translation, and is richly illustrated throughout with Detaille's original published artwork depicting accurate portrayals of uniforms and military life. The book has been further embellished with an additional full-colour section displaying other works by the artist.Contains the entire translation plus over 300 illustrations from the original artwork by the military artist, and gives background information on regimental histories, army organizations, recruitment, training, battledress and equipment.L'Arm&eacute;e Franaise is the only military history book of its kind, giving background information on regimental histories, army organisations, recruitment, training, battle dress and equipment of the soldiers of France. It is a guide to the French armies that fought in the Napoleonic Wars, Crimean War, the Mexican Expedition, the Conquest of North Africa, and the Franco-Austrian and Franco-Prussian Wars, as well as a contemporary look at peacetime army in the late 19th century.No one can make a serious study of military history without becoming familiar with the wars fought by the armies of France."},{"Title":"L'Armee Francaise: An Illustrated History of the French Army, 1790-1885","review":"The Impressionists are the most famous French Art Movement of the late 19th Century.

Edouard Detaille in my opinion was the greatest historical painter/illustrator of the 19th Century. Do not buy L'Armee Francaise for the text. It is an English translation of stilted and heavily baroque 19th Century French. However, the illustrations are simply amazing!

I have been intrigued by Matthiessen's Watson Trilogy (which I read in the condensed newer version) and by some of his non-fiction. The subject should have worked: evangelical missionaries from the Great Plains travel to the Amazon to spread their version of faith. Catholic missionaries are already there. So is a government representative who wants to clear the land for logging. The tribe of 'locals' have other ideas, and they are still rather 'undomesticated'. The government man hires a duo of very shady mercenaries, Wolfie & Moon, a Jew from 'Frisco' and a half Indian from the same region where the missionaries came from. Both have been 'de-nationalized' by the US for fighting wars in other countries' armies.The missionaries are two couples: two newcomers and two who have been there for a while. The provincial place from where they start into the wilderness is a shock to the newcomers. So is the fact that the 'experienced' mission wife is attractive.From here on out very little surprises the experienced reader. Unfortunately, none of the characters were in the least interesting to me. When the book was published in 1961, the subject may have been a new one, but 50 years later, missionaries are not really an interesting issue any more. Nore are corrupt murderous provincial governors in the 3rd world. Nor are gangsters of all kind. The novel has been made into a film with a great cast: Daryl Hannah, John Lithgow, Aidan Quinn, Katy Bates, Tom Waits, Tom Berenger... Possibly the film is more interesting, but when I see in the description that it is stretched out over 3 hours I have doubts.The book cover claims Conradian and Greenian dimensions for the book. I wish it were so. Yes, there are Greenish drinking priests and missionaries bothered by the flesh, and ok, the gangsters have something Conradian about them (think of the thugs in Victory or Gentleman Brown in Lord Jim), but the tale does not come alive.I should have read this 50 years ago, probably."},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"This case study of culture clash is the story of Protestant missionaries trying to bring the Word of God to jungle savages. They think themselves heroes of The Lord, but there are no heroes here save, perhaps, Louis Moon a reservation half-breed who lost his faith. Moon is now an aimless mercenary staggering through life, bouncing off one obstacle after another. When it becomes his job to massacre the indigenous people, he is revisited by drug-induced dreams of his youth and instead joins them as their rain god fallen from the sky (and a failing airplane).Self-righteous missionary Martin Quarier, becomes less certain of his beliefs as the novel progresses, but seems incapable of moving beyond them. He sees the absurdity of the doctrinal feud between Catholics and Protestants, yet cannot think of priests as anything but the Enemy, in league with Satin. And Satin seems to be working on him, as well, churning up lust for the wife of another missionary.The religious beliefs of the natives give a glimpse of how faith gets started. Their minor gods clearly provide more for them on a day-to-day basis than the major one Quarier tries to serve. He creates a \\"rice convert\\" or two, but is ultimately a miserable failure.At Play in the Fields of the Lord is a classic tragedy of misunderstanding and miscommunication. If you haven't read it, it's worth that first read. If you have, it was probably long enough ago that it deserves a second look."},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"This book is the comparison of Missionaries Vs.

This is a book for people who want to tear the face off of reality. This is a great, honest and sad book. It is a requiem for indigenous people around the world, maybe for you"},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"If you are a first-year anthropology major, or just interested in non-western cultures, and the clash and misunderstandings that occur when two cultures meet, this book is definitely for you. While falling slightly into the \\"noble savage\\" trap, it does a fair job portraying a non-western culture's reaction to ours. The book dates itself rather badly, however, in the degree to which it features the typical 1960's revulsion of its own cultural roots. Whereas the Indian's religious customs are treated evenhandedly and sensitively even when they result in innocent people being murdered, the practitioners of the white-man's religion are in equal parts bats-in-the-belfry loony, criminally corrupt/cowardly/hubristic and/or hypocritical, or failing that, just plain ineffectual. Suffice it to say, that had the book been one-quarter as contemptuous toward the superstitions of the indians as it was to the superstitions of the whiteman, this book would never have been published.That being said, the book's themes of what separates man from animal, the power of nature's processes in an unconquered environment, and mutual incomprehension that accompanies so much of cultural interactions makes this book a fair read."},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"Although written a long time ago very relevant to what is happening now in our world.

This was the first of his novels I read and at the time I kept wondering if I was reading it aright, so powerful is it. Some passages simply stick in my head verbatim and I'm known for dropping them in front of people I think would appreciate them. It has one of, if not the strongest opening images of any book I've read: the yearning for that which is impossible and that which will destroy us, put into image and action, the way fiction should do. The last line in the opening is a real slammer. And so it goes, chapter after chapter. No movie can do what a novel can, especially this one."},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"This book has been on my list for a very long time. Finally, it showed up at a used bookstore and cried out, \\"read me!\\" So I did. Boy am I glad too.\\"At Play in the Fields of the Lord\\" puts you into the Amazon, making you watch for piranhas, drunken native people and nasty illnesses. But this isn't an adventure tale. There are no heroes in this novel. Instead this is the story of how religious fervor clouds common sense, fuels racism and results in the destruction of the people the missionaries so desire to convert.I really like how Matthiessen used this story about 20th Century Christian missionaries in the Amazonian jungle to comment on and inform the 19th Century Native American Genocide. Lewis Moon has Native American blood and was a standout Indian at his reservation in North Dakota but he couldn't play the white man's game and has a swift fall from grace. Moon's thoughts about his native ancestors helps connect up the North American experience with the brutal and fanatical attention paid to the Amazonian native people.For a book with a political agenda, \\"At Play in the Fields of the Lord\\" doesn't skimp on plot or character and the latter is what makes the book great. Whether its Hazel or her son Billy or Martin or Wolfe or Moon, you have a range of standout players who have real and distinct arcs. This is a book that starts slowly but the richness of atmosphere, character and plot made an indelible psychic mark on this reader."},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"Having enjoyed the movie, I was anxious to read this book. I find it hard to say which I liked better. Other reviewers have outlined the main features of the story. The characters are sharply outlined and deeply revealed. This is an excellent read. However, the end was a bit disappointing to me, as it seems to leave the reader \\"up in the air\\" regarding the main character's destiny. The best characterization, to me, was of the missionary's wife. I thought the most moving and, in a way inspiring, event was the missionary's death. Peter Matthiessen is a very good writer."},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"This book is just as good as the film, directed by Hector Babenco.

The rich, splendid descriptions of the Amazon rain forest are glorious, and the story is very sad but leaves an impact. At the end, when Lewis Moon has escaped down the Amazon and lands on a sand bar, there is one sentence I will always remember: \\"Orion and Sagittarius climbed the skies and looked down at their reflections in the clear water.\\"I could not attend, but Peter Matthiessen was one of the keynote speakers at the Texas Bigfoot Conference in Tyler, Texas this year, still going strong at age 82 as an author and wildlife naturalist!

A classical tale of colonialism, the story is riveting, even though a few of the characters (especially the missionaries seem prescribed. The reader turns and twists throughout the book and is continually surprised, yet the story progression remains clear."},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"This is an amazing story with deep and complex characters. As complex as the characters may be, they are all symbols and representations of greater concepts. For example, the missionaries that want to save the savage Niurana symbolize Western civilization and it's forced influence of many native tribes throughout history. On a deeper level the novel explores the perceptions of good v. evil and how that kind of thinking is limiting when the Catholics and Protestants are bothe seen as evil by the other side. Included into this melting pot is Lewis Moon, a Native American from the US who takes a drug and ends up living with the Niurana.There is no happy ending in this novel. It shows just how destructive stereotypes and preconceived notions of good and evil can be. But it is an ending that is throught provoking and that makes a statement about contemporary life in a global world.I would recommend this novel to anyone that would like a new perspective on globalization but it must be taken into account that this novel is not an easy one night read but a thought provoking (although enjoyable) journey to be savored."},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"I disagree with the above reviews, and I guess I'll say why. First this is not a book only about &quot;male behavior&quot;--Hazel and Andy are equally important, and their behavior turns the whole narrative around. I also don't find Moon to be an anti-hero who represents truth or is sympathetic in any way. He joins the Indians out of the sadly egotistic feeling that he can fool them into thinking he is a God. That's not respect, brother. Of course, he can't do it for long. Mostly, this is a book about getting in way over your head: that's the one trait every character shares (even the Indians). They are all being drawn into a situation out of their control, out of their element. One question: why the gender-reversal in the names of Leslie and Andy? (I realize Leslie is a male name in England, but Huben is AMerican, and 'Andy' isn't a female name anywhere with that spelling). I'd be interested to know, Peter, if you're reading. Mostly, this is the kind of novel that creates a wolrd so removed from our own, that it ends up BEING our own. I liken it to Robert Stone's 'A Flag for Sunrise' and Naispul's 'A Bend in the River' (about English-speaking foreigners in Central America and Africa respectively) Why doesn't the director who filmed 'The English Patient' film this?"},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"I am an evangelical Christian and I have recommended this book to many fellow believers about to embark on a mission somewhere. As far as I'm concerned, it's essential reading for anyone taking the Gospel to people who have never heard it.I also have lived and worked in the so-called \\"Third World\\" and seen the remnants of Christian mission work over the past several centuries -- the great, the good, the bad and the ugly.Matthiessen tells a story here of mostly bad, of course, and some ugly. Narrow-minded, holier-than-thus, do-good Christians come in and almost destroy a native culture. That, in itself, is indeed a fascinating if predictable story line.But the story does indeed include some of the good -- of self-discovery and loving sacrifice by one of the do-gooders, and of self-discovery and perhaps \\"deliverance\\" of another major character, a Native American Indian. All involved leave changed -- one way or another -- after the arrival of the do-gooders and their attempted intervention.It is an outstanding story that will stand the test of time, worth telling for a very long time to come.I highly recommend it to any thinking person anywhere."},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"This should be required reading for all missionaries intent on bringing Western values and religion to indigenous peoples. Perhaps they can see the folly of attempting to change a culture that predates Christianity by several thousand years. I do not want this to turn into a personal attack on Christians, but the last Stone Age tribes that exist beneath the canopy of the rain forest have lived, loved, fought, died and thrived for untold millenia without the help of white missionaries who more times than not bring with them illness that these people have never been exposed to (smallpox ring any bells?), and end up doing more harm than good. We have no business meddling in the affairs of a culture that most of us cannot understand and want to change because it is so unlike ours. The Niaruna in this book, the Yanomani in present day Brazil, need the light of white Christianity about as much as Masai of Africa need a McDonald's franchise in the Serengetti. Shrouded in darkness and demonism indeed. When will we learn to leave good enough alone?"},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"I have previously read and reviewed four other books by Peter Matthiessen, all of which I thought were fine books and to which I gave four stars. But I never quite thought of them as works of pure genius, not until I read this book. Here, Matthiessen's writing is so exquisite, nuanced and daringly spot-on that one scarcely knows how to describe it. He writes like an an angel or dmon swooping down upon the South American jungle landscape and deep into the inner lives of those who populate it with a searing lyrical torch. I've never read anything quite like it.The setting could not seem more banal or clich&eacute;d: hypocritical evangelists, a jaded Catholic priest, primitive Indian tribes, a corrupt Spanish officer etc. But Matthiessen sets them all to dancing through dark and light, death and life in this book.He describes the Spanish cathedral as seen though the eyes of a Protestant missionary's wife thus:\\"Though she knew no Latin, the priest's ritual voice in the unearthly light evoked half-memories of illuminated manuscripts, of fat abbeys and round-pated monks, fair countrysides and far cathedrals against towering windy skies crossed by dark birds.\\"and he describes the jungle as seen by a missionary thus:\\"He had wandered into a cathedral of Satan where all prayer was abomination, a place without a sky, a stench of death, vast somber naves and clerestories, the lost cries of savage birds - he whooped and called, but no voice answered.\\"But, most of all, he describes the world as seen by Lewis Moon, the anti-hero of the book, with a frightening, magical sharpness, as when he parachutes into the jungle here:\\"He blinked, in tears; he was alive again, laughing idiotically in the clean sunlight of the upper air, legs dangling and swaying like the legs of a rag doll, drifting, drifting down through the great morning, in a wild silence like the wake of bells.\\"I quote so extensively because it's simply impossible to convey the power of the book without putting its unearthly lyricism on display. Matthiessen is also a naturalist, of course, and his descriptions of the environment are as precise as his writing is ensorcelling, as profound as the depths to which he takes the readers into the souls of his characters.I don't know what else I can say save to urge every lover of literature to please, please don't let your life end without first reading this coruscating work of highest art."},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"What makes this book so compelling -- in addition to the complex plot and the fascinating characters -- is that it deals with life in the raw. As indicated by the other reviews, this book is many things to many people. How you perceive this book is pretty much what you bring to it. The other reviews are informative because of the different interpretations. But they all seem to agree on one thing: This is a profound, incredibly well-crafted literary classic that makes the reader think and may even make him or her change, just as surely as the characters in the book are transformed. One of the best books I've read in many a Moon."},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"Matthiessen's book deeply affected me, mostly because it is unsettling and so well \\"done\\" that I imagined myself doing and being all the beautiful and hideous things its characters do and are. The copy of the book I have has a one-line cover review that mentions something about the great compassion that comes across its pages. I agree with all the other reviews here on Amazon about what makes this book so great: evocative writing, a driving plot, compelling characters, an exotic yet beautifully and believably rendered setting, humor, horror, longing, lust, irony and juxtaposition of things as they are, and on and on. However, as I have thought often during the reading of the book I must say that I agree with the cover reviewer, and for me, what elevates this book to the highest level (which I believe it is on) is its compassion. Matthiessen shows his readers people being people, which as anyone can tell you, is often ugly. But, more importantly it is beautiful, and if you allow Matthiessen to show you how this can be, he will. I think this book is about perfect and reading it made me glad to be alive.\\"The way to innocence, to the uncreated and to God leads on, not back, not back to the wolf or to the child, but even further into sin, ever deeper into human life.\\" - Herman Hesse.I almost forgot to mention the above quote, inscribed in the opening pages of this book, which I believe states what I intended to convey in my review.Finally, I have not seen any discussion of Padre Xantes in any of these reviews and I was wondering if anyone would like to comment on him. To me, he was one of the most mysterious characters, especially in his final appearance where he eats a barely boiled egg. Thoughts?"},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"This is a very good book, but not great. Matthiessen's writing is engrossing and it is difficult to put it down. However, the vileness of some of the subject matter is a bit hard to swallow. This is, no doubt, a realistic tale, written after Matthiessen had traveled throughout the continent. The movie does have an influence, as one keeps thinking of Ms. Hannah. The plight and evolution of the natives and their values is intriguing. The disaster that results from outsiders forcing culture and religion down the throats of the \\"savages\\" is thought provoking and relates to many situations one sees. The characters aren't all that likable, but certainly very real. Hazel is a sad case. The jaguar shaman-to-be is a character about which it would be nice to learn more. Matthiessen says that he rewrote the last journey many times. This is the toughest part of the book to follow; is it real or a dream? I actually did reread parts of the end. There's no escaping the depression that comes from dwelling on the conflict in the jungle. I still feel that, despite the author's beliefs, his nonfiction work is better. But this is an enjoyable novel, regardless."},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"An excellent adventure story that is both fast paced and well developed. I've read a number of books by Matthiessen. This is the best I've read yet by him. His fiction is far better than his non fiction in my opinion."},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"Why do I never hear Matthissen's name come up when there is speculation about who will win future Nobel Literature prizes?AT PLAY is surely one of the great novels of the last half-century, and the reviewers hit on all of the reasons why. But add to that FAR TORTUGA, and the Watson Florida trilogy; and then add to THAT his brilliant and important non-fiction, from The Tree Where Man Was Born to The Snow Leopard, to In the Spirit of Crazy Horse; then, for good measure add in Matthiessen's involvement in The Paris Review, and you have a resume that is Nobel-quality.Hey, I love Roth, too (admittedly not everything), but get serious!"},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"While made into a disappointing film, this is a truly great novel that is on one level aobut missionaries in the &quot;Amazon&quot; trying to **save** the natives and on another level about the clash of egos that can consume us all. It is also a great character analysis of different types of male behavior"},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"This is a book that must be read slowly so that all of the impact can be absorbed mentally. The style of writing doesn't allow a person to speed read this wonderful book. It isn't wonderful because of it's happy ending or remarkable heroes. What makes it so good is that it is like a delectable meal---it should be enjoyed slowly and passionately. It is definately not &quot;fast food&quot; fare. One must savor every bite. The author's skill is in his knowledge of the heart and nature of diverse religious beliefs---catholic, native american indian, evangelical Christian, indigenous Amazonia indian and mysticism. The way he is able to describe the mind and feelings of the characters is truly a gift and talent. Then his descriptions of jungle life and habitat fascinate and charm the reader. If I had to pick out a hero in this story it might be Boronai (you'll just have to read and find out who he is) or Andy Huben the wife of the fanatical and narrowminded, misguided and misdirected evangelical missionary. He becomes such a &quot;scalp hunter&quot;, trying to win souls for Jesus, so that he can bost to his supporters back home, that he completely loses sight of the Lord's heart, plan, and purpose. As an evangelical Christian myself this attitude grieves me. These native indians were shrouded in darkness and demonism and needed to know the real and true Jesus Christ. Somehow this just wasn't happening. The lines between savage and civilized becam more blurred as the book moved on. Pick this book up and take your time reading it.

Email Boland7214@aol.co"},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"This novel is the story about the impact of outsiders on a tribe of Indians in the Amazon. Essentially two facets of the outsiders (read Western Civilisation) that are explored &#65533; the &#65533;sacred&#65533; in the form of missionaries, and the &#65533;profane&#65533; in the guise of mercenaries. Their stories told in alternating chapters, Lewis Moon and Martin Quarrier both have a purpose in mind - both feel that they can &#65533;save&#65533; the locals that are yet to come in full contact with Western Civilisation. Moon is part Native American, and at the beginning of our story he is a mercenary hired to kill the Indians. On a drug induced flight, he crashes into the jungle and ingratiates himself into the &#65533;wild&#65533; Indian tribe. His relationship with the tribe is really an extension of his life so far &#65533; he doesn&#65533;t quite fit in, no matter what he does. Quarrier is an evangelical missionary who has travelled with his wife and child to bring the word of God to Indians. Very early on, however, Quarrier has doubts about his own suitability, and then the broad-spectrum suitability of anyone using trickery to force a belief on the Indians. This brings him into conflict with his co-missionary, who is a stereotype of all that is wrong in the missionary movement &#65533; this character is a man more interested in his own personal reputation and the number of souls he has saved (or it looks like he has saved) than genuine results.This is a well written exploration of &#65533;missionaries and misfits&#65533; on the edges of civilisation. We have comparisons of Catholics and Evangelicals; comparisons between missionaries who are there for the greater glory of God (or the idea of God at least) and for the greater glory of their own name; and the attempts by different outsiders to &#65533;save&#65533; a tribe from other outsiders, with more concerns for their own agendas than the welfare of those they are trying to save. Oh, and there is some amazingly insightful writing about interpersonal relationships to boot.What I liked best about this book was that Matthiessen spared nobody &#65533; unlike some novels of this genre, the Indians are not simple &#65533;noble savages&#65533; &#65533; some are cleverer than others; the Indians aren&#65533;t all environmentally friendly, in-tune with nature good-guys (Moon takes them for task for their wasteful practices, but they don&#65533;t care)and Matthiessen takes the time to explain the motivations of his characters, something that can be sorely lacking in some novels.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good novel. For those with an interest in the specific topic area (the Amazon, 'Western' culture meets 'natives', missionaries) there is a lot here (if you liked Poisonwood Bible, i you would probably like this). But even if this is not an area you would naturally gravitate to, i would recommend it on the basis of Matthiessen's great writing alone.One point - the first 4 -6 chapters can be hard going, but stick with it - things pick up. It was for these first chapters that i docked a star (would have given it 4.5 stars if possible)."},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"Not since the reading of Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; have I read such a powerful and ironic novel as that of &quot;At Play In The Fields of The Lord&quot;. This book is a first rate masterpiece! Its subtle irony and dramatic content are the creation of literary genius. Rarely have I ever found an author whose work so moves me to not merely observe the characters, but instead BECOME the characters. Indeed, as the book's storyline progresses, the reader is drawn into a web of spiritual doubt and political corruption which leads the reader to question his own faith, morals, and even deeds. After all, at least once in our lives we shall become Lewis Moons for at least a brief moment. Whether this fleeting instance destroys an Amazonian culture or simply estranges your inlaws depends upon that person's individual circumstances. In the end, the reader *becomes* each of the novel's characters as we struggle to discover our purpose &amp; self identity. In the end, it is the reader who is left asking, &quot;Why?&quot;"},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"One theme I found to be particularly compelling in this book which has not been directly explored in the reviews currently posted is the search for identity which seemingly each character in this novel is engaged. Lewis Moon, a man who existes on the fringe of the dominant culture of the US, longs for validation in the culture of his ancestors, a culture which is tragically unavailable. The missionaries, Protestant and Catholic alike, seek identity and validation in the people they seek to convert, including the endless &quot;conversion&quot; of their own families. The other characters have their own identity issues. The most compelling of these searches, to my mind, was that of Lewis Moon who, without any feeling of loyalty to any culture available to him, seeks identity in an indiginous culture not yet eradicated by the dominant Chilean culture of European origin. (Perhaps he thinks he can help them avoid the fate of the culture of his ancestors.) The novel explores each character's basis for self-perception and what they do when their basic assumptions about their role in the world are challenged. What does it mean to be an American? What does it mean to be an American who has had his citizenship revoked? What does it mean to have faith? What if the dogma of your denomination appears to produce results that seem &quot;un-Christlike?&quot; What does it mean to indentify as a member of an indigineous people? What does that mean when you are among members of another indiginous people? All these questions (and there are many more) posed in the book have lead me to a better perception of who I am and why I think so. One of the best books I've had the pleasure to have read."},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"This book carried me WAY beyond the story line, using the questionable character of Lewis Moon as transportation. The well-meaning Quarriers were as lost and out of place in the jungle as the natives would have been if you dropped them off somewhere between 42nd Street and Central Park. And the death of the innocent child is a sacrifice to that ignorance.The journey of Lewis Moon away from civilization into the native life represents two things--a retreat from the sophistication of a society to which he did not seem to belong, and a search for an ultimate truth. As he penetrates further and further into the jungle, he comes closer and closer to the heart of life itself, and closer ultimately to death. This story is a mystery to which you have to write your own ending, and I dearly loved reading it!I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the juxtaposition of humor and tragedy, and the complicated contradictions of the human spirit"},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"I've always been a bit of an escapist, so this book was perfect for me. Peter Mattiessen is actually a travel writer, well qualified to describe the South American rain forest setting. What surprises is how well he conveys the brutal reality of what might befall us, should we find ourselves sitting at a rickety wooden table at La Concepci&oacute;n Taverna at the end of a mud street in the jungle.You will find yourself in the strangest company. It's hard to tell the savages from the decent white folk. The Missionary's wife appears to be losing her mind. The natives are restless. The mercenaries passing through town. You are about to meet Lewis Moon and, for some reason, you will not be able to look away.This is a disturbing book, no-one is spared, not even the reader."},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"One might not expect a naturalist explorer to be capable of weaving a dynamic, emotional, and gripping narrative on par with some of the best fiction writers of the last century, but that's exactly what Peter Matthiessen accomplished with At Play in the Fields of the Lord. His writing is strongly influenced by his extensive travels, and this, his fourth novel, is imbued with a particular verve. Set in the Amazon, the tale weaves in and out of the untamed jungle, featuring some of the most compelling and conflicted characters I've encountered.Martin Quarrier, his wife Hazel, and their son Billy have left their comfortable midwestern life to join Protestant missionary Leslie Huben and his wife in their ongoing struggle to convert an elusive local tribe, the Niaruna. Martin's respect for and interest in the tribal cultures encourages a different approach to conversion than the evangelical Leslie, and matters quickly become complicated when the local authorities (with Leslie's implicit approval) enlist the aid of two American ex-patriot mercenaries to bomb the tribes into submission. One of these is Lewis Moon, a half Chayenne Indian with a dark past who, under the influences of the powerful psychotrope ayahuasca, eventually decides to join the Niaruna and reclaim something of his lost dignity and sense of identity. Ultimately, the Niaruna are caught amongst the Protestant missionaries, the Catholic \\"opposition,\\" the local authorities, and partial-converts from other tribes; it is essentially a conflict no one can win.The narrative weaves between Martin and Moon's perspectives, as each comes to grips with their own inner conflicts about faith and identity. Matthiessen breathes further life into this story with a colorful, and very real cast of supporting characters. The ex-patriot mercenary Wolf, self-described \\"Anti-Se-mite Jew\\" and former compatriot of the disappeared Moon provides the occasional black humor. Matthiessen portrays Hazel's gradual disintegration with a frightening realism, building the books cumulative tension effectively. Leslie Huben, with his evangelical fervor and golden boy demeanor, becomes an unexpected antagonist as Martin struggles with his own faith.Matthiessen's treatment of the Niaruna and the other Brazilian cultures is realistic and sympathetic without being pandering or idealistic, where the aboriginals are portrayed niether as heathens or as noble savages. He approaches questions of faith, culture, morality, family, and spirituality with an understated ability without becoming mired in existentialism. His narrative is simultaneously raw and elegantly constructed, and is both an exotic and intimate read. At Play in the Fields of the Lord isn't mere travel fiction; it is a complex character study with a suspenseful, driven plot, and a thought-provoking examination of mission work. Matthiessen scrutinizes evangelical Christianity through a very sharp lens, and the faith of the individual missionaries remains complex and fascinating even to a non-believer. The novel's perspective on Christianity is a critical one, but is personalized through the actions of individuals without being universally condemning.The writing is comfortable and easily digested, while still evoking the complex themes and moods that make this novel so successful. The oppresive atmosphere, the sense of fear and uncertainty, the primeval jungle; all are richly evoked on these pages. It is a heartbreaking, rewarding, thought-provoking, and ultimately haunting read.~Jacquelyn Gill"},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"In Matthiessen's At Play in the Fields of the Lord, Lewis Moon, the mysterious and elusive mercenary with a good heart, steals every scene in which he appears. The story, in a nutshell, concerns the clash between 4 forces in a remote South American jungle reason: misguided Christian missionaries, corrupt local politicians, the near Stone Age jungle natives, and Lewis Moon. Beautiful progress of a story in which it's hard at any moment to know who to root for, a story in which no one really comes out a winner, and therein lies the moral."},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"The novel, At Play in the Fields of the Lord is excellent. It deals with the very important issue of brining missionaries into \\"uncivilized\\" countries. The novel shows how destructive it can be to interfere with other cultures, especially when it will ultimately hurt the civilization. In the novel, Evangelical missionaries go to South America to spread their religion to the Indians. This proves to not only be a mistake, but it is destructive to both the missionaries and the Indians. Our culture tends to always want happy endings in both stories and movies, but this story is well done because it does not show a happy ending. The missionaries do not come in and convert the Indians. Everyone does not end up living happily ever after. In fact, the opposite happens. Both the Indians and missionaries end up in despair. This book is well done because it exposes the realities of what can happen when people try to interfere with other cultures. The missionaries end up making a huge mistake which leaves the Indians with nothing. The missionaries also realize that they have made a huge mistake by interfering with the lives of the Indians, but by the time they realize what they are doing it is too late. I would recommend this book to anyone, and I also recommend that people watch the movie, which is also very well done. For anyone interested in reading the book,take your time with it, and really consider exactly what the message is, because I believe it is really up for interpretation."},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"The author excels on all levels. His description is not only accurate but lyrical; his characters are finely drawn; the plot is intricate and complex. The intent is clear: the missionaries are portrayed as being self-righteous and hypocritical. Only the child can make the true connection with the natives, and he becomes a sacrificial lamb. Moon emerges as an Adam figure, seeking his destiny and finding it at last by losing himself in the universe. What a magnificent book!"},{"Title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord","review":"I'm actually nearly 30, but I don't have an Amazon account so disregard the \\"kid\\" title. Before I read Matthiessen's work, I was a very very devout christian. I lived the \\"truth\\" as I believed it to be. I led a christian youth group at my high school, I was a member of a christian rock band and I was eagerly anticipating my mission trip to New Guinea, until I read At Play In the Fields of the Lord.A small group of American protestant missionaries venture into a dangerous and deep section of the Amazon rainforest to succeed where their Catholic rivals failed, who were killed by the people they were trying to convert. The result is a clash of civilizations and ideals, between the missionaries and the indians and even between the missionaries themselves and the indian tribe as well. The end result was one of the most sobering things I've ever read in my life.My question is, why? Why do we westerners feel the need to travel far beyond the reaches of our own nations to selfishly and arrogantly proselytize people who's only crime is being too geographically removed from the Middle East to know of a person we revere as a god? Why does it have to be this way? Why can't we just respect another's way of life? In all good conscience, I could not be a missionary after reading this book. If anything, it strengthened my love toward my fellow man and woman more than my church did because it taught me to live and let live.I urge others with similar dilemmas to explore this book.

In turn, I was quick to grab this old out-of-print collection of short stories from the mid-1960s upon finding a forlorn copy in a used bookstore. But note that the previous reviewer actually said very little about this particular book. Sci-fi (and to a certain extent, horror) fans with a historical mindset will find Disch's works to be worthy of much more respect and attention. But during the time period covered in this anthology he was not yet in his prime.Here we find Disch exercising ideas from the new wave of sci-fi that was breaking at the time, exploring sci-fi phenomena in earthly settings with psychological or political themes. Most of the short stories here were built on underdeveloped ideas or were restricted (in length) for magazine publication, and either way Disch was still finding his voice. Civil rights angst and cold war paranoia are common themes here, but Disch didn't explore such themes very fully in under-whelming tales like \\"The Number You Have Reached\\" or \\"1-A,\\" while some supposedly offbeat experiments in style like \\"Fun with Your New Head\\" and \\"The City of Penetrating Light\\" have aged very badly. Granted, there are a few winners in this collection, such as \\"Nada,\\" \\"The Squirrel Cage,\\" and \\"Casablanca,\\" all of which are given room to develop their ideas and which place Disch firmly in a new generation of 1960s sci-fi talent that would achieve greatness at a later date. But unfortunately, few of the stories in this particular anthology are truly memorable, and it should be tracked down only by collectors. For most interested readers, Disch's underappreciated talents are best found in later novels including \\"Camp Concentration,\\" \\"334,\\" and \\"On Wings of Song.\\" [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"Fun with your new head (Doubleday science fiction)","review":"thomas disch killed himself last week, july 4, 2008. a critic once called him \\"perhaps the most respected, least trusted, most envied and least read of all modern first-rank SF writers.\\" he was (surprisingly) best known for writing a popular children's book--\\"the brave little toaster.\\" but disch--a brilliant crank--wrote pretty much everything; poetry, sci-fi, so-called literature, horror. this book is a prime example of his unlimited imagination, subversive humor and chilling accuracy at capturing humanity in all its ugly glory. my favorite story in this collection is \\"the roaches.\\"disch is one of those under-known cult favorites whose status will only grow after his death, i'm sure. i'm sorry he didn't feel the full force of that appreciation while living."},{"Title":"The donkeys (Award Books combat series)","review":"The title comes from the German view of the English soldiers who charged into their machine guns and barbed wire: &quot;Lions led by donkeys.&quot; The donkeys were the professional officers of the British army that was destroyed in those battles, officers who were unable to adapt to the awful technology that changed the face of war forever. When I was studying under Michael (now Sir Michael) Howard at All Souls in 1972-4, he insisted that this book should be read by anyone who wanted to understand the early phase of the Great War. It is a classic and must be read by anyone trying to understand the impact of the War on the English people, and the shock of the early battles on the perception of the British military of what needed to be done. It is judgmental to be sure, and would not be the only source one would need to understand this critical transition, but it is nonetheless an essential text.Bob Rizzi Bethesda, MD"},{"Title":"The donkeys (Award Books combat series)","review":"The only thing really wrong with this book is that it only covers 1915. Otherwise, it gives a dismal, heartbreaking account of the way the British commanders on the Western Front destroyed what was left of their pre-war army, and failed to learn anything during the process. I wish Clark had covered the entire war.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The donkeys (Award Books combat series)","review":"I would be interested to have a written list of the \\"errors and lies\\" with which Clark's book is allegedly riddled. It is immensely readable and, if it is distorted and unhistorical, so is Sir James Edmonds' Official History, which Clark follows closely. The First World War is a terrible unhealed wound on the British psyche, and both the denigrators (Clark, Denis Winter, Leon Wolff) and the apologists (Terraine, Bond, Sheffield) are dangerous guides because they cannot overcome their own emotional interference (Terraine's biography of Haig contains more preposterous falsifications than are to be found in The Donkeys). I wouldn't take Clark alone as my guide to the British campaigns on the Western Front in 1915, but students would be better served by calm and factual analysis of the case he presents than by abusive phrases which tell us nothing except that he has hit a nerve in the abuser."},{"Title":"The donkeys (Award Books combat series)","review":"Alan Clark's scathing indictment of the British Army commanders in the first full year of the 1914-18 War is quite masterful, and, although possibly not intentionally, it paints a damning picture of the English class system of that period. The utter lack of regard for the lives of the lower ranked field officers and their men is quite palpable throughout Clark's description of the various 1915 engagements. The pointless wastage of men and materials in the battles of that year destroyed the old professional volunteer army, which was later replaced by an army of \`cannon fodder' conscripts.The overall commander of the army during the disasters of the 1915 debacles was virtually forced to resign as a result. The new Commander, was, if anything, more forceful in his attitude of unconcern regarding the wastage of young lives than the one he replaced."},{"Title":"The donkeys (Award Books combat series)","review":"Alan Clark's The Donkeys is a brief history of the British campaign in France and Flanders in the year 1915, focusing on the British defeats at the battles of Neuve Chapelle, Second Ypres, Aubers Ridge, and Loos. Clark blames the British defeats in 1915 on the incompetence of the British generals, whom he condemns as butchers, fools, and knaves. In Clark's opinion, the British Army in 1915 consisted of lions led by donkeys.The Donkeys is the only short and accessible account in print of the British battles on the Western Front in 1915. Unfortunately, The Donkeys is a terrible book: I studied it closely while researching my Master's thesis, and found it was riddled with errors and lies. It should never have been reprinted.But don't take my word for it: when The Donkeys was first published, in 1961, it received a number of blistering reviews. AJP Taylor wrote that The Donkeys &quot;lacks understanding and sympathy,&quot; &quot;disregards the most elementary rul! es of historical scholarship,&quot; and &quot;is valueless as a serious contribution to history.&quot; Michael Howard called The Donkeys a &quot;petulant caricature&quot; and dismissed it as &quot;worthless.&quot; Rudest of all was John Terraine, who called The Donkeys &quot;the apotheosis of distortion.&quot;If you are interested in the history of the Great War, then avoid this book. A much better and more recent book on this subject is Lyn Macdonald's 1915: The Death of Innocence."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties!

Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"Sometimes it's hard to plan a get-together where people enter a room and enjoy themselves with good food and drink and fine conversation. Authors such as Charles Dickens and Jane Austen wrote extensively about people who got together at parties where foods and drinks were served, and wonderful conversation ensued; perhaps that's what every host and hostess would love to hear at their parties. Reading books such as Barefoot Contessa Parties! and The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook make me grateful that someone like Ina Garten took the time to figure out how an average homemaker can create nice parties where the food is not only delicious but comfortable to assemble and enjoy with friends. Before I read the book, it wasn't easy even to prepare a brunch for eight, but with sensible ideas, I can offer guests something different without trying the &quot;omelettes for individuals&quot;, as Ina once did. Ina's Chinese Chicken Salad with the delicious peanut sauce is already in my refrigerator, as is the noodle pudding (rich and delicious). I loved the idea of pre-oiling and pre-heating the pan before creating homemade potato chips, and the Asian Grilled Salmon was a winner.

The recipe will need some serious tweaking for the home kitchen.The other recipe(s) that put me off were for the chocolate chip and peanut butter chocolate chip cookies. The recipes cannot be right! I thought it might just be a typo, but all three (there is one for chocolate chocolate chip cookies which I haven't tried because the other two were really terrible) are written with practically the same instructions. I have made a lot of cookies in my day and I've never had any cookies come out as badly as these did. There is no way you're going to bake tablespoons of cookie dough at 350 for 15 minutes and not have them come out burnt to a crisp! Mine were burnt on the outside and raw in the middle, and I took them out early. If you look at the picture where she is scooping out the cookie dough she's clearly using a very large cookie scoop for her cookies...so I'm wondering if someone made a mistake in the editing? Those recipes frustrated me to no end. I finally gave up after making the carrot cake cupcakes. They just weren't that great...they were bland and kind of dry.I love Ina. I want to trust Ina! But I think the recipes in this book are hit and miss. I don't want to go out on a bad note so I will say that the recipes for the lemon cake and orange chocolate chunk cake are worth the price of admission for me. (Those are my favorites that I've tried so far...I need a break from this book after the disappointing recipes.) Maybe the recipes don't all translate right when they're scaled down from large bakery size batches? I hope that's what it is."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I love the way Ina Gartner wrote this cookbook - the style is that of your best friend confiding her best secrets for successful entertaining. Basically her tenants are that entertaining is about the guests and the hosts interacting, not the food, and that cooking should be replaced as often as possible with &quot;assembling&quot;. Hear! Hear!This cookbook offers a wonderful *style* or approach to cooking and entertaining. Frankly, I don't think the recipes are in themselves all that special, but that's hardly the point. Gartner offers you a way to learn to entertain and to LOVE it. Thankfully, on that front, Barefoot Contessa Parties! really delivers. The book is devided into seasons and offers a complete menu for each party - a Valentine dinner, a football party, an afternoon tea, a not-Thanksgiving dinner, etc. She also offers her philosphy towards approaching the theme of the party, and also gives examples of her best and worst parties and why they worked (or didn't). Overall, the book is really entertaining in itself and makes you want to get into the spirit and have your own party, whether you use her recipes or not."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I am a convert to Ina Garten's belief that parties should be fun for all, even the hostess! She tells how you can arrange as much as possible in advance so you can enjoy your guests and provide a relaxed atmosphere. She admits to having made the same mistakes we all have, such as producing individual omelets for 20 breakfast guests and never getting out of the kitchen!The recipes are great, and are grouped together for different types of parties: lunch in the garden, pizza party, Sunday breakfast. Most recipes are simple and well tested, thanks to her successful store. So I was bewildered to find that the filet of beef recipe calls for a VERY expensive cut of meat to be spread with butter and then cooked at 500 degrees! Smoke started billowing from my oven (I had to carry the meat outside!) and I had to refer to another cookbook to adjust the temperature and time. But I loved the Sour Cream Coffee Cake, Hummus, Asparagus and Snap Peas, and Orzo with Roasted Vegetables.I will be using the cookbook often, both for recipes and for approach."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"For years I've looked for a menu cookbook to replace &quot;The Southern Living Party Cookbook&quot; that I have relied on since my early married days. In &quot;The Barefoot Contessa Parties,&quot; Ina Garten offers simple, delicious dinners with fresh ingredients that are easy to find and dishes that are fun and easy to prepare and that work well together. After I brought the book home, I made a different menu for three consecutive weekends, and haven't been disappointed yet. All my friends are getting this cookbook for Christmas."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"This is my favorite of Ina's cookbooks because the recipes are so easy and the party ideas are so much fun! Even if you aren't planning a party, the recipes can be used daily for regular meals and the dishes can be mixed with other recipes throughout the book.Definitely worth buying for the gourmet and regular cook alike!"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I will not say the recipes are not nice, they are. Most are very simple to prepare and ingrediets are easy to find which is nice. What makes this book is the authors willingness to share her experiences. After throwing a few parties myself, I to learned people enjoy themselves more when you join them and can actually take part in the evening as opposed to running back and forth from the kitchen. Ms. Garten has provided a well rounded selection of menus, recipes and party ideas. Along with this she has also added tips for planning and pulling off a sucsesful party. I highly recommend reading the introduction to the book and to each chapter, don't just thumb through the recipes you will miss out on the purpose for the book. I wish I had had a copy 10 years ago when I hosted my first production. I say production as opposed to party since like Ms. Garten's idea of omletes for everyone, I spent most the night in the kitchen and away from my friends who felt quilty because I was in the kitchen and to tired to enjoy their company."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"This book is GREAT! I've made a number of the recipes and they've all been a big hit! My favorite is the orzo with roasted vegitables. The asparagus chicken salad is also very good! I recommend this book because the recipes are easy to follow and they all taste great!"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I have seen Ina Garten on the Food Network and liked her simple and elegant foods. Her book is just as wonderful as her show. Her recipes ARE simple to follow, each with fabulous pictures. They are elegant and great tasting. She supplies an entire menu for each &quot;party.&quot; I have made several recipes for friends and each has gotten rave reviews. If I have one small criticism. it is that not all recipes have the amount of servings supplied. But overall, this is a wonderful asset to any kitchen!"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I absolutely hate to give anything than a 5-star review for an Ina Garten book but I didn't love this one and not because I didn't love the recipes. I presumed that this book would be more focussed on finger foods, cute canapes and serving large groups of people, such as the recipes inMartha Stewart's Hors d'Oeuvres Handbook. Most of Ina's other books seem to serve 8 people and this one is no different, serving 8 people is not that hard, it's the 20 plus parties that I find tricky! I'm always looking for new books for large crowds and this one isn't that book, unless of course you can afford to serve full sized lobster rolls for 40..."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I love the Contessa's cookbooks. They are reliable, the meals are delicious and generally easy to pull off. I ordered this so I'd have some menu ideas for a Fall party we host, and I have to say, I was disappointed only because there were so many fish dishes. This would obviously not be a problem for seafood lovers, but neither my husband nor I care for seafood at all, so the number of recipes I am interested in is severely reduced. That's my only complaint. Otherwise, the same high quality recipes and photos."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I recieved the book in excellent condition. This is such a great way to purchase books! I will be doing it again!! The cookbook itself is hugely impressive for someone just beginning to entertain or just want a few new ideas. Simple to follow and recipes are not too fussy yet delicious!"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties!

At this point, I am thinking of keeping the book as it has many recipies that I wish to try. Love the fact that she does not have weird strange ingredinets necessary for the dishes."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties!

Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I have owned Barefoot Contessa Parties for several years. This was given as a gift because my friend praised everything she tasted that I made from the book. I do not enjoy long hours in the kitchen; don't like fancy recipes and parties intimidate me. Everything I have made from the book came out well."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"Ina's books are so beautifully illustrated. The recipes are wonderful my family and friends enjoy everything that I have prepared. The Chinese Chicken Salad was good but the dressing called for an 1/2 cup of peanut butter, and 4 teaspoons of kosher salt. When making this dressing, do not include the extra salt because peanut butter is salty enough without adding more to it. I just thought that the salt content was too much. Other than that, bon appetit!"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"This is a must-have for your cookbook collection! I've watched Ina on Food Network for a while but this was the first cookbook of hers that I bought. There are beautiful pictures of every single recipe (yay!) and the recipes are so delicious! The low down on what I've tried:Shrimp salad - Even friends who don't like shrimp loved this salad. Very easy and so good!Chinese chicken salad - Great foundation recipe; added shredded cabbage, carrots and cilantro.Pasta, pesto and peas - A whole bowl of pasta pesto is normally too much of the same basil oil flavor for me, but this recipe makes it delicious and so easy to eat bowls and bowls of it! I added some sundried tomatoes for a little more zip.Lemon cake - One of the yummiest desserts EVER! Added a side of mashed raspberries but also great alone.Asian grilled salmon - It's a little on the salty side but the flavor is great.Grilled herb shrimp with mango salsa - Hands down, the best shrimp I've had at home, at a restaurant, anywhere! You'll be totally wowed! I didn't think the mango salsa was necessary at all though.Potato pancakes with caviar - I didn't add the caviar, but the pancakes with just the creme fraiche was super tasty!I've never been disappointed with any of Ina's recipes - she rocks!"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"This cookbook is absolutely fantastic. As are all of Ina Garten's books. I have cooked at least half of the recipes and they never fail to get rave reviews. The recipes use common ingredients which are easy to find and no fancy techniques are required. It is also nicely illustrated. Watch out though if you are \\"fat\\" conscious! Low-fat is not her style!"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"A beautiful book to read and just to have on your coffee table.But an even better book to use. Beautifully illustrated and wonderfully written."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"Ina garten is one of my favorite cookbook authors. Her writing is clear and concise and I can trust her recipes will always be good. A lot of people says she name drops and uses too many recipes from other peopple. But everyone knows that you can't come up with a recipe out of thin air. They are based on something else. She's just giving credit to the people on whom she based her recipes off of. Recipes in here include: Baked Virgina Ham, Butternut Squash and Apple Soup, assorted cookies, Rugelach, Strawberry Country Cake, Ceaser Sald with Pancetta, Pesto, Peach and Raspberry Shortcakes, Fennel Soup Gratin, and many other recipes. There are many recipes in this book that I like. I made the Grilled Herb Shrimp for a party of my mom's and it was edelicious. I'm a vegetarian, so I didn't eat them, but everyone raved, and I can tell their comments were sincere. Plus somebody asked me for the recipe, a true sign that it is very good. The Lemon Cake in here is also very good, and the orange variation in the Barefoot Contessa Family Style is my father's favorite cake. I also made the Cranberry Fruit Conserve for Thanksgiving and it was perfect. I didn't put the raisins and nuts in it though, it was optional, and I thought it wouldn't be that good in traditional cranberry sauce. She also introduced my mom and I to fennel. My mom never used it before, and she is quite the cook. I never used it either. So we tried it in the Vegetable Pot Pie. It was delcious! The crust was perfect, and the variety of vegetables was great. It was the perfect vegetarian meal for me. I can't wait to try more recipes.Also, on a side note many people from her second book say they have trouble cooking at 500 degrees. We cleaned our oven and wiped it down before making the Penne with Five Cheeses from her third book(which we thought was delicious) no smoke at all. You just have to listen to her when she says to make sure your oven is really clean before cooking at 500 degrees. There shouldn't be a problem."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I love cookbooks especially \\"entertainment/party planning\\" cookbooks and I feel in love with this book from day one. Every recipe I have tried has been soooo good! I had to write this because I tried the Chicken Chili yesterday and it was excellent and it made me realize that Ina hadn't gone wrong by me yet. The Roasted Asparagus and scrambled eggs (two things I would have never put together) were superb not to mention her shrimp salad that keeps me craving it every week, the Spinach Gratin and Smashed Sweet Potatoes that made me want to have Thanksgiving Dinner at my house this year (that's a first!) and her roasted cherry tomatoes were all wonderful! If you are like me and love easy cooking/entertaining that your guests and family would rave about please get this book! I'm definitely a Barefoot Contessa fan!"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"Let me start by saying, the Barefoot Contessa books are the first ones I take out when I'm looking for a recipe. All the recipes are so good and really very simple. It has great pictures which are so helpful and easy to follow directions. Everything I've made from her books has been great. Now I'm waiting for her next book!!"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"This is the most amazing book from my favorite party planner in the world! Great recipes and ideas with the utmost detail and elegance. If you like throwing parties for any reason at all, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"Have you ever noticed that when you go to a party where everyone is hanging out in the kitchen, those parties are the most fun? Well, Ina encourages guests to participate in the last minute food preparation. She puts on fun music and takes a more relaxed approach.Ina Garten decided she would rather cook because it was her true love and left her job as a budget analyst in the White House in 1978 to follow her dream of opening a specialty food store. She now owns The Barefoot Contessa in East Hampton, N.Y. Over the past 23 years, this has become a culinary destination. It is now a 3,000 square foot market where 20 cooks prepare the food and another 20 people help customers in the store. The scent of rosemary and fresh French bread dances in the air. They prepare fresh salads and dinners according to what's in season. In this book, you will find many of the good ideas and delicious foods that you can find in the store.After years of her customers asking for her recipes, she finally revealed some of her secrets in her first book: \\"The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook.\\" I was very impressed with Ina's first book and gave her book as gifts to friends. This book is equally beautiful and James Merrell has done a wonderful job photographing all the food styled by Rori Spinelli.When you open this cookbook, you will feel like you are entering Ina Garten's world. The lush color picture of her home with the door left open is so wonderful and you feel like you could just walk inside and smell freshly baked chocolate chip cookies and take one right off the plate!So, where will you find Ina when she is hosting a party? You might find her whipping up Tropical Smoothies (page 39) and chatting with a friend in the kitchen. Someone might be helping to cook the scrambled eggs with asparagus (page 34) while another guest is cutting the Sour Cream Coffee Cake (page 37). These are all recipes in the Sunday Breakfast section.Was I impressed by her new cookbook? Yes. She has organized it so well and I love the party themes by season. Each recipe has a refreshing header and sometimes gives a variation for the recipe. The parties are divided into Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. They include a Sunday Breakfast, Pizza Party, Jewish Holiday, Academy Awards, Canoe Trip, Lunch in the Garden, Happy Birthday, Outdoor Grill, Football Party, Autumn Dinner, NOT Thanksgiving, Afternoon Tea, New Year's day, Snow Day, Valentine's Dinner and Fireside Dinner Parties.The Index is also well organized. The book design is superb and is all a cookbook author could wish for. Except for a few recipes, the entire recipe is on one page and you don't have to turn the page to read the directions in most cases. The instructions are not numbered. A space between various instructions gives you the idea that you are onto a new step, so they are easy to follow. Her recipes are not difficult to make. Most of the dishes can be prepared in advance.I also love her writing style. When you read her notes, you feel as if she is talking to you and you are sitting out on the deck with a glass of lemonade. Each party begins with a page telling you something funny about a party. \\"I'll never forget the worst party I ever gave.\\".....pg. 33 Ina also shares her wisdom from years of catering and planning parties. Some of the things she writes in this book are just laugh out loud funny! She is so daring and has been catering parties professionally for more than twenty years. I mean, why not serve dinner in the study by the fireplace! I love her creativity.\\"Drag the table out on the porch and set big platters of cut melons, papayas and long stemmed strawberries down the middle. Put out baskets of fresh bread and coffeecake. Have hot coffee in thermoses out where people can help themselves. The food will be the decoration.\\" - Ina GartenI can truly say that every recipe in this book looks just divine. I made the chicken chili recipe today, but in half the quantity. The ingredients included chicken breast that you bake while the onions, tomatoes and bell peppers simmer on the stove top. You just toss in the diced baked chicken and then in a few minutes, dinner is ready. You may use green bell peppers in place of the more expensive red and yellow bell peppers. I also used Mexican-style canned tomatoes since I had those on hand. You can also make the recipe even if you don't have a food processor. Just use a kitchen shears to cut up the tomatoes right in the cans. A 6-quart pot works well and someone might want to include more pan/pot sizes in a future printing, especially for new cooks.Now, I am thinking that to really have a real Barefoot Contessa Party, you might want to order her great coffee, the Contessa Blend. It was invented over twenty years ago and is a blend of coffee with cinnamon. While you are ordering the coffee from her site, I dare you to resist ordering some double-chocolate brownies.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties!

Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I wouldn't start with this book -- I actually 'inherited' it from someone who didn't care for it. I like the recipes, but the book is laid out as a series of party menus, rather than desserts in one section, main dish in one section, etc. While I appreciate the menu suggestions (they are a big help, as I am sometimes stymied as to what to serve with what), I would rather see them listed in the back of the book, rather than have the book organized this way.

Her commentaries are also entertaining to read and helpful. And, I can't believe it, but she included a recipe for a lemon cake in this new book that I noticed in one of the pictures from her first cookbook.

I much prefer cookbooks to be arranged by course or main ingredient and then list suggested menus in the back. Parties contains sixteen different party menus (Sunday Breakfast, Academy Awards, Football, Valentine's, etc.) for each occasion with a varying number of courses or recipes for each menu. Shockingly, considering this is my least favorite Ina cookbook, there are quite a few standout recipes, including:Sunday Breakfast's Sour Cream Coffee CakeCanoe Trip's Pasta, Pesto, and Peas and Lemon Cake (this one may be worth the price of the book alone)Outdoor Grill's Endive and Avacado SaladAutumn Dinner's Salad with Warm Goat CheeseValentine's Dinner's Sauteed Cabbage (I only eat cabbage in a Fish Taco or sauteed like this-- couldn't be more delicious!)I would recommend this cookbook (especially after reviewing all the recipes I love listed above)."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties!

And hey--Ms. Garten looks GOOD!"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I try not to miss any of Ina's Food Network TV programs and always look for one of her recipes when I want to cook something new. PARTIES is just the tip if the iceberg, so to speak, when it comes to her advise and menus for parties where the host has fun, too. This is a wonderful book and I'm sure the recipes are the best. Now I'd like to see Ina put out a party book with step-by-step recipes that can be prepared ahead of time and then completed in a very short time just before serving. She has me enjoying small informal dinner gatherings; planning better menus for friends and family; and I'm actually more organized BEFORE my guests arrive. It's the timing and the last minute \\"things to do\\" that I need help with. Maybe I just need her in the kitchen with me! Made her Pastitsio for a Canasta party last weekend and it was wonderful."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties!

I don't have the first Barefoot Contessa book yet, I have my mother's copy and I am hoping she forgets I have it. I recommend this book highly. I guess I must mention my favorite cookbook is The Ultimate Southern Living Cookbook. It's only my favorite because it is all purpose and has how to make just about everything in it--it's a great reference cookbook."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties!

Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"We haven't had Ina on TV here in Australia for that long, but she is gathering a huge following. Loved the recipes in the book but thought the book would contain more helpful hints, surely she has learnt many valuable trouble shooting/time saving/setting up techniques over the years. The book was good though, I would recommend it for anyone looking for a great collection of her wonderful recipes. Lesley Garard Queensland Australia."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"She's a lively writer and her general attitude (don't work so hard that you nod off during the main course) is surely welcome. But there's little here for those of moderate means. Can you afford beef tenderloin for eight? And who eats this much, anyway? If you've got more splash than cash, try Prue Leith's Dinner Parties."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties!

I just love Barefoot Contessa!"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"Ina Garten has brought sanity and great food to entertaining at home.The great thing about this book is the style everything is served and prepared in, though it uses a bit more fat than I would cook with for everyday meals. She is a friend of Martha Stewart but her recipes are very un-Martha like in preparation. Ina does not have a staff of hundreds to make everything just perfect for that dinner party for the magazine. This lady runs a business on her culinary skill - she does what works with a minimum amount of fuss - it tastes wonderful AND looks great.I have received rave reviews for the Sour Cream Coffee Cake, the Happy Birthday! meal, and the Chocolate Ganache Cake. The Chocolate Cake went over big. It was so easy to make, it was an afterthought while putting together a meal for six at the very last minute.You will not be disappointed with this cookbook."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I had planned to try a few more recipes before writing a review. But after making and eating 2 of the Chocolate Chunk Cookies that are photographed on the back cover of &quot;Barefoot Contessa Parties&quot; it's apparent that anyone who is thinking of buying this book should quickly do so. The cookies are great, they remind me of the kind that were made by a company 'David's Cookies'. Only Ina's are better.Yummm. Or as my 6 year old son Alex has just said,&quot;They are extremely super.&quot; Last night I made the Brisket recipe but had to exchange water plus ketshup for tomatoe juice - no time to get back to the store. The results were a major success. Alex who has always refused my previous brisket attempts devoured slice after slice. As did my husband and our 10 year old. Tonight will be the vegetable pie recipe. Ina has written an introduction that clearly states the best parties are the ones you can easily prepare for and then happily join your guests. There are four Chapters:Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Fall. Each chapter has 4 menu planners with a brief introduction story ( filled with tips and personal info.for each menu). Each of the various menu's have easy to prepare recipes that are up to Ina's superior standards. I plan on testing them all. Hope she writes the next one within a year. Personally I enjoy her positive attitude that is clear in each of her many and varied recipes."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I love to cook and bake but I run screaming from complicated recipes. This cookbook contains simple recipes for really great-tasting food. It is uncomplicated and the adjoining photographs are simple and elegant. Never have I found a cookbook where page after page I have found recipes that I actually want to try.I made the ceasar salad the first day I bought the book, the sour cream coffee cake the second. Both turned out fantastic! Tomorrow I shall conquer the delicious-looking rugelach.The book is touted for parties but don't let that fool you. These are great recipes for simple family dinners as well as large parties. The book is also sprinkled with Ina Garten's advice and past experiences.I thank Ina Garten for this wonderful new cookbook - but moreover, my husband thanks her!"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"Ina Garten has it down to a science - but a very relaxed science, at that. She teaches you how to throw a dinner party, garden party, even a child's birthday party with maximum style and class, and minimum stress. I love this book. I love the recipes and ideas and have used many of them on different occasions - often mixing and matching from different sections. The book is divided into four seasons, which makes perfect sense when planning a party - because it makes life so much easier when you use what is seasonally available for recipes as well as planning seasonally appropriate venues and activities for the party - indoor vs. outdoor, what type of drinks to enjoy, etc. I can't say enough good things about this book - you need it in your cookbook collection. I loaned it to someone and missed it dearly for the several weeks it was gone. I even considered purchasing a second one - just in case."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"It doesn't top her first book, but boy, it's close! My only complaint about the book is that it's a little hard to find the recipes by category (looking for an entree? you'll have to search under poultry, seafood, etc... in the index) so I give it 4 stars, not 5. However, there is no complaint about the recipes themselves! Just like in her first book, everything I've made from this has turned out beautifully. AND, as a bonus, that beautiful looking lemon cake pictured in the dessert trays from the first book, but sadly not listed as a recipe, is included in this book. Ina Garten is my hero! I only wish the Barefoot Contessa store wasn't on the other side of the country."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I loved her first book so when this one came out I had to get it. I was not disappointed. I've made the Herbed Grilled Shrimp with Mango Salsa a couple of times now and everyone loved it. The Garlic Roasted Potatoes were so easy and delicious. I even e-mailed Ina to tell her how much I enjoyed her books and 2 days later she replied to my e-mail. I highly recommend this book to those who entertain and go into &quot;panic mode&quot; when company's coming (like me). The last 2 times I've entertained I've used recipes from her books and I was so relaxed because I wasn't rushing around that I finally got to enjoy myself without having to excuse myself from my guests to finish food preparations."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"This cookbook offers easy-to-follow, easy-to-prepare recipes that nonetheless produce delicious and elegant results. It offers tips for planning parties and creating menus aimed at getting the cook out of the kitchen and into the living room to spend more time with guests. Most of the recipes use ingredients that can be found in any supermarket, which is a big plus, and many of the recipes can either be prepared quickly or in advance. The recipes are broken down by season and then by occasion, which enhances the usefulness of the book, and the recipes are printed in a large font that's easy to read. Plenty of sumptuous photographs, too. This cookbook will be of use not only to anyone who enjoys entertaining, but to those of us who enjoy creating great meals even in the absence of a special occasion.There are some flaws, however. First, there's way too much name-dropping. Who cares if the author parties with the rich and famous? Do we really need to know this? Secondly, the menus often call for dishes or components which the reader is directed to locate in the author's other cookbook, &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot;. There's no reason that those recipes couldn't have been reprinted here to save the reader the bother of hunting down and purchasing another book. I couldn't help but cynically wonder whether this wasn't a bald-faced attempt to boost sales. Thirdly, the oven temperature is missing from the recipe for &quot;Rori's Potato Chips&quot;--a minor error which will no doubt be corrected in subsequent editions. Apart from these flaws, I nonetheless recommend this cookbook wholeheartedly. After checking it out of my local library and taking it for a test-drive, I decided that it was well worth purchasing."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I was very disappointed with this cookbook. I read all the rave reviews and somehow expected the book to help me plan and pull off elegant dinner parties with recipes for those. Instead it has tips and recipes for doing everything but (i.e. a make your own pizza party, a new years day brunch, a tea party). The ideas, recipes and strategies for creating a relaxed atmosphere are good, but the book's philosophy is that those fancy Saturday night dinner parties should be avoided. If you agree, then this may be the book for you-- but it wasn't what I wanted."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I just love to read the intros to great cookbooks. They tell the story of the rest of the work. Here, what I never knew before about this great cook: how she came to the Barefoot Contessa: She loved to throw great parties!Arranged around the four seasons, she provides four menus for events like Sunday breakfast, Canoe trip, Birthday, Christmas, Snow Day, Fireside Dinner.Great solid recipes that are not too complicated or overpowering on the exotic ingredients nor techniques, just great party offerings such as: Perfect Poached Fruit;Carmel Chocolate Nut Ice Cream; Smashed Sweet Potatoes with Apples (this is soooo good!!); Fennel Soup Gratin; Vegetaple PotPie.Couple this with lavish Clarkston Potter superb layout, writing and color photos, and advice on scheduling, decorating, invites, etc. and this is great work for you who like Ina enjoy feeding and entertaining others.

Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I class myself as a good cook when I follow a recipe and it turns out well. I love to entertain but have generally ended up in a sweat and not really enjoying the event itself. Then I discovered Nigella Lawson and Ina Garten.Barefoot Contessa Parties is for the woman who wants to relax and enjoy the party when cooking for other people. She has a busy life and cooking is somewhat of a hobby.Barefoot Contessa Parties and Nigella Lawson's How To Eat (plus a double oven) gave me more confidence to cook for others and experiment with my own ingredients to adapt recipes than any of your Joy of Cooking or famous chef books. My kitchen is clean and tidy when guests arrive (a big plus for me being a messy cook) and the food is great. I also had dinner at a friend's house some months ago when the most delicious lamb was served. I've long envied the way it was cooked to discover the recipe in Barefoot Contessa Parties!On another note - there have been mixed reports about the beef tenderloin recipe. It worked for me. Perfectly. Yes, the oven smoked but the meat was superb and my guests were very complimentary. This will now be one of my staple dishes when entertaining.Please try Nigella Lawson's How to Eat or any book by Nigella. She too is an advocate for keeping it simple and being with your guests. She's also famous for the quote &quot;after all, it's only dinner&quot;"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I enjoy cooking and eating and reading about cooking and eating.I received this book as a gift and I have had a lot of fun with it.Garten's recipes are relatively easy and presented with beautiful pictures. She offers suggestions and menus for a number of different occasions: lunch in the garden, a birthday party, a fireside dinner for two. I am always most interested in the author's approach to cooking and event planning. Garten shares such information as &quot;organize like a caterer&quot; and offers such tips as have your guests share in the cooking.My only criticism-I wish she had put more of herself in the book. I am a Nigella Lawson devotee. With her books, I feel like she is in the kitchen next to me. With Garten, I feel as if she jotted down her tips and handed them to me.I would recommend this book to cookbook lovers and to beginner and more advanced cooks with entertaining ambitions. I would not recommend this book to individuals who want just one or two cookbooks-this book focuses more on party and event planning.I also believe that it makes an outstanding gift."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I must admit, I collect cookbooks like coffee table books. This one works well as a coffee table book (lovely pictures of food looking gorgeous, and readable text). But not to belittle the book, it is also a terrific cookbook. I've tried 3 recipes so far and they turned out fabulous! (the grilled prawns were my favourite).The recipes were easy to follow and this book is definitely moving from the coffee table to my kitchen.Why not 5 stars then? The self-advertising is a bit too obvious."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"First off, yes, I like Ina Garten's books--and her cooking. Most of the recipes here are simple; the food, satisfying. But this book is too enamored with its own success. Most egregious are the listed recipes that are not found in the book, but are simply referenced to her first book. Savvy marketing, no doubt. It makes sure you buy both books. But irritating, nonetheless. And there's just so much rank sloppiness going on. The party for twenty? Look at the yield in the recipes--some are for 6 people, some are for 8, others, more. So what do you do if you're indeed having twenty over? Someone, I think, just slapped together a bunch of recipes and thought, well, we're already a success. Why sweat the details?"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"After hearing rave reviews about this cookbook, I skipped my usual recipe test run on my family and prepared the Academy Award menu for 8 guests last weekend. The appetizers, roasted cherry (I used grape) tomatoes and the potato recipes were very, very good, but the beef tenderloin was not. Just like the reviewer below wrote, my oven filled with smoke from the [$$$] piece of beef ....the timing for the medium rare tenderloin was not even close ( yes, I checked my oven temperature and it was correctly holding the 500 degree temp) and the seasoning was blah. I will experiment with this cookbook more, but will not experiment on my guests first!"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"Party foods are different than the foods you expect to find in a normal cookbook. As Ms. Garten says, you want foods you can prepare in advance and join the party yourself. But, it is also a good thing to do some of the cooking while the party is going on. Perhaps she has higher class parties than I do, but I find that parties seem to break into smaller groups, one of which is in the kitchen. And to cook something - like fresh baked bread while the party is going on is a good thing to do. If nothing else it puts out such good smells.I also find some of her dishes would be just as suitable for use with a regular meal. I'm going to try her Spinach Gratin tonight. I like spinach anyway, and perhaps it's just the picture, but it looks and sounds so good.If the weather were just a bit warmer, I'd also prepare the Vanilla Armagnac Ice Cream. But I think I'll wait a few weeks.Any way, here are some very good ideas, and that's why you buy cookbooks."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties!

I'm just out of college and always trying to find things that taste good, are easy/quick, inexpensive, and healthy, though usually I have to sacrifice one or more for the others. This recipe tastes amazing, one of my favorite foods, and is also really easy. Since it's made from apples, onions, and squash, it's healthy, relatively inexpensive, and the ingredients stay good longer than most fresh fruits and vegetables (I always have trouble with fruits, vegetables, herbs, etc. going bad before I make my dish).My mom also makes the beef tenderloin (filet mignon?)- though not with the sauce; it's our favorite thing for Christmas."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties!

It is not a book the serious cook would need for their bookshelf. Many of the recipes are variations of those found in her friends homes and restaurants. I was looking for a more original approach to her entertaining and found it lacking. Unfortunately it appears to have been written for her fame rather the cooking.

Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"This book is, sadly, for me (living in Australia), and a caterer, largely a coffee table book. I had to order the book through Amazon as it was not available locally.Many of the ingredients (as stated in the book) are not available in Oz, though I know they (or similar) are available here (and, I guess, elsewhere) under other names. However, those names are not forthcoming. I find this a source of extreme frustration, especially in this so-called world of globilization. I feel the author(s) should pay some heed to the so-called dreaded &quot;globilization&quot; trend in order to peddle their &quot;wares&quot; book.The book was a vision-splendour. Martha Stewart's fingerprints were all over it (not that that's a &quot;bad thing&quot;.) I've been a &quot;Martha friend&quot; since her &quot;Fast Menus&quot; series, the &quot;Martha's Christmas&quot; (wow, has *that* saved my tail for 10 years or more) and other &quot;Martha books&quot;. However this is not meant to be a &quot;Martha book.&quot;This book is good, don't get me wrong, but, in my humble opionion, it is centred too much on the foods available on the US East Coast (without giving alternative suggestions for use elewhere, especially Internationally).My suggestion, for what it's worth, re-edit the book and give alternatives for some of the foods (especially seafood/ vegetables and meat/poultry to some extent) and you'll have an International best seller on your hands.Happy Eating!"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties!

I saw her a few times on the Food TV network and fell in love with her homey, down-to-earth style of cooking and entertaining. She has easy ideas and her food is delicious. I like her comments in her margarita recipe, not to use the expensive kind, but use the inexpensive type of tequila. She is my kind of lady with comments like this.Her book is well illustrated with pictures of the recipes that are in this book. What I really enjoy is that the recipes are quality recipes that turn out very well. Some of my favorites that I have tried from this book are the apple crostata, which is a rustic apple pie that tastes devine. California pizzas, so much better than take out with fresh mozzarella, basil, and fresh tomatoes. Her chocolate chunk cookies will have everyone asking you for more.I can't say enough nice things about this book, but I like what lies behind this book. Good food doesn't make the party, its the good company. You should spend your time and efforts with those that you love, and not be so exhausting when you entertain you can't enjoy yourself either. All of her recipes really fit this theory as they are pretty easy to put together, but taste like they came from a fancy restaruant."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I love this cookbook! Ina's new TV show demonstrates many of these recipes, which really makes the whole process very easy. My favorites so far are the beef tenderloin with Gorgonzola sauce (fabulous), the Garlic Roasted Potatoes, and the Lemon Cake. The Lemon Cake is a staple in my summer entertaining menus; just a little whipped cream and fresh raspberries and you have a wonderful end to any meal.Most of the recipes are easy to make ahead, so you can get out of the kitchen and be with your guests."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"When I first heard that Ina Garten had a new cookbook coming out I was as excited as I'd ever been as a young child waiting for Santa on Christmas Eve!! I thought to myself that if her new cookbook would be anything like her first book, &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot; then this was something I simply had to have. Well, I managed to get a copy of this new cookbook a day before it was actually released and I have to say that I am not disappointed. Once again, Ina has amazed me with mouthwatering receipes that I simply cannot wait to try. This is a beautiful cookbook that is definitely deserving of a 5-Star rating!!"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"This is Ina Garten's second of three cookbooks and the one most closely patterned after the flagship work of her mentor, Martha Stewart. It presents ideas and recipes organized for small scale entertaining at home. As such it is no match for Stewart's \`Entertaining' volume, to which I would direct you if you need to plan any serious parties with more than eight guests.Garten's first book was simply recipes from her catering business. They were probably the best she had. This book adds value to a simple collection of recipes by organizing courses into party menus designed for sixteen different family and close friend occasions. The third book seems to be composed of leftovers.The choice of events to celebrate is a bit quirky in that traditional occasions such as Christmas, Graduation, Thanksgiving, Fourth of July, Mardi Gras / Carnavale, and St. Patrick's Day are not included. Rather, ten out of the sixteen are \`moveable feasts' in that the menu is appropriate to just about any occasion. Some are limited by season such as \`Outdoor Grill' and \`Canoe Trip', but many are generic indoor excuses to have a good time, such as \`Sunday Breakfast', \`Pizza Party', and \`Fireside Dinner'.Unlike Stewart's book, there is really not much serious advice on how to organize for parties. Much of it is common sense plus clever ideas for special events, such as the idea to pack picnic portions in Chinese takeout cartons.Garten has the advantage of claiming with full justification that her recipes are all specifically developed and test to work in a small party environment, as she has been in the catering business doing just this thing for many years. On reading her recipes and seeing many of them done on her Food Network TV show, I believe almost all of these recipes are simple and short in prep time, if not very cheap. The few recipes which take more than a page of large type are the baked goods. As Garten says herself, many are more a matter of \`assembling' than they are of cooking.Next to books from publishing house Alfred A. Knopf, cookbooks from Clarkson N. Potter have the most distinctive style. Where Knopf's books tend to follow the sedate style of Julia Child's classics, Potter's books for Stewart and Garten go for lots of large, glossy, very good photographs. Following the maxim that one eats with their eyes before their mouth, this may even help sell cookbooks with it's appeal to the visceral. Unfortunately, a rational look at the content versus the price suggests this book is a bit short on value. I will give Garten credit for referring to recipes in her earlier book rather than filling pages in this book with repeated recipes. I may be visually challenged, but photographs in cookbooks rarely create a positive impression and often create a negative impression if they are poorly done. In this book, I think they are a wash. They are too caught up in being artistic to give great value to the culinary, but they are not bad photos, so, they do nothing for my appreciation of the recipes.At $35 list price for sixteen menus and about eighty new recipes, I say this is only a modest value for the cost. The tie-in to the TV show adds some value, but not much. I would recommend Sheila Lukins' book \`Celebrate' as a serious resource for family gatherings. I already suggested Martha Stewart's book as a better source for larger events.I recommend this book to any Ina Garten fans plus anyone who already has the other volumes recommended in this review, and simply needs more ideas. Professional caterers are an obvious choice. The book delivers the expected content in an attractive package. Nothing more."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"Ina has a way of simplifying cooking and producing dishes with exceptional flavor. I've tried several recipes and all have been met with rave reviews. I have so enjoyed this book, I bought her other three."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"This book has gorgeous photos and is fun, but it's not really designed for a regular person's life. Garten's idea of parties, which she writes in the introduction, are mostly small gatherings. This means that the book isn't very helpful for larger groups.There are some tips on organizing the party, but not as much I would have liked, such as a timeline of how when to prepare things. Of course, when you are only doing a small party this isn't as important, but even for the tea for 25 she doesn't tell you how you should store things or what you should make first and last.My major complaint would probably be the cost of the recipes. Wow. This book is about how we might like to entertain our closest and dearest friends if we had a vacation house in the Hamptons and a BMW (oh wait...). So, really the book is about an ideal lifestyle most of us just wish we had.It's a fun read and has some interesting recipe ideas, but is not all that practical."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I must disagree with some of the reviews that have placed this book at par or below. Ina hits it out of the park yet again with Barefoot Parties! It is true that you will not find your run of the mill \\"holiday\\" parties in here, but who needs more books on those types of parties? We need ideas and recipes for all of the months in between! Parties! delivers just that. First of all, the recipes work; every time. Secondly, Ina chooses menues that one might not associate with that particular get together. It's a refreshing book that you will use over and over again not only for parties but for every night of the week."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I love this book. I have used the recipes countless times. Especially the one with shrimp and mango salsa. Roasted pork, endive salad with avocado, pesto, delicious....I so agree with her entertaining philosophy, entertaining friends especially, is about enjoying each other's company better experience when you have delicious food...!"},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"If you're interested in cooking, you've probably seen Ina Garten on her Food Network television show, \\"The Barefoot Contessa\\". I became a fan of the program a few years ago, after I noticed how naturally she presented herself. She's there for cooking and food, not to show off unlike so many FN stars. She is quick to share tips, generous with how-to, and approaches cooking with a unique, approachable air, even though her techniques are classically grounded. I own several of her cookbooks, which all share a common philosophy of well-researched recipes, good, straightforward directions, a few personal details, and beautiful photographs of the dishes. If you want only one, I would recommend this book highly. First of all, she lays out her hard-earned tips for entertaining. First, it's not easy...how refreshing! Planning is key, prepare as much ahead as possible, and have a strict rule of four courses. More details follow about serving, tableware, etc. Brilliant! This has transformed my approach to entertaining and I can usually enjoy the meal along with my guests. Secondly, I bought the book for the sour cream coffee cake recipe. Worth the entire book for this recipe alone! Her technique for making caramel is revealed and now I can confidently approach this task that in the past led to many scorched pans and tears. Brisket, grilled chicken, salmon sandwiches, lemon bars...this cookbook can keep you busy for many years. A great investment."},{"Title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun","review":"I have several of Ina Garten's books and this is one of my favourite. I use it regularly and enjoy that her entertaining style is similar to mine, simple and enjoyable for the hostess also. The plum tart is to die for and the chicken chili is a staple in our house now."},{"Title":"Barksdale Air Force Base (LA) (Images of America)","review":"As an AF brat and a civil servant who has been stationed at numerous Air Force bases, I found this book totally fascinating to read! Yes, it's easy to read, but that's what makes it so enjoyable. It's not your typical \\"history\\" book that will bore the average reader. It's informative and entertaining at the same time. I wish I had a book like this from every base I've lived on and/or worked at."},{"Title":"Barksdale Air Force Base (LA) (Images of America)","review":"Very comprehensive regarding the early years but lacks detail of the 1950s-80s. Overall a book to be appreciated."},{"Title":"Barksdale Air Force Base (LA) (Images of America)","review":"As a resident of Louisiana I found this book to be very informative & enjoyable! My daughter used this as a reference for a history project. (She won first place!) Her project was on 'The History Of Barksdale AFB'. The judges found it impressive that one of her references was written by her Uncle Shawn(my brother)! So our family is proud of him & my daughter greatly appreciated the help he provided her with!"},{"Title":"Barksdale Air Force Base (LA) (Images of America)","review":"The photos are decent, but the book is terribly written, I'm afraid. Much of the text seems as if it was penned by a fifth-grader. The good people of Barksdale deserve better than this."},{"Title":"Better Times Than These","review":"This is a very fine novel - one of the best about Vietnam. It has a good, authentic story line, interesting and well developed characters and solid writing. It's easy to read and hard to put down. I think anyone interested in the Vietnam war experience would find it well worth reading."},{"Title":"Better Times Than These","review":"This book has never gotten the respect due it and that is a shame. This is the best early war novel on the market. Things are new and we are learning the way things are going to be. This anti-war movement has not really started and fighting is the news. This is Groom's first book and I have a first edition that I would not part with.Read this one first, \\"Sand in the Wind\\" next and the \\"13th Valley\\" last. These books are the war as it was lived and fought. They are some of the best war fiction ever written."},{"Title":"Better Times Than These","review":"Winston Groom captures the essence of the Viet Nam war in this remarkable book. As you travel with these soldiers to Viet Nam and into battle, you feel all the emotions that made this war so controversial. Groom's writing is so vivid that it brings the war right to your doorstep where it can't be ignored or misunderstood. A powerful must-read. Once you start Better Times than These, you won't be able to put it down. And after you've read it, you won't be able to get it out of your mind."},{"Title":"Better Times Than These","review":"I had originally noticed Winston Groom, probably like millions of others worldwide, by the smash success of Forrest Gump. I picked up a few novels by Mr.Groom and I have to say that I enjoyed this far more than his famous book turned major motion picture. This book was extremely funny in parts, sad in parts and very dramatic. He paints such a picture with his writing and I have to say it is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. I cannot believe it was never turned into a movie, like most great books are. The only thing I was disappointed about when while reading was when it was over."},{"Title":"Better Times Than These","review":"This is by far Groom's best book. A beautiful portrayal of the grusome war called Vietnam. It sucks you in and you can not put it down. Groom goes into depth of the charecters so well, you feel that you know them. I would recommend this book to any one with the interest in a great saga. I want to read this book again and again, it's so good."},{"Title":"Better Times Than These","review":"Winston Groom's own personal experience as a soldier in Vietnam clearly shows through in \\"Better Times Than These,\\" and lends the same degree of authenticity captured so vividly by Philip Caputo in \\"A Rumor of War.\\" Groom intruduces his readers to a variety of characters that are all to familiar to every Vietnam Vet - from Spudhead Miter, the slow, backward southern farm boy, to the cold and callous, cigar smoking, Colonel Patch. \\"Better Times Than These\\" recounts all the passions of a nation, the personal tragedies of its families, and the brutal realities that are a part of every war. I highly recommend you read this book. And when you're finished, give your friends a wonderful gift by sharing it with them."},{"Title":"Better Times Than These","review":"In my opinion, this is THE book to read about the war in Vietnam.Once you begin,you cannot put it down because Winston Groom is a genius storyteller. I cannot say it is a pleasant read, but it is an unforgettable one."},{"Title":"Better Times Than These","review":"Winston Groom's (the man who wrote \\"Forrest Gump\\") first book. Set in the Summer of 1966, Billy Kahn is a college student who is enlisted into the Marines for the Vietnam war. The story begins with Billy getting on board a troop transport bound for Asia, following his rise up the ranks to becoming company commander. Just as Billy is reaching the pinnacle of his military career, he is dragged into a moral dilemma that leaves him at a major crossroad.From family and friends protesting their actions at home, girlfriends abandoning them via letter, and the tragic deaths of their fellow soldiers the book does not pull punches with the hopes, passions and tragedies of the realities of soldiers fighting the Vietnam war."},{"Title":"Better Times Than These","review":"Winston Groom's own personal experience as a soldier in Vietnam clearly shows through in &quot;Better Times Than These,&quot; and lends the same degree of authenticity captured so vividly by Philip Caputo in &quot;A Rumor of War.&quot; Groom intruduces his readers to a variety of characters that are all to real and familiar to every Vietnam Vet - from Spudhead Miter, the slow, backward southern farm boy, to the cold and callous, cigar smoking Colonel Patch. &quot;Better Times Than These&quot; recounts all the passions of a nation, the personal tragedies of its families, and the brutal realities that are a part of every war.

The author's later stuff is far more substantive."},{"Title":"Better Times Than These","review":"For somone who did not grow up during the age of Vietnam, this book reveals the tragedy and hardship of those involved. I recomend this book to anyone intrested in that time period, or curious as to what war is really like."},{"Title":"Better Times Than These","review":"I picked up this book in a &quot;remaindered&quot; bin, never realizing that it would one day be a valued first edition by the creator of Mr. Gump--no great testimony, in my opinion. For the time, it was certainly the best of the Vietnam novels, though later books have left a deeper impress on me, most especially &quot;The Things That They Carried.&quot; But you'd do well to have this one on the shelf also. -- Dan Ford"},{"Title":"Better Times Than These","review":"It amazes me that some books get published at all. In this case, the story is there: the themes, characters, and the events. I was disappointed in how Groom constructed the tale. At times the text appears to have been written by a high school student.Better to read Walking Dead by Craig Roberts, or The Only War We Had by Michael Lanning (if you can find it)."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"If you are a fan of C.S. Lewis and trying to collect his materials this is a simple and enjoyable daily reading. I particularly like the paperback cover with the feather on more than the new ones, so I would recommend a used copy. I would also suggest \\"The Abolition of Man\\" and \\"The Weight of Glory\\" to go with it. It makes for a nice three book set."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"Always interesting to discover the roots of an author's world.(By the way, Amazon's packaging/quality is 5*.)"},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"If you like to get people's perspective on God, then this is a good book. If you want emotion and reason to pull together to reveal truth, then it flounders.Even as does C.S. Lewis, George McDonald has a tendency to make movingly worded, but scripturally, or even reasonably, baseless statements. Culture and emotion are on his side, but that doesn't make him right.For example, he subtly comes from the perspective that to truly know God is to never to plan, want, or put forth effort. Adam created the names of the animals, king David created the pieces for the temple of Solomon, and Moses gave the people the law. God sustained them and gave them their creative abilities, but it wasn't through sitting around waiting for God that they were able to bring these things about.Further, he has the self righteousness that says \\"what a sinner I am\\", followed by \\"you should do such-and-such\\" or \\"we should all try to do such-and-such\\" meaning \\"you should do such-and-such\\". And has an over inflated view of the righteousness of children.However, I share his view that we are all sinners, held back from becoming monsters by the chains of God, and I identify with his melancholy, but I finish the book holding him in equal regard to C.S. Lewis. Read that however you please."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"I have never enjoyed the writings of George MacDonald, and even though Lewis tried to select &quot;the best of&quot; with his anthology, I did not benefit from reading this book. The fine introduction by Lewis is what prevents this book from receiving a rating of 1. Don't bother buying this unless you want to read what Lewis wrote."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"George McDonald has lots to say about how to act when you are not feeling well loved or connected to God. In short, how do we act when we're unsure of our faith or angry?For example:The Highest Condition of the Human WillThe highest condition of the human will is in sight. . . . I say not the highest condition of the Human Being; that surely lies in the Beatific Vision, in the sight of God. But the highest condition of the Human Will, as distinct, not as separated from God, is when, not seeing God, not seeming to grasp Him at all, it yet holds Him fast.-George McDonald quoted in C.S. Lewis George McDonaldI don't know exactly what he is trying to say, but what I think it means is that when we are shaken and unsure our continued faith is ever more amazing. What does this have to do with Good Samaritans? I hope something, or I am going to lose my key demo. I know that when I am not feeling good or happy that I am less likely to help others and pay attention to my principles. I think if others have the same problem we need to ask ourselves, \\"what does my mood have to do with what is right and wrong?\\" I think McDonald would say that a person with a strong will acts the same regardless of how he or she feels.--Luke T. GoodSamaritanblog.com"},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"This is probably the only book written by C.S. Lewis that I will give less that 4 stars. I think it's great that he wanted to have an anthology of George Macdonald, but it just didn't work. Don't get me wrong, the quotes are great, but it just doesn't really give you an idea of who Goerge MacDonald is, and what his writing is like. Nearly all of the quotations are from his book of sermons, which is not one of his most popular works. If you have heard of George MacDonald and want to check him out, I would reccomend just jumping straight into The Princess and the Goblin or one of his other works. This just isn't the \\"usual\\" George MacDonald, and you don't get much of a hint as to what his \\"fantasies,\\" which are what he is famous for, are like."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"Loved it! Amazing how much Lewis own thought and often words are an echo of MacDonald.This edition was very nice too. I ordered two and preferred this one. Layout, paper, print all added to the experience of the thought.I highly recommend it- profound truth in short pithy statements! Needs to be pondered often."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"No wonder CS was drawn to this man's writing! Lewis sorts through MacDonald's body of work to get to real nuggets.MacDonald packs more theological mind-fodder in one or two sentences than most can pack in a book. There are sound bites that will occupy your thoughts all day."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"George MacDonald has a lot of spiritual wisdom; I love short little tidbits of his thinking that I myself can think on. If you like MacDonald (or Lewis) and his books, especially the spiritual aspect, you will love these quotes."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"My printed copy of this great little book was being held together with rubber bands. I was so glad to find it on kindle and at a very reasonable price. The format is very user-friendly."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"Profound wisdom from the \\"master\\" of C.S. Lewis. Though Lewis does little writing in this book, his dissecting and categorizing of MacDonald's writings is worthy of a book, and thank God Lewis thought so. The little writing that Lewis contributes is in an insightful introduction, which gives great perspective into the position of MacDonald and his theology. As Paul exhorted, MacDonald has indeed sought wisdom from above, and not of this world. The best description I can use is soul piercing. It's a wonder MacDonald is hardly mentioned or known in the Christian culture as a whole. It's no wonder Lewis called him his master -- I don't doubt many more will as they learn of him, including myself."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"I am halfway through the book and can't express how much it has spoken to me. The book is divided up into short, numbered sections, all less than half-a-page long; some as short as a sentence, and the reason is this: it is so rich with insight you cannot consume it in large gulps. You need to savor it, like fudge, to make sure you are relishing all that's there. I personally limit myself to about 10 sections per morning and I pause to journal and reflect on most.I don't think I would have been ready to listen to MacDonald a few years ago. He writes from a deep, still place of ruthless, rugged faith. It's particularly rewarding for me to read snippets of his theological thoughts having just read his Curdie books. I notice many of his reflections showing up in the pages of his fiction. I also see the origination of much of C.S. Lewis's thinking and fiction.Buy it and try it. If it doesn't ring true, wait a few years and try again. MacDonald's writings are a gift, as are his stories."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"title prehaps says it.... yet its a terse thought provoker to be used with do it yourself wait no this about someone else style o thinking init the wolfkins sheep rabbits n well normal confused scientists-even whos out there n need to connect a little perhaps in regards to the local planetary deity epiphany known as yeshua the lover of fasting wolves and middle eastern vampires...."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"Maybe it's too easy to take one thing that someone says (anyone says) and not make sense from it once it's out of context. I recommend reading MacDonald in context. His insight is impeachable if you're goal is to know God and be known by God. Otherwise, MacDonald's goal was never to write a theological treatise. Then again, neither was this Jesus' goal when he was here. \\"heptazane\\" (review above) should beware of being so flippant with things he doesn't fully understand."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"MacDonald was a master Christian apologist of the late 1800s, and an enormous influence on CS Lewis, JRR Tolkien, WH Auden, and Charles Williams, to name a few. His fantasy novels and sermons have been a source of inspiration for every generation of Christian apologists and fantasy novelists since his death. MacDonald's writings, however, inspiring though they are, are often laborious and difficult to read. Additionally, much of MacDonald's writing phases in and out of print regularly, and is sometimes not easy to find. It is for these reasons that CS Lewis, who called MacDonald \\"my master,\\" compiled this \`anthology' of MacDonald's theology.In this little volume are 365 \\"readings,\\" short quotes from MacDonald's sermons, novels, or stories. Actually, more than 2/3 of this material comes from his sermons. Several of these quotations are uplifting and thought-provoking, and all bear the mark of a man who devoted his life to Christian apology through fantasy. An anthology like this is a good place to be introduced to MacDonald's thinking and writing, and also a large step in understanding such later apologists as CS Lewis. These readings, though sometimes taken slightly out of context, are a great look into the work of George MacDonald."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"I wouldn't say that this book inspired me to want to read all of George MacDonald's works, but it was worth the money I spent on it. This book gave me some new perspectives on faith and the importance of understand and doing what God wants me to do. I don't agree with all of it, but I was helped by most of it.A few quick samples: &quot;Oh the folly of any mind that would explain God before obeying Him! That would map out the character of God instead of crying, Lord, what wouldst thou have me to do?&quot;&quot;Thy hand be on the latch to open the door at His first knock. Shouldst thou open the door and not see Him, do not say He did not knock, but understand that He is there, and wants thee to go out to Him. It may be He has something for thee to do for Him. Go and do it, and perhaps thou wilt return with a new prayer, to find a new window in thy soul.&quot;&quot;A man my sink by such slow degrees that, long after he is a devil, he may go on being a good churchman or a good dissenter and thinking himself a good Christian.&quot;&quot;Every one of us is something that the other is not, and therefore knows something - it may be without knowing that he knows it - which no one else knows: and... it is everyone's business, as one of the kingdom of light and inheritor in it all, to give his portion to the rest.&quot;"},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"This is pretty much my favorite book (except the Bible). His thoughts are luminous -- no dry wisdom, but truth in the best sense, which he really lived out. Real food for anyone with a heart for truth, and a decent starting place for anyone else. you gotta read it! : ) It even has a few poems of his -- but check out &quot;Diary of an Old Soul&quot; for a whole book of them. The more I read of George MacDonald's the better I feel like I understand God and His Word-- he ties things together delightfully so they make sense. It's vivid. It is infused with that shining quality that CS Lewis aptly called &quot;holiness&quot; -- but not as we've imagined holiness!"},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"While I am not typically a big fan of the short, daily reading format of quotes taken from some unknown context, I found and continue to find this book valuable and beautiful. Whether George MacDonald's theology was bad or not (and who's isn't at times?), one thing he conveys over and over in his writing is that he KNOWS the love of God. All the good theology in the world cannot measure against instruction about loving God and loving one's neighbor.Personally, I often grow weary of head knowledge and I want to commune with a saint who understands and experiences love to a degree that I can only hope to reach someday. I want to be encouraged that love is action, not theory; that Jesus is reality, not concept; that life is fullness and joy, not numbers and facts. George MacDonald takes me further and beyond the average clich&eacute; and pat descriptions and expectations of the Christian life. He takes me places I always hoped existed and renews my belief that God is much more than I can want or imagine.And for what it's worth, I believe there is another way to interpret statement 1, different from A Reader's interpretation in the following review: \\"Oh the folly of any mind that would explain God before obeying Him! That would map out the character of God instead of crying, Lord, what wouldst thou have me to do?\\" I think G. M. meant that spending our time simply amassing facts ABOUT God is a poor substitute for EXPERIENCING God through the act of obedience. In other words, understanding the faith is different from walking by faith.Those are my [opinion]."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"This anthology is a wonderful collection of beauty and insight into the Christian life. George MacDonald had the rare gift of getting to the heart of the matter, whether it be to convict or to comfort. C. S. Lewis did a masterful job (as always) with the compilation and introduction. This little volume is truly a blessing."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"C.S. Lewis called MacDonald &quot;my master.&quot; Read this book and you'll see why. Though MacDonald's writing style is sometimes clumsy and sometimes confusing, at other times it soars. Lewis admits that MacDonald is not among the great writers if one defines literature as &quot;an art whose medium is words.&quot; But creating fantasy, says Lewis, he &quot;does better than any man.&quot; In this volume, you get mainly MacDonald's theological writings, taken mainly from his sermons. Again, Lewis says it best: &quot;I dare not say that he is never in error; but to speak plainly I know hardly any other writer who seems to be closer, or more continually close, to the Spirit of Christ Himself.&quot; I can't say enough about this book--full of profound insights!"},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"In CS Lewis' 1945 novel, \\"The Great Divorce,\\" 19th century fantasy poet/pastor George MacDonald guides Lewis' narrarator on passages between hell (the joyless, fearful \\"grey city\\") and heaven. The narrator (by extension, Lewis himself) acknowledges MacDonald's life influence from when, at 16, the then-agnostic Lewis read MacDonald's \\"Phantasies\\" and concluded: \\"Here begins the new life.\\"MacDonald's influence reaches past Lewis to forebears Lewis Carroll (whom MacDonald mentored through Carroll's writing/publishing \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"), James Barrie, and GK Chesterton. Barrie and Chesterton helped co-chair MacDonald's centenary celebration in 1924, and Chesterton later called MacDonald \\"one of the three or four greatest men of 19th century Britain.\\"No wonder Lewis prefaces his anthology of MacDonald quotes by calling its compilation \\"discharging a debt of justice.\\" MacDonald, overlooked in a fantasy literature timeline stretching from Lewis and fellow Inkling J.R.R. Tolkein to J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, shows his wisdom through 365 excerpts from his poems, sermons, and short stories. Each is less than a page-long for easy daily reading.Referring continually to Lewis' introduction helps while reading his MacDonald selections. Lewis writes, \\"Nowhere else outside the New Testament have I found terror and comfort so intertwined.\\" It guides MacDonald images of the Good Shepherd's sharp-toothed sheepdogs tracking and returning sinners (quote 149), or being told in bereavement \\"you must be made miserable that you may wake from your sleep to know that you need God.\\" (quote 223, from a man who lost a wife and daughter during his life). Even misplaced daily items are God's blessing against materialism (81). Lewis built his \\"Screwtape Letters\\" concept near completely around quotes 245-247.\\"George MacDonald\\" rewards those consistently referencing it. It captures not only MacDonald's freedom from his Calvinist upbringing, but does so though powerful images of Father and Son, Christ and His faithful. It straddles God's demanding \\"the last farthing\\" against sin to man's ability to deny self (159, 300) and see that self as God does (208, 243) before we see Him for what He is. Fear and shame, to MacDonald, are undesirable but acceptable introductions (349, 214, 242), until we know, accept, and obey that deeper love (208, 243).These are excerpts, nothing more. Even praising MacDonald's vision Lewis admits, \\"If I were to deal with him as a writer...certainly MacDonald has no place in its first rank - perhaps not even in its second.\\" Indeed, many MacDonald inspired (again, Lewis' beloved \\"Narnia\\" series) would take his approach to fantasy as a window into human behavior to wildly popular heights a century after his death. \\"George MacDonald\\" is neither biography nor full appreciation. But it reintroduces a key 19th literary/spiritual figure through his star pupil, and is recommended for fans of Lewis and of Christian fiction."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"George MacDonald's writings are succinct and open-ended, permitting, even urging, the reader to ask life-changing questions which God, in His grace, never fails to answer. C. S. Lewis said of MacDonald &quot;I regarded him as my master.&quot; Many of Lewis' written thoughts reflect truths as expressed by George MacDonald."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"This anthology was edited/assembled by the late C. S. Lewis, and contains many of his favorite passages from the published works and sermons of George MacDonald. MacDonald was C.S. Lewis' &quot;literary Christian mentor&quot; - to quote this perhaps most popular and effective 20th Century Christian apologist (i.e. Lewis).Many of the short quotations/exerpts marvelously synthesize Jesus' sayings and the Apostles' teachings into visual images. I particularly find the &quot;Our God is a Living Fire&quot; series."},{"Title":"George MacDonald : An Anthology","review":"Although I have never read George MacDonald before, I figured if he is one of the more influential writers for C.S. Lewis, that I could certainly check out his &quot;best of&quot; book.The intro from Lewis is wonderful, and explains his regarding MacDonald as &quot;his master.&quot; Lewis says that he has never written a book in which he hasn't quoted from MacDonald, and one can see after reading this book how many of Lewis' thoughts may have been shaped by MacDonald.My favorite entry in the anthology is entitled &quot;The Knowledge of God,&quot; and reads:To say Thou art God, without knowing what the Thou means -- of what use is it? God is a name only, except we know God."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"I could not put this book down. I read it when I was taking an Appalachian study coarse. As the mountian farming era came to an end this work shows the wrenching pain the upland mountian people suffered as they encountered the industrial world. To this day I remember the characters, their plight and their contribution to the change. A very excellent read of their emotions, thoughts and what they did with them. A ten star read."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"The Dollmaker is set in a war time setting, ups and downs of ordinary people and their hardships. A woman who helped survive by making dolls but it's much more than that the hard aches they went through, the loss of a child.It a great read. I ordered the book through Amazon and received in speedy time in great condition. Would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"This is fabulously written - like reading Huck Finn. It is a tragedy on a par with the great Greek tragedies and Shakespere's. After you read this book you will never use the word \\"hillbilly\\" again. I first read this almost 40 years ago, and I have never forgotten Gertie, the protagonist."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"This has been my favorite movie of all time since it first aired on television. My children found a copy of the movie for me long ago and I share it whenever I can because of the message of hope. Of all the reviews I've read on this movie, not one speaks of the message of God's provision when we've taken a wrong turn. She's continually looking at the 'face' of Jesus and can't quite see what that might look like. It is the theme throughout and yet the reviews I read are focused on what I believe are extra great messages...but not the underlying message. At the lowest point of her life the very cherry wood that she's been carving throughout the story takes on a new meaning as 'Christ was broken' for her. It's there that she finally gets the message of his face. He saved her from the life she was living and ultimately brought her home."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"This novel is a great novel for not just women, but men as well. In the book, the main character is Gertie, who has problems with decision making. She is looking out for the best interests in her family. With her unselfish ways, she tries to do her best. This takes place during World War II, in the United States. During that time, people had to help in the war. Her husband was chosen to help out in Detroit, which is the beginning point of her problems. Since she is from the south, she experiences a whole new world up north, and at the same time deals with her problems in the family. Gertie, is probably one of the strongest woman characters that I have read. By reading this novel, you'll be able to experience the adventure and drama that Gertie goes through, it will touch your heart."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"The Dollmaker is a terrific story of love and the tragedy of love. Gertie and her family are forced to move to wartime Detroit from their home in rural Kentucky. From this, Gertie's family began to fall apart. Her husband was never home, and always in a temper, her children constanly picked at her to lose her &quot;hillbilly&quot; ways. Gertie's only escape was her &quot;whittlin' foolishness,&quot; which was not foolishness at all but her most attractive aspect. Her wood carving was also symbolic of her hope. After the loss of two of her five children and her troubles with her husband, she destroys this hope, as well as destroying herself."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"It took me forever to read this novel because it is very, very descriptive and very long. I also found the story very depressing even though it is truly very well written.The story starts in the hills of Kentucky during World War II and Gertie is trying to get her sick child down the mountain to a doctor. She is a strong willed woman who will do anything for her children.The story progresses from the mountains of Kentucky to Detroit, where Gertie's husband take a factory job. Gertie leaves the Kentucky home that she loves due to her mother's nagging and her husband's insistence.From there the story goes down hill and never returns to anything good for Gertie or her family. The story is a treatise on city versus the country and also on industrialization and farming.I can not recommend it since it was so depressing, with one tragedy after another and because it was very tedious reading."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"Yes, I have heard it being compared to \\"Grapes of Wrath\\". It certainly is on the same level of craftsmanship and insight. However, I think the topic is DIFFERENT. It's the first book in my reading experience that approaches the topic of consumerism and living in disposable world. It's not about men (and women) overcoming financial, social and emotional difficulties. It's the same men (and women) creating their own hell. Mostly throuh inaction. I had mixed feelings about the protagonist. As much sympathy I had for her, I was also angry at her willingly (or rather without resistance) being lead to the \\"slaughter\\", as a cow. One may try to make this book into another feminist novel. Someone else may discribe it as a war novel. I disagree."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"If you want to walk away from a book feeling hopeless and sad, by all means, read this book! You just keep waiting for the book to make a turn around, but the character's life just becomes worse and worse! And the book is so long and terribly detailed! The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I do believe the author accurately portrayed the harshness of life for a family in innercity Detroit during World War II. However, I would not recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"I kept trying to read this book and just can't seem to get into it. Can't stand the way it is written in slang. If it would of been written in better language I may of gotten into it, but had to keep trying to figure out what the character was saying, so needless to say put it back up on the shelf and haven't taken it down since."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"The Dollmaker by Harriette ArnowThis is a magnificant, powerful book about a woman's strength, endurance and inner beauty in the face of despair and hopelessness. The innocent faithfulness and innate goodness of Gertie, many times described as a massive, unattractive woman, turns her into an angelic, beautiful creature for the reader. Gertie, always the champion of her children and &quot;good wife&quot; to her husband, triumphs over adversity, fends for herself and emerges as a wonderful role model for people everywhere. For a person characterized with little education, she had the quick thinking, common sense intelligence of someone with far more education. The mountain vernacular was at times difficult to decipher, but with continued reading it became easier. The descriptions of nature and scenery were so richly detailed that it was easy to picture the story--almost as if a movie was being watched. One horrible part in the story was described in such a graphic manner that the reader could literally be sickened, because by this time in the book, the characters are your own, like family members.This may be one of the greatest works of literature portraying &quot;woman's strength&quot; ever written. Give it a try--you'll like it."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"Having grown up in rural Kentucky 'The Dollmaker' was far too real for me. Gertie is a real character, she is the typical strong and determined woman of the mountains. It is almost repulsive that she has to be paired with a man who is a weak and spineless character. Despite it all she was able to create beauty, honor her husband and children and to have dreams in all the despair. Her life is typical for so many women of rural Appalachia from that time.I would say that one who has to see the movie to critique the book needs to remember that a movie is rarely as worthy as the book. Either read the book or see the movie, most often I choose to do the former. Why let a movie ruin a good book!Stands out in my mind as one of the all time best reads, comprable to &quot;The Good Earth&quot; by Pearl S. Buck!"},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"Harriette Arnow, in The Dollmaker, not only chronicles the collapse of the ages-old rural universe of Appalachia and the subsequent historic wave of migration north to the Northern States during WW II, she gives us a giant of a character in Gertie Nevels. Tall as a man, strong as a man, staunchly independent without even knowing it, Gertie nevertheless kowtows to her overbearing mother, then to her husband's wishes to give up her dreams and everything that has ever had meaning in her life. Highly symbolic, each character is nonetheless surging with blood and gristle and clashing with a society that pits human against human, culture against culture, for profit.Arnow, a brilliant novelist and National Book Award finalist in 1955, has largely been relegated to \\"regional\\" literature and somewhat forgot in recent times. Her first novel, Mountain Path, captured a kind of human being we see little of today in America. Both fierce and fearful, generous to a fault but full of grudges and a firm believer of \\"an eye for an eye\\", they are of a time and place that is now almost lined-out with Interstates.In The Dollmaker, Arnow takes what she so masterfully sculpted in her early fiction and brings it into the light of the world. The rough and raw characters of Mountain Path are now thrown into the mix of the new Detroit slums. Bigoted Northerners, foreign-speaking European immigrants, and the reviled hillbillies of Kentucky, Tennessee and beyond come together in an international community amidst the life-and-death early days of unions and union busters.The Dollmaker is long and by the end I was wrung out. At times I found myself wanting to shake Gertie, at others, to take her in my arms and protect her. In the end she becomes so tragic a being that I was stunned. It is said that Arnow was influenced by Emile Zola's novel Germinal. The similarities are all there, but their messages, and certainly their conclusions, are significantly different."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"As editor of The Mountain Laurel, a journal of mountain life, I found this book excellent in its descriptions of mountain people. It is a perfect example of two types of poverty and how mountain people cope with it - poverty at home in the mountains, where they have land and can raise their own food, but have little money, and poverty in the big city where they have jobs and have to buy everything they need to survive. The main theme in this powerful book is survival. If you wish to understand Appalachia, read The Dollmaker"},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"The Dollmaker was a beautifully written book. Once I started to read it I could not put it down. It is about the life of a woman during World War II, who under certain circumstances regarding her husband, is obliged to move her family from Kentucky to Detroit. The change that Gertie, the mother, is forced to undergo and adapt to is evident through the course of the novel. Arnow opens our eyes to life during this period for many people like Gertie. People, with &quot;big&quot; dreams, go to work in war factories that over work them and place them in dangerous conditions. Because money made is necessary for payments, food, or other foolish neccessities, families are forced to live each day as it comes. This view of society during this period was new to me. I had never realized the adjustments, cultural shocks, and advantages people could take of others during this time, or during a war. Arnow tells the events that take place in Gertie's life so well. The images she creates our realistic. She doesn't try to make a romance or happy-go-lucky ending out of the book. She tells about Gertie's sufferings as they are. Her book is more like a historical documentary, except we get to experience, emotionally, what the characters do. Some would argue that this book is too depressing, but Arnow wanted us to realize that life can be like this some times. There is no cruelness or situation that occurs to Gertie or others in this book that we don't see in our own lives or could empathize with. I felt emotionally and mentally as drawn to this book as I did to The Grapes of Wrath. I saw the same spirit of human survival and courage in both books. The Dollmaker gives an inside look into what changes in surroundings can do to a family. Just as in The Grapes of Wrath, we see the gradual deterioation in the family structure. This was sad, but truthful. You have to read this novel to understand or feel what I mean in describing it. If your realistic and perceptive, you'll enjoy this novel. It will be mind boggling at times. I recommend you have a box of tissues at your side before beginning. In any case, after reading The Dollmaker you'll certainly be more open minded and sympathtic towards others' sufferings and realize that you and I have it easy."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"549 pages of misery. Reminded me much of Ken Rouch's painful movie &quot;Ladybird, Ladybird&quot;. Depressing to read, especially when I thought I had figured out, about 100 pages before the end, what was going to happen. But the end, when it came, took me completely off guard, made me want to weep. Which says an awful lot about Arnow&quot;s writing capabilities. You never saw her writing. No overblown metaphors or similes. Just a bleak portrait of one hillbilly woman who could not change or learn from her mistakes. And pays, oh so dearly. And yet she paints her characters with such vivid brush strokes that they leap off the page and into my thoughts in bed. A book not easily forgotten . Yet not remembered with ease either. What a tragic figure is Gertie Nevels."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"The central character in The Dollmaker is Gertie - a strong Appalacian woman during WWII. Forced by economic conditions and pressured by her husband and family, she leaves the isolation of the rural mountains for Urban life in Detroit. This is a compelling page turner - it's not a fairy tale and it has a hard edge. Currently on assignment in Appalacia, I have had an opportunity to view Gertie's world first hand. Jane Fonda's TV Movie is also recommended - it is faithful to the book and Ms. Fonda's performance won an Emmy. I read this book over 10 yrs ago and I never forgot it."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"This book is about a strong, loving mother: Gertie, the dollmaker. During wartime, her family must leave their homeland of Kentucky and move to Detroit where her husband can find work in the factories. In Detroit, the family is very, very poor. But Gertie strives on, caring for her children, carving dolls, and dreaming of a better future. Tragedy and utter sadness strike the heroine. You feel the pain in your chest as though you were her.A wonderfully written book. Deep characters that you care about. Warning: emotionally wrenching."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"I first read this book almost 30 years ago and have come online today to find it again. This is one of the most powerful stories I have ever read, evidenced by the fact that it has stayed with me for 30 years. Having married into an Eastern Kentucky family, and lived there for several years, I can vouch for the authenticity of the characterizations in this book. The depth of this woman, her loyalty and courage in the midst of the trials of her marriage and the sometimes horrific circumstances of her life, are so beautifully expressed by Ms Arnow. The detail with which the author writes helps the reader to experience Gertie's heart and the way of life that has shaped her into the person she is. Anyone who has lived in Eastern Kentucky will know that the women are the true strength of the land while having the least opportunity; I see this as Ms Arnow's tribute to the women of Appalachia and applaud her lovingly accurate portrayals. I am purchasing this book for my 17-year-old daughter, who has a great appreciation for good literature and a biological link to Appalachia. It is my hope for her that she will also be inspired by Gertie Nevels' strength and courage to be not afraid to tap these qualities within herself."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"Gertie Nevels is a woman meant to live out her days on the land in Kentucky, all her dreams for her children tied up in the predictability of hard work, where abject poverty is ameliorated by fresh vegetables and harvested crops, self-sufficiency the rule the family lives by. But industrialization has hit the country, jobs scarce, the cities calling workers with the promise of a weekly paycheck, food on the table and a company roof over their heads. For men like Clovis Nevels, this opportunity is all that is left in a country at war, the factories emitting a siren call to prosperity. Were it not for her husband, Gertie would never leave her home, but she is a humble woman, guided by her Bible and righteousness to keep the family together. Against her children's complaints, Gertie gives up her dream for a home of her own and moves her brood to wartime Detroit.The cacophony and dirt of the city are a terrible shock to Gertie and her children, but the living conditions are outrageous to those used to country life, row houses connected wall to wall, the loud voices of neighbors booming in argument, contentious men needing sleep before the next shift, wives unhappy with their husband's drunkenness, hordes of children gathering to play in the dusty courtyard, every semblance of the country removed in this smoke-filled, filthy place, where shift change is announced by the bleat of a horn and the wail of the train wakes the night. Her children settled in school, Gertie makes her peace with this new environment, keeping the younger ones close by, comforted by the wood carving she does to calm her hands and pass the time.The Dollmaker is a powerful social indictment of the consequences of industrialization, spoken in the idiomatic dialect of an uneducated country woman faced with the disintegration of all that she holds dear. The formidable Gertie will know the loss of her husband's pride and self-respect, the creeping fear of joblessness, the private nightmare of assimilation into an indifferent city and the small comfort of the wood she works with her hands. Eventually, even comfort will be forfeit, given a loss that brings Gertie to her knees, prayers scant comfort in her extremity. As multifaceted as the figures she carves, Gertie Nevels is the backbone of her family, and a source of strength to her friends, driven to survive this new, soulless world.

The fact it was also a big book was enticing as what's better than a book you never want to end? Instead, I forced myself to read this book and frankly I think whomever wrote that excerpt left town and handed over the rest of the writing to some anal amateur. Although I favor detailed, descriptive writing, this style of writing was absolutely crazy ridiculous with it. Almost 2 pages devoted to children playing. It gets OLD. I really can't believe there are 35 5-star reviews here. Also, one other 1-star reviewer here wrote it's like reading a foreign language, as the book is indeed written in another language (hillbilly), which becomes difficult and tiresome after 100 pages. Imagine only 500+ more to go! The bottom line is the detailed writing is mind numbing, the story boring and characters non-descript, which sounds like an oxymoron I know. There is one redeeming feature about this book. I read it in bed at night and although I usually have trouble falling asleep, after 15 minutes my head is nodding and the rest is history. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"I am an avid reader but I found this book \\"over the top\\", too many characters, too slow, (stayed in one scene far too long), almost written in a 'foreign', very difficult 'language'. Unfortunately, not a good read at all."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"I could care less about this book being depressing as that is the only thing that made the read realistic for a person trying to live in an urban city where things are much more expensive, and work much more fast paced then Gertie's(main character)original country home. The book was far too detailed. For God sakes one does not have to have specific step by step detail on every doll carved, or every pointless digresing thought."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"While I did enjoy parts of the book, I find it to be lacking overall. Gertie is a believable character but lacks in courage. She was supposedly a strong person. She did face many challanges but didn't overcome then. Instead she sidestepped her problems. Not until the last page does she actually become the character she is portrayed to be but I barely made it to the last page. The climax occurs far too early in the book so the resolution takes up far too much time. The one star was given on pity alone. Do not read this book if you have seen the movie. In fact do not read this book period."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"This is one of the most thought provoking books that I have ever read. Ms. Arnow gives a unique perspective of the Appalachian people and the hardships they faced during WW II as they migrated from Appalachia to Detroit."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"A great read that mixes just enough fiction with historical fact especially to those of us who lived during WWII. It traces one family from their coal mining Appalachian roots through its migration to earning a living in the industrialized city of Detroit. It raised a serious question: which life was actually better and in what ways? Existence became no more than a matter of survival skills in Detroit and the standard of living was extremely poor. It showed the influence of both management and the growth of unions in this turbulent period of War. Again, for those who lived it, perhaps in different parts of the country, it brings back a variety of memories...some that can be viewed as valuable and positive, even when at the time the events all seemed to be extremely negative!SMS"},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"I cannot think when i have read something that has affected me in quite this way. a controlling mother, told to be subservient to her husband, follow him to michigan to work in steel mills during WW11. she loved this old farm, bought it with her own saved money. gave it up, went to the hellhole that was michigan during this time period; practically cardboard houses, too small, filthy, alleyways always dangerous. she lost her daughter to a train, cutting off both her legs. read and understand why wood carving kept this wonderful woman sane. another son left to go back to kentucky and she was thankful i know. well worth the price and its well worth your time to read it."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"My grandmother owned this book in the early 60's, and my sisters and I read it with awe.

It shows that the strength, courage and faith that women use daily in everyday life is taken for granted by some but cherished and passed on by others. This book makes you grow in ways that are not easy to describe."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"I will not go so far as to say Arnow is another Hawthorne. But what I will say is that this novel deserves a place in the American Museum of Literature for several reasons. First of all, Arnow presents us with dramatic images. Also, she creates an excellent picture of a country family who is forced out of their element. She then shows all the outside perseucution they are subject to. And perhaps this is her biggest accomplishment. Ever since the dawn of the novel, family disputes have been a major theme. This family faces so many problems from the outside, that they DO NOT have the luxury of going through a family dispute. Arnow masterfully shows us the different problems the different characters face and they suffer as a family. At first, I was a bit worried because of the size of this book. But the truth is it is never boring. Not only does this book belong in the museum of Women's Writing, but it also belongs in the museum of American Classics."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"The Dollmaker was a novel about a family and it's struggle to stay together. The main character Gertie Nevel moved her family from Kentucky to Detroit in an effort to survive. It was during War World II and Gertie's family was in dire need of money. Though Gertie is strong willed, her fight in the chaotic wartime of Detroit thrusts her into a life she is at times unable to bare. The type of life she lived before and her morals she brought up with her to Michigan is something she continued to battle with through out the book. Her love for land, crops, and the country throws her into despair. Her Detroit home smothered her with disbeliefs of never being happy in an environment such as a city life. The home itself was small and she felt like she could have been suffocated at any moment. Her perception of urban life is not a good one either. She views Kentucky as this beautiful place where life should be, and instead she's in Detroit where there is nothing but evil. Another problem Gerite faces is in her leisure time; there she is incapable to whittle the small dolls for Cassie, her youngest daughter. Now she has to make ugly, unwanted dolls to make money. Gertie is a character with a lot of inner strength, and yet her spirit was broken through out the novel. Although this book was stretched out in miniscule detail it allowed the readers to understand more clearly how life changes for the better."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"Loved the movie, most times the books are even better so I bought the book, fast shipping, good transaction, book perfect condition, just was dissapointed in the story.

Get out the Kleenex."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"This is a book to be read by high school age and up. It is a beautifully told story with themes that are universally relevant and especially so for teenagers."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"The world is at war, and the army is stealing away the men, and those that are left are being hauled off to work in the factories in order to assist the war effort. In rural Kentucky Gertie is lucky enough to still have her husband around, he drives the coal truck, but knows that this situation cannot last. He has his date with the army already lined up. But she is preparing as best she can. She has been saving her money and almost has enough to offer on a nearby farm. Without having to pay half what they earn on rent Gertie and her family will be able to plan for the future. But on the eve of her plans coming to fruition all is ruined and she must uproot her family and follow her husband to the city of Detroit.On a reading forum a member mentioned that one of her favourite books was The Dollmaker by Harriette Arnow, so I decided to give it a go. She had warned that it was a sad book, but oh my god, the depression you feel while reading this one is unrelenting. And just when you think it might lift a little, bam, it hits harder than ever. But don't let that put you off, it is a fantastic read. And I may even reread it at some point.The entire story is told from the point of view of Gertie, everything we find out is because of what she sees or knows, although on one or two occasions there are a few sentences to give a broader viewpoint. But as for what is going on in the book, that is all from Gertie's POV. And she starts off the novel such a strong character. She knows who she is and what she wants. She has a plan to improve her lot and the lot of her family, and she can see how to work that out. But we do get hints of her lack of self-confidence in other respects. Her mother's belief in a religion of hellfire and damnation is different from her view of god. But while she rejects that wrathful god, she cannot reject her mother and her mother's influence. And once she leaves the familiar setting and is dumped amid the chaos of Detroit she loses her way. Uncertain and powerless.There are a lot of themes in this book, and I'm sure you could read a whole lot into the book, from a feminist reading, to a religious one. You could look at the corrupting influence of the city, or the freedom offered by artistic expression. And even how to raise children. Or the effect of unions on a family.But this isn't an academic blog and I'm not going to go into all that, apart from to say that is is amazing how much this book covers without even seeming to try. It is the story of one family and the mistakes they make, the tragedies they suffer, and the problems they face from not communicating properly. At one point in the book I really wanted to smack some of them and tell them to talk to one another. Stop keeping secrets and hiding things. Just talk!And the ending... I'm still not sure how I feel about it. But I'm not going to spoil it for anyone.I think I could talk about this book forever. Or at least for a long time. What I also found interesting is that Harriette Arnow didn't think this was a feminist book, she said in an interview\\"I don't think Gertie was a faminist. What was best for her children came first. On the other hand, I'm weary of this talk of women. It's much like the old talk of the proletariat, that woman is woman, and there are no individuals, and all women are alike. It makes me both angry and sick at my stomach, because women are individuals and each should be permitted to follow her own bent, have control of her body. If a woman wants to marry and stay home and raise six children, that's her business, and never with a thought beyond the home and the church and the school\\"whereas to me that statement right there is a feminist statement. And I think that is one of the problems with feminism, how it is perceived. Some people seem to think that to be a feminist you must insist that all women join the workforce and earn their own money. I disagree. I think being a feminist simply means that men and women should be given equal opportunity. Ah, but that is a different conversation. I do think however that one quotation in particular from The Dollmaker stands out in relation to it being a feminist book, it comes in the second half, after the family have moved to Detroit and Gertie has an argument with her son's teacher, which leads to an argument with him, and between him and Clovis, and between her and Clovis.\\"Slowly her hand dropped from the doorknob, and she turned back to Clovis. It wasn't the way it had used to be back home when she had done her share, maybe more than her share of feeding and fending for the family. Then, with egg money, chicken money, a calf sold here, a pig sold there, she'd bought almost every bite of food they didn't raise. Here everything, even to the kindling wood, came from Clovis.She understood in one second of time so many things - the trapped look in Mrs. Anderson's eyes, why Max's radio played so loudly sometimes when she had an evening off and Victor was home. The rich had wide lawns and thick walls; the poor had radios.\\"I have said more than enough here, and yet, could say more, but I won't, I'll just urge you to read this book."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"I have read this book several times. I grew up in eastern Kentucky and many, many family members took \\"reading', writin', and Route 23\\" north to Ohio and Michigan to work in factories and fulfill their dreams. Like Gertie, they were fish out of water and had difficulty assimilating. Yes, it is depressing, but unfortunately it is closer to non-fiction than fiction, in my opinion. It so well expresses the Appalachian values of loyalty, love of land, love of family, etc. that it was required reading at Berea College in the '70s."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"This is my third reading of The Dollmaker over a 15 year span of time. Parts of this novel always stay with me, even as I forget the particulars: the tracheotomy on her youngest child when it was do it or die; the yearning for and eventual purchase of land of her own; the tragedies that await her family in Detroit. It is even more poignant now - I grew up in Appalachia, and now live in the metro Detroit suburbs, where \\"Ypsituckian\\" is a derogatory word. This book chronicles a people and a time gone by, as the mountain region gets more and more homogenized. It makes me fiercely proud of home."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"This is a haunting story. In it, a unique woman with clear and powerful dreams and goals, betrays her self by listening to the advice of the average folk who surround her. In following their advice, she forever loses her chance of attaining her own dreams, and also betrays and loses 2 of her children - one of whom returns to the land they left, one of whom, tragically, dies.This is one of the most painful books I have ever read. At the beginning of the book, Gertie is portrayed as nearly superhumanly powerful in her determined success in saving her youngest child's life. Then Gertie forces herself to give up her lifelong dream of owning her own farm - when it is almost within her grasp! - to follow her husband into the ugly heap of industrial Chicago in the name of the war. She does this because she is convinced by vast numbers of average folk that it is the RIGHT thing to do. She convinces herself that her private dreams are mere selfishness, and that she should sacrifice them to &quot;follow her man&quot;.Echoing the same mistake again later, she bows again to popular opinion, and banishes her most beloved and unique child's imaginary playmate. As an indirect result, her daughter dies. Fleeing to play alone - where none can hear/watch her with her imaginary playmate - she has a horrific accident in the train yard, and dies nightmarishly in her mother's arms. And yet, Gertie does not see that these betrayals of all that is most unique, sensitive, and artistic at her core is evil. Instead, she continues to see it as self-scrificing, when she is killing the best self she could be and sinking into the dross around her. Symbolically, at the very last, she gives up her beautiful cherrywood carving of Christ to be cut up to make mass-produced dolls; her final betrayal. Ah, no wonder she could never see his face!This story will never leave me. In many ways, I wish it would. But it teaches a hard lesson; that to be true to anything, one must be true to oneself. To a religious reader, it truly brings home the lesson of the parable of the talents. One must not misuse or waste the gifts of talent given by the creator. But, oh, poor Gertie!"},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"An amazing book, especially considering it was published in 1954.The opening scene is gripping: an uneducated rural housewife performs a tracheotomy on her dying son. She values their country life and holds to those country values even when war comes and she takes the kids and follows her husband to Detroit where he's been assigned to work in a war factory.Wonderful characters, vividly drawn. But most of all, The Dollmaker is a passionate denunciation of industrialization and of war and all that it does to families and society."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"A life changing experience.

The power of the story and the \\"realness\\" of thefamily are the same, as when I was that young girl. Please read."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"This raw, almost painful, book to read takes places during World War II where all men who could were joining the armed forces and those that couldn't were being encouraged to go work in factories to help the war effort. This is a story of a hillbilly family that was transported from their Kentucky home to the new Detroit slum housing built for the influx of factory workers. Life is costly both financially and emotionally as the family tries to adjust to their new life in a cold spot away from the green growing things they were used to. As the war ends and the men are all being laid off from their war jobs they face an uncertain future with no work and no way to support themselves and their family.I've read many books that take place during WWII and I have never read one that showed the harsh realities that many families faced to help the war effort. This book showed the poverty, the bigotry, the greed, the unions, the despair. You might end up a bit depressed with reading it, but your thinking about that era of our history will be changed."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"A woman whose whole world becomes destroyed by the coldness of her loved ones is the story of Gertie, a strong and intelligent woman of the South. Coming from Kentucky to an industrial Detroit was the turning point in the life of Gertie and her numerous family members, but what saved her from total despair was her art. Her art, what she believed to be a time waster, was in reality, the most attractive external aspect of this maschuline woman. Gertie is the living comparison of the way of life in the South and the life in Detroit at the time. She always points out the good and bad in both areas, yet without being cruel with the critisism, because Gertie is a very open minded person, even with people who do not accept her for what she represents. A touching story about survival in a difficult situation, The Dollmaker is also about final sacrifice."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"I read Harriet Arnow's book, \\"Hunters Horn\\" first and knew I wanted to read more of this skillful author's work. I obtained the paperback book, \\"The Dollmaker\\", and was completely absorbed in it beginning with the very first sentence. When I got to the chapter about the little daughter and the tragic event that happened to her, I literally sobbed. This is a book of human nature - I have never known people like the characters in this book, but I lived every moment with them. I wouldn't recommend the book to just anyone - it takes an individual with a certain sensitivity to appreciate it."},{"Title":"The dollmaker","review":"I think this book was excellent.

The collaboration has produced a readable book that recreates the meter and rhythm of Sumerian poetry in English. I enjoyed this book very much and use it often for historical reference to Ancient Sumeria"},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"Although Inanna is not a book I would pick up and read, while reading it in my high school English class I was a bit intrigued. It was a bit odd at first, but as I read on, I found I was enjoying this book. It grabbed my attention. It had lessons hidden within the context of the book that if told normally would have been boring. Although the context of the book was a bit odd, to say the least, I found the book to be educational. It was interesting to know that it is one of the oldest recorded texts. With knowing that, we can better understand why the usage of sexual phrases was so abundant in this reading. I did not know much about Middle-Eastern culture before reading this book. It did help to show some of their customs and ways of living at the time. One thing that I found important when reading the book was the repetition. It was used to show the importance of such things as the \\"me\\". The \\"me\\" played a major role, and this book portrayed that very well. They told us that Enki did not give all the \\"me\\" to Inanna at once, but Inanna received more as she arrived in Uruk. Also, repetition was used to show the fertility of Inanna. Since she is the fertility goddess, this is extremely important. On portion of the book that I really connected with was the part where Inanna goes down to the Underworld to see Erishkegal. It may have been the wording, but this portion panted a vivid picture in my mind. Between the descriptions of the corpse of Inanna, and the doings of the gala I was able to see in my mind what was happening. Over all, I found Inanna to be interesting as well as a bit educational of Middle-Eastern culture. I would not read it on my own, but did not find it a waste of my time."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"Inanna, Queen of Heaven and earth was a joy to read. Inanna being my favorite Goddess was a plus but the book was set so that anyone can read and understand it, unlike some other Sumerian books. The commentaries and interprtations were presented acuratly and clearly. The commentary on the me was extremly acurate in that she acquired more as she crossed to Uruk. I was impressed with the fact that it was bold and to the point which is what Inanna was all about. The Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi was explicit and exciting. I actually used the poems in a group Sumerian rite.This book is a must for anyone loving Sumerian, Ancient civilizations, or Inanna."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"The Descent of InannaIn the Descent of Inanna, there are two sisters, one who is the goddess of heaven and earth and the other who is the goddess of the underground. Inanna is somewhat tricked into visiting her sister in the underworld, but it's more like a trap. The father of both girls sends someone down to save Inanna.In this story I see an aspect of sibling rivalry. The two sisters seem to be trying to out-do each other, like most siblings do. This is still a current thing that happens between siblings.I also feel like the descent could have a double meaning. It's not just her physical journey but also her mental journey into the darkness."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"The Descent of Inanna is a good read with some holes in the story as parts of it has been lost in time. The author is also a mystery as no name has been inscribed with it taking credit. So with this being said I like to express my thanks to the publisher to pick up the book. I&#8217;ve read Descent of Inanna and it has reminded me of a few story themes that made it an easy read. The structure/theme of the story is easily recognizable to follow through the character&#8217;s action. However, with Inanna some parts of the story seem confusing as well as the motives. It doesn&#8217;t help that you can&#8217;t understand the reasoning for our reasoning differs greatly in our time. We, as the reader, over think one&#8217;s action and say, &#8220;Why did they do that?&#8221; Like seriously why Inanna would go down the Underworld in the first place. Then to relieve my mind of the overwhelming curiosity for the answer I tell myself she was just a masochist.It is a fun read nonetheless. Whenever I read this it reminds me of reading the Disney adaptation of Hercules. More specifically when he goes to the underworld and confronts Hades and tries to rescues Meg&#8217;s soul in the swirling abyss filled with taken souls. It&#8217;s obvious that Hercules was successful but, with Inanna her plot armor was not that strong. She and Hercules however shared similar traits along with the whole story of Inanna with Greek Mythology. She faced trials set against the underworld by passing through the gates each disrobing her power, both faced against the lord of the underworld; both had a mission to go to the underworld. However Inanna got her butt handed to her by her sister. I like to see that not all &#8220;good&#8221; characters always win. It promotes realism and diversity to stories that always favors the hero. If you have nothing better to do aside waste you mind watching senseless television programs then I recommend reading some good book and one I would suggest would be the Descent of Inanna.I like to say thanks to the author for the entertaining read."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"Inanna, Queen of Heaven and Earth has been on my shelf since 1987.

It is also exceptionally well-suited for our times. Inanna, the young goddess-queen, \\"lives large.\\" Awaiting her first courtship and sexual experience, she \\"wonders at her vulva,\\" and her erotic imagery makes \\"Sex and the City\\" seem careful and guarded. She rejoices in her young husband, Dumuzi, on whom she bestows every possible honor - and yet speaks only fleetingly when he reveals that his real interest is in governing the land, not in being with her.Like most women today, she raises a family, and runs her \\"empire\\" - all with skill and grace, poise and passion. Yet the moment comes when this is not enough. For reasons undisclosed, she \\"sets her ear\\" towards the Underworld; she decides to visit her sister, Ereshkigal. In the following adventure, she is killed, brought back to life, returns triumphantly to her capital city - and finds that her husband is too absorbed in ruling the kingdom to step off his throne and greet her!The grand-scale drama of this story captivates our minds and our imaginations. The lush, epic poetry gives us insight into a culture both far away and yet very resonant with our times. The emotional journey of Inanna - at times understood only in allusion, and at times disarminingly frank - is on a peerage (and in fact it is the progenitor) of all of our heroic and \\"mythic\\" journeys - both literal and inner.Wolkstein, a famed storyteller, brought the story of Inanna to life. She gave it order and clarity, and also a sense of liveliness with which we can all resonate. Kramer's decades of detailed research and study, translating the original Sumerian cunieform writings, provided a solid bedrock for this breakthrough work. The synergy between poet and scholar, storyteller and academic, gives this book a special place in our hearts - and our libraries. It is as meaningful today as it was some 4,000 years ago. Inanna's story, beautifully told here - surrounded by pictures of tablets and artifacts, and bracketed with scholarly analysis - reaches to the hearts of people everywhere."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"I loved this book...easy to read & well written.

She was child, woman, and elder. She was part of life, and of the underworld. Enki, her father and the god of wisdom, bestowed on her every holy gift he had, including his wisdom.That brings up a second point. These are very down-to-earth gods. Beer - brewed grain - was an important part of their diet, if only because the alcohol granted some level of disinfection. Enki lavished his riches (and beer) on his beloved guest. The more beer he lavished on her and on himself, the more gifts he granted. Next morning, he woke up and asked his aides \\"What happened? - I did WHAT?\\" By then, Inanna was away with the goods.As a fertility goddess, Inanna had no equal. The stories go on at length describing the holy rites of fertility. She joyously embraces her own fertilization, or at least a good hearty attempt at it. What more could one ask of a goddess?The myths are truly wonderful stories, from the oldest written language in the West. The book is a collaboration of translator and mythologist, and seems stronger for both of their efforts. Each adds a useful commentary to the text, as does the artist who chose the authentic Sumerian artwork that decorates the text. Still, it seems clear that much has been lost to history, or has not yet been recovered form the fragmentary texts. As good as these stories and hymns may be, they'll just get better as more tablets are translated and more pieces puzzled together. It's a dicey process, though. As much as I enjoyed these stories, I wondered whether the pieces had been puzzled together correctly, or even belonged together. Awaiting further discoveries, no one can know.Inanna was a contemporary of Gilgamesh, who appears briefly. She is a natural complement to his story, and gives a wider view of that very early point in Western history.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"The story of Inanna is the heroine tale of a Sumerian Goddess. It tells the story of her coming into her power as a Goddess and the struggles she had to deal with along the way. It covers the making of her symbols of power from the Huluppu Tree, her acceptance of the holy me from, a gift from Enki, the god of Wisdom. It also tells of her marraige to the shepherd Dumuzi and their relationship. Most significantly, it tells of her journey to the underworld and her resurection. This story opens the eyes of the reader to the culture and the religious beliefs of the Ancient Sumerians. It portrays a respect and reverence for women and fertility which is unusual in present day society. Inanna and her ability to overcome struggles however, can be applied to the world of today. Through reading this book, you will learn much about overcoming adversity and becoming your own individual person."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"This story accounts important events in the life of the Sumerian fertility goddess Inanna. The story begins with \\"The Huluppu Tree\\", and then to \\"Inanna the Goddess of Wisdom\\", at which point in the story Inanna receives the precious \\"me\\" from the god Enki. The story then follows Inanna through \\"The Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi.\\" The final part of the story is called \\"The Descent of Inanna.\\" In this part Inanna travels to the underworld to see her sister, Erishkegal. Inanna dies in the underworld, only to be brought back to life with the help of Enki.I found the book a little difficult to get into at first, but then I began to see it as more than just a story, and I saw all of the things it exposed about the Sumerian culture and way of life. This book was more than just a story. It was filled with all types of emotion, and it exposed a new civilization to the world. Another part of this book that I liked was the fact that the main character of the story was a woman and a heroine. It shows just how important women were in life.I feel that this book, whether it is liked or not, should still be read. Not only does it shed new light on the idea of the woman/goddess as a heroine, it also opens a person's eyes to a different culture. It takes us out of modern day thinking and shows us what life was like in a culture very different from our own."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"Inanna was first introduced to me through a video that was produced in the late eighties. At first glance I thought the main narrator in the film was overemphasizing a narrative that in all actuality didn't require such emotion and energy. However, when we explored the text in more detail and I had the opportunity to read the story aloud, I realized that in reality the story of Inanna is both powerful and emotionally moving as it delves into the life of both a destructive and creative goddess.The story of Inanna is a culmination of four separate tales including: \\"The Huluppu Tree\\", \\"Inanna and the God of Wisdom\\", \\"The Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi\\", and \\"The Descent of Inanna.\\" Succinctly, the story follows Inanna as she attains womanhood, steals the \\"Me\\" in a drinking game with Enki, looses her virginity in a \\"milk\\" fiasco with Dumuzi, and redefines herself with a trip to the great below. Throughout the entire story Inanna's capacity for fertility and destruction is often emphasized and in the end this appears to be the main theme of the story.Even though the premise of Inanna is one often found in many of the books we read to day, the Sumerian style of writing was slightly off the beaten path of modern day literature. The plot progresses ever so slowly with continual repetition more akin to a prayer book than a myth. Often ideas and comments are repeated three times so as to clearly emphasize integral points. This mechanical repetition makes the book very easy to understand and conceptualize even though the underlying symbolism and message is very profound and timeless. The structure of the writing is also unorthodox. Throughout the entire first half of the book the reader feels lost in a web of ideas that seem to be leading to no real climax or focal point. Then the reader gets to \\"The Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi\\" and from there the book picks up. Ideas, especially those pertaining to sex, are often expressed in long metaphors that encourage the reader to conceptualize an idea more than just read and brush over a statement.Although I personally found the writing style slow, I still enjoyed the book. When read with a mature mindset, Inanna is an opportunity for modern civilization to explore a society that embraced a goddess of immense power. A goddess who's life appears to be mortal, but who's power and capacity dictates life and decides death. Overall an interesting book that I'm sure will grow on me with time."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"The result of a collaboration between Sumerian scholar Noah Kramer and folklorist Diane Wolkstein, this book is a thoughtfully annotated translation of the major Sumerian cuneiform texts devoted to the goddess Inanna-among the oldest religious texts in the world. It is illustrated with black-and-white reproductions of ancient Sumerian art, mostly on clay tablets.Our understanding of Sumerian culture continues to grow as new texts are found and our perceptions change. This book was published in 1983, and included material unknown to the general public at the time. There are four major stories of Inanna told here: \\"The Huluppu Tree,\\" \\"Inanna and the God Of Wisdom,\\"\\"The Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi,\\" and the extended epic \\"The Descent of Inanna.\\" Seven hymns to the goddess round out the collection.In \\"The Huluppu Tree,\\" we meet the adolescent Inanna, expectantly awaiting the attainment of her queenship. The Huluppu tree, which she has planted and tended as a symbol of her hopeful authority, becomes infested with evil creatures, like personal demons, that will not depart and bring her to despair. She eventually appeals to Gilgamesh to vanquish the demons, and they exchange gifts made from the wood of the tree, bringing them both to greater power.In \\"Inanna and the God of Wisdom,\\" Inanna, now sexually mature but still youthful and unproven, is welcomed by Enki, God of Wisdom, who acts the role of proud grandfather, giving a feast in her honor. Enki's magnamity increases as he drinks, and he ends up offering Inanna all the magical keys to human civilization. Inanna, with enthusiastic politeness, accepts the gifts, and then makes a quick exit, getting a head start before Enki thinks better of his generosity and sends his monsters in pursuit of the errant goddess. Inanna, with the help of her trusted companion goddess, gets passed the monsters and arrives in Uruk withher magical cargo, where she comes into her full power. Enki, apparently wise enough to let go of his greed in the face of fate, acknowledges Inanna's victory and ascendance.In \\"The Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi,\\" Inanna, after some initial resistance, enters into an erotic courtship with Dumuzi the shepherd. This text is strangely alluring, moving with untroubled ease from sexual frankness to touching detail. (The scene where Dumuzi knocks on the door of Inanna's house for the first time feels like it could have come straight from a modern teenager's diary). After the marriage is consummated, Dumuzi curtly informs Inanna that he's going to be very busy being king now-don't wait up, hon. This poignantly rapid slide from courtship to neglect sets the scene for events in the next narrative.In \\"The Descent of Inanna,\\" the goddess, now Queen of Heaven and Earth, finds herself drawn to enter the underworld, realm of the dead, ruled by her evil and somehow tragic sister-self, Ereshkigal. One by one, she is stripped of all the symbols of her power at seven gates, to be left naked and alone before the Queenof the Underworld, who kills Inanna with a single blow and hangs her on a hook to dry. Inanna has planned her own rescue in advance, though, and escapes to the surface, thronged by demons intent on finding someone to take her place. Inanna will not surrender to them her loyal sons, but when she returns to find her husband Dumuzi, not in mourning, but proudly sitting on his thrown and dispensing authority, she strikes him down and sends the demons after him. The tale of Dumuzi's flight is nightmarish and filled with dream imagery. Thanks to the efforts of his compassionate and self-sacrificing sister, and the softening of Inanna's own anger, a Persephone-like bargain is reached, and Dumuzi is allowed to return to the living for half of each year.The hymns that round out this book are an exciting glimpse of the actual religious practice of the Sumerians. Especially interesting for modern Pagans is the annual ritual wedding between goddess and king.I'm someone who tends to be rather skeptical about the ancient precedents of modern goddess worship, but these texts caught me off my guard. They are amazingly modern (or is it timeless?) in their content. The goddess actually grows psychologically and spiritually through the series of narratives, and theportrayal of the sexual dynamic between men and women rings uncannily true across four millennia. Inanna's story is the original heroine's journey. And, unlike most of her male counterparts, she doesn't need to kill anything to attain her spiritual victory. (Well, almost. Dumuzi gets a serious lesson in raw goddess power!). Her character seems to flow from woman to goddess and back again so smoothly, that it is impossible not to feel a living religion in these texts, one in which there was an intimate dialog between the powers of the goddess and the human experience of her priestesses.These original texts are better than any modern retelling of Inanna's story I have come across, not just because they are more \\"authentic\\", but because they are hauntingly moving. Unlike the familiar mythology of the Greeks and Romans, which has come down to us in a more or less \\"literary\\" style, these works seemmore spiritual, even liturgical. Repetition is combined with a directness of wording, and the result is often very powerful; there is a primal intensity about them. They disarm you with their open, almost child-like language, and then leave you sitting, mute and amazed, in that timeless central cavern of the human experience."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"Diane Wolkenstein revives ancient poetry that reminds us of a Goddess tradition, long lost to the Western world. In conjunction with Samuel Noah Kramer, a noted scholar on Sumer, she works with the subleties and ambiguities of the texts to reveal experiences long ago pressed into clay and forgotten.This book is a collection of stories &amp; hymns, translated from the cuneiform by Kramer. Wolkenstein, an expert in folktales, mythology, &amp; storytelling, worked with his translations to craft an essence of the myths that reads coherently; confronting the reader with stories that are at once archaic and contemporary.Numerous relief images from ancient Sumer enhance the &quot;otherness&quot; of the text. Rhythms and repetitive lineation loudly proclaim the exotic nature of this sacred poetry. And yet, at the heart of these stories, lie essential &amp; archetypal material, which underlies the lives of each of us. I like this feature of the book best--I can read these ancient hymns and find a resonance within my modern soul. Wolkenstein and Kramer have well accomplished what they set out to do.One notable feature of this poetry is the erotic content. Whether veiled in metaphor:&quot;At the king's lap stood the rising cedar.&quot;or explicit:&quot;As for me, Inanna, / Who will plow my vulva? / Who will plow my high field? / Who will plow my wet ground?&quot;this erotic sacred literature of a vanished people stands in stark contrast to the purified verses of the canonical Judeo-Christian scriptures. Long before religion villified sexuality, we read--we experience in this poetry--that it was an honored sacrament, inseparable from spirituality.The book concludes with chapters on Sumerian history, commentary on the material and translation, notes on the artwork, and a bibliography for further research. It contains an useful index.This book is appropriate as a translated primary source for undergraduate work about the ancient Near East or mythology. It is a great source for those seeking to explore (and reclaim) the history of the Goddess, and for those who just can't get enough good Sumerian poetry! Five stars for an excellent balance of the literary with the scholarly, for breathing new life into a lost tradition.(If you enjoyed this review, please leave positive feedback.

While Graves' work does not meet that standard, &quot;Innana&quot; more than does so.With the fist stanza, &quot;In the first days, in the very first days, in the first weeks, in the very first weeks, in the first years, in the very first years&quot;, you enter a primal Dreamtime where the the Goddess exists as a real being made tangible by enchanting words. It takes a true poet to translate words from a dead language into a modern one and have them retain their effect. Wolkstein does this with grace and power.The imagery of the tales and hymns themselves is lush, erotic, and real. I reccomend this book for anyone interested in finding a sacred text that opens up a living channel to the Goddess."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"This is a wonderful translation of the hymns to Inanna. I highly recommend it to those who are interested in ancient Sumer. However, I would like to add a cautionary note. These hymns were written in a much earlier time by a people not bound by our victorian prudery. They revelled in and honored the body beautiful. Much of the language is extremely frank.The hymn regarding the courtship of Dummuzi and Inanna is indeed beautiful and touching. It is an intimate peek into a very different time and culture where woman was treated with reverence and respect.This book would make a wonderful addition to any personal library, especially those interested in ancient civilizations."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"I found this book very fascinating, what little I knew about Inanna wasn't even covered in this--and this book covers alot. It is completely mind blowing to read these actual (though slightly adapted) Sumerian poems that are so...sensual and nearing explicitness. I would have liked to have seen more on Inanna's context in the Sumerian pantheon and her role in society. Also more on some of the art in the book would have been great, though seeing all of the pictures of these clay seals and such was great.A very interesting book, though if you are looking for some Sumarian equivalent to Bullfinch's Greek myths this is not it at all.I think I need to know more about Sumerian mythology and society in general to really appreciate this book, though. It is not really a good starting point."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"This excellent book is the result of a collaboration between Samuel Kramer, a renowned Sumerian specialist, and Diane Wolkstein, a talented writer and folklorist. Wolkstein took a selection of Sumerian poems about the goddess Inanna, translated by Kramer and others, and rendered them into modern and highly poetic English. Kramer worked with Wolkstein to ensure fidelity of Wolksteins renderings to the original Sumerian. Beyond the translations/reinterpretations, Wolkstein also assembled several poems into a sequence based on life history starting from early life to maturity, and in the case of the poem The Descent of Inanna, beyond life to resurrection. This arrangement may not be strictly historically correct but it gives this sequence real dramatic integrity. Individually, Wolkstein's versions are vivid. As commented by other reviewers, some of these poems contain sexually explicit sections, which may not be to everyone's taste, though these sections are also some of the most striking poetry in this selection.Accompanying the texts are an excellent series of short essays. One is by Kramer and gives a nice overview of Sumerian literature. Kramer also describes the history of the recovery of these texts. Wolkstein provides a very good set of interpretative comments on the poems. This book has a particularly nice set of illustrations drawn from Sumerian art and these selections are described very well in another short section of the book."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"Diane Wokstein's book of the story of Inanna, the original Goddess of the first recorded civilization five thousand years ago between the Tigres and the Euphrates, astonishes with its poetry and power.This legend, unlike the story of Persephone, describes a woman/Goddess who receives the wisdom of civilization, chooses her mate (with advice from her mother), and willingly descends into the underworld. Also, unlike the Greek myths, there are positive and loving male figures (especially Enki, the God of Wisdom.)I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in mythology and the evolution of myth."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"Anyone who wonders what life and love were like in pre-patriarchal times should read this book. In fact, anyone who has a heart should read this book. It contains a beautiful, unique love story, and tales of a great and karismatic goddess-queen, Inanna. My wife and I read the love story to each other now and then, and weep with joy, love, and sadness every time. The book shows just how much a great translator, Kramer, and a great story teller, Wolkstein, can do to bring alive a culture that is completely foreign to us."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"This a great volume! First off, having a folklorist help with the translation is a tremendous idea because there's a big difference between translating words and reproducing meaning. Wolkstein brings us the poetry and power of these works, while Kramer provides a guarantee everything is grounded in fact rather than being a Neo-Pagan/New Age snow job.Aside from the welcome addition of more Sumerian literature to my library, the volume includes brief essays on Sumerian history, the story of how the tablets were amassed and translated, and analysis of the works by Wolkstein. This material provides a welcome context for the poetry, and I liked that they put it after the works. You read and then hear what the experts have to say. The volume also includes photos of Sumerian art. As a result, this small volume gives you a taste of Sumer from multiple perspectives. It's an approach that should be used by others translating ancient texts.Although Wolkstein's analysis is illuminating and astute (particularly in her parsing of structure), I got a little uncomfortable with her analysis of the Descent poem. Rather than analyzing the work, she seemed to take an idea and run wild with it. Her insistance on a triple goddess identity for Inanna smacks more of modern-day feminist/neo-pagan cliches than anything in the actual text. On the other hand, since we will probably never know the exact meaning of these ancient texts, why not take some risks and analyze from a contempory perspective? After all, myths only have power if people can relate to them. I just wish in doing this she had picked a perspective that was less trite.But that's a minor point, and I'm sure there are others who would find it useful. Bottom line: If you're into Sumerian literature, this is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"In Sumarian times, Inanna was queen of Heaven, and with the \\"me\\", queen of Earth. Inanna would not be very accepted in modern day times because she tends to respond and react to situations quite differently than society would today. Inanna is not in love with the man to whom she is betrothed, and reacts rashly to the marriage, only to find herself suddenly in love soon after. Inanna changes her opinion of many things and sometimes judges situations too quickly. In today's society, Inanna would be regarded as a pompous goddess who gloats of her own powers and attributes. She admires her sexual attitude and her perfect body and appears to have much to learn. Thus, Enkidu, god of wisdom, is brought into the story to perhaps correct this flaw. However, she proves to be a cunning woman and warrior when she repeals the many monsters Enkidu throws at her, and thus earning the victory over the \\"me\\". She proves to have wisdom as well when she enters the underworld and dies only after she has planned her own resurrection. When Inanna leaves the underworld, she must have someone take her place. She quickly throws the demons at her husband only to realize that she may have made a mistake and feels regret. A queen/goddess that makes these careless decisions would be worshipped by few in modern day. One must look at the picture as a whole, however, and realize that this is a goddess that is going through her adolescence and is having to make choices in her life. Though they may not always be the right choices, she is starting to learn what is good and bad, right and wrong. Her life's journey has been hard and the events that she has experienced are beginning to shape who she is as a woman and goddess. We must respect Inanna for having the pride to marry, courage to enter the underworld, and remorse after committing a thoughtless choice. She is growing up and the hubris that she once had is turning into strength."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"This ancient epic follows the journey of the fertility godess, Inanna, to the underworld. Throughout the story, she is given the holy me by the drunken Enki, has a \\"fling\\" with Dumuzi, and is killed and brought back to life with the help of her loyal servant Ninshubur and the god Enki.For my first piece of Sumarian liturature, I was a bit surprised as to what I encountered; repitition is used quite frequently. This became boring to me after a while because I didn't think it was necessary to read the same thing over and over again. The god Enki toasts Inanna many times with the holy me, but now that I have read the story, I know that it is just to symbolize the importance of each item he toasts to her. Aside from the repetition, I was also surprised that as long ago as this was written, people didn't have as much shame in sexual acts. The act of intercourse is portrayed with detail to an extent that even some high school students could not help but laugh at. It's not the fact that high school students are not mature enough to handle it, it was just a shock to how in depth it goes. The concepts in the story were not very hard to grasp, but the form of writing made it a bit difficult to read.I was quite pleased with the outcome of the story, and was glad to have had the chance to experience a different piece of writing for a change. But I must say that Sumarian liturature is not my favorite, and I might not read another unless it's a requirement."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"This Sumerian piece of work was very different from what I am used to reading. It is not that i did not like it, I just wasn't used to the format that it was set up in. I understand that the Sumerians repeated parts of the story, but I personally got uninterested when certain phrases were repeated five times. Although this story is very graphic and sexual, it described it in a way where most people could understand without having to bluntly say that they were having sex. Even as a high school student I understood what was going on between Inanna and Dumuzi. I also liked how realistic it was when Enki gave all of his me to Inanna while he was drunk. It just goes to show that people do stupid things when they are intoxicated. The characters are also realistic. For example, when Dumuzi is power hungry for the throne and totally ignores Inanna, even though she gave him his power. I was extremely surprised that Erishkegal could treat her sister in that way; when Inanna only came down to grieve the loss of Erishkegal's husband. It was very ironic when Dumuzi curses his friend for betraying him when Dumuzi did the same thing to Inanna. The fact that Inanna forgave Dumuzi by doing that for his sister after he deceived her is happy and realistic because people forgive and forget. If this story was not written the way it was, with symbols and vivid descriptions, it would have been pretty boring. Since it was thoughtfully written but easy to understand, then I would have to recommend the book only to people to have open minds about different literature. I think I will appreciate the story and understand it a little better when I am older."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"Sumerian literature is not something that I would read everyday. I was first introduced to Inanna in my high school class. I wasn't really interested in reading this tale, but as we were paired off I began to read this intriguing story. It doesn't have difficult concepts to grasp and that is one reason that I liked it. You could still interpret the text the way that you wanted to because it wasn't point blank saying things, but it was leading you in a direction. An example of this could be when Enki gives the Holy me to Inanna. He gets drunk and you don't know if he uses it as an excuse to give her the me or if he really wasn't thinking straight. It allows you to interpret it in many ways. There is a lot of repetition in the story. I believe that this was to get a strong point across, but it didn't connect with me. I didn't like to read the same thing over again five times. One part of the story (The Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi) that I thought was rather promiscuous was the parts were they were talking about Inanna and Dumuzi having sex. Even though it wasn't directly said it seemed to be giving too much detail. I didn't think that it was an important part of the story, so it didn't need to be included as much. I have to say that it was better described through the fertility of the land though and fit into the story because Inanna is the goddess of fertility. The journey that Inanna takes to the underworld shows that she is vulnerable, but still capable of many things. From her death and her coming back to the world above, you are able to see who her real friends and allies are. This is a story that proves that people are not what they seem to be as shown by the way the Dumuzi does not get off the throne when Inanna gets back. Overall, I thought the story wasn't too bad for a piece of literature that was a style that I'm not used to and something out of my culture."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"If you have any interest in Inanna or ancient Mesopotamian religion, this is the book for you. Very informative, with translations of actual cuneiform tablets &quot;written&quot; by Inanna's people. This book brought me closer to knowing Her, and I look forward to reading another book about her that I plan to buy soon..."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"Although I can't say I really knew too much about ancient Middle-Eastern culture before reading this book, I can say that it definitely prompted more questions and encouraged me to look beyond the traditional method of storytelling and pursue something that, while foreign to me, was once a very sacred and valued belief. Inanna tells the story of a regular woman in the pique of her womanhood that, due by and large to a stroke of good fortune, stumbles upon these gifts of life called the \\"me.\\" With these gifts, Inanna (now a great goddess) takes on not only her duties as a wife to her new husband Dumuzi, but also a nearly epic journey through the underworld to her sister Erishkigal, which allows her to experience a deeper understanding and wisdom that will deem her one of the greatest goddesses of her time. Inanna constantly encounters obstacles, some presented in metaphors to represent the hardships and temptations of life, while others simply provide the experience needed for Inanna to gain enough perception and fortitude to continue on her crossing over to womanhood.Reading this book brings with it the ability to journey back into the time of Inanna, experience its sense of reverence and piousness, and truly appreciate these ancient peoples' beliefs. One of the most effective ways of emphasizing the importance or sacredness of a subject was the way in which one line or an entire section would be repeated. For example, when listing all of the gifts of me that Inanna receives from Enki, God of Wisdom, the same sentence is repeated with each different gift that Inanna receives at the end. This allows the reader to absorb the magnitude and importance of each gift while addressing the main point at the same time, reading much slower than the typical American pace. Although there are parts of the writing that repeats itself, the story is also told in a clear and concise manner, so the sense of urgency and worth never leaves the reader. Being forced to read this much more carefully really exposes a whole new aspect and appreciation for the writing, and gives the reader a worth-while experience."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"The story of Inanna can only be described as wierd. Yes, we all know that the story is from the Middle East and comes from a time when literature was completely different from how it is today. Although it was fun to sing the songs of the characters within a group in a high school class, the story didn't strike me as a personal favorite. I believe that it is a story not particulary written for high school students as we sometimes get lost in the humorous hints of sexuality and the numerous accounts of repetition. However, the story does contain good story line about a character known as Inanna who is the goddess of love. It enlightens certain decisions that she must make in her journey that will make her a woman. From Enki, her father, giving her all of his \\"me\\" because he was so drunk to Inanna's journey in the underworld, the story is rather entertaining if you are attentive.From my experience of the book, its not a story that I would pull out of a bookshelf and just begin to read. When laid in front of me as an example of a different writing style from the past, I took it what it was and made the most of it."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"This piece was not one that I ever would have chosen to read myself, but was instead introduced to it by my 11th grade English teacher. It is not a work of literary genius, but is instead a simple story of explanation created by the ancient Sumerian people about the lives of their gods. Similar stories exist today such as that of Santa Claus to explain the appearance of presents under the tree Christmas day. The characters are presented as ordinary and their thoughts and actions are on the same level, if not below, that of the average person. They make mistakes that portray them as entities to be learned from, but not mimicked. When the god of wisdom gets drunk and gives away all of his greatest possessions it makes me wonder about the earlier definition of wisdom. Family is another subject that seems contorted. If this story was meant to enclose life lessons why is Inanna presented with the \\"gift\\" of prostitution by her father figure, the enlightened god of wisdom, and then murdered by her sister. Another aspect of ancient life that was revealed by this composition is the common occurrence of infidelity. Inanna has only recently married and slept with Dumuzi when he tells her that he would like to sleep with other people. If Inanna, a goddess, can only entertain her husband for a short time, how long would an average woman last? One further aspect of this story that irritated me was the constant repetition. I understand that it was meant to stand out from the rest of the text, but there are other ways to drill important pieces of information into the mind of the reader. This story is a good tool for looking into the past and discovering the thoughts and beliefs that were held in ancient times. I have learned about a new style of writing, gained some insight into the Sumerian world, and enjoyed a good, if simple, story"},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"Being new to the style of Sumarian writing, at first I did not appreciate the repetition of this story. I felt repeating the same line numerous time was tedious and boring, but in the end it made me realize the most important bits of the story. The repetition was especially important when Inanna received the gifts of life called the \\"me\\" from the god of wisdom, Enki. Each gift was repeated a few times, this showed the glory of these gifts while helping me to remember what they were.Diane Wolkstein opened my eyes to a new type of writing with her Middle Eastern work, Inanna, the story of a girl coming into womanhood, taking her place as queen and then making a journey to the underworld to visit her sister Erishkigal. In this metaphorical piece, nothing is said bluntly but, it was easy to understand what was happening. For example in the story the \\"courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi\\", Wolkstein never says they are having sex but the writing lets readers infer that is what's happening. Because Inanna is goddess of the earth, references to plants during their love making is used often, such as \\"who will plow my high fields\\". Inanna takes a journey to the underworld to visit her sister. Going through the seven gates of Hell each time taking away a little of her identity. This was made to represent the hardships of Inanna's life each time mostly representing earthly temptations she needed to get ride of.It was very educational to experience the Sumarian style of writing. Even with the unique style of writing, it was an interesting story and opened my eyes to Middle Eastern culture. This story takes a mature reader with its graphical love seems, but if the reader is mature enough to handle those I feel it is a great story showing the hardships of growing."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"Wow. This book is incredible. If you have any interest in the ancient societies of the Middle East buy this book. The translations are clear and give you a feeling of being a part of something that is bigger than every day life. I can't even pick out a favorite with any ease (though I may lean toward &quot;The Lady of the Morning&quot; and &quot;The Lady of the Evening&quot; for personal reasons). Let me say it again: buy this book."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"Inanna is about the Sumerian goddess of fertility and the grain. This epic is one of sacred love and worship. It celebrates the goddess religion. This epic predates that of the Iliad and the Bible and yet it predicts the great flood and other events in both. If you wish to read a book rich in Sumerian culture this is the epic for you. It gives a sense of what life was like in one of the very first cultures on earth. Reading Inanna by Wolkstein will broaden your horizons and give you an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"Recently my 11th grade English class and I were assigned the Sumerian novel, Inanna. Now this piece of writing is a shock to many who are not familiar with Middle Eastern literature. This story was complete with an unbroken chain of metaphors and several lines of repetition that told the story so that the reader really had to look behind the veil of the writing to discover the plot. This plot recited the tale of a goddess by the name of Inanna who is portrayed and done so respectfully by her sexual vigor and her salacioius assesets. The way the novel is written, it seems women are expected to flaunt their feminine features proudly and sex is described as a civilizing event, not a Satanic repercussion. The climatic plot of the novel is observing Inanna in her descent into the underworld in order to mourn the death of her sister's husband. As a quick sidenote, Inanna's sister is Ereshkigal, the goddess of the underworld, while Inanna lives in Heaven and is the goddess of the steppe. Therefore, Ereshkigal represents the ultimate opposite side of Inanna, her evil mirrored image. Once in the underworld, Inanna is killed by her sister, but through a fair swap, she is replaced by her husband Dumuzi and his sister Geshtinanna and is therefore freed. Inanna's journey is engrossing to say the least but the teaching to take from this is that it is possible to forgive and let live and what you do can return in or against your favor three times greater."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"I first encountered Inanna a couple of weeks ago in my high school English class as we paired into groups and read it aloud to each other. For someone who has never before ventured into the world of ancient Middle Eastern literature, it was both eye-opening and somewhat disconcerting to me. This edition is based off of a set of four related tales: \\"The Huluppu Tree\\", \\"Inanna and the God of Wisdom\\", \\"The Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi\\", and \\"the Descent of Inanna\\". These tales follow Inanna, the goddess of fertility, as she fornicates with the shepherd Dumuzi, gains near infinite power from the god of wisdom, Enki, while in a drunken state, and finally journeys into the underworld to confront her evil sister, Erishkigal.The first thing one notices while reading this tale is its separation from the format of modern literature and storytelling. In order to drive a point home, ideas are repeated over and over, characters repeat themselves multiple times, and the protagonist must put herself through countless trials, gates, similar visitations, and must perform repeated actions throughout her journey. This kind of writing becomes very redundant and forces the story to slowly unravel, as Inanna travels at a painfully slow pace through the gates of the underworld, visits a number of gods one by one only to have each one drone the same quote, and encounters similar situations where through magical synchronicity everything occurs uniformly and in repeated instances. As with many mythological tales, characters often perform fantastical, illogical, and wildly dramatic actions, such as when Inanna visits her sister, and her sister strikes her dead, hanging her lifeless corpse on a hook on the wall. Finally, there is the \\"Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi\\", the quarter of the story devoted to the questionably necessary description of the erotic love-making between Inanna and Dumuzi, who speak in undeniably suggestive metaphors. After reading this section, the reader will never think of \\"milk\\" in the same way again.However, if the reader is mature enough, there is some to be taken away from this tale. It is an honest portrayal of a woman in her sexual prime, not ashamed, but rather proud of her physical appearance. The story also exhibits woman not as a warring, conflict-brewing character, as in Greek mythology, but as a genuinely loving and innocent yielder of life."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"I could not put this book down. It incresed my interest in the goddess Inanna and Sumerian mythology so much I immediately purchased (from amazon.com) Inanna, Lady of Largest Heart : Poems of the Sumerian High Priestess by Betty De Shong Meador."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"I'm a pretty big nut when it comes to Sumerian gods and goddesses, so this book was a no brainer. I also have \\"Inanna: Lady of the Largest Heart,\\" which I would highly reccommend in addition to this book for those who want to learn more about Inanna and Sumeria.This is mostly a collection of short hymns to Inanna, and show her gentle side. Some of the hymns are rather explicit in their descriptions of sex, something kind of out of character for a goddess of love (and of war, let's not forget!). A lot of the poems are really heartwarming, for lack of a better term. I'd actually read some of these to my girlfriend for \\"romantic poetry,\\" and we both enjoyed them (even though she isn't really into the Sumerian stuff).There are a lot of copies of the ancient Sumerian tablets and images of Inanna, which will really help you get a clear picture of her.The second half of the book is information about Inanna and Sumeria, not exactly really interesting for me, but well written. This would be the best book to pick up for those interested in Inanna, then check out \\"Lady of the Largest Heart.\\""},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"My classmates and I read this book together. It was a very interesting book, and was our introduction into Sumerian literature. The fact that the literature was ancient made me very curious as to what it would be like.After the first few sections about the Huluppu Tree and Inanna receiving the honorable me from Enki, the tale was pretty straightforward. I really enjoyed the symbolism of the creatures that made their home in the Huluppu tree. The me that Inanna received varied from practical, to completely off of the wall, but I guess every one of them could be useful at one point or time.The next section was about the courtship of Dumuzi and Inanna. At first, I found it really interesting how Inanna denied Dumuzi because he was not a farmer. The parallels she made between the farmer and Dumuzi were not only literal, but also symbolic. It was interesting how the relationship was explained through nature.The Descent of Inanna was probably my favorite section. Just seeing the fact that Inanna and Erishkegal were the exact opposites of each other, but together, were the complete woman. I was amazed at how cruel Erishkegal actually was towards Inanna.The end of the story was really interesting, and the parallel between the Greek Goddess Persephone and Dumuzi was very surprising! Just the fact that two different cultures could have such similiar stories was very interesting to me!As I said, this was my first experience of Sumerian literature, and although this piece was quite vivid at times, it was definently worth noting."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"The story of Inanna was a bit out of the ordinary for everyone who read it. Especially since I read it during my high school English class, I was somewhat flabbergasted at first. Among the different methods of writing and the different culture it conveyed, I think that it originally shocks most. Once you get beneath the outer layer though, you begin to develop a certain respect and appreciation for it. First, the form of writing by itself is at art to say the very least. The techniques of hiding specific lessons and messages within the text were fascinating; to think someone in this primitive time in history could do this is baffling. Also, the way that it was written for the purpose of learning is amazing in itself. The repetition may get annoying I must admit, but you develop and understanding of the language after awhile. It makes you really wonder what life was back when it was written. The question always comes into your mind throughout the whole story of what was going on at this exact time in history.The culture and the life style must have been so different. Reading about this goddess Inanna and her journey through life, really made me put my life in prospective. Learning the background of the Middle East, a whole new side of our world that I have never heard of before, was so interesting. The way that their culture embraced sexuality, among many other things, that our society is embarrassed of today really has to tell you something. Watching an interpretation of the story on video in English class was self-explanatory. People's first reacting was just to laugh and they immediately thought that it was just some inappropriate story. When Inanna is in her courtship with Dumuzi, and when she alone embraces her gender, you really need to appreciate that instead of giggle.The most important part of the section of the story that we ended up reading had to be Inanna's descent and ascent in the underworld. It was so interesting how a goddess would actually willingly venture to the very depths of our earth. She sacrificed everything she knew for the most horrible experience in her life. Although, you could also look at it as the most amazing experience. Though she had to go through many unpleasant times, such as removing all of her garments, she really did reach enlightenment. Especially when she is able to ascend from the dark place solely because of her friendship with Ninshubur. That shows true devotion that a friend would never give up just to help Inanna get her life back and be able to share her experience with others.Over all I definitely give Inanna four stars if on nothing else but respectability. I truly admire where this story came from, and how important it is that we study it. I recommend this epic because of its true expression of Middle Eastern history, and because its an interesting story of a goddess achieving enlightenment."},{"Title":"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth: Her stories and hymns from Sumer","review":"I won't say that I'm not pleased with my purchase, however I will say that the merchandise can't be described as very good.

What I didn't expect--or forgot--was the profound spiritual impact that the biographies retain even after 13-15 centuries.The book consists of translations of three hagiographies from the 5th through 7th centuries from the regions of Asia Minor and Egypt. Each is written by rough contemporaries of the saint in question or his followers. Perhaps the most fascinating of these accounts is the remarkable life of St. Daniel the Stylite. An ascetic in the tradition of his mentor, St. Simeon, Daniel spent the last 30 or so years of his life standing atop a pillar. There he gained a reputation as a living saint and dispensed wisdom and miracles to commoners, patricians, bishops, and even emperors such as Leo and Zeno. His fame was such that the heretical usurper Basiliscus was cowed by St. Daniel who came down from his pillar to issue a rebuke.St. Theodore of Sykeon was another ascetic miracle worker and reluctant bishop from the area of Asia Minor near Ancyra. He lived during the tumultous late 6th and early 7th century and, much like St. Daniel, he was sought out by the great and small alike for his wisdom and for his ability to cast out demons. This biography contains numerous examples of his battles with demons--who called him \\"iron eater\\" in reference to his strength and power over them. St. Theodore was well known to the emperor Maurice and famously rebuked the tyrant Phocas who had usurped the throne and murdered the family of Maurice.St. John the Almsgiver was a married layman who was called to the patriarchate of Alexandria after his wife and children perished. He was renowned for his outstanding generosity and care of the poor in Alexandria during a time of military defeat, economic collapse, and wholesale destruction in the Greek east. Truly, St. John \\"spoiled the poor\\" as Mother Theresa of Calcutta would later put it, and is a great example of charity and piety for us today.In short, this book is very useful as a historical document, as the stories of many famous historical persons are intertwined with the lives of these saints. In several cases, these lives serve as the only known record of certain events. However, don't be surprised if these biographies have a certain spiritual impact on you as well. While some of the anecdotes related seem to suffer from the hyperbole of oral tradition, most of them are credible accounts of incredible suffering, piety, physical endurance, and miraculous events. All in all, a great read for anyone interested in this period."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"In this book contains almost every documented fact about the little girl JonBenet's murder. If you haven't closely followed the case already, this book will get facts straight in your head as to who's who and what's what. If you pretty much know everything that has been released about the murder, this book will seem reduntant and boring. This book won't give you any new insider secrets or clues unknown, but Dr. Cyril Wecht plainly tells you his theory on the murder and explains the medical jargon he uses to support his theory. I think the book serves as a &quot;fact refresher&quot; and a good read."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"I am sadly and steeply disappointed by previous reviews here, of those who scream &quot;nothing new&quot; and &quot;the killer isn't revealed&quot; or some equal nonsense. Did the reader really expect to pay $6 to solve the murder? Reality is a cold drink of water, my friends. At least give Dr. Wecht the credit he deserves. Of course it's the same info, we're all working from publicly accessible documents here! If he broke the case beyond a shadow of a doubt and to a moral certainty, he'd be sitting in jail for breaking the law, which would almost exclusively be the way to get the information! As a journalist, I can sympathize with the critical: the book does get a little tedious and lost in the details that seem to swirl around the consequential players in the case. But the concise examination of fundamental evidence cannot be ignored. Wecht's resources and access are limited, but his analysis of what IS available is both gripping and intimate. Dr. Wecht, I would be very honored to hear from you myself, and you feel free to drop me an e-mail anytime. I'd be glad to have you in my corner if the sky began to fall."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"Dr. Wecht truely is the Sherlock Holmes of forensic pathology. His analysis of the autopsy report and crime scene are both fascinating and eye opening. I admired Dr. Wecht's involvement with the Kennedy assasination. His reputation is impeccable and he is well respected among his peers. I wanted to read one book on the JonBonet Ramsey case. This book was chosen solely on the basis Dr. Wecht was associated with it. He does not disappoint!!"},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey?

His scenario is most likely the real reason she was accidently killed."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"Facinating and detailed.

A friend of mine told me about this book. It was written by the Allegheny County Coroner in Pennsylvania. It was neat to know that a far-local had written this book. The beginning of the book is very interesting and keeps you reading. However, after about the middle of the book it goes to before the murder of Jon Benet and talks about the history of the Ramsey family and neighbors. If you are interested in Criminology this would be a good book to read and learn how the evidence and case was destroyed."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"This book explores several different theories and the likelihood of each. Prior to the publication of this book I submitted a theory to Dr. Wecht. He actually took the time to answer me personally. Alot of thought went into his analysis of the evidence in this crime, unlike the tabloids some other readers have suggested.If you want a theory that Jon Bonet was kidnapped and killed by two headed space monkeys, then read the tabloids. But if you want the facts, read this book."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"To: Cyril Wecht, M.D. J.DI read the background of John and Patsy Ramsey in your book. I did not see a victimology. I am sure you know that in cases of sexual deveient behavior involving death, the victim can supply the answer. I have not been able to follow the case closley, but have not heard many questions I would like to have answered that relates to the victim. I would think the F.B.I. as well as the other investigators would have conducted this by now. The jewlery worn by the victim may in fact tell us a little more, but I am sure you understand where I am going with that. I would like to hear from you as I am a retired Det./Lt and I suppose a little like an old fire horse. Good book and information."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey?

(Onyx True Crime)","review":"I really found this book more interesting than the others about JonBenet. I agree with Cyril Wecht's position on what happened to her because it is the most probable conclusion. I am not sure why so many people had angry reviews on here. The book is well written whether you agree with the author or not. The police ruined the case and that is the truth no matter what you believe about the Ramseys and there seems to be a lot of proof of sexual abuse even with no semen. DNA could have been on her body from anyone at the Christmas party that night and I don't think you can clear anyone as a suspect since all the evidence was no badly mismanaged."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey?

If you have followed the case since the beginning most of the book would be stuff you already know. It wouldn't really be a waste of your money. It is intriging, but I was disappointed at the ending of the book."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"This book is disappointing.I found there to be too much in the way of the authors opinions and not enough fact to back it up. Everyone has their own opinions on what happenes to poor Jonbenet Ramsey but I was interested in an unbiased account of what went on.I did not feel I got this from this book.I wouldn't recommend this account to those who are interested in facts and evidence,not another personal opinion.I did'nt find this book to be as well written as expected.Look elsewhere for the facts."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"Cyril Wecht, who is a well known medical examiner gives a very thorough explanation of the autopsy report but, it is the only interesting thing in the book. The rest of the book does not bring new light to the murder of this child. There are parts of the book that are repetitive. Dr. Wecht gives some good explanations about the inside job, the possibility of a relative ( parents)however, there are questions that are still are unswered."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"Dr Wecht gives his opinion on a famous autopsy and could report his thought in let-us-say 20 pages. in his desperate attempt to write a complete book and who-knows? get on the bestseller coattails of the murder, he managed to fill 350 pages. A Guinness record in padding!"},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"Cyril Wecht is a forensic pathologist and known for some extraordinary findings. He is opinionated, direct and straight forward. He makes good sense of autopsy facts yet, he is speculative in his conclusions. Interestingly, Wecht came to his conclusion almost immediately after seeing the first photographs from the Globe and never swayed. My cope was signed by Wecht and behavior is in line with his hand writing. In my upcoming book \\"the principle of lying is telling the truth, just not the whole truth\\", the JonBenet Ramsey case will be discussed and the elusive S.B.T.C [sic no dot] revealed. And no, my conclusions are not the same as Cyril Wecht's."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"Overall, I think this is a very good book and I am not questioning Dr. Wecht's qualifications, his work or his conclusions.I think that the book could have been improved by some small editing to minimize the effusive gushing over Dr. Wecht's accomplishments.I don't know if this was done by the co-author or by Dr. Wecht himself, but the laudatory comments read like someone bragging in a high school yearbook. The language used to attempt to glorify Dr. Wecht had the opposite effect on me. I felt it was overdone, childish and unnecessary.However, other than that, I think this is a very sensible, readable book, and I do recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Ramsey case."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"A disappointing book to read...all the information stated in the book was not factual. The information was pulled from tabloids and news articles. ...who reported it first....I think people are buying this book because of Dr Wecht...don't waste your money...We all know who the real killer is! And it isn't mommy and daddy!"},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"The brilliant forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht is becoming &quot;bigger than his art.&quot; While his theories are often sound, he seems more interested in promoting himself. And this book isn't even written in HIS VOICE! The co-author talks about Wecht like an icon. Despite that, the book is taut and entertaining. The self-promotion knocks it down a few notches, though."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"There are many books on the Ramsey case. I chose Wecht's because of his solid work on the Kennedy assasination, his outstanding experience as a medical examiner, and his reputation for hard-nosed independence. On the whole, I was not disappointed, though the book does not work well as an introduction to the case. As could be expected, Wecht concentrates on his specialty - what JonBenet's autopsy reveals about the crime. His findings in this regard are very emphatic, and are underscored by a refusal to speculate about the case as a whole. Those readers looking for revealing scenarios will be disappointed; the book sticks closely to the facts without indicting anyone, though the no nonsense conclusion states that the crime was almost certainly a family affair. Neither does the author dwell on the notorious infighting inside Boulder city government, nor the contaminated crime scene itself. For a book that concentrates on physical facts, this latter seems a curious omission, since the surroundings in which the body awas found should reveal a lot about the crime itself. I suppose the scene was too disturbed by the father's movements and inept police procedure to provide the type of scientific cerainty Wecht prefers. Anyway, I think those surroundings deserved more discussion than they got. On the whole, Wecht's book is not the last word on this fascinating case and genuine tragedy, but neither can it be ignored.I've been accused over the years of having a morbid streak because of the true crime books I read. It's probably true. Still, I'm old enough to remember when true crime was solely the subject of pulp magazines with formula writing, whose provocative covers I would sneak when my mother wasn't looking. But a curious thing has happened to crime coverage in the last thirty-five years (starting with In Cold Blood). It's become not only a respectable literary genre for those who care, but a real source of insight for readers in general. Murder is no longer just murder. A well-researched and well-written true crime book can provide rare glimpse into how lives are lived, how communities are run, and ultimately, into what we as a society value. For example, in the Ramsey case, we glimpse: the tacky world of beauty contests among little girls hardly old enough to walk, the private lives and dark psychology of a millionaire family, an ineptly run Boulder justice system failing in its primary duty, and a media that would probably pay this crime no mind were the parents of average income. In short, murder has become a type of sociology, made meaningful by people who are names, not just numbers. For writer and reader alike, a well-done crime book is like a knife cutting through a community : layers of day-to-day life are suddenly exposed that would otherwise remain hidden. Such unrehearsed revelations can provide real insight. Maybe morbid psychology got me started as a boy, but as an adult, I don't apologize to anyone for my true crime library."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"I don't understand why other people have trashed this book. Cyril Wecht's analysis of the crime scene and autopsy report is the best description of the murder out yet. He is methodical, logical, and draws on years of experience. And, his scenario matches the available evidence. I think this is the best book on the JonBenet Ramsey case available now."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"I believe that this book contains very well written information of facts gathered from the Ramsey's investigation. This book can not tell us who killed JonBenet, it can really only leave us to believe who we think may have killed her. I believe that this book has a great aspect on the slaying of JonBenet and I would strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"The only useful information for the average reader audience was Doctor Wecht's explanation of the autopsy evidence. I agree that the death of JonBenet was probably some family member in the house that night - John, Patsy, or Burke Ramsey. Wecht states that Burke could have killed her, but rules him out because it, &quot;did not fit with his analysis.&quot; I believe Burke does fit because common sense and logic says that John and Patsy Ramsey would cover up this killing if Burke had killed his sister by accident and/or during a sex game that got out of hand. If a golf club was the weapon that fractured JonBenet's skull that night, even a ten year old child like Burke could have done the deed with this type of instrument. Supposedly JonBenet used to sleep with her brother in his bed when she wet her own, did they ever play child sex games? Why did the parents state that Burke was asleep during Patsy's 911 call when the enhanced tape showed he was awake, and asking them questions, with his father seeeming to be annoyed by Burke's queries? In the Schiller book, &quot;Perfect Murder, Perfect Town&quot;, he states that JonBenet received a traumatic injury to her face with a golf club, about a year BEFORE her death. Who hit her, and what were the circumstances that caused the injury? Schiller fails to tell the reader who hit her, could it be the same person that fractured her skull that fatal night in 1996? While Doctor Wecht is famous for his Sherlock Holme's detective capabilities, I think he needs to reevaluate his conclusion that Burke Ramsey doesn't fit his analyses; ditto, for all the other expert's who only see Patsy and/or John Ramsey as the only &quot;logical&quot; perps. Logic says that parent(s) will do most anything to protect their child, even covering up the death of a sister by a brother."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"I completely disagree with readers who've called this book &quot;disappointing&quot; and said that it shares &quot;nothing new.&quot; Cyril Wecht's interpretation of the forensic report sheds light on motive, opportunity, and means. Charles Bosworth's writing is of a very high quality for true-crime books. The authors do an excellent job of providing the differing points of view in the case (police, DA's office, and the Ramsey family), but they don't shy away from educated speculation (which of course is what all of us who are so interested in the case are engaged in). I would recommend it to fellow Court TV junkies and those with an interest in true-crime stories."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"This book was well written and held my attention from cover to back. The book gives you many facts, yet allows you to make your own decision as to who you think did it. The authors pose some very thought provoking questions. After reading this factual book, I am still curious to hear other points of view. I will read another book on this case to cover all angles, but this book is excellent at making the wheels turn in your own head."},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"Dr. Cyril Wecht offers an experienced and objective analysis of the public information about the JonBenet Ramsey investigation.It is painful to hear about the missteps of the Boulder Police Department in the crucial, intial moments of the investigation. Yet, as Wecht quoted of Sherlock Holmes, &quot;When you have eliminated the impossible, that which remains--however improbable--must be the answer.&quot;It is equally painful to think that the parents of this child, who have rightfully or wrongfully, and at times conspicuously, appeared as victims, would have been involved in her grisly death. Yet it is this very improbability which stands alone among the various scenarios as being the most plausible..Wecht stops short of offering his opinion on what actually may have happened...Hopefully justice will indeed be served and the perpetrator(s) and/or co-conspirator(s) will Who killed JonBenet Ramsey?"},{"Title":"Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey? (Onyx True Crime)","review":"I found this book to be very interesting, the Dr. gave us a great opportunity to come to answer our own questions. This is an unsolved crime therefore he could not tell us &quot;WHO&quot; killed Jonbenet but rather he gave us his &quot;OPINION&quot;as to what may have taken place. I TRUELY believe the Father or Brother was the killer and the dutiful Mother helped to cover it up.Having insight to sexual abuse on a child she seemed to have many qualities of a sexually abused child and in many states there was enough of them for the parents to have been investigated. They were quite &quot;Lucky&quot;to have been living in such a small and trusting community and to have been percieved as &quot;The Perfect Family&quot;. Had this family(I use that loosely) helped in the beginning since they had nothing to hide I believe they would have found Jonbenets killer. Of course in my opinion they already know who it is and time will tell. Usually the guilty can't handle the guilt if they truely loved the deceased and they come forward but saddly usually only in death.Unless they are very adapt to handling pressure and in that case it usually takes many years and then eventually death. The death of Jonbenet was horrible and it has effected many in the world, I would like to read John and Patsys version but they are Rich, Alive and in my mind cold blooded and do not deserve a penny of anyones good hard earned money!

Here's an excerpt from Icke's book:...JonBenet was murdered on Christmas Eve and Josef Mengele created a sacrificial ritual for this date called \\"The Last Bulb of the Christmas Tree\\".

Though some of his conclusions are now outdated by modern research, no one has written with more poetry and skill on this topic than Ardrey. Throughout his quartet of books on human origins and behaviour [African Genesis is the first of the four] Ardrey shows how mankind is less of a fallen angel and more of a risen ape; and that man truly is still only a halfway house between the ape and the human being.After a Broadway flop American playwright Robert Ardrey [author of the play Thunder Rock and the script for the film Khartoum among others] toured East and Southern Africa in the early 1960s. This was a time when astonishing fossil discoveries were being made in the Olduvai Gorge by the Leakey family and by others showing that humanoids had originated in Africa some 2 million years ago. Ardrey talked to the fossil-hunters, the palaeontologists and the anthropologists and learned all he could of the new discoveries and their implications for human origins and behaviour.Ardrey's main thesis is that mankind was born in Africa over 2 million years ago, and for most of that two million years the species' success has been largely dependant on its ability to kill. Without that underlying hard edge the species would have vanished aeons ago along with all the others that failed to survive. And only if we take that unpalatable truth about ourselves into account can modern mankind be truly understood.In this book Ardrey's hero is Australian-born palaeontologist Raymond Dart who discovered and named the first Australopithecus Africanus skull in the 1930s, and who correctly identified Africa as the first home of the human species and A. Africanus as a human ancestor in the face of ridicule and rejection by the scientific establishment for 30 years. The book is moving and beautifully written. If you want to understand human nature, and the possibilities for both the past and the future of the species, there is no better place to start than African Genesis."},{"Title":"African genesis;: A personal investigation into the animal origins and nature of man (A Laurel edition)","review":"African Genesis is a book that deals with experiments, scientific facts, and evolutionary developments. Even though its old you still have to respect all of the different information in this book. Ardrey's first explanation's are the importance of territory. He used two studies done by other Anthropologists. One with ants the other with birds. The red ant experiment was done by Eugene Maris, it was simply a little bridge that the ants wouldn't cross to leave their territory, but would cross when coming back. Eugene Maris's other works are explained in great detail in this book. His other experiments were more interesting. The bird experiment, done by Eliot Howard, explained the importance of a male establishing its territory before anything else; with birds and apes. It explains an error in Darwin's teachings of man, claiming that sexual tendencies are the first priority. Howard, in all his long career, never knew of a male bird, with territory, to lose a mate; nor a male bird without territory to gain one. Ardrey shows some of these same examples later in the book with gorillas.Its stuff like this that makes me believe evolution over creation. Reading though the chapters the relationships of us to Australopithecus africanus or erectus is amazing. According to this book A africanus was a carnivorous smaller type of gorilla, erectus was a vegetarian and was bigger than africanus. Ardrey's Romantic fallacy deals with many animals that had true emotions and showed some examples. You see its all evolution. The last chapter is a laudatory approach to free speech. Ardrey is humble about agreeing with him or not, but not to ignore natural sciences brought to us. We are an unfinished revolution he says. He continues and then relates back to Africa's origin of man. The next book I will look for is where this one left off; for this left off at our stage. I would have liked him to continue and explain how all the different races formed if we came from Africa. But that may be too much for this book. What matters is after you read this book you have a clear understanding of Darwin's decent of man. You know that evolution is a long process and has many debates (like Ardrey's 24 paragraph debate of evidence that the use of weapons is a human legacy from the animal world). Anybody that is interested in the evolution of man and African anthropology, you'll want to start with this book."},{"Title":"African genesis;: A personal investigation into the animal origins and nature of man (A Laurel edition)","review":"For those dissatisfied with the ludicrous baggage of the world's gods and religions as the origin of mankind and the source of human behaviour, Robert Ardrey is a good place to start. Though some of his conclusions are now outdated by modern research, no one has written with more poetry and skill on this topic than Ardrey. Throughout his quartet of books on human origins [African Genesis is the first of the four] Ardrey shows how mankind is less of a fallen angel and more of a risen ape; and that man truly is still only a halfway house between the ape and the human being.After a Broadway flop American playwright Robert Ardrey [author of the play Thunder Bay and the script for the film Khartoum among others] toured East and Southern Africa in the early 1960s. This was a time when astonishing fossil discoveries were being made in the Olduvai Gorge by the Leakey family and by others showing that man had originated in Africa some 2 million years ago. Ardrey talked to the fossil-hunters, the palaeontologists and the anthropologists and learned all he could of the new discoveries and their implications for human origins and behaviour.Ardrey's main thesis is that mankind was born in Africa over 2 million years ago, and for most of that two million years the species' success has been largely dependant on its ability to kill. Without that underlying hard edge the species would have vanished aeons ago along with all the others that failed to survive. And only if we take that unpalatable truth about ourselves into account can modern mankind be truly understood.The book is moving and beautifully written. If you want to understand human nature, and the possibilities for the future of the species, there is no better place to start than African Genesis."},{"Title":"African genesis;: A personal investigation into the animal origins and nature of man (A Laurel edition)","review":"I feel like I'm being a little generous giving this one four stars for two reason: (1) It's quite dated - So much has been learned and written, both in formal and popular science circles, since this book was first published in 1961, the arguments Ardrey puts forth are not quite as true to the mark as they once appeared to be, but more importantly (2) Ardrey's style of writing is much less suited to today's readership than it must have been 40 years ago. He ceaselessly anthropomorphosizes his animal characters far past where it's proper. This tends to detract from his overall arguments in today's more savvy readership.Still, Ardrey had a point to make. And it's a good one. The struggle for survival in the natural world is the game our ancestors played as well, and we're here because we were good at it - better than our ancestors competing for the same niche. That's why we're here and they're not.This book is also a starting point from which popular anthropology has its base. It was very shortly after this point in time that the Leakeys came into the public arena in a big way. So it's interesting to see where the forefront of the public view was at this point in time. There's a fairly decent summary of the work done up to that point as well. Fellows like Dart, who pioneered the field of modern physical anthropology, tend to get forgotten in the frenzy of activity that followed in the 60's and beyond. For these reasons, the book is worth getting.Finding Ardrey's &quot;African Genesis&quot; may be a chore. But the Amazon book search worked for me, ..."},{"Title":"African genesis;: A personal investigation into the animal origins and nature of man (A Laurel edition)","review":"Robert Ardrey's book on human origins is remarkably well-written. That is both a feature and a possible disadvantage. He writes so well that error--if such there be--might be invisible. It is a fascinating book to read, if only for the writing.His thesis, that man was born to kill, and to kill with weapons made by his own hand--more or less--is hard to dispute, given history.The book came out during a time when the prevailing ethos required, and delivered, the peaceful, noble savage.Jane Goodall, among others, helped the ethos mightily with her first book about the Gombe chimps.Ashley Montague wrote a book implicitly challenging Ardrey's point.The ethos needed the peaceful, noble savage in order to have him, or his descendants, which is to say, us, corrupted by capitalism, male-oriented religions instead of the Goddess, republicans, Americans, or some other evil-of-the-day, without which everything would be so much better. If we had been then as we are now, who would we blame, and for what?I can recall one, if not more, novels about prehistoric man in which the Neanderthals stood in for the flower children while the oncoming Cro Magnons for the Marines and paratroopers fighting in Viet Nam. Not explicitly, of course, but the point was clear. We, Homo Sap, Cro Magnon, white, were evil.I was on campus at the time and got more than a couple of ears full of this.Ardrey is refreshing. He deals in facts. Some of them are no longer quite as certain as he thought. The sequence of pre-human ancestors and the association of tools, or not, upon which he depended for his thesis, have been changed. Whether that makes much difference to his point or not is hard to say, since we don't know much about the newcomers, including how they related to the pre-humans Ardrey used. And, in fact, we don't know that the currently-accepted view of the sequence is correct. And it is further possible that somebody other than, say, australopithecus, both used weapons and fathered the human race. In which case, Ardrey would be correct.He is fascinating in a number of ways, but some of the facts he presents are astonishing. For example, the types of bones of various prey found in a South African cave are grossly disproportionate to their presence in the prey themselves. Why lower jaws of small antelopes, and not the rest of the head? Why straight horns and not curved horns? The matched double dents in the heads of baboons, whose wounds fit the distal end of a medium antelope foreleg--grossly overrepresented in the bone pile--seem quite positive. The hyena skull choking on one of the bones shoved down its throat exhausts all possibilities other than that an angry australopithecus killed it.This idea attracts opposition still.Various television documentaries of our ancestors, either actors with terrific makeup, or superb animation, show the kind of pre-humans Ardrey discusses as unarmed victims of practically any other animal.Ardrey refers to a paleontologist calling fangs in a hominid skull, \\"tools for intra-specific aggression\\" instead of the dread \\"w\\" word, \\"weapon\\".Keeley and others are discussing war before history, or prehistoric violence, but considering only Homo Sap and only the last several tens of thousands of years. Even they are finding resistance, some transparently faulty reasoning.In some cases, the violence in primitive societies is laid at the feet of white interlopers, without whose baleful presence, all was peaceful and orderly.All in all, Ardrey makes a solid case that man is born to make, hold, and wield weapons. Whether subsequent research discredits his sequences or not, the case is well made and definitely worth reading carefully.This book is quite old. I'd be interested in a comment about why you were looking at a review of it.

From its origins in Enlightenment thinking, it has challenged longstanding beliefs about women and male-female relationships. Matthews' book offers a study of the emergence of the women's movement in mid-nineteenth century America, charting both its broader intellectual origins and the context of contemporary reform movements.Both strands are integral to understanding how feminism developed as it did. Matthews starts by describing traditional views of women, views that were under assault by Enlightenment ideas about equality and natural rights. The first gains were made in education, where the assumptions of women's mental inferiority to men came under increasing assault. Yet from the first there were disagreements within the incipient movement, as education advocates such as Catherine Beecher balked at the more radical ideas of Frances Wright and others.One of the great strengths of the book is in Matthews's explanation of the ties between the women's movement and the swelling reform movements of the 1830s and 1840s. Many women joined the crusade for moral reform, gaining experience that would later be applied to campaigns for women's rights. No effort proved to be more important, though, than the campaign against slavery. Here women joined a campaign demanding liberty for a population legally defined as second-class people, just as women were at that time. Though Matthews eschews the idea of a direct evolution, she does acknowledge the influence, as well as the fact that many of the early male supporters cam from the ranks of the abolitionists.Yet the Civil War represented a turning point for the movement. Many feminists felt it necessary to subordinate their activities to the cause of abolition, while others (such as Susan B. Anthony) were determined to press ahead. But the greater division came with the end of the war. Many feminists saw the postwar measures to grant African Americans the right to vote as the perfect opportunity to extend the franchise to women as well. Yet many abolitionists preferred the viable goal of enfranchising African American men to the more radical one of universal suffrage, which threatened to complicate the issue. In response, leaders such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton increasingly adopted elitist language that alienated many within the abolitionist movement, ending their support for women's suffrage.This elitist tone foreshadowed the changing social complexion of the women's movement during the 1870s. Increasingly, upper-middle-class women were joining the ranks of feminists, at the same time that many in the movement began to argue for the moral superiority of women to men. Yet sexuality threatened to shatter the feminist movement in the 1870s, as debates shifted to questions of \\"free love\\" and controlling childbearing. Matthews concludes with the presentation of the Declaration of Rights for Woman at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, a \\"fitting closure\\" in the reaffirmation of the natural and equal rights of women.Matthews' book is a great starting point for understanding the early years of American feminist movement. More than just an introductory survey, it contains valuable insights into the broader philosophy behind the movement's goals. She is especially good at analyzing the motivations of its participants on issues ranging from restructuring laws governing property ownership within marriage to broader redefinitions of love and the role of women in society. The result is a work that demonstrates the broad strides that feminism made in the first half-century of the women's rights movement - as well as how far they had yet to go."},{"Title":"Peace and War","review":"Robert Serber's definitive quality is understatement. Even the opening line of his book starts with the mundane \\"I was born on...\\" His style may seem to point to a manifestly boring book. It is only when one knows the importance of the ages which he lived through, that one realizes that Serber does not need to exaggerate or dramatize anything he says. The most noteworthy achievements are those which simply need to be stated, never eloquently dramatized. And Serber's life, his times, and his achievements are all more than noteworthy.Robert Serber is not a name known to even most enthusiasts of science and history. But consider the major events of his life; childhood spent in Philadelphia, PhD. with Nobel Laureate John Van Vleck, post doctoral studies and a lifelong friendship with J. Robert Oppenheimer, time spent at Los Alamos as one of the primary participants in the Manhattan project, work on the hydrogen bomb, teaching and research at Berkeley, Illinois, and Columbia, and a life devoted to science, teaching, and scholarship. No wonder Serber does not need to overstate things. His words and observations do the talking and dramatization. And yet there is warmth, compassion and appreciation in his words, which may be subtle, but which are nonetheless an important ingredient of his writing.This downplaying of major events and times is a characteristic that is not just a style of writing, but an inherent part of Serber's personality. The austere physicist from Philadelphia with a steel-trap mind liked to be a detached observer. He preferred to be a scribe who would record events for posterity. He describes some of the most important and personal events in his life, including tragic ones, with unblinking objectivity. Even though he participated in some of the earth shattering (pun intended) events in twentieth century history, his narration of those times reads like a journalistic account, with scant editorial comment. But this does not make the matter any less interesting, as his detached position gave Serber a clear mind and an attention to detail, that others would lack because of their impassioned involvement. Flowing smoothly with the narration is a dry and understated sense of humor, and unconventional observations on politics, scientists, and society.Serber's main achievements were building the atomic bomb, and more importantly, being part of a unique mission to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a few months after the bombs were dropped. His job was to take readings, make measurements, and in general document the general destruction the bombs had wrought.Serber lived in a unique age and time, possibly the most important period in the history of American physics, when the American scientific establishment was burgeoning and assimilating resources that would launch it into the front rank of world science and technology. He was also lucky to be at the right place at the right time, and brilliant enough to be sought by the leading theorists of the century, many of who were Nobel laureates. After growing up in Philadelphia, he obtained his PhD. at the University of Wisconsin with John Van Vleck, a future Nobel laureate known for his pioneering studies of magnetism. After Wisconsin, Serber received a National Research Council fellowship, one among only five awarded every year during Depression times, to study physics at the institution of his choice. He planned to work with Eugene Wigner at Princeton, another future Nobel laureate. But fate intervened when Serber attended the then famous summer physics school at the University of Michigan. At Ann Arbor, Serber heard J. Robert Oppenheimer lecture; \\"His mind was so quick and his speech was so fluent, that he dominated almost every gathering\\". Serber was so taken with \`Oppie', that he decided to change plans and drive west to Berkeley instead, where Oppenheimer had created the greatest school of theoretical physics in the United States. A measure of Oppenheimer's influence can be gleaned from the fact that, among the five NRC fellows throughout the country that year, three chose to work with him.At Berkeley, Serber quickly became Oppie's closest associate and worked with a dozen of his students, who would go on to become important scientists themselves. Those were Depression times, and Serber describes how he and Oppie's students were introduced to an unfamiliar way of life, wining and dining with the theorist, and acquiring his erudite tastes in literature, poetry, and art. Some of Serber's most important papers were coauthored with Oppenheimer, and he became Oppie's close friend and research associate. He says that his role was to act as translator for Oppie, and explain to students what the master really meant. Once in a while, Serber and his wife and Oppie the bachelor would catch a movie or dinner across the San Francisco bay, and then work late into the night with Beethoven's string quartets playing in the background. The lover of metaphysical poetry, and the quiet, unassuming student, made a fine pair. In summers, Serber and his wife Charlotte would drive to Oppie's ranch in the New Mexico mountains and mesas, where horse back riding was the norm for traveling. Late in the 1930s, Serber moved to the University of Illinois, where he taught for three years. Then of course, war broke out.Oppenheimer invited Serber to join the atomic bomb project, and Serber was part of the elite group of theoreticians who Oppenheimer assembled in the summer of 1942, to work out basic bomb theory. These luminaries included Hans Bethe and Edward Teller. Serber recalls the stimulating discussions in the summer heat, involving calculations on whether the bomb would set the earth's atmosphere on fire.At Los Alamos, Serber's most important initial job was to give a set of lectures that would indoctrinate the new, brilliant recruits with the basics of nuclear fission and bomb physics. Despite the impediment of a slight, lifelong lisp, the young theoretician lectured with authority to people like Enrico Fermi, irreverent Richard Feynman, and a dozen other Nobel laureates. These lectures were written up and declassified after the war, and in 1992, were published with Richard Rhodes as a co-author, as the Los Alamos primer. A PDF version is available here.Serber's group did important work on the implosion method for the plutonium bomb. Unlike some other participants, Serber does not leave a record of having participated in discussions about the moral implications of the bomb. He was the scribe, and he let the leaders do the talking and equivocation.Probably the most important part of the book concerns Serber's trip to Japan right after the bombs were dropped. His job was to go to Hiroshima and Nagasaki and document the damage done by this new force of nature, as well as collect samples. During that period, he wrote dozens of letters to his wife, and these letters paint an evocative picture of the period, his thoughts, and his observations. It is possibly the only time in the book, when he lets himself indulge in some emotion and awe; both of a nation almost completely destroyed by war, and of the incredible power of the new weapon which he had helped to create. He documents little amusing incidents of island life, and his descriptions give us a flavour of the life of American soldiers and civilians scattered on those little islands in the Pacific, who had been fighting for their life against a desperate and almost fanatical enemy. He also narrates the brutal destruction that had been inflicted in turn by Curtis LeMay's incessant strategic bombing, which killed many more civilians than the atomic bombs (about 2.5 million)After the war, Serber lived a relatively quiet life, first teaching at Berkeley, then finally moving to New York to teach at Columbia. About ten percent of his book is devoted to non-mathematical, but technical descriptions of his work in nuclear physics with Oppenheimer, and at Berkeley and Columbia. These accounts can easily be skipped by uninterested readers.Serber's characteristic understatement sometimes hides emotion and sentiments. It's a little amusing, when he recounts incidents like a colleague propositioning his wife, with nothing more than a one line objective description. Apparently, after a party, the colleague led Charlotte into the nearby woods, and made a pass at her. When she refused, he asked her why (!) Charlotte, as austere as her husband, quietly pointed to the ground and replied, \\"Poison oak\\"There is one time when you cannot help but feel that this man is trying to hide his pain and sadness under the guise of journalistic reporting. In 1967, the man who had brought Serber into the mainstream of American physics, and who had been a guiding light for physics and conscience in America, died. Serber planned to deliver a eulogy for Robert Oppenheimer's memorial service, but characteristically, he refrained after his wife told him that he was not good at doing these things. Later in the same year, Serber's wife committed suicide from depression. If there is one person whose name appears in Serber's account even more than his own, it is his wife Charlotte's. Serber does not need to say that his wife was a very important and constant presence in his life. It is quite obvious; the two had been together through every phase of his life since graduate school, and she had been a lifelong companion in every sense of the term, participating in his adventures, and having an important say in his life. Even though Serber does not devote a single sentence to describing how he felt after the incident, again, he does not need to. His wife's unflinching support of him is evident throughout the book, and one cannot help feel somber and sad, even while reading this apparently most detached of accounts.Later, Serber struck up a close relationship with Kitty, Oppenheimer's widow. Tragically, she too died a few years later, while on trip to Panama. As if this were not enough, Oppenheimer's daughter Toni also committed suicide. In a span of a few years, Serber lost people who were closest to him, who were an integral part of his life during the most important of times. He does not need to express his feelings for us to know how he must have felt.Serber retired from the Columbia physics department, and spent the rest of his years with a woman he met on St. John's Island, where he often vacationed. He must have found solace and pleasure in spending time with his two sons. The island had been a favourite vacation spot and sailing bay for the Oppenheimer family.The Amazon book review for Serber's book says that \\"Nonphysicists will find parts of this fascinating memoir unintelligible, but that should not be a deterrent\\". I wholly agree. But I would also object to calling it \`unintelligible', and I hope that opinion refers only to portions describing Serber's research.As someone interested in the history of American science, I found Serber's book illuminating for its accounts of American physics in its heyday, and in general remarkable for its understated style and dry humour, consistently demonstrated. But it is also an important memoir documenting a remarkable time with remarkable people in it. Serber was an important physicist in a tumultuous time, both for science and society, and for war and peace. He never says much. And he never needs to do."},{"Title":"Peace and War","review":"Robert Serber was J. Robert Oppenheimer's student, friend, and first recruit for the atomic bomb laboratory at Los Alamos. Serber recounts this, as well as the most of the rest of his life, in an engaging informal style. I wish he'd been a little more forthcoming about his and Oppenheimer's politics, but even the little bit he tells adds vital new information to these subjects. He also recaptures how the A-bomb project looked to people who were AT WAR, who actually had to choose between killing the enemy and letting their countrymen be killed. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Peace and War","review":"Serber, one of the most important and influential physicists of this century, tells it all.

It was even better the second time around! :)"},{"Title":"To Have or to Hold","review":"This is the first Kilpack novel I have ever delved into and if it's a hint of her story telling ability, I can honestly say I will go back for more. The story follows Emma and Andrew through an unconventional relationship of convenience that takes a rocky but riveting path to sincere love. The storyline, while different, is still one that only a romance novel can pull off, which Kilpack cleverly cops to herself in the prose. Kilpack brilliantly crafted her characters with dimension and depth, something hard to come by in most LDS romances. Her main characters are far from perfect and that makes them all the more relatable. The book is engrossing yet fast and intuitive in its reading. Kilpack walks the fine line between sweet love story and innocent romance beautifully, with no awkwardness or overtly unnecessary situations. There is more than one source of conflict and the problems delivered take actual work for her characters to sort through and solve. Her fringe characters could have used a little more work because at times they felt more like placeholders than actual influences in the story. However the work Kilpack put into Andrew and Emma more than makes up for the placard qualities of some of the supporting cast. This book is a fantastic novel to lose yourself in for a day and will leave you with just the right satisfaction in the end."},{"Title":"To Have or to Hold","review":"This was one of my favorite books EVER!!!

From the first page of this book, Nalo captures me. I am entagled in a story about Ezili, the African goddess of love. She emerges in the lives of three women: Mer, a slave healer who was also a lesbian, Jeanne, a mulatto woman who was the mistress of poet Charles Bedulaire, and Meritet, a Greek slave/prositute. Each of these women had their own battles to fight. Mer, was sent on a mission to see why the salt roads were blocked from the African Gods. Jeanne was given a disease by her lover than untimately diabled her, and Meritet was given self-awareness and the sense to hear people's thoughts. Nalo's poetic prose was what made the book SO good........I couldn't stop reading it. I can't wait until her new book comes out and I'm going to purchase all of her other novels. READ IT!! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Salt Roads","review":"Stemming from the Latin crudos, meaning \\"raw, uncooked, bleeding,\\" and related to cruor \\"blood from a wound\\" The Salt Roads is indeed crude. Carved from human flesh, with all it's bone, meat, sweat, blood and juice, Hopkinson spares no pain. Her novel is raw work sliced from the skin of three women and a new-born god.Mer is a slave in Haiti who's only hope lies in brief liaisons with her woman lover, and her faith in La Sirene, one of the gods from the old country. Jeanne, in another time and land, is Baudelaire's scheming dark mistress, desperate to grasp at security in a century and land where there is no security for women, of any color. Thais, an Alexandrian prostitute, runs away from her master to see the great Roman cathedral at Capitoline. At the hands of their masters, each woman suffers the hardships of their time, and then more.Within each, Hopkinson deftly interweaves the triple aspects of Erzulie, the Vodun goddess of love. Riding, or possessing, Mer, she is La Sirene, ruler of the ocean and motherhood. Like La Sirene, Mer steadfastly mothers and bathes the ill, oppressed, and wounded slaves of her new land. As Erzulie Danthor, Jeanne is consumed with jealousy and passion, unable and unwilling to keep herself from affairs with either man or woman. Through Thais and her ordeals in the desert, comes the aspect of Erzulie Freda, the virgin goddess of love.Fortunately from all my research for Cry Havoc it was easy to see the various manifestations of Erzulie in each of the women, but I'm afraid that is a subtlety lost on the more casual reader. Having said that, I have to admit the borning of Erzulie throughout the story confused me. It seems that, like the women, the goddess wasn't able to fully manifest until suffering through an almost near-death wounding, a sacrifice if you will from the hand of her oppressor. As with the women, once the wound was overcome, she was reborn into her authentic destiny.Hopkinson's novel is earthy, mystical fare, heavily seasoned with the vital salts of blood, sweat, and juice. It's a compelling read of women and gods, displaced and found. While compelling, be warned that The Salt Roads is often disjointed - Hopkinson juggles the four lives unevenly, with Thais appearing late in the story, as if in afterthought."},{"Title":"The Salt Roads","review":"I love this author! If you want to read something fresh and new, you must read her. Also, try her first two books: &quot;Brown Girl in the Ring&quot; and &quot;Midnight Robber&quot;. Both are examples of speculative fiction at its very best!"},{"Title":"The Salt Roads","review":"No one writes like Nalo Hopkinson and she does not write to the market. She writes what she writes and I'm glad she wrote The Salt Roads. It is extraordinary. It isn't always an easy book to read because life was not always easy for these women."},{"Title":"The Salt Roads","review":"This lyrical, yet sexy novel might well be the breakout book for Nalo Hopkinson. Published almost at the same time as the highly anticipated new novel by Toni Morrison, Hopkinson has no need to be afraid of comparisons with the Nobelprize-winning writer. With her third novel, Hopkinson has left the rank of journeywoman behind and has joined the ranks of such masters as Octavia Butler, Alice Walker, Gloria Naylor and, of course, Toni Morrison. This is an essential read and to put it simply - a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Salt Roads","review":"This is my first reading of Nalo Hopkinson's writing. Although, I find the book engaging to some degree, I get really turned off by the misrepresentation of the Goddesses Ezili and Het-Hru (mistakenly called Hathor--the wellknown Greek name for the Goddess). If you're writing from the perspective of the people who originally worshipped the goddess, at least get her name culturally correct. It would lend more authenticity to the storytelling. The limitations given to Ezili in the story are painful to read (a goddess trapped inside a human?? A goddess being birthed in the 1800s??). Sorry doesn't sit right or fly right with me. The modern vulgar language used by the goddesses are insulting and disturbing. I was excited to read this book. I was dissappointed. Nalo is a talented writer. I give the writing 4 stars, however, because of the way the goddesses and African descended women are presented in the story, 2 star rating overall."},{"Title":"The Salt Roads","review":"Nalo Hopkinson's The Salt Roads centers on the spirit, Ezili's (a goddess of love and seduction) emergence in three women throughout time. The reader gets a glimpse of her in Mer, a lesbian slave woman healer, in the early 1800's on the Caribbean island of St. Domingue (Haiti) during a burial of a stillborn child. The second appearance is in the 1880's within Jeanne, a mulatto Parisian dancer and mistress to a white poet whose purse strings are controlled by his domineering mother. The third woman, Meritet, is a prostitute in an ancient (340's A.D.) Egyptian brothel.Although these women exist during different time periods, Ezili seems to emerge, exist, and influence each woman simultaneously. With Jeanne, she appears in dreams, and wants to live, act, and breathe through her until Jeanne is physically scarred and disabled from the ravages of a sexually transmitted disease. Mer receives her awakening during a riverside burial ceremony of a stillborn child and Meritet has an instance of self-awareness that allows her to experience the independence of Ezili.Aside from the Ezili storyline, each main character has her fair share of drama, heartbreak, and intrigue. Each are a victim of circumstance; in worlds that were cruel to the black woman. Mer deals with the harsh reality of plantation life and the impending slave revolt that secured Haiti its freedom from colonial rule. The author expertly embeds regional history and folklore into Mer's story. An aging Jeanne struggles with securing her future as a courtesan in a world in which her skin color places her at a disadvantage and Meritet journeys from whoredom to sainthood.This book is full of symbolism (the incorporation of the value, taste, and healing power of salt, etc. throughout the novel is superb). It also has a mystical and esoteric feel to it; the stories are heart wrenching and the characters are memorable. The author embellished a bit at times with the transcendental themes causing lapses that were very vague and abstract; however for those who enjoy heavy, lyrical prose and surreal themes, it is worth picking up. Overall, it is a wonderfully imagined story that dabbles with the supernatural and issues of self-worth, survival, and redemption.Reviewed by PhyllisAPOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Club"},{"Title":"The Salt Roads","review":"This \\"Salt Roads\\" of this historical/magical realist novel are the trails of sweat, tears, and blood that course through women's lives. Separate narratives intertwine here, each wrought with the precision and lyricism of a short story, but together they produce a true novel of compelling scope. The settings range from Baudelaire's Paris to the cane fields of French-ruled Haiti, from early Christian Alexandria to the present day. The threads of slavery, childbirth, love affairs, and accidental sainthood are by turns comic, angry, and earthily sensual.Rich with historical detail and human intimacies, the book sometimes pulls back to a goddess-like view, contemplating the slow changes that have transformed women's lives over the centuries--but never losing its light, witty touch. In short, a very big novel with many finely crafted and exquisite parts."},{"Title":"The Salt Roads","review":"Early in the nineteenth century, on the French colonial Caribbean Island of Saint Domingue, three female slave women, led by Doctress Mer, inter a stillborn baby. During the burial ceremony, they pray to Ezili, the Afro-Caribbean Goddess of love and sex, to \\"use\\" the infant's &quot;unused vitality&quot;. Mer knows first hand how Ezili resides inside them as the goddess lives within her to use her when needed for that is how she has the healing hands.Ezili employs other female African or Afro descendents as her channel. In the nineteenth century in Paris, Ezili lives inside mixed blooded Jeanne Duval, lover of poet Charles Baudelaire. In the fourth-century Nubian Meritet, changes from a prostitute to the founder of a religion when Ezili enters her. However, even Goddess' have fears that they will expire as Ezili worries will happen to her now that Jeanne' is dying from syphilis. Escape may be through Mer's prays, but at a moment when the Saint Domingue slaves seek freedom at any cost could still endanger the Goddess.Extremely complex in terms of the time paradox, Nalo Hopkinson shows why she is the leading fabulist of Afro-Caribbean mythology, religion, and folk tales filled with Mojo today. The plot spans time and place yet seems so right though readers will struggle with non-linear events (string theory anyone) connected via salt and the Goddess. The three women are fully developed, but surprisingly in a mystical sense so is Ezili. Nalo Hopkinson provides another winner with her insightful look at Afro-Caribbean mythos.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Salt Roads","review":"This fabulist tale begins on the island of Saint Domingue, eventually known as Haiti, the scene of slave revolutions and oppressive masters. On one dark night, three slave women bury the tiny body of a stillborn, returning him to the earth. Each of the women experiences an unsettling sensation, in fact, the birth of a goddess, Elizi, brought forth from the depths of their grief. The afro-Caribbean goddess exemplifies the enduring strengths, eternal beauty and fertility of womanhood in all its permutations, evolving over time, as she inhabits the world through three specific women.The first woman who hosts Ezili is Jeanne Duval, a half-black, half-white dancer, who has captured the heart of poet Charles Baudelaire in 1842 Paris. Baudelaire is Jeanne's only hope for the future, as her present is riddled by poverty and it's inherent pitfalls. The poet comes from a wealthy family, although his mother eventually disowns him after his many years of cohabitation with his sultry and sensual mistress. The reader sees Paris through the eyes of this woman, who pleasures a wealthy man to maintain her place in society.Changing time and place, in 1792 the island of Saint Dominigue's economy is driven by sugar cane, the slaves endlessly toiling in the fields, harvesting the lucrative cane crop. Most of these slaves have come on slave ships from Africa, their life spans shortened by perpetual hunger and exotic diseases indigenous to the island. The second visitation of the goddess is through Mer, an older slave. Gifted in the healing arts, Mer attends the slaves on the plantation, burdened by her intimate awareness of their shameful existence. Mer communicates directly with the ocean goddess, who speaks to her of salt: the salt of tears, of the ocean and the womanly rites of passage.Finally, Meritet, a young Alexandrian woman of pleasure, is the third vessel of the emerging Elizi. Traveling with a young male prostitute to the former Jerusalem, Meritet is beset with an unexpected loss, followed by a spiritual transformation, one that changes her from prostitute to legend.Moving gracefully through time, each woman acts as a vehicle in the evolution of Hopkinson's goddess. Rich, earthy and sensual, the powerful prose describes a passionate people. Striding through history, ribald and uninhibited, the author speaks for those without voices, enchanting, seducing and raging at the weight of injustice.Hopkinson has penned a fantastical tale of empowerment and joyful sexuality, but accomplishes much more: the intoxicating prose entertains and informs, indicting the brutal institution of slavery. Guided by the author's powerful intuition, take this exceptional journey, as mysterious as the world of the spirit and as real as the steel chains that bind the limbs of those bought and sold. Luan Gaines/2003."},{"Title":"The Salt Roads","review":"The Salt Roads is the third novel by science fiction writer, Nalo Hopkinson; however, this novel is really more of a historical fantasy. Hopkinson combines elements of voodoo, mythology and Christianity to weave a very interesting story that shares a common symbolic thread -- salt -- the salt in tears, in sweat, in blood and even in the sea.With the unfortunate burial of a stillborn infant, the goddess Ezili is evoked from the prayers of three Caribbean slave women to their individual gods. Ezili is the goddess of sex and love. She possesses the ability to occupy the minds and bodies of three different women during various periods of time. With her birth and inhabitation of these women, Ezili offers the strength to love and hope for a better life.In eighteenth century Saint Dominique, Mer, a Caribbean slave women, has the gift of healing. She is content with her life as a slave and spending time with her female lover until she receives a visit from the spirit Lasiren, who gives her a message to save the slaves on the plantation. Ezili gives her the strength she needs to take on the responsibility. She faces several challenges with a sorceror named Makandal who is starting a slave revolt on the plantation. Her relationship with her lover is threatened when her lover's husband returns to the plantation with an invitation for Tipingee to leave with him.In nineteenth century Paris, Jeanne Duval, a dancer and the lover of poet Charles Baudelaire, is seeking true love and security. Because she is of African descent, she can never be more than Charles' mistress because he is too cowardly to stand up to his overbearing mother who controls all of his money. Theirs is a twisted love affair that leaves Jeanne unsatisfied. Jeanne is the first body that the spirit Ezili possesses. In Jeanne, Ezili learns and grows. When Jeanne is inattentive or asleep that Ezili is free to travel through space and time. The spirit of Ezili gives Jeanne the strength to find true love even after falling victim to a devastating illness.In fourth century Alexandria, Meritet is a nubian prostitute. Meritet is inspired by the tales of Jerusalem and decides to travel there. She takes along her friend Judah, a male prostitute, and they use their bodies as payment for their fare to Jerusalem. Once they arrive in Jerusalem, Judah seems to prosper while Meritet is faced with misfortune. After the spirit of Ezili possess her, Meritet is changed from a prostitute to a saint, a founder of a religion.The Salt Roads is a very good book. It is not a quick read and does not follow a logical storyline; it's fantasy, so the elements would not make sense to a logical thinker. The book can also be pretty graphic and extremely gross at some points. Overall, it was an excellent read. I applaud Nalo Hopkinson on this effort.Reviewed by Paula Henderson of Loose Leaves Book Review"},{"Title":"The Salt Roads","review":"Mer, a healer and midwife, is an African slave on a sugar plantation on Saint Domingue (renamed Haiti in 1804). Jeanne Duval is an Afro-French dancer and courtesan living in Paris, and the mistress of 19th-century poet Charles Baudelaire. Meritet is a Greek-Nubian prostitute in fourth-century Egypt, better known to the world as Saint Mary. Something connects these three women across the span of time--something larger than any of these women could ever suspect.When three Caribbean slave women, led by Mer, come together to bury one of the women's stillborn son, their powerful grief and prayers call the attention of Ezili, an African-Caribbean goddess. Using the unused life force of the dead child, Ezili moves back and forth across time, possessing and working her will through various bodies.Jeanne is one of the goddess' most frequent vehicles--mainly because Ezili finds herself inexplicably tethered to the beautiful French dancer. She is free to inhabit other bodies only when Jeanne, slowly dying of syphilis, is in a deep dream state. Ezili plants the seeds of revolution in Saint Domingue through Mer, and sends Meritet on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.What all these women have in common is salt--in all its various forms. Whether the salt of tears, the salt of the ocean, or the salt of sweat, the goddess travels the Salt Roads to accomplish her goal. The question is \\"What is her goal?\\" Not even Ezili fully understands at first, but as she grows more powerful, and comes to know the many aspects of herself, all is revealed--both to her and the reader.Author Nalo Hopkinson beautifully weaves her stories together in a broken narrative, jumping back and forth through time and between characters. Some readers may have a little difficulty finding the rhythm of her storytelling, but the reward for their perseverance is great. Hopkinson writes in a flowing, sensual, sometimes poetic, style, but her rich use of history keeps the book grounded in realism. While the stories of the three women are often heartbreaking, Hopkinson skillfully breaks up the sometimes heavy narrative with light touches of humor sprinkled throughout--the way a good chef uses salt.Ultimately uplifting and filled with hope, The Salt Roads is a beautiful book-one that stays with you long after you close the cover. The Salt Roads is the winner of the 2004 Gaylactic Spectrum Award for Best Novel."},{"Title":"The Salt Roads","review":"Complicated, sexy, rewarding.

In reading this novel, I found that Hopkinson is a writer that uses stiff doses of human emotion and reality to balance out her themes of mythology, fantasy, and religion. THE SALT ROADS is an eccentric read; I truly can say I have never read anything like it. Strongly recommended to those readers who desire a taste of the unknown or an edifying and enlightening experience, THE SALT ROADS is one of the new classics of our generation.Reviewed by CandaceKof The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersComplete review can be found on our website..."},{"Title":"The Salt Roads","review":"In this mythic fantasy, Nalo Hopkinson braids together the lives of three distinct African women into a potent and sensual feminist vision. Mer is a plantation slave and a healer in what is now modern-day Haiti. She is the lover of Tipingee, but shares this love with Tipingee's husband. Jeanne Duval is a former dancer who is now the lover of struggling Parisian poet Charles Baudelaire. In ancient Alexandria, Thais is a prostitute, and her journey will take her to the outskirts of Jerusalem. Through their lovemaking and daily lives, these women host the spirit sometimes called Ezili, who echoes other names. Ezili can influence their actions, although she often is simply witness through their corporeality, even as she flails against her own bonds. Weaving these seemingly disparate threads together, Hopkinson illumines the lives of women as she explores sexuality, transcendence, spirituality, and personal freedom. Much like \\"Godmother Night\\" by Rachel Pollack and \\"The Female Man\\" by Joanna Russ, this novel reaches beyond the confines of genre to sing passionately with new rhythms."},{"Title":"The Salt Roads","review":"I absolutely loved Ms. Hopkinson's debut novel, BROWN GIRL IN THE RING, so I was really hopeful about this ambitious novel.THE SALT ROADS is a non-linear story in four parts. The narrative switches back and forth between women of color from all over the world. The characters are Mer, a Haitian healer on a plantation; Jeanne, a mixed race woman in Baudelaire's France; Thais, an Egyptian hooker in Greece; and Ezili, the goddess figure that loosely ties the narratives together.SALT ROADS tells their tales of love and lost. While the premise is engaging, I was never really aborbed with it and didn't find any of the characters (except for Mer) engaging. Self-absorbed Jeanne, for example, is particularly unsympathetic and distant.Hopkinson's strength is in her poetic use of language. Her scenes and dialog are lush and sensual but the story itself left me hanging. Most of the characters are so isolated that it's difficult to see how they truly interact with their surroundings.In the end, I think I might have enjoyed the novel more hadEzili been a more dominant character."},{"Title":"From Bondage to Contract: Wage Labor, Marriage, and the Market in the Age of Slave Emancipation","review":"This excellent study of nineteenth-century American households brings Hannah Arendt's assessment of the home as a place of labor and violence clearly into view. Amy Dru Stanley looks at the spread of contractarianism into household relations and finds not improvement but rather a different basis for wringing effort from subordinates to enrich and comfort their masters. Defenders of the south's peculiar institution used similar arguments with regard to labor, comparing the &quot;wage slaves&quot; in the north to the real slaves of the south, always in favor of the latter. Stanley's assessment is more nuanced, valuing individual freedom while remaining sensitive to the grinding hardships this freedom brought with it. The heart of her argument is her close analysis of the relations of dependency between slaves and masters and husbands and their wives and children. While the movement to free slaves had widespread support among many social groups, the movement to free wives, like today's movement to free children, was seen very differently. Indeed, slave emancipators held out the prospect to freedmen of being kings in their own castles, of holding their wives and children in bondage to themselves just as their white masters held their slaves and the members of their own families, to encourage them to leave their masters following emancipation. Yet for the freedmen, the money to be kings in their castles was lacking, and freedwomen had to labor as long and hard in freedom as they had in bondage to keep their poor households going. As a result, many resisted playing their assigned parts in the freedmen's family romance. Meanwhile, their poor white sisters faced similar economic constraints. Free labor during the era governed by the &quot;iron law of wages&quot; condemned workers' families to penury and, in extreme cases, pushed wives and daughters into prostitution as their only alternative to destitution. Stanley's informative discussion of the personal cost of commodification of labor to individuals and their families provides many opportunities to consider other results of this process on human existence."},{"Title":"Pigs at Christmas","review":"Indeed, this book has something for everyone.

It's a gripping tale about a group of Americans in the near future who recognize that their country has been taken from them. But the means of restoration are at hand, made possible by a convergence of the best in the human spirit and the pace of techological innovation.Jeremiah Jackson is a sympathetic protagonist, an aging intelligence officer fighting the triple demons of terrorism, his failing marriage, and his failing country. But his deductive skills are as sharp as ever. He weaves his way through a maze of suspicious characters who are planning a cataclysm, and he finds redemption in the end for the good guys, himself, and his own relationship.The novel presumes to reach wide, and it succeeds. It is action, mystery, history, social commentary, and love rolled into one. It is hope grown from hopelessness. The reader readily identifies with the reasons for Jackson's emotional downcasts, and then accompnaies him on his struggles to solve an intricate intelligence puzzle. Along the way the reader gasps at revelations of the inhumane audacity of the bad guys, marvels at the clever application of new technology, and wonders all the while at how and why this country has abandoned so much good in the span of mere generations. And finally, the reader nods with approval at the courage and selfless commitment of the individual.The astute reader quickly picks up references to Ayn Rand, Alexis deToqueville, Cato the Elder, and others, but the truly discerning reader enjoys discovering subtler allusions to Allan Bloom and certain contemporary celebrities.Destiny Restored's timeliness is also remarkable, projecting global terrorism and the worsening culture wars as the chief threats to America's survival as we know it. But the epic backdrop doesn't smother the personal interactions. Particularly moving scenes include the good-bye from a loving daughter to her parents, the display of humanity exhibited by the diverse group of adventurers at the point of their embarkation, and the pouring out of two good people's individual feelings as they struggle to survive, and revive, a failed marriage. To say nothing of a surprising, redemptive reconciliation at book's end.Completing the emotional spectrum is good old-fashioned excitement. Here are saboteurs caught and uniquely punished, a chase, a dogfight, and even an out-of-body experience.It's a great read."},{"Title":"Destiny Restored","review":"My wife reads a lot of romance and mystery books. She thoroughly enjoyed this book and is looking forward to Arthur Becker's next book, which she hopes will be a sequel to \\"Destiny Restored\\". The plot kept her quessing right up to the end."},{"Title":"The Last Page","review":"The Last Page is a solid debut; an emotional drama that takes a look at the need for love in the lives of its two protagonists, Karen Sanders and Travis Miller.In this novel, we see how the two of them keep the world around them at a distance, and learn why it is they are so content to continue to live their lives in this fashion. Karen doesn't take men seriously because she believes they cannot be trusted, and so her relationships with them fail; she doesn't make any real efforts to make the relationships work, so when the man slips up, she sends him packing. Travis is about as quiet as one can get, contenting himself with spending countless hours typing on his computer everyday; all he does is write while slucking down copious amounts of coffee at The Coffee Cove--the place where Karen works.Palmer's first two chapters are highly intriguing as we learn about the mysterious Travis and his absolute silence as he writes. We quickly see that the interest in this enigmatic man extends beyond merely the reader as Karen has taken to trying to study him while at work so that she can try and see who he really is. When they finally meet, the story really takes off.Palmer writes very deliberately, taking the time to craft a story that is as much about the book's surroundings as it is about the characters themselves. If you enjoy details, you should enjoy this one because it is a rich read in that respect. At times, he does write a little more than perhaps is necessary, but not so much that the reader should become bored.I enjoyed the characters in this story: they are compelling and the conflicts they face are quite real. The more I read, the more I grew to actually care about these main characters and found myself wanting to know how certain plot points would be resolved. Neither of the main characters are without their demons, so drama effectively builds with each subsequent scene, especially once they start to become friends.The Last Page is a solid debut that leaves the reader with hope that there is more to come in the future. I would definitely recommend that others read this richly-layered, multi-dimensional story."},{"Title":"The Last Page","review":"With some pieces of literature, it can be difficult to determine the author's intent in regards to a theme. Often I finish a book and wonder what drove the author to create it. What, if anything, am I supposed to take away from this book?In the case of \\"The Last Page,\\" quite the opposite is true. The themes in the book are evident, driven home through characters that even the happiest and most secure of people will find themselves connecting with.The story centers around Travis Miller and Karen Sanders. Karen, a waitress at a coffee shop, is a happy go lucky, completely together woman by day, and a broken, scarred, borderline alcoholic by night. She drinks to dull the pain from a past that haunts her. Travis is a patron at that same coffee house. Each day he comes in, sits at the same table and types feverishly on his laptop without speaking to anyone. From the first, Karen is intrigued by Travis, and his rejection of her efforts to get to know him only fuel her intrigue that much more.Travis is plauged by demons of his own; from a family that never loved him, from the death of his best friend, from being a social outcast all of his life, and from never, no matter how hard he tried, being good enough. With time and diligence, Karen begins to draw Travis out of his shell and a beautiful friendship blooms. They teach each other about life, happiness, and above all, trust.Is there anyone out there who has ever felt that inability to trust people? Trust can be broken, and once you learn that lesson, I think that each and every one of us has gone through the emotional mess of wondering whether its worth it to put yourself out there again. This is how Karen and Travis feel; and being such a realistic notion, you can't help but be drawn into their story.Not only are the characters and the plot line engaging, but so is the writing style. The language that Palmer uses is rich in description. Everything is detailed, but no overly done. The story is simple and straightforward, and appears to be straight from the heart. When I finished reading, I actually found myself wondering if the whole story was something the author had experienced first hand. It appears that genuine. The result of Palmer's efforts is a heartfelt novel about two people trying to survive in life. It's well done."},{"Title":"The Last Page","review":"The last page, for me, was a nice change. The story gets stronger as the book progresses and I found it difficult to put the book down. Brian has an eye for detail and it shows! I highly recommend reading The last page!"},{"Title":"The Last Page","review":"In \\"The Last Page,\\" Palmer combats the toughest of circumstances, with even tougher characters. His characters must deal with love, death and the life that remains. Palmer's most significant strength in his debut novel, to me, is his strong grasp of place and attention to detail. He specifically does a good job of setting his scenes in Tacoma favorites.Economy: Palmer's novel, however, is quite wordy and underpunctuated, which makes for fairly slow reading, including a need for quite a bit of re-reading.Also I thought there was a number of points in the novel when action was summarized rather than actually developed, which cheats the characters and the story.\\"The Last Page,\\" however, is peppered with gems, as Palmer's characters not only grapple with the meaning of love, but with themselves."},{"Title":"Coding: The Handbook for Information Technology","review":"This book is a wonderful companion and reference guide for many of the programming languages a technology professional might encounter.Each programming language is broken into a chapter and begins with a short synopsis of the language, a few facts (which serve as excellent reminders of a languages essential characteristic), and a short program with an explanation of what each line means.Reading this book won't make you a subject matter expert in any one of the programming languages it covers. However, the book is an excellent reference tool that will help you understand the basics of many programming languages and help you remember the syntax and structure of a language you haven't used recently or are only vaguely familiar with.The Swiss army knife approach taken by the author's to cover as many languages as possible is done quite well, making this book a bible for any technology consultant."},{"Title":"Coding: The Handbook for Information Technology","review":"As an IT consultant, I found this book an indispensable guide for anyone who needs to quickly familiarize themselves with a new language/technology. While you might think that a single book covering 20 technologies is an overly ambitious scope, it is in fact the brevity of each topic that is this book's strength. The book assumes that the reader is well versed in some technologies and computers in general and then cuts right to the heart of each specific skill-set. Rather than 20 books of 300-500 pages each, this book summarizes the basic framework and essential knowledge required to quickly become productive in some of the most widely used techonolgies. I've often found myself wishing I could just get a \\"Cliffs Notes\\" version of many of the 5 pound books I end up needing to read quickly for work - this is finally it."},{"Title":"A Shostakovich Casebook","review":"I write only to second the first two reviews and bring the debate up to date. When 'Testimony' first appeared in 1979, the naive political attack of the then Soviet union obscured the more profound criticism of those who knew Shostakovich well - namely, their incredulity that a personality as complex and secretive as Shostakovich was would ever have revealed himself to such a degree to a comparative stranger. Volkov did not help his cause by refusing to disclose the bulk of the transcript for many years.But when he finally he did so, it turned out that his practical reasons for keeping the ms. to himself were correct - for inspection revealed such obvious indications that Shostakovich had by no means endorsed the book as to end the controversy and Volkov's reputation with it. This analysis is detailed in the Shostakovich Casebook, and also in the Bard Festival handbook. The material is not at all dry, but quite interesting to people wondering how working historials and biographers actually do business.It is worth noting, however, that even the harshest critics acknowledge the enormous service 'Testimony' performed to Shostakovich, in presenting the West with a different image of the man than simply genius-cum-party-hack. It caused many people (myself, for example) to take a look at a musical accomplishment that was prodigious by any standard. The revitalized interest in DDS's chamber music, songs, and what were once considered his minor works, has led to a massive and long overdue appreciation of a towering musical genius. Volkov is owed a debt of gratitude for that that no one denies."},{"Title":"A Shostakovich Casebook","review":"I've never posted a review before, but I can't allow the above \\"editorial review\\" to go unanswered. I don't understand how, after reading Laurel Fay's article in this book, there could possibly be a sliver of doubt in anybody's mind that Testimony is a massive fraud.While I agree that the view of Dmitri Shostakovich as a loyal communist is naive and simplistic, the view espoused by Testimony is at least as much so. The veracity of the portrait of Shostakovich presented in Testimony is, at least, open to questions. The authenticity of the book itself has been demolished by Laurel Fay's excellent detective work. There can no longer be any doubt that what Shostakovich affixed his signature to was a collection of previously published writings. The departure from these earlier texts comes, in every single case, immediately following the end of the page which has been signed. There could not be any clearer evidence that the authentification of the book was carried out under false pretenses.Mr. Page draws attention to the agressive tone and the sometimes-monotonous focus of A Shostakovich Casebook. Publishing this kind of jeremiad wouldn't be necessary if Western journalists didn't persist in their stubborn refusal to acknowledge that Testimony, whatever its merits may be, was written by Solomon Volkov without the help of Dmitri Shostakovich.--&lt;A HREF=\\"http://web.mit.edu/jikatz/www\\">Jonah I.

You get many different Shostakovich experts talking about what information exists out there.

The Washington Post review cannot be let stand as it misunderstands the problem and demonstrates more than ever our need for this book. It is a sad truth that every book of falsehood published needs probably five or ten books of truth to correct.Plus, and alone worth the price of the volume, there is included one of Richard Taruskin's invaluable essays on Shostakovich demonstrating once more his astonishing vision and learning with respect to Russian music."},{"Title":"Guide to Interpersonal Communication (Guide to Business Communication Series)","review":"If you are in business, you need to read this book.

The layout is similar to Encountering the Old Testament (by Bill T. Arnold et al). Each chapter begins with learning objectives, questions to consider, and key words to understand. Coded side bars cover topics such as \\"The Apocrypha\\" and \\"Modern Translations of the Bible.\\" Each side bar is coded as Interpretive, Theological, Historical, Cultural, or Archaeological. Chapters end with summary statements, questions for reflection, and resources for further study. Numerous photographs are included with a large number drawn from modern Judaism. There is a brief appendix on Jewish history from 331 to 63 B.C.This 382 page book is very readable and probably appropriate in depth for a college textbook, although in this space cannot go as deep as, say, LaSor, Hubbard and Bush (Old Testament Survey). It is written from a conservative perspective but critical scholarship is presented in abbreviated form. For example, the standard dates for Second and Third Isaiah are presented in a paragraph. There is a general failure to engage such critical issues and the authors present \\"scholarly opinion\\" alongside \\"conservative evangelical\\" scholarship without always committing to a particular view. So on the authorship of Isaiah they write \\"There is no unanimous opinion on this issue among conservative evangelical scholars. Some prefer the multiple authorship view. Others view the entire book as the work of Isaiah of the eighth century B.C.\\" (p 293).Much of the content of the book summarizes the biblical content. New Testament interpretation is mentioned in theological sidebars where relevant and the reader is encouraged to apply theological insights to personal faith.The majority of the book was written by Alex Varughese who also edited the work as a whole. Varughese and the other three authors are department heads of Christian liberal arts colleges (I do not know who Robert L. Lewis is [named in the ...description]. He is not listed on my copy).This book will prove a colourful and readable introduction to the Old Testament, especially in terms of biblical content and life application. The numerous illustrations allow the reader to visualise Israel and modern Judaism.This review is based on a galley proof."},{"Title":"Discovering the Old Testament: Story and Faith","review":"I really like the introduction. Right out of the gate it gives the sidebar that lays out the objectives, key words and suggests questions you may have as you read through the chapters. This really helped me tie the reading of the text together. It suggests comparing our own precious memories to how you lived for and served God.The authors put real effort into the format to help the student get the full meaning. This is an excellent book a must for anyone studying the Old Testament."},{"Title":"Discovering the Old Testament: Story and Faith","review":"This is one of the best written books for learning about the OT.

The authors integrate the biblical information with helpful sidebars in the categories of Interpretive/hermeneutical, Theological, Historical, Cultural, and Archaelogical.For example, on page 226, there is an excellent and concise explanation of the reason for mixed marriages. It explains the problem of syncretism that eroded Israel's practice of monotheism. It then offers practical advice for marriage today.This work is a landmark work in Old Testament Survey that would be helpful to all students of the Hebrew Scriptures.

I've since dropped the class and returned the book, good riddance. Maybe the expected level of education has plummeted since I finished school 3 years ago, but this was an early high school level book AT BEST. Yes, the pictures are colourful and pretty, but they were also gigantic, taking up entire half-pages in some places. That's called padding. The type size was enormous (more padding) and most of the textbook was just a not-that-brief summary of the bible text - you might as well just read the bible itself.This book is for COMPLETE BEGINNERS who have never picked up the bible and probably never plan on doing so in the future after reading this book.

If you ever heard, &quot;test this, restrict that, and by the way, you'll probably end up going blind anyway&quot; and then thought &quot;Why should I?&quot; this is a great eye-opener. This book offers real-life feelings and experiences of other DM-ers (both types) in support of the idea that major adjustments are being/have been required in your life, and there are emotional side-effects of those changes that most of our doctors are not trained to deal with. It has some good tips, but more importantly, helps you ask the question: exactly how is this going to effect my self-image? Great section about thinking of yourself as &quot;good or bad&quot; based on choices that most make without a second thought. (i.e. should I go for a run?) There are also good chapters on how parents feel when a child is diagnosed, teenagers and their control issues, and sex.

The darkest hours may bring the brightest blessings.\\" ~Mom, April 4, 1968While reading my mother's diary from the first year of my life, I noticed that she was not only writing notes about me, she was writing notes about God. She would describe her joys, her experiences and her love for God. Between all these notes, my first year appears. What a beautiful gift!When you stop to think about it, how many individuals experience God in exactly the same way? Finally, I've realized that God is not limited to our ideas of who he is and at times he can surprise us by appearing while we are exercising or making us feel loved as we are falling asleep. In fact, I think God is mostly found outside of Church because he wants us to worship him in mind, body and soul.This might mean that you worship God while exercising, while studying or even while reviewing. Where are you the happiest? God can meet you there. You can find God while laughing with your best friends, while reading a book, while listening to music. The experience of God can be similar to being in love. I feel it as radiant energy (like the sun) glowing in my body. As if I'm being warmed by the sun or by love.You feel nurtured, protected and renewed. It gives you a sense that you are in fact in control of your destiny and that God wants the best for your life.In this fascinating journey through the minds of 40 Well-Known Seekers, we find 10 main questions. The answers range from casual observations to deeply poetic descriptions.The Main Chapters include:How I Encounter GodWhat God Feels LikeDiving into the DivineHow I Pray or MeditateWhat Cuts Me Off From God?Helpful Beliefs I HaveWhat Does God Want?Finding God in Daily LifeIn Search of the MiraculousMy Spiritual Advice IsPaths to GodContributors: Lynn Andrews, Marilyn Atteberry, Pat Boone, Joan Borysenko, LeVar Burton, Mantak Chia, Deepak Chopra, Alan Cohen, Stan Dale, Ram Dass, Bruce Davis, Wayne Dyer, Warren Farrell, Willis Harman, Richard Hatch, Louise L.

Young Sowers, Jim Nissley, Robert Fulghum, John White, Doreen Virtue and Jonathan Robinson.Through this book you can learn about why negative emotions separate you from your experience with God, why it is good to understand and eradicate fear, how living in a state of appreciation for life itself allows you to love God.While reading Pam Oslie's description of how she cleans the house and talks to God, I had a moment where I enjoyed a good laugh. Finally even Jesus is there to help with the housework. I mean, you could even talk to God while you are cleaning the tub.With a minimum of spiritual terminology, God becomes very accessible. Jonathan Robinson has created a beautiful gift about how wonderful the experience of God can be. I think when you truly start to see God as a God of Love, life becomes less of a conflict and much more of a comforting journey. Why should we only have peace in the next life, when this life awaits?~The Rebecca ReviewP.S. Also look for \\"Giving Love Away,\\" A CD for healing in the world.

Dr. Anderson probably could also, although I have not met him as I have Mr. Covino (I'm one of his art students). While I would, as he also does in this book, recommend ALL people see a physician before beginning any excercise/nutrition/supplement program, there is much food for thought here. He details many vitamins, minerals etc. and their effects on health and longevity and also provides an excellent weight loss and fitness program. However, the most important part of the book is in the last chapters where he writes of \\"Your Self and Its Role in Society\\" and the importance of psychological balance in both health and what he calls \\"active longevity\\". Many health-longevity books overlook this important factor.My only concern is that some of the supplement dosages are higher than I would personally risk.By following his diet program I lost nearly twenty pounds in two months and in four months had developed much more upper body strength with his excercises than I had previously from years using weight machines."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax","review":"In their preface, Waltke and O'Connor describe their work as an intermediate grammar to be employed between basic grammatical studies and more advanced research literature. The reference nature of this volume is exhibited in its logical and topical arrangement. The introductory section deals with matters of history (of the language, the Hebrew Scriptures, the study of Hebrew), linguistics, and grammatical units. The second section of the volume covers Hebrew nouns; the third considers adjectives, numerals, and pronouns; the fourth delves into classical Hebrew's verbal stems; and, the final section describes the usage of verbal conjugations and clauses. The glossary of grammatical terms, classified bibliography, and indexes enhance the volume and enable the teacher and student to maximize its use.An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax (IBHS) provides the students of biblical Hebrew with the most up to date and scholarly grammar written in the English language. The authors make it clear that their volume does not replace other reference grammars. Their reasoning is both honest and accurate-IBHS is not exhaustive either in treating exceptions or even in covering all matters of syntax and grammar. This grammar, however, is so well written that we can only hope that Waltke and O'Connor will see fit to complete this magnificent offering in a second volume that would treat the remaining elements of Hebrew syntax with the same excellence manifested in this work.All other reference biblical Hebrew grammars for English language readers have been written first in another language and then translated into English. The only exhaustive reference grammar for biblical Hebrew available in the English language is the old classic, Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar (Oxford University Press, 1910), edited in the original German by Emil Kautzsch and in the English translation by A. E. Cowley. It is woefully out of date, however, being nearly one hundred years old. More recently, Paul Jo&uuml;on's A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew was translated from French and revised by T. Muraoka (Pontifical Biblical Institute, 1996). It is more up to date, but lacks the exhaustiveness of the older grammar by Gesenius-Kautzsch-Cowley."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax","review":"This is very well written intermediate grammar on Biblical Hebrew. It bridges the gap between a student grammar like Lambdin's Introduction to Biblical Hebrew and a reference grammar like Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar (GKC). The introductory material is very useful. The introductory material includes a brief introduction to semitic languages in general, the history of the Hebrew language, the transmission of the canonical text and the masoretic tradition.Linguistic jargon that will be encountered is well explained. This is very useful for students of O.T. studies who are not usually schooled in linguistics.The book is also well footnoted. The footnotes may be used to get started on deeper research into particular features of grammar.Overall, study of this book will help get the student of B.H. and O.T. over that hump from being competent to read and translate the basic narrative materials (Pentateuch, Joshua-2Kings, Ruth, Jonah) to tackling some of the more difficult translation issues in the canon."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax","review":"I have been a fan of Gesenius for a long time. While I knew there was updated information to consider, I thought his text was enough. But although his text is certainly still necessary, and necessarily covers issues that the book reviewed here does not, it is clear that one must turn to Waltke &amp; O'Connor to reach a greater level of accuracy. Writing so long after Gesenius, they have presented new and accurate information based on the latest research, not only of Ancient Hebrew, but also based on cognate Semitic languages.I have found the sections on Hebrew verbs the most enlightening and correcting, e.g., that the Pi'el stem is NOT intensive. Such intenseness must be detected from a combination of the lexical verb meaning, the stem, and the text/co-text. This book also presents other up-to-date information on the forming of nouns from verbs, etc.As others have noted, the layout and presentation is great. It really can't be presented any easier, I don't think.One must read Gesenius, for he presents very important information across the board, including much on phonology and linguistics not covered by Waltke &amp; O'Connor. But to stick with Gesenius will leave one in error on some points. Waltke &amp; O'Connor, simply put, make the corrections and make studying Biblical Hebrew exciting, and even much easier to learn."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax","review":"After five semesters of studying Hebrew, I thought that the only remaining thing for me to learn was vocabulary.

For the person who wants to know EVERYTHING about Hebrew, this book is indispensable"},{"Title":"An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax","review":"I agree with the all the previous postive comments, no need to restate them. I am largely self-taught in BiblicalHebrew. Once you are past the basics, Waltke-O'Connor is the next best thing to having a real teacher. This book fills the gap between what most introductory books teach you and what most advanced books and articles think you already know. I do not agree with the previous commenter who said that it is a difficult read. This is all relative - All advanced hebrew grammars (and many beginner ones!) are difficult reads. Waltke-O'Connor is easier than most. But is not a traditional reference grammar like GKC or Jouon-Muraoka. It is not designed to allow looking up a particular verse or construction and find The Answer. Rather, each chapter is an extended discussion of particular area. Their aim is more to help point you in the right direction. Regarding GKC - the English translation lacks Bergstrasser's additions."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax","review":"Waltke's grammar is about as good as it gets with Hebrew Grammars. Considering the subject matter and its scope one has to expect a monolith like this 700pg jumbo sized monster. But this isn't just some pedantic and wordy school book, it is accessible (assuming that the reader has a basic understanding of Hebrew already), rich with Biblical examples, and comprehensive (at least as far as a grammar can be).

They present their material in clear and concise language. They do not attempt to show off how brilliant they are by using words that most of us have never heard.I would study a passage and use their scripture index to see what they said about a particular verse. This may not have been their intention, but they cover a lot of scripture as they explain Hebrew. I found that the index was accurate as to a passages location and it was easy to find (unlike Gesenius' book).I also appreciated the large type that they use. Many books of this sort try to cram as much information onto every page that they can. This book is easy to scan when looking for something. Even the footnotes are easy to read.I don't believe that any student of Hebrew would regret buying this book."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax","review":"This is the best reference work for Biblical Hebrew (BH) syntax. There are other syntax references for BH, but none this thorough by a long shot. They all have their place and fulfill their own function, but in terms of a definite reference guide, this is the one. It's a pretty hefty volume and will certainly keep the reader busy for some time.... Beginners might want to check out Arnold/Choi's or Williams's work, which are essentially abbreviated or simplified versions of this one."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax","review":"This is the Hebrew grammar that I use the most often. While I also use Williams and Arnold and Choi, this grammar is more comprehensive, and its size certainly reflects this. It probably betrays my inclination towards the exactness of Greek to like this grammar so much. As my Hebrew professor often tells us, all these grammar categories are contrived to some extent, so at some point it isn't helpful anymore to go further in depth on the uses of the so-called \\"cases.\\"All in all, I usually find it easy to locate the grammatical point in which I am interested, though sometimes I have to resort to looking up every instance a Hebrew particle occurs throughout the book. For this looking up of various nuances of a particle, I sometimes find Williams more user friendly. Nevertheless, Waltke and O'Connor's volume has been my resource of choice."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax","review":"This book really gives you what you know to dig into advanced Hebrew studies. It is certainly not the end of the road, though, as we still don't understand what the Hebrew verbal system is or exactly how it works. This book concentrates on doing its best to provide an overview of Hebrew sytnax rather than concentrating on particular problems in the research field. If one is looking for answers to these questions, one might be dissappointed by the brevity of the references in this volume. Hebrew is unfortunately still one of those languages where you are going to have a few grammars and subscriptions to a few periodicals before you can feel you have a good idea what's going on. Contrary to poular opinion, Kautsch/Genesius is not so much out of date as it is out of vogue. Such is the nature of Hebrew research. Also, the current Kautsch/Gesenius has an addition by Gotthelf Bergstr&auml;sser covering Hebrew morphology, though I am not sure if A. E. Cowley's English translation has this useful section. I would certainly recommend purchasing Kautsch/Gesenius-Bergstr&auml;sser in addition to this book. I do not read French and have not picked up Jo&uuml;on's version or its English translation."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax","review":"Depends on what you want to study.I have read only part of the book, then put it down as overly wordy for my use. But if one wants to learn what others have said about Biblical Hebrew grammar, then this book is apparently a good overview.The best way to learn Biblical Hebrew is merely to sit down and read Tanakh (Old Testament) through from cover to cover, over and over again. But that takes time. So as a shortcut, people read published grammars.I wanted to see how Waltke and OConnor treat the verbal \\"tenses\\". They give a review of grammarians starting from those writing during the Medieval period, up to modern times. Many pages. Then give their own ideas. Unfortunately, it is wrong too. It appears that they have developed their ideas of grammar from analyzing what others have said in the past, then making a choice which seems to be the most plausible to them and possibly tweaking it.Based on my experience with the book:If one merely wants to learn grammar for the purpose of reading the Tanakh, then this is not for you (or me, for that matter). It is entirely too long, contains so much extraneous material and is not necessarily accurate. The book best for this student possibly has not been written yet.If one wants to get an introduction to the history of Biblical Hebrew scholarship, along with a survey of the theories taught through the ages, this looks like an excellent tome. Possibly with no equal. Especially in the English language.So, as I wrote above, it depends on what type of studying one wants to do, which is why I gave it a 3 star rating. For some people it deserves a five star rating, and for others a one star rating.My experience: after a one year, two semester, college introductory class in Biblical Hebrew using Weinstein's (A Practical Grammar for Classical Hebrew (English and Hebrew Edition)textbook, not accurate). Then, with the help ofThe Analytical Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon,Gesenius' Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon to the Old Testament ScripturesandKonkordanz Zum Hebraischen Alten Testament/ Concordance to the Hebrew Old Testament (German Bible Society) (Hebrew Edition)I proceeded to read Tanakh through from cover to cover. After a few times through, I came to the realization that the Gesenius lexicon is often wrong, the roots listed in Davidson's lexicon sometimes don't make sense, and the book that gives the most accurate meanings is the Lisowsky concordance. As far as grammar is concerned, I learned that I could trust none of the books I had learned from in class and afterwards, especially when it concerns the verbal system. Further, sometimes the Masoretic points are wrong as far as meaning are concerned, so reading Tanakh using an unpointed text which will allow for different readings often clears up murky to unintelligible passages. I have now read Tanakh through more than 20 times, I lost count, reading for meaning and understanding. I am still learning."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax","review":"This Grammar offers a new non traditional view on the problems of the Biblical Hebrew syntax. It is indispensable for those who want to understand the Hebrew biblical text on the professional level."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax","review":"If you are a serious student of Hebrew this is the only way to go. The book explains how the language is built from the ground up. If you are like me you have found learning Hebrew challenging (that's a joke). I have tried learning vocabulary, rote memorization, even coming up with silly English sentences to help me remember words (The goddess \\"Hera\\" is quick) (sad, I know). This tool is essential approaching the language from the building block side of things and I am now able to look at the prayer book and recognize forms and tenses I never understood before.

It was written to show how martial artist can apply the principals and philosophy of Jeet Kune Do to their art and this book accomplishes this feat perfectly.

Very good!"},{"Title":"Unlimited (Jeet Kune Do)","review":"Sifu Burt Richardson breaks down the concepts of Jeet Kune Do so that martial artists of all disciplines can better understand the holistic approach to the study of martial arts. Burton starts with philosophy and tactics, then gives a detailed explanation of the five categories. He concludes by illustrating how these concepts can be applied through hundreds of photos. This book in not about a particular system, but how the individual martial artist can practice more efficiently and with greater understanding than ever before."},{"Title":"Unlimited (Jeet Kune Do)","review":"The first half of this book does a pretty good job of scientifically breaking down martial arts and training. The book starts off showing different symbolic jestures in the martial arts, such as bowing, and then explains the meaning of Bruce Lee's JKD symbol, then Richardson's JKDU symbol. Whoopie. Next is a list of the tennets of JKDU's philosophy, as well as it's fighting philosophy/tactics. Interesting that the two should be separate. There's actually some good stuff here, though. Next, the five ways of attack are explained, as well as the three ways of defense; all very scientific, and all are included in any good JKD book elsewhere. Mr. Richardson then gives his seven ranges of combat. There are four empty-hand ranges and three weapons ranges. I've grown out of the whole range concept thanks to &quot;Mastering Jiu-Jitsu&quot; by Renzo Gracie, and I'd recomend that book to any martial artist. Six different postures are then classified; this does little more than make you aware that your body can be in at least six different possitions. Then there's three pages on how there are billions of techniques, and a good bit about techniques as words, and how you learn to write your own sentences. Different methods of training are classified next, including a section on spiritual training. Once again, this is more or less to classify what you are doing. Then, from pages 56-137, there is nothing but crap. Not really crap, just a bunch of techniques to show you how much the author knows, really. There wasn't much here that was related back to JKD principles. If you don't know a lot of techniques, then this section might interest you. Overall, though, I didn't see anything really new on the JKD front, and it seemed like the author just wrote this book to promote himself and his &quot;style&quot;, not to help others grow in the martial arts. Nothing at all like the other JKD books out there. It's a shame, because I do like Mr. Richardson's articles in IKF, and I hear that he's a good instructor. Shame none of that showed in this text."},{"Title":"Unlimited (Jeet Kune Do)","review":"This is a fair-good book that shows some good techniques for a variety of attacks. However it should outline sections on takedowns, blocks/parries, and finishes.

Padded with pictures this book does convey the essence of JKD Concepts but I was looking for more of a techniques oriented text.

All these people who think they know Jeet Kune Do have no idea that what they do know could be no more then the 2nd class of it. The real tragic part is no one alive knows the full art of Jeet Kune Do since his son passed away.

From page one, I fell headlong into the world of Coyote, a mythological trickster who is reborn in present-day Washington State and grows up with a human family. We're along for a rambunctious ride as they gently but firmly try to guide him, in his formative years and a magnet for mishaps, with a level head and a sense of modern morals--and fail utterly.What a fun, charming, irreverent, thought-provoking and thoroughly delicious story. I laughed throughout, and the book is already on my short \\"must read again soon\\" list.The author seems to have uncanny insight into the workings of the animal mind. The narrative seamlessly combines this perspective with Coyote's developing human intelligence and the dawning mindset of an ancient god. At some times this gives us a unique, wry sideways glimpse of our own society; at all times, it makes for excellent storytelling.I feel like sharing this book with everybody I know. The more readers touched by Coyote's magic, the better!"},{"Title":"Five Star Science Fiction/Fantasy - New Coyote","review":"There aren't enough good things I can say about this book. It is a genre bending roller-coaster ride. It touches on mythology, ghost stories, werewolves, and magic, as well as a fair bit of science and animal psychology. It's humorous at times, and cover-clutching dramatic at others. By the time you are finished Bergey will have you believing in Sin-Ka-Lip (Coyote), a real narrative rather than a work of fiction. \\"What if?\\"As a native of the Pacific Northwest, it is readily apparent that the author is a resident of his story's setting.

I was surprised to see that he had written a book, and even more surprised to find that I enjoyed it.I kept checking the cover to see if it was written by Tom Robbins. New Coyote reads a bit like Another Roadside Attraction, although not so raunchy and with animals. It probably is not a coincidence that both Bergey and Robbins live in western Washington.New Coyote follows the adventures of a group of aging hippies and their strange creation, Coyote. Coyote's origins are either in high tech bioengineering or in ancient shamanism. Mike knows enough about both to thoroughly muddy the waters. The book is told from Coyote's point of view, so it is understandable that he can't really explain where he came from.The theme of the book is Coyote learning who or what he is. Every time he (and we) think that it is all figured out, he finds out that there is much more to learn. All he really wants is to be left alone to live with his family on the farm (and maybe cause a little bit of trouble...). Unfortunately other people think that he might be useful.Mike is a veterinarian, and it shows in his knowledge of animals. Most stories told from an animal's point of view ignore the realities of animal life, New Coyote doesn't."},{"Title":"Five Star Science Fiction/Fantasy - New Coyote","review":"Sunbow Farms was once a commune but now only Mooney lives there with Coyote, an animal who can talk. Mooney's main crop is marijuana so she can pay the taxes on her multi-million dollar land grant. It is a successful enterprise until the police discover it and arrest Mooney. Now she must find another way to pay the taxes or loose her land.Mooney's friend John visits them accompanied by a blind girl suffering from amnesia. Moose and Coyote bond immediately but when Coyote becomes friends with a werewolf, something magical happens to him so that he change on the night of the full moon. John explains to Coyote that John's totem Fox had him mix human DNA into a cell which reproduced and created Coyote. Though of Native American legend Coyote wants to learn the White Man's Magic (science) and has no memories of his life in the spirit realm. A bad magical entity has entered Coyote and Fox says he will have to kill him to protect others in the mortal realm. Coyote doesn't want to die now that he has found someone to love.NEW COYOTE is a cute urban fantasy showcasing a character who is young in years and wisdom but has the potential to fulfill his mission if he doesn't get killed by the many dangers that he seems to attract. Readers will find him adorable and hope that there will be future books that continue his story. Michael Bergey blends New Age mysticism with Native American mythology to create a work that is quite special.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Five Star Science Fiction/Fantasy - New Coyote","review":"This was the best book ever, funny with a lot of adventures and action a must read. don't forget to read book 2 coyote season"},{"Title":"Five Star Science Fiction/Fantasy - New Coyote","review":"Once you get past Coyote's lisp, the story is funny entertaining and a pretty good capture of Native American Coyote (Trickster)."},{"Title":"Five Star Science Fiction/Fantasy - New Coyote","review":"What if the old animal spirits from Native American lore were still around; but, weakened by modernity and science they didn't understand, Coyote grow up in a new body to learn the ways. It's a great launching off point for a book; while \\"New Coyote\\" wanders rather than focusing on the specific premise it's an entertaining ride.The book is mostly lighthearted, and it's a good fit for the prose, which is straightforward but smooth and a quick read. Coyote is a great character; he comes across cleanly as an intelligent coyote without overplaying things. He fits right into the parts of the book that are more heavily inspired by the Coyote stories. The rest of the cast doesn't have time to get too complex, but the main cast never falls into stock territory; even when the book turns more serious the characterization works.New Coyote is not the most complex of books, but the neat idea and execution leave it as an enjoyable read that hits that succeeds as well as you could ask.****1/2"},{"Title":"I Know Why the Manatee Swims Naked (I've Shopped for Bathing Suits, Too)","review":"I happen to have been fortunate enough to see and hear Ms. Covan deliver her fabulously funny stories.

After years of bounty hunting and endless strife have taken their toll, Durham decides to take a nap for a few years in a cryotube. 1200 years and many wars later she awakes to find everyone and everything she has ever known is gone.On the good side, in her absence she has been declared a saint! Well it would be good if the humans, who still hate mutants, and her own followers weren't both trying to kill her.Before she knows it Durham finds herself on the remains of a blasted planet forming alliances with her bitter enemies against an even deadlier foe.If you like anything from the warhammer realm you will also like Durham Red and the other cast of characters to be found in the explosive new collection from Black Flame Publishing."},{"Title":"Durham Red #1: The Unquiet Grave","review":"Red decides she needs a break way from it all for a while. However, the immense length of time she spends in suspended animation wasn't really what she had in mind.Upon awakening it seems she has been canonised for her role with the Strontium Dogs and mutants, and a lot of carnage has been carried out in her name.She also has to deal with the pretty horrific problem of a planet-sized brain sucker, or Mindfeeder if you want to be more polite, as well as a high up rat in the ranks."},{"Title":"Durham Red #1: The Unquiet Grave","review":"Not much thought went into the science part of this fictional story, but the quick pace and akward social encounters kept my interest throughout the book.

If your knowledge of genetics lets you believe a \\"mutation\\" could cause human offspring to become a superstrong vampire, with no defects, in one generation, this may be the book for you -- I couldn't hack it. The setting was like a jungle filled with tigers -- no other animals. Serious SF does not have battlefleets without civilizations and industry supporting them -- economics have to be considered. If the characters have no constraints as to where they go or what they do, it's a fantasy, not science fiction."},{"Title":"What the IRS Doesn't Want You to Know: A CPA Reveals the Tricks of the Trade","review":"My annual salary grew steadily each year since graduating from college in 1994. However, there was hardly any money to pay off my credit card bills and forget about nice vacations or investing! I'd had enough. I heard of IT jobs that paid $50/hr. (or more). One day I had a conversation with an IT contractor with 7 years experience. This man had incorporated his own business and suggested that I did for the tax benefits. However, he was not very articulate as to EXACTLY what benefits there were to incorporating. I had to know. So I purchased Marty Kaplan's 3rd edition in late 1997. On May 20, 1998 I paid a law firm $300 to formally incorporate my very own company. I was instanly a President!(I still get a kick out of my title!) I have been contracting ever since. I think that I would have been contracting whether I purchased this book or not. However, Marty Kaplan's book provided a detailed comparsion between the different types of businesses. (i.e. sole proprietorship, partnership, Limited Liability Company, C-Corporations, &amp; S-Corporations) Marty explained the financial realities, that precious few people understand. These truths showed me the pros and cons to each business model. All the financial decisions that I made were based on the information I gleened from this book. I assure you that I am infintely better off today than I would be if I were still at my 1998 job. But, what's more is that I'm better off today than I would be if I had contracted as a &quot;W2 employee.&quot; (which is much easier in the beginning!) It was Marty's text that enlightened me! Also, Marty speaks plainly about being audited - &quot;...it may happen and don't panic.&quot; Marty is completely ethical. His text simply shows readers how to prevent raising red flags. (i.e. certain IRS forms have been found to be guaranteed red flags and Marty advises how to legitamately report those same expenses on the &quot;right&quot; forms) Marty provides excellent anecdotes that will help readers predict the IRS's behavior and steer clear of its wrath. Marty spends the remainder of the book showing you how to maximize your legitimate deductions while minimizing your tax liabity. This book paid for itself in a split second. Thank you Marty!"},{"Title":"What the IRS Doesn't Want You to Know: A CPA Reveals the Tricks of the Trade","review":"Keeping up with all the IRS rules and regulations can be a real hassle. The tax code keeps getting more and more complex every year, in spite of countless promises by politicians to \\"simplify\\" the system.This book does give some useful tips on how to avoid taxes. It points out specific ways that you can legally reduce your tax burden, along with key mistakes to avoid, unless you like the idea of being audited.This book is written in an outline format, with boldface and bulleted text throughout. This is helpful, for finding specific information. You can quickly turn to a chapter that interests you, and then narrow down your reading by looking for the sub- topic that interests you.Thw way this book portrays the the American tax system might not sit too well with some people. The author talks about the IRS, not necessarily as a great, friendly institution, but not as something to take caution with, either. He paints a picture of the IRS as being a firm, but reasonable institution and points out that we should not fear the IRS at all. We all can think of many, many occasions where this has not been the case. The IRS has abused its authority in many instances, and many feel that some of its unethical actions are directly the result of political manipulation against enemies, like in the case of auditing of high- profile individuals. But this book avoids talking negative, making the IRS seem like an institution that is reasonable and accommodating.This book shows the reader many ways to avoid taxes, and much of the advice is sound, but I found this book to be a yawner overall. It's one of those books that could be viewed as a reference book, or a reading book. However, if you try to read the book from cover to cover (it's more than 450 pages in length), don't be surprised if your eyelids seem to become very heavy after every few pages of reading. This isn't exciting material, and it can induce drowsiness quickly.This book has been updated and revised many times to keep it current with the ever- changing tax laws. It's the type of book that becomes outdated very quickly, and needs constant revisions to keep up with the times. My edition is already a couple years old, and I can already see where the technology chapter is way behind.This is an ok book to have around, as a reference guide to reducing taxes and complying with IRS rules. If you don't want to pay a tax professional and you enjoy the challenge of working on your own taxes, then this book could prove to be very beneficial. For everyone else, it will likely just sit on a shelf and collect dust. Buy it only if you feel that you really need it."},{"Title":"What the IRS Doesn't Want You to Know: A CPA Reveals the Tricks of the Trade","review":"Any one who even thinks about submitting a 1040 should have this book in hand.

For once, I was able to ask my accountant some informed questions and avoid a possible disaster. Every possible itemization is considered.

One negative review is from a tax protester (they argue that nobody should have to pay taxes, but they love sending their kids to public schools and enjoy their social security checks!).There's another negative review from a Ron Paul supporter. I love Ron Paul, but trashing the author's book because you WANT a flat tax doesn't make your dream of a flat tax come true, and it's really unfair to the author.The last review is obviously someone who works for a taxing agency. The author may advocate some strong tax avoidance techniques, but tax \\"avoidance\\" is still legal (tax EVASION, which is illegal, is not what the author proposes). I've represented enough taxpayers to know that the IRS would love to do away with the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, but until that happens, taxpayers have the right to legally reduce their tax any way they can.So, that being said, the author is getting trashed from every direction, which usually means the book is good. He doesn't advocate anything that would put you in jail, but he does mention quite a few good tax shelters that almost everyone can take advantage of. By the way, the IRS has tried to make \\"Tax Shelter\\" a dirty word, but most tax shelters are completely LEGAL. Do you have a retirement plan? Then you have a tax shelter.The book could use a yearly update, which is the only reason it's getting four stars."},{"Title":"What the IRS Doesn't Want You to Know: A CPA Reveals the Tricks of the Trade","review":"Now available in a revised and updated eighth edition, What The IRS Doesn't Want You To Know: A CPA Reveals The Tricks Of The Trade is a compendium of solid, up-to-date tax advice for 2002.

This number is rising as companies are down sizing and young people skilled in computer technology enter to workforce as small business owners.This is an older volume, published in 2003 and some of the material is dated.

Waugh is a much more sympathetic voyager than the more heroic likes of Chatwin or Raban - his whining about lack of bath water or pesky mosquitos is more refreshing than some writers' spiritual journeys.Despite his attempts at objectivity, 'Remote people' is written, as we might expect, from a very jaundiced viewpoint. Waugh's experiences aren't really 'Alice' at all, simply a concatenation of minor mishaps, local eccentricites and cultural differences in very poor countries that only a very insulated Englishman would blow up and find surreal. Some of Waugh's ill-advised political theorising, especially his unconvincing defence of the notorious white settlers in Kenya's Happy Valley, make for distinctly ncomfortable reading, although one is grateful for Waugh's evident and lucid integrity to his own beliefs. It is surprising in a book of 1931 to see how many of the issues raised by post-colonial theory were already being painfully argued about.Of course, we don't read Waugh for politics or sympathy to foreigners. Although written in a more descriptive, less dialogue-driven style than the novels, we find the same account of bewildered, uprooted Modern Man faced with the problems (and comedy) of the simple fact of other people (American professors absurdly reverent of Ethiopian religious practice; Seventh Day Adventists prone to seasickness; colonial magnates encouraging staff and guests to climb life-threatening volcanos etc.). The travelogue is less interesting than the rich set-pieces - the Abyssinian coronation; the bathetic trip to an ancient monastary; a rooftop cinema where the audience wilt sleepily in the sun; the efforts of native scouts to light a fire; a berserk ship journey down river with the captain trying to shoot game from his cabin, his passengers leaping off to search for any hits."},{"Title":"Remote people (Duckworth's Georgian library)","review":"This book is fantastic! It covers Waugh's journey to see the coronation of Emperor Haile Selassie in the 1930s, then his long and tough trip to get back home to England afterwards.Evelyn describes the journey vividly and tells a range of amusing travel anecdotes. The only shame is that he did not visit more of Ethiopia.."},{"Title":"Homicide in Families","review":"It is a great book for anyone doing research in this area. Ann Goetting is a professor of sociology at Western Kentucky University who is very experienced in studying domestic violence. She strongly feels that homicide is a public health problem and believes it needs to be addressed. This book is her way of informing the reader and helping to come up with some preventive methods. Goetting&#8217;s research is based on findings of the Detroit area. The book is put into nine profiles of homicide in special populations. Each of the profiles related to females, children, or the elderly in the capacity of offender or victim, or both. This book attempts to inspire preventive considerations through knowledge. She breaks down statistics in different categories such as: race, sex of offender, age, domestic status of victim, social class of offender, arrest record of offender, religious affiliation, homicidal motive, etc. She puts all the information into almost every category you can think of. Then with the highest statistic in each category gives us an image of an offender. The image helps to inform the reader on how to identify a person who is an offender and/or the victims they tend to go after. Goetting tries to give the reader the ability to identify people who are at greater risk of involvement, as offenders and victims, and which locations, times, and other circumstances are associated with the increased risk. This book is filled with statistics and also preventive methods that can be used to solve the problems related to homicide."},{"Title":"Child Custody Made Simple: Understanding the Laws of Child Custody and Child Support","review":"This book offers a good overview of child custody and support and provides many references, both in-print and on the web, for further, more detailed information.

The author spends the first 75 pages discussing his youth and family which have little or no bearing on his experinces as a soldier. I found the description of training very superficial and the description of combat and Waffen-SS tactics and personal experiences very light when a more in-depth description of his feelings and experiences in combat would have been more interesting. This is a lightweight book on the Waffen-SS."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"The name of this book should have been \`Duped! They Fooled Me!' The author enlists in the Waffen SS to save Germany and Europe from Bolshevism, and to be a good citizen by fulfilling his duty to his country. His unit has uniformly good officers who are competent and morally admirable. However, the author witnesses some disturbing incidents, including a train of sealed boxcars full of people going to a concentration camp, slave laborers begging for food and being brutally rebuffed, and an uncle forced to divorce his wife because she was a Jew. These incidents are rationalized away by the belief that all will be straightened out after the war is won.All of the good officers and most of his friends and comrades are killed in action. Upon capture by the Americans, Voss learns that the SS has exterminated millions of people in death factories. (He calculates that in one camp alone, 3000 people a day were murdered.) But his SS unit never exterminated anyone (or so he claims). They fought a \`clean' war under exemplary officers. It dawns on the author that something might be wrong. His loyalty to the men he fought with, and to those who died dominates his thinking. He has a lot of trouble coming to terms with the reality of Nazism.The book reads well, but the first 50 pages tend to drag as the author describes his family life. Later in the book, his high school sweetheart Christina is killed in a bombing raid. His family's house is destroyed. Germany has attacked the whole world and is in shambles. Again there is little discussion about these tragedies. In his mind he is still fighting Bolshevism.He risked his life in combat to keep the concentration camps open for business, to allow SS troopers (in other units) to burn down villages and execute people, and give nazi bigwigs time to grab their loot and head for Argentina. But he clings to the idea that his SS unit consisted of good men fighting Bolshevism, and can't get himself to see beyond that. He was manipulated and used as a tool by a cult group of homicidal maniacs. He sees only that good men were killed. I'm not sure he recognizes the bigger picture."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"Good book, parts of the book are enthralling and vivid.

The price of war is very high, even this good war, and the book makes this clear with sickening detail about the loss of idealism, innocence, and lives.This book takes you back to the early days of the Hitler regime, when Germans were still arguing with each other about the merits of the Reich (they argued? what a surprise and they sound a lot like Americans today fighting with their family members who can't face Bush's fascism.)Highly recommended.

This book is typical of the genre which portrays the honest, upright, and virtuous German soldier as an unfortunate victim in the dirty world of politics. My father was a medical officer in the second world war and to his dying day he hated the Germans. And he grew up speaking German at home in Oregon. When his unit first entered Germany he expected the Americans to be greeted as liberators. He was shocked to find the Germans to be a bunch of whining crybabies in total denial of what had happened to them. They blamed the Americans and the British, not the Nazis. If it had been up to my dad the western allies would have stopped at the German border and told Stalin to have his way the krauts. If this book is about the author's conscience I'd like to see where. At no place in the book does he question the judgement of Adolph Hitler. He makes the devastation caused by the Germans in Russia sound as if there were a few isolated incidents perpetrated by a minority criminal element. The only regret this man expresses in this book is an implicit sorrow that the Nazis lost the war. The Nazis were psychos. There's no way they could have worked their evil without the compete submission of the military. There's a great line in the excellent film Stalingrad. The captain says to a former officer who has been demoted \\"I'm no Nazi Otto.\\" Otto, the ex-officer replies \\"No, you officers are worse. You went along, even though you knew who was in charge.\\" The author of this book bought into the psychotic, racist nationalism of the Nazi party. At no point in the book does he reject it. As I approached the end of the book I kept waiting for him to assign the blame for the war on the Jews. I guess he ran out of ink and paper before he got to that point. By the way, I'm not Jewish."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"The author tells a rather disappointing story abouth when he was a humble and simplistic soldier, proud of the \\"good branch of SS\\", despite hiding it during captivity for obvious reasons and ignoring his father's advice not to join the SS for the \\"things they are doing here\\".

I have certainly read my share and more. Black Edelweiss is a more personal tale which takes the reader into the author's Waffen-SS unit and is written in such a way that one can imagine himself part of the scene.Black Edelweiss is a gripping tale of obscure battles fought both in the remote backwaters of Finland and Karelia but also on the Western Front as Allied forces overwhelmed Germany. It is a tale of courage, idealism, loyalty, betrayal, and often super-human endurance. It is also the tale of one man's journey from being an idealistic recruit in the elite forces of his homeland to POW status where he is confronted with the reality of the enormity of his country's crimes.Author Johann Voss intersperses stories of his service and his subsequent captivity with more personal stories of his family and his social milieu in such a way so that anyone who has ever served his country can identify with him on a basic human level. As for his membership in the SS, most fair-minded people understand that most members of that organization joined for the prestige of serving their country in an elite unit, not to commit war crimes.Those hungry for the gritty details of history will be most satisfied after reading Black Edelweiss. It is an important addition to the edifice of our knowledge about World War II."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"Basically this is a memoir from a german ss soldier's accounts of his experiences through World War 2.

And this book is exactly what I have been looking for. As I read the book, I found an almost uncontrollable desire to seek out, find, and talk to German WWII veterans. I so desperately want to understand their POV, their motivation, what they thought of the different soldiers they were fighting against (US, British, Russion, etc.)...what they thought of their own commanders' tactical skill (mostly the smaller unit commanders such as Battalion, Company, Platoon, etc.). I just cannot get enough. REading this book makes me want to buy some 6th Mountain Division German vet a first class ticket to Finland just so I could walk the battlefield with him, hear his stories. Having said that, is there any German WWII vet in the Atlanta, GA area? Would you care for some company - an ex-soldier coming over with some chocolate in some tin to spend an afternoon talking about military history, tactics, strategy, critique, etc.? If so, please reach out! This is a great book. I can't put it down. Here's my take: although I am certainly glad we won and I am one proud American, these guys (the kind writing this book) were soldiers too, and really DARN good ones...and dammit, I just want to see it from their eyes...before it's too late. All the German WWII vets out there: we want to hear from you; we want to hear the soldier stories if you are willing to share them."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"A few years ago while touring our WWII battlefields in the Vosges Mountains of Eastern France with members of my 70th Infantry Division Association, my wife and I met the author. Since that first meeting we have had the opportunity to exchange both our recollections of and our thoughts during those dark days. At the US Military Cemetery in St. Avold I have stood next to the author as he placed flowers by our Association's memorial wreath. I have listened to his words as he shared his feelings with our group of veterans on tour in Saarbrucken, the large German city we captured in March 1945. I have felt the anguish in his mind as he described becoming aware of the horrors that the Nazis and some of his fellow Waffen SS comrades had committed in the concentration camps.And the author has listened to my story of being ambushed and captured, then wounded by artillery shrapnel, and surviving a severed artery because a German soldier risked his life while carrying me unconscious to medical aid.As I read the fascinating Black Edelweiss I found myself frequently comparing my situation as a 17 year old youth in rural Kansas with the author's thoughts and activities halfway around the world. Black Edelweiss has given me a new perspective on both the German military and the citizens of Germany during the early \`40s.I found once I started reading it was difficult to put the book aside."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"As noted in the other reviews, this is one of the best war memoirs around, perhaps the best German memoir of WWII. Unlike so many other accounts written only years after the fact, Black Edelweiss was penned within the first years after the war and not originally meant for publication. I suspect the author, with a strong sense of family, wanted to have something to present to his decedents, something that he had completed as a young man still with the full emotion and confusion of the initial bewildering and catastrophic events that were the fate of his generation.This memoir is interesting on a variety of levels. One is the account of mountain infantry training the author received as a young volunteer for the Waffen SS. Far from politically indoctrinated fanatics, we see an elite military organization preparing men for combat in modern war. I suspect that the emphasis on political and racial indoctrination was more a product of the pre-war years, when the Waffen SS was seen as a force against potential enemies within the Reich, not after say 1941 when large numbers of new replacements were needed to man an expanding number of divisions fighting in foreign theaters of operations. That and the fact that many foreign volunteers, some from ethnic groups lower on the SS pecking order, where filling the ranks of these formations as well. The emphasis went from \\"elite order of racial Uebermenschen\\" to \\"cadre of the common European struggle against Bolshevism\\". This latter attitude is mentioned by the author numerous times and obviously was one of his main reasons for joining the organization.On another level is the sociological perspective of various views common among Germans during 1941-3. He sees his own class in school as divided between the idealists and the pragmatists. Some, like the author, saw the war as a personal challenge and were eager to commit themselves, while others saw it as the business of others and hoped to survive the chaos as best as possible, which is hardly the usual view we have of German youth of that time. Interesting in that the author shows us how universal this conflict of views is. One need only think of the attitudes of the generation of young Americans confronted with the Vietnam War and how they reacted, although in some cases in later life only to adopt the opposite view when it no longer required a personal commitment.So some of us can respect the author's decision to serve his country as a soldier in wartime. But the branch he chose to serve with was the Waffen SS, part of the larger SS, which was to be branded a criminal organization by the Allied courts due to their administration of the Holocaust among other crimes. The author admits the crimes and the guilt of the SS (he found out about the death camps and other atrocities as a POW after the war), but can't condemn all his comrades, most of whom are dead, as criminals in serving a cause which they believed in, which the author never thinks included common knowledge of the criminal character of the SS. It is a quandary for which the author never finds an answer, perhaps because no answer is possible. That the author saw the Nazis as having perverted all the values that his generation had believed in, of destroying his country in a senseless war while pursuing the most inhuman crimes imaginable is tempered by the fact that he doesn't see the defeat of Germany as a liberation. . . See page 133.The mistake was in not overthrowing the criminal regime themselves, which was a \\"disgrace\\", but in having to have their enemies do it for them. Furthermore, the final outcome of the National Socialist swindle was not inevitable, \\"All the same one lesson is clear: never again must there be any public authority without active popular control\\". Page 71.There are others points the author mentions as well such as the belief common in Germany after the First World War that a new movement which would do away with the old distinctions of class and status, create a Volksgemeinschaft, was necessary for national rebirth. Also of special note are his interesting and gratifying comments concerning US troops in action and his description of Operation Birke, the German evacuation of their Lapland Army from Finland to Norway in the fall of 1944, an arduous trek of over 1600 kilometers conducted in good order under pressure from both the Red Army and later the German's former allies, the Finns. I doubt that this unique military achievement of the Lapland Army will ever be repeated.This book should be of interest to all readers interested in the Eastern Front in World War II, particularly since it is one of the few accounts available of fighting on the Karelian sector, those interested in the history of the Waffen SS or those interested in a sociological perspective of Germany during World War II."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"Black Edelweiss is a rare example of a personal WWII memoir written soon after the events (most of the draft was written while the author was a POW during 1945-46) with the emotional and historical breadth of a book written from a much greater distance of time and utilizing a variety of non-personal references. Johann Voss (a pseudonym) has put his life in the SS-Mountain Infantry Regiment 11 (given the name &#65533;Reinhard Heydrich&#65533; in 1942) to paper in a way that the reader can truly assess the actions of a single soldier, his immediate platoon members and larger Regimental force rationally without the baggage of bias. This is not to say that the author has created a typical post-war apologetic piece that draws empathy/sympathy from the reader. Rather, Voss draws the reader along in an honest forthright story of his experiences as a loyal soldier within a larger group of comrades who, although fighting for the Hitler regime, did so with heart and passion for comrades, unit and country, but with clear chivalry (or at least as much as can fairly be expected in war) and battle fairness. It is the very nature of when this book was drafted (and little changed by the author later although published 60 odd years after being drafted) &#65533; while the author was still feeling connection to and pride of unit &#65533; that makes this NOT a typical Nazi apologia book. The book was however written at a time when the author was learning (second hand) about the atrocities of the Nazi regime and the SS structure more particularly, and as such the author is able to place his military experiences in perspective of the regime he served. This creates both an honest look at combat and the emotions invoked upon finding for what and whom he and friends served and died for. Emotion is raw and real in this book.Voss starts and ends the book in third person from the POW pen, but in between weaves an engrossing story of how a young impressionable German is compelled to join an elite SS-Mountain Regiment; how this decision positively affects his life; how he survives the cold and combat of service above the Artic circle, in the Vosges Mountains, and the last days of the western Reich frontier; and how his earlier decision to join this elite group of men affected his life upon realization that his combat unit has been wholesale lumped with the SS of the Endl&ouml;sung. The stories of regiment combat are visceral in content and quite rewarding. One can feel the cold, stress, fear and adrenalin of the situations.I highly recommend this book if you want a clear and apparently unembellished, time-unbiased picture of a German combat unit in action. If you want to double your pleasure read Black Edelweiss back-to-back with another Aberjona Press production, Seven Days in January by Wolf Zoepf. This latter book deals exclusively with the SS Nord Division and it&#65533;s combat both above the Artic Circle and the Lower Vosges and is pitched more from the pure combat history perspective."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"This book is the WW2 memoir of a Waffen-SS soldier written while in American captivity immediately following the war. Johann Voss, a pseudonym, is a thoughtful, intelligent young man from a prominent family that joins the Waffen-SS in 1943 out of patriotism and the idealistic desire to protect Europe from Communism. One of his main purposes in writing the book is to counter the evil reputation of the Waffen-SS (deservedly earned by such divisions as T&ouml;tenkopf) and show that not all Waffen-SS soldiers were cruel murderers but that some were motivated by quite selfless and altruistic goals.The book is well written, fast-paced, and quite an interesting read. It is fascinating to see how the soldiers described do not see themselves as evil world-conquering monsters, but rather as noble heroes. It did strike me as a bit too sugarcoated &#65533; the suffering of the soldiers in the cruel winter environment of Finland is not really covered, and the focus tends to be on his positive experiences, rather than the negative. This was obviously written by an idealistic 20-year-old who had not yet been exposed to the horrible crimes of the Nazis and the SS. Still, it is worthwhile to read an account from the other side of the war and learn about their motivations for fighting &#65533; not really that much different from the American boys over there."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"It was with great anticipation that I awaited the publication of \\"Black Edelweiss.\\" I was with Task Force Herren (the three infantry regiments of the 70th Infantry Division newly arrived in theater without artillery and logistical support) and moved into Northeastern France to face a growing threat there. We were attached to the 45th Infantry Division during the German operation \\"Nordwind,\\" in which the author, Johann Voss, was a machine gun section leader in Regiment 11, 6th SS Mountain Division (Nord). That operation was Hitler's last campaign after the German failure in the Battle of the Bulge. The author's division was hurriedly brought to northeastern France t o participate in \\"Nordwind\\" without its heavy supporting weapons from its area of operations in Finland where it had been engaged for several years against the Soviet Army. Voss's descriptions of the combat actions against us in the Vosges provide an excellent complement to those of Wolf Zoepf, author of \\"7 Days in January,\\" and a member of Voss' sister Regiment 12. Voss was captured by American forces and and held for two years. During his captivity, he was assigned for a time to work for a U.S Army Judge Advocate Generals Corps officer where he had access to extensive factual documentation of the Holocaust and other Nazi crimes, and had finally to face and accept reality of the destruction of his boyhood dreams and the goals for his country as an infantry soldier.His story opens in 1938 when the author was a young boy of 13. He is caught up in the hopes and fears of his parents and other elders; the nation's need for economic recovery, and a great fear of Bolshevism and the Soviet Union. He joins the Hitler Jugend and is greatly impressed by his older friends and relatives who have gone into uniform, and the actions taken by the National Socialist government of Germany. He becomes very anxious to help his country, and when old enough, decides to join the Waffen SS. He is assigned to the 6th SS Division, Regiment 11 in Finland. He vividly describes life and military operations above the Arctic Circle against the Soviet foe. The winter of \`44-'45 in the Vosges Mountains in NE France was the coldest in 50 years, and while it may not have measured up to the cold of the Arctic Circle region, I found myself comparing the actions taken by the German soldiers to deal with the extreme cold with those we used to survive the cold of the Vosges Mountains that December and January.As an infantry battalion commander many years later in Vietnam, I also found myself comparing the rigors of combat leadership I experienced with the leadership actions taken by the author's battalion commander and was duly surprised and impressed. Surprised because I had been under the mistaken impression that in WW II, the German Army officers did not show the concern for their soldiers' personal welfare and safety that we did, but in actuality I found that he seemed to follow the high standards of the U.S. Army Infantry School's leadership guidelines taught all U.S. Army infantry officers; impressed because all his men clearly loved him. \\"Black Edelweiss\\" will remain as a permanent addition to my library."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"A first rate memoir, in which the author crystalizes his wartime experiences and reflections in a direct and thoughtful manner. As the publisher and editorial reviews have stated so well, there is fresh and added-value to this memoir, since it was largely written at the conclusion of WWII. It is free of the 'rationalization' and detachment typical of many memoirs written years later, and largely by the German Officer Corps.The author addresses a number of the painful questions facing German WWII veterans in general, and Waffen-SS veterans in particular. Although, a number of the reasons cited by the author for his volunteer enlistment in the Waffen-SS, and support for the Nazi regime's war effort, may sound stereotypical, the context and timely record of his judgements transcend these well-worn cliches. The author was able to clearly and concisely translate his personal value system against the backdrop of Nazi Germany, and honestly open his life to the reader's inspection, free of rationalization and ready answers. He draws the conclusion that sometimes there are no answers of 'why' to pressing questions of personal value judgements, but that some values remain constant and must be used to face the future.In sum, this memoir presents more of a common man's 'thinking' perspective - a middle-class and average German viewpoint. Again, not to be understated, is the value of this memoir as written at the end of WWII, and the honest insight captured within. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"Some very good reviews have been written about this book, is there anything else to add? Well yes, there is.Perhaps i should explain a little about myself first. I live in North Norway and research the war in this part of the world,for me some of the places Voss talks about are not strange names from a far off distant land, they are home. In fact i owna weekend cabin right next to the very road Voss trudged down in late 1944 and i can tell readers that the signs and detritusof that retreating army are still to be seen in the surrounding forests and hills. So for this reader Voss's book has a sense of familiarity about it.So what can i add to the existing reviews? Well, this memoir is invaluable, even unique in that it is, to my knowledge, the firstto deal in depth with the experiences of a German soldier fighting in Scandinavia to be published in English. For that i am deeply grateful to both Voss and his publishers. Thewar up here is virtually ignored and forgotten amongst the English speaking nations and yet tens of thousands died in over 3 yearsof fighting. Voss has done a great service to the memory of the fallen of both sides in reminding us that whilst the decisive battlesof the war were fought elsewhere men and women also fought and died up here, in the Northernmost parts of Europe.It's also worth commenting on what this book is and what it isn't. This is not a history of the 6 SS Mountain Division, nor is it a history of the war in the Arctic. It is, however one private soldiers experiences as he saw them. It's an important point as Voss does make several mistakes and confuses slightly some units and personalities. This isn't a critisism though, you can't expect a machinegunner to know much about what was going on outside the confines of his company or battalion."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"All of the other reviews are spot on. I have read several books on World War II and this one is at the top of my list. I found it fascinating the details the author encounters vs. the overall big picture of battles and outcomes of large campaigns. I also gained more respect for the planning and professionalism that went into the smaller operations that author witnessed and took part in.As others have mentioned it makes you realize that not all SS were fanaticals and racists. And in this author's case it was matter of joining to do something about the war and attempt to help his country.I particularly enjoyed the author's experiences before the war, how he described his middle to upper middle class life and how nice it was. I also found the relationships, expierences, and his vivid memories he recalls about other soldiers (including his father) very interesting. I can easily imagine what it must have been like.Its a quick read, possibly too fast. I really wish it was longer and that it was not edited down to its size (as mentioned in preface). This is definitely a highly recommended book."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"An amazing book which is very well and thoughtfully written. The author carefully examines his own motives and actions, and then sets them against the background of his emerging knowledge of the holocaust after the war.He and his unit were not involved in atrocities, and I have found no record of accusations against the Nord division. Part of this (or much of it) may be owed to the fact that they operated mostly in the Arctic and then on the Western Front during the final days of the war. They luckily never served in Russia or Poland, so were not in a position to be confronted with the war against the Jews. Despite this the author recognizes that he was involved in the organization that carried out the killings, and feels complicit to an extent.Very interesting look at German homefront life, and the much ignored fighting in Finland on the Arctic front.Not a trace of the self-pity and &quot;look what the Allies did&quot; that you find in some accounts of this nature, but also shows that not everyone in an SS uniform was a bloodthirsty monster. A view some will not approve of."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"This book will probably be a disappointment if you are looking for shoot-em-up fear-validating accounts of German warfare. It is a book that is more introspective than any other war book I have read. Those that are in to the deeper aspects of war will find this a very interesting read. Voss does a good job of documenting his perspective and gives a great account of the political mindset of the Germans before, during and after the war. From that perspective it is different from most others. Voss has a refreshing abundance of character and honesty and helps the reader see why the German fought so hard even after the end was no longer in doubt. Like I said, if you are looking for the boom-boom of tanks, this will leave you a little unsatisfied. But if you want to look inside the mind of a impressionable young man in caught in the complex dichotomies of Nazi Germany, then this book is a good get."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"This book represents the author's two-fold efforts to recount his experiences as a soldier of the Waffen SS in WWII, and to explain how he and his comrades fought bravely and honorably as members of one of the most reviled criminal organizations in history. The author, Johann Voss (not his real name), was a soldier in the 6th SS Mountain Division. He spent most of 1943 and 1944 above the Arctic Circle fighting both the Soviets and the elements. After a long trek through Norway, he spent the last few months of the war on the Western Front and was wounded fighting the Americans, ultimately ending up in a POW camp.As a war memoir, this is a solid, not outstanding, book. There are few accounts in English about the fighting in Finland. The terrain and the weather provided many unique challenges to the combatants. This was an infantry war in which victory or defeat depended largely on the skill and determination of the individual soldiers. There are few tanks and no massive artillery barrages more common in the great battles fought further south. Mr. Voss describes the campaigns in which he participated, including the battle for Sennozero, the declaration of war on Germany by Finland, and the retreat through Norway. Voss describes the beauty of the taiga, and often references the writings of Hamsun. He was apparently inspired to serve in the Arctic in part based on reading Hamsun. Voss writes with an engaging style, and describes both his personal perspective and the \`big-picture' view. Maps are liberally interspersed through the text clearly place the cities, landmarks, and combat formations. This is not a complete account of the campaigns in the Arctic (if you are looking for this, try Earl Ziemke's \`The German Northern Theater of Operations 1940-1945'), but limited to the campaigns and battles in which Voss was an eyewitness/participant.For a 21st century reader, it is the second aspect of this book that is the more interesting. The conventional view of the German soldier generally, and the soldiers of the Waffen-SS in particular, is that they were all racist fanatics fighting an aggressive war for a lunatic. Voss makes it clear that the viewpoint of most of the German soldiers (Heer or SS) at the time was somewhat more nuanced and complex. Voss claims to have joined the SS largely out of patriotic motives, and that many of his comrades in arms were fighting (and dying) for the sames things that soldiers fight for today: duty to their people, patriotic responibility to their country and their government. Voss claims that if the German people knew the extent of the crimes of their government, they would not have fought, and that although the SS as an institution committed many of the most heinous crimes of the 20th century, neither he nor his comrades were directly involved and that his (and that of his comrades) experience in the Waffen-SS was honorable. The veracity of these statements is, of course, impossible to assess in isolation, Mr. Voss's assertions don't make them truisms, but they are not obviously false either. Mr. Voss tries to explain that the SS trooper (and by inference the German soldier more generally) often possessed the best qualities of a soldier, including bravery, endurance, and loyalty, not just those qualities of a war criminal. This view goes a long way toward explaining why the German Army continued to fight as a coherent force until the last month of the war when it was clear to everyone by late 1943 that they were going to lose. It also suggests that organizations, governments, or political movements that are self-evidently evil when viewed with historical perspective may not have appeared as such to the participants at the time. In any case, Mr. Voss was fortunate that he did not serve with the SS further south. He may well have had a different view of the SS.If you are tired of reading the revisionist novels of Stephen Ambrose, and are looking for a thoughtful, nuanced war memoir by a German soldier of WWII, this may be exactly what you are looking for."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"The title of the book explains much of what you will read. A member of a Waffen SS Mountain unit fighting against the Soviets on the Finland border, the author gives a riveting account of his experiences in the dense forests of the north. As the tide of battle turns against Germany, his unit is forced to retreat into Norway. Once back in Germany they are thrown against the overwhelming Allied invasion, and fight their last stand in the Hertgen Forest.More than just a war epic, this book gives an in depth look into the soul of a warrior who cared deeply for his Kameraden and is troubled by the cause which he and so many of his countrymen sacrificed so much for."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"The withdrawal of German SS troops from Finland to Denmark, when the Finns ended their resistance to Soviet pressure, is fairly well known. The impossibly short timetable the Germans were given to withdraw, Finnish attacks on withdrawing German forces, and the long retreat to northern Norway are not so well known. The author describes \\"his\\" campaign from the viewpoint of a well-trained, highly-motivated, teenage soldier who walked and fought all the way as a member of an SS mountain division. Later, as a prisoner of war, he was never identified as a member of, and so escaped the harsh treatment reserved for, the Waffen SS. Surprisingly, he became a clerk for an American war crimes tribunal member at Nuremberg. The author examines in this book the question of Waffen-SS war-crimes guilt, and so, justifiably from his position of relative innocence, joins an emerging genre that seems to attempt to rehabilitate the Waffen SS. Interestingly, he pursued a career at law, post war. This book suggests a separate legal and moral niche for the Waffen SS who were indeed \\"just soldiers, too\\", which, at Nuremberg, was judged not to be the case."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"This book is quite a read. I found it eye-opening, interesting and even a bit entertaining. I thought it was great how the author tells his story, alternating between his time in the field and his time in captivity. It made for an almost movie-like experience. I also found the authors thoughts, upon learning of the Holocaust, and his reactions and feelings on the subject, were quite interesting. Foremost being, he felt the name and image of the elite Waffen SS was soiled by Nazi goons.I highly recommend this book. I've read several first-person memoir type accounts, and this is by far the best I've read so far."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"This is a very good book, and I do recommend it. However it is more about one soldier's experience in war, not, I feel, about his awakening conscience.

I do recommend it, but caution that it isn't all that it's subtitle says it is."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"A young boy comes of age during the years of dark war clouds forming over Europe. Coming to a decision he joins a unit of the Waffen-SS.This is a very well written book, and it is written in a timely manner so as to draw upon fresh mental images and memories: of what was happening in the whirlwind that turned into a giant Tornado that sucked up everything into its path and left death, destruction and waste in its wake.It is also a story of how some of these soldiers that survived came to view things in a different light: The intentional darkness cast over certain activities cloaked the actions to destroy entire races and ethnic groups.The reader will be caught up in fire fights, survival in extreme battlefield conditions that seems nearly impossible to overcome only to have allies turn upon those that fought side by side with them.This is a great read for anyone wanting the truth and the inside scoop on what these men and women thought, did and went through.Dreams in Blue: \\"The Real Police\\""},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"Johan Voss's story is interesting in its sheer typicality. He grew up in an intellectual middle-class family which held varying opinions on Hitler, from fanatical enthusiasm to seditious contempt. As a teen, he became somewhat enrapt with the idea of the Waffen-SS, which was marketed not as a racial elite but as a brotherhood dedicated to protecting Europe from Soviet Communism. Seeing in the concept the seeds of a United Europe (divisions of Waffen-SS were recruited from everything from Danes to Frenchmen to Cossacks and Muslim Croatians), Voss joined up, and being from a mountainous area, was assigned to the 6th SS Mountain Division \\"Nord.\\"\\"Nord\\" spent most of its service fighting on the forgotten sector of the Eastern front - the Russian-Finnish border. Voss served in the frozen wastes of the Arctic Circle until late 1944, when the deteriorating military situation caused Finland to turn against Germany - indeed, the book's toughest emotional passages deal with the bitterness of the Germans as they are forced to march a thousand miles through the snow to Norway. After that, the division was sent to France to fight in the \\"Second Battle of the Bulge\\" - Himmler's assault into Alsace in the closing days of 1944. It was during this chaotic battle that Voss was captured by Americans and first had to hide his SS identity. In the prison camps he was confronted with evidence of Nazi atrocities and engaged in lengthly and painful self-examination about the Waffen-SS and his role in it, hence the \\"conscience\\" part of the title.EDELWEISS is not the best WW 2 memior I've read. It moves a bit slowly, and Voss is almost too thoughtful for his own good; his constant introspection is interesting in and of itself but drags down the narrative. But it is a refreshingly bold and important book. Because he falls short of complete repudiation of the organization, seeing himself as both the facilitator of crime and a victim of it, Voss' memior is somewhat controversial. Like many other W/SS vets, he is willing to accept his share of responsibility for the actions of Nazi Germany, but refuses to serve as the \\"alibi of a nation\\", merely because he wore SS runes and not Army litzen on his collar. By refusing to be lumped in with the black-clad Political SS and the Death's Head troopers who staffed the concentration camps, Voss puts himself at odds with everyone, inside and outside of Germany, who wants him to admit that he is criminal and keep any non-criminal exploits to himself. Luckily for history, he didn't take their advice."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"I purchased this book to help me understand the otherside of WWII. I was curious to see how the war was witnessed through the eyes of the defeated.Voss does a good job with his descriptions of life in the SS. I believe that he goes a bit far though with trying to persuad the reader that the SS was not the criminal gang portrayed at the Nuernberg trials. Every Officer was excellent and every soldier was honorable. Anyone with military experience knows that no unit has perfect sodiers and officers. I can understand and respect that he wants to protect the honor of his fallen friends. He also tries to portray the unit as humanitarian when they hand out what few rations they have to American POWs since they fought so bravely against his unit. Or when they bury church bells in Finland to \\"protect\\" them from the advancing Russian Army. Again these stories seem to embelish upon his recollections of the war.I find a common thread within the book, that is a patriotic, selfless, honorable individual who did what he felt was right given the information provided to him from his government. Voss does note that he sees a box car filled with people but states he was ignorant as to where they were going. He never takes this any further. This could be attributed to his youth, military training not to ask questions, or ignorance is bliss. If on the otherhand Voss is telling the truth and he was a simple soldier doing what he felt was right then it makes it difficult to think of the whole German Army as a simple killing machine. He was just a person who wanted to do what was right and may or may not have been ignorant of the atrocitties his government was commiting. But as the story goes on you find Voss not fighting for Hitler but instead for his own survival and his comrades around him. Maybe it is a good thing to put a human face on the Axis soldier.I would highly recommend this book along with the Forgotten Soldier, In Deadly Combat, and Seven Days in January."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"Black Edelweiss is truly a superb book which details the fighting conditions in northern Finland that the 6th Waffen-SS Mountain Division Nord experienced. The book starts out a bit slow from a &#34;blood and guts&#34; perspective, but is well worth reading, as it helps one realize that many of the German soldiers - even those that fought in the Waffen-SS - were as ordinary and &#34;normal&#34; as the soldiers from other nations. The description of mules carrying ammunition to the front lines and dead soldiers' bodies to the rear lines, of the frigid fighting conditions, of German patrols carrying extra skis on prisoner acquisition missions so that the prisoners could ski back with the German patrols to the German lines - makes you feel as if you are fighting right alongside the Germans. This book is a must read not only for anyone wishing to more deeply understand fighting conditions in the north but also for anyone with an open mind willing to concede that there are two sides to every coin."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"This is an outstanding book both in it's style and in it's actual presentation.

However, having just read an American classic on the war against Japan that some say is the best American war memoir and rigorously honest, in comparison the author of Black Edelweiss falls far short of moral honesty. The author of \\"The Old Breed\\" examines repeatedly the hate that the American Marines especially had for the Japanese and why, and describes the atrocities committed by both sides which would fall into the most extreme criminal conduct.This moral honesty is once again missing from an account of a German soldier who fought on the Eastern Front, the front that in fact had the worst atrocities of the European war as committed by both Germany and Russia. Yet the only brutality reported by the author was a mild beating given to a Jewish laborer by a soldier from a German Army guard unit than his unit rescued!The author undoubtedly sanitizes his account of the fighting in his unit. There is no talk of taking no prisoners, no account of the shooting of wounded Russians or even of the Russians shooting wounded Germans. The editorializing by the author takes up way too much of the book, the conditions preceding his volunteering for the Waffen-ss, and his imprisonment by the Americans. In his musing, however, he inadvertently illustrates why most German's then and are still clueless about their culpability in the atrocities that the German Army and police forces committed in the name of the German nation.In the lead up to the authors volunteering, there are hints that something is wrong in the war, that the Waffen-ss is involved in something that the author should not get involved in. Yet no one will say what it is . . . a complete lack of intellectual and moral honesty among the common people of Germany, specifically those who surrounded the author. Like the author, the people of Germany chose not to investigate further the hints that were clearly there. There were a determined few Germans who did and were of course immediately imprisoned and finally executed.It has been said, \\"Where did the German's think all those thousands and thousands of Jews, political prisoners, gypsies and others that were rounded up at night going during the five years of the war.\\" Because they sure didn't come back. The key is that a great many German people were in a position to know, and could have known if they were so inclined to find out the horrible atrocities that were being committed. It was not a select few of the Waffen-ss or sd. The common army units were murdering men, women and children too. It is all documented.The denial then and the denial that continues is due to moral cowardice, and of NOT wanting to know. It was and still is in the German character to see themselves as victims, and consequently to look to others to blame for the basic character flaws that are ubiquitous in the German people even today. This point that I make is well documented in books and studies if any of you want to research this.

With pride, Voss wears the proud roons of an elite Nordic mountaineer unit fighting the Russians at the Artic Circle in Finland. His experiences and combat are honorable conflicts of WWII.Johann Voss never participated in the mass killings and atrocities that many other SS units incurred on the Eastern Front in Poland, Belarus and Russia. His unit fought the conventional war on honorable terms in both the Finland Nordic country and on the Western Front against the Americans.After being forced out of Finland, Voss continued to fight with the SS troops called the Black Edelweiss against the Americans. Greatly outnumbered by the superior American Army, Voss saw the destruction of his battalion and was captured as a POW.Somewhat startled by his circumstances, Voss finds out that Germany has lost the war and by association as a member of the SS he is a \\"gangster of an outlaw organization.\\" Finding this as a shock, Voss tries to explain his reasoning and purpose of volunteering for the SS. It becomes evident that Voss struggles with what the war and the SS were all about.As an aside, many of the battle scenes and descriptions were truly painted to haunt the reader. One such instance was an American lieutenant colonel rescuing stranded and wounded Americans right under the nose of the SS. Such a brave act that in deference to such bravery the \\"gangster outlaws\\" did not shoot at him.I can entirely relate with Voss. I too returned from an unpopular war in Vietnam. I too was ostracized and referred to as a \\"baby killer.\\" Voss like I acted honorably and should never be identified as an active member of a \\"gangster or baby killer organization.\\"If one's heart is good even though other people are doing wrong, please don't hold this author responsible.This memoir is both honest and needed to explain the psyche of the German soldiers mind.

A must read."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"I purchased this book as a source to peek into the mind of a Waffen SS soldier and determine whether his wartime experience supported the ridiculous stereotype handed down on these men over the decade: ruthless, evil killers fueled by nothing but pure hate. Sure, there is no shortage of evidence to the horrors that numerous members of the Third Reich inflicted upon Europe, but I've always found it naive to assume that those committing such atrocities represented even a majority of the men serving in the German military machine (like i don't view those responsible for Abu Graib or the My Lai Massacre representing the entire US Army).I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with this memoir and finished it with a belief that Johann Voss, even as a member of the Waffen SS, seemed to be no different than any American soldier in the way he viewed and conducted his military experience ... doing his job and defending his country, politics aside.Almost half of this book focuses on the author's life before joining the military. His childhood and home life were not rife with a fanatical devotion to all-things-Hitler and Nazi ideals, but more on the collective strength on each family member's individualism (from the Hitler-supporting sister to the outspoken anti-Hitler uncle). If anything, his time prior to joining the military was more about enjoying his youth, even with his father fighting with the German Army on the Eastern Front. His decision to join the Waffen SS was not a political decision, but more that of pride and personal challenge ... much akin to an American's desire to belong to the Rangers or SEALs.Voss' duty in the northern sector of the Eastern Front near the end of the war gives the reader a glimpse into a theatre of conflict pretty much ignored. The combat he describes is not long and glorious, but short, hectic and blurry. Most of his military experience is about coping with deplorable winter conditions than combat. He describes his feelings about his former \\"brothers in arms\\" (the Finns) joining the ranks of the Soviets with understanding ... even through his unit's arduous retreat through difficult terrain and sub-zero weather to escape the Finns. The recollection of his final combat experience against Americans are effectively and vividly descriptive ... the reader can easily visualize the fighting. No medals, no glory, no hatred ... Voss portrays himself as a nothing more or less than a citizen soldier. Through the course of the book, he introduces us to individuals that have varying degrees of impact on him: family members, friends and comrades. By the end of the book, most all have been killed. As a POW he is faced with the atrocities leveled against the Waffen SS and must shamefully accept it's legacy. Nowhere in the book does Voss describe his unit participating in atrocities, but it is left to the reader to determine whether the author's wartime experience was \\"honorable\\" ... which is what I concluded.Since the author wrote his memoirs during his stint as a POW, the book intermittently jumps from his recollection of events to \\"current\\" time (as a POW). Although that may be an annoyance to some, the breaks to his status as a POW give the reader a sense of intently listening to someone telling a story to the point where you feel like your witnessing the events with the author ... only to be brought out of the dream-like state by the phone ringing ... very effective."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"All I can say is this is a rare memoir, an SS mountain trooper's thoughts written right after the war.

At roughly 200 pages, Black Edelweiss may seem short to some, but the moral lessons examined make it seem twice that when read from cover to cover. If you're interested in that war, this book has a unique mood all it's own, and you will not be dissapointed.Although I read it when I was flying across the Pacific and had left Sydney with a bad head cold, I had no trouble grasping the significance of the instances and concepts that were being discussed herein.

This is annoying - the book is brief enough (200 pages) as it is, without having half of it dedicated to a subject the author was not involved and only knows the vaguest of details (written in 1946 while a prisoner of war).I still give the book itself five stars - the binding is good, the print is legible, the paper clean and crisp, and the images and maps nice and clear - but the content left something to be desired.

A majority of the book is about his time in combat, but there are many pages written while he was in captivity where he is forced to come to grips with what he was a part of. He is unashamed of his participation in the SS, and seems a firm believer that the German cause was just in its battle against Bolshevism. I can not judge him as I did not grow up in 1920/1930s Germany, but as a former soldier who has been in combat, I feel his memories and descriptions of his wartime experiences are genuine. This is a page turner, well written with nothing that will hang up a reader, and a glimpse into the mind of just one man in those conditions in our history.

Specifically, why did so many men volunteer and how was the esprit de corps developed by its elite divisions?Yes, some of those men committed attrocities. But the spate of oral histories coming to light after more than half a century indicate that such conduct was not limited to the SS. We also did some of that. But as they say, \\"history is written by the winners.\\"Voss joined the Waffen-SS in 1943 at age 17 and wrote the notes that were to become _Black Edelweiss_ as a 20 year old PW. As a former Lieutenant in the Jungvolk, he enlisted because he wanted to help his country. His father and older brother were on the Ostfront. His father, a veteran of WWI had also been a Freikorps volunteer. Fighting Bolsheviks was a family tradition. His best friend was transferring from the Wehrmacht (Heer) to the W-SS.Patriotism was a family value, Johann was a patriot.He also volunteered for a mountain division and was posted to the 6th-SS Gebirgs Division \\"Nord,\\" stationed in Soviet Karelia and northern Finland above the Artic Circle. After about year of fighting, allied with the Finns, Finland again capitulated to the Soviets. Nord had to fight its way out of Finland. Voss' 11th Regiment ended up in the lower Vosges near Reipertswiller fighting the US 157th Reg, 16-20 Jan '45. In Feburary he was taken prisoner during an ill advised attack on Lampaden. Many of his comrades died during this fight.That Nord was still undertaking attacks, futile as they were, was due to the comradeship found in good outfits, usually concomitant with good NCO and Officer leadership.So what prompted him to write his memoirs as a 20 year old PW? The JAG Captain he worked for as a clerk/translator (he also spoke French), was the recipient of photographs from the concentration camps. Voss was horrified by these photos. He had not joined for that reason, nor would his family have condoned such behavior. The camps were thought by the average German to be work camps.As a point of information, combat Waffen-SS units were not posted to these camps. Yes, before the SS-Totenkopf was placed under Army control after the Polish campaign, the SSTK served as Einsatzgruppen behind the lines during that campaign. Regardless, there were only a small number of W-SS, usually convalescing from war wounds, who saw duty as guards.About a month after the trials at Nurnburg began (which was why the JAG had the photos), the International Military Tribunal ruled that the Waffen-SS, as part of the Allgemeine SS, was guilty of being a criminal organization. \\"So, under the law of the victors, the volunteers were a gang of criminals.\\"_Black Edelweiss_ is a must read for persons curious about World War II and for that matter, curious about German culture.Keith Bonn's Aberjona Press has done another amazing research-wise accurate job!

He saw combat first at the Karelian front in Northern Finland against Soviet Russia and later at the Western front against the Americans and their allies. The memoir is the honest and accurate account of a brave soldier who sincerely albeit erroneously believed that he was fighting for a just and noble cause. It deals as much with the struggle between opposing armies which took place on the battle field as with the struggle between supposed duty and nagging doubt which took place in the author's mind.I can attest to the honesty and accuracy of the author's account because I too was a German soldier and had similar experiences which I reported in my book \\"A Mind in Prison\\" (Potomac Books, Washington D.C., 2000). I also fought in Finland though not in Karelia but north of it directly at the Arctic Ocean. Having been equally inexperienced and idealistic as the author of \\"Black Edelweiss,\\" I volunteered for military service in 1939 at the age of eighteen and went through the same struggle of the mind between supposed duty and doubt.While reading \\"Black Edelweiss\\" I sometimes had the feeling that the author described my own experience. It was the same enemy, the same fight, the same landscape, the same cold, the same makeshift bunkers, the same insufficient rations, the same exhaustion, the same endless winter-night, and the same northern lights. Maybe the author experienced even harder fighting than I did, because the Waffen-SS was an elite corps which was always deployed where the fighting was the hardest. Nevertheless, I know how it was, and I have no doubt that the author is telling the truth.When Finland surrendered in September 1944, the German troops in Finland began a long retreat to Norway, avoiding neutral Sweden. The author's SS-unit marched from the area East of Rovaniemy (the capital of Lapland) to the area of Tromsoe in Northern Norway and from there to a sea-port where they could embark on a troop transporter to Germany where they were urgently needed. My military unit took the northernmost route from Kirkenes to Hammerfest where we embarked on a troop transporter which took us to Narvik. Both operationswere exceedingly exhausting marches through the Artic night.Whereas my unit remained in Narvik till the end of the war, the author's unit was moved to the Western front which in early 1945 was already within Germany's borders. There they offered the last resistance to an enemy which was far superior in terms of numbers and material. They fought as bravely as usual but after heavy losses finally surrendered, landing the author in an American prisoner of war camp.The book is well written and documented with rare photos from the war in the Arctic. Since the author wrote his book immediately after the war while still being a prisoner of war, while I wrote my book more than fifty years later, the author does not completely come to terms with his fight for a criminal regime and with the hardships of a prisoner of war stemming from the collective accusations against the SS as a whole, whereas I had the advantage of having gained a soothing distance from the tragedy of WWII. But this difference diminishes neither his book nor mine. Each in its own way is a testimony before the court of history about brave young men who thought that they were doing their patriotic duty while in reality they were serving evil. The reader be the judge."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"I was born in 1948, two years after the author completed the book on hisexperience in the Waffen-SS during World War II and his slow realizationthat the government he was fighting for and believed in was alsoresponsible for the deprivation and murder of millions of innocenthumans. My experience growing up in post war America, with a fatherthat had fought Germany in this war, led me to believe the SSrepresented the lowest form of human behavior and no member could everbe redeemed.This belief is true enough for those who perpetrated the cruel andhideous treatment of Jews, Gypsies and even some German children (see, for example, Witnesses of War by N. Stargardt) but the author presents another story that differs from what I was led to believe, notably, that Germany's motive for starting World War II was world domination by the superior German race.But was there another motivation? The author's well written story suggests that Bolshevism and its threat to German values was the primary reason for the war, that this was a noble cause, that the threat was so great that a pre-emptive strike was necessary and that in some (perhaps many) German military units a high sense of duty to their families and loyalty to there fellow soldiers prevailed. The several philosophical discussions with friends leading the author to reevaluate his beliefs are quite revealing and his description of his captivity and treatment by the American military is most interesting.You may judge for yourself what was the truth during this period ofworld history (or for that matter today) but the author's schoolmasterseems to have captured the operational definition of truth during anywar when he said \\"Truth is whatever is efficacious.\\""},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"Black Edelweiss is a moving account of one soldier's experience as a member of the Waffen-SS. Coming from a relatively pleasant and priveleged upbringing, Voss recounts his youthful idealism, and his desire to serve his country. This, along with his admiration of the many soldiers he personally knew, compelled him to join the Waffen-SS. Serving mainly in Finland and Northwestern Russia, Voss claims to have had no first-hand experience of the Holocaust or other atrocities that are commonly attributed to the SS. In hindsight, he does admit to witnessing suspicious activities, but it was only after the war when he fully realized the horrific crimes committed by men who wore the same uniform as himself. His account confirms that many SS units were strictly elite combat units, and not involved in the extermination of civilians. Like many other former SS soldiers, Voss and his comrades felt that they were fighting to defend Europe from bolshevism. Taken at face value, I can certainly sympathize with this. Voss expresses his utter shock and abhorrence at the news of the Holocaust. He views this as completely antithetical to the values and honor he and his comrades represented as members of the elite SS. I've read at least a half-dozen German WWII memoirs and I would rank 'Black Edelweiss' in the top 3 along with 'Soldat' by Siegfried Knappe, and 'The Forgotten Soldier' by Guy Sajer(even with the controversy). This is a very personal account, imbued with the author's conscience and idealistic views. Thankfully, it does not get bogged down with too many tedious military details like some war memoirs tend to do. Voss is extremely eloquent and sincere and he exudes a sense of honor and idealism that I can't help but admire."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"Having a library of approx 250+ books on WWII I have seen my share of good and bad memoirs. Black Edelweiss is definately one of the good ones. Though a short read, I found it full of everything I was looking for. Combat description, the soldiers thoughts, etc. and could not stop reading the book.The chapters begin with the soldier (Voss) and his training, reasons for joining the SS and carry on to his posting up North. I found this part of the book interesting as there are not that many memoirs that deal with battles up in Nothern Europe. This was a welcome change to most German memoirs out there that deal with the larger grinding campaign battles. The chapters end with battles against the Americans (good combat description) and his ultimate capture.There was none of the \\"why us\\" in this book, but just a combat soldier reflecting on his part in WWII.There are only a few pictures, but the maps are easy to follow, well done and well researched...you don't have to be a hardcore researcher to understand them.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"I have read several German memoirs - Soldat, The Forgotten Soldier, In Deadly Combat - plus several other studies of the Waffen SS, and I'd say this book ranks as good or better than any of those in terms of readability, insight, and thoughtfulness. Combat memoirs, whether American or German (&quot;If You Survive&quot; and &quot;Company Commander&quot; come to mind on the American side) can often become a series of descriptions of small unit battles that, while representing the thrust of the book, can be difficult to follow, or can have the perverse affect of stripping the humanity from the narrative. In the case of German memoirs, I have found as an English reader that the formal language in the translations can often compound that affect.Regardless, the story in Black Edelweis, of a patriotic German who joins the Waffen SS late in the war, is outstanding at painting a picture of pre-war Germany through the eyes of the authors' family, the comradeship that held the German army, the horror as he discovers after the war the deeds of his countrymen in regard to The Holocaust, and the patriotism and pride that the author stills feels for his unit and the way he served. I would highly recommend it to students of the German side of World War II, and would recommend it as an outstanding introduction for history readers who have never read a German memoir to the genre. It is easy to read, enjoyable, and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"As a casual World War II history buff who has read a number of books about the Waffen SS written from the distant perspective of historians, I was looking forward to this memoir of a young SS trooper written shortly after the conclusion of the war. Unfortunately, Black Edelweiss doesn't quite deliver all that it promises.This relatively short book chronicles the family background, formative teenage years and military service of the author. Voss comes across as a pleasant young man, largely removed from the coarser aspects of Nazi Germany and National Socialism. He joins the Waffen SS not out of any ideological fervor but rather because he naively subscribes to the view that it is his duty as both a good German citizen and as a member of the larger Western European community to combat the Bolshevist threat. Voss is ultimately assigned to the Nord Division and posted to Finland where he sees a modest amount of combat before returning to Germany where he is ultimately captured by the Allies.Quite frankly, I did not find the author to be nearly as introspective as some of the reviews suggest. Although open and candid, Voss rarely has anything truly profound or of great import to say. Because he served in Finland, he was not forced to confront firsthand any of the atrocities committed by his comrades stationed either at home or on the Eastern Front. It is only after the war, while in captivity, that Voss is exposed to the horrors of the Einsatzgruppen and death camps. It bears noting that Voss was apparently not subjected to combat as brutal and horrific as that experienced by many of his comrades on the Eastern Front. Perhaps for these reasons, Voss' account is often far less poignant and compelling than those of some other German soldiers such as Guy Sajer (Forgotten Soldier). Same is not intended as a criticism of either Voss or his military service - merely an observation that his perspective is somewhat limited.Despite my reservations, Black Edelweiss remains an interesting read that I would recommend to any student of either World War II or the Waffen SS."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"Black Edelweiss (by Johann Voss) is the story of a young German who served his country in WWII by fighting in the 6th SS Mountain Division. While young Voss did serve in an SS unit, his story is not that of a fanatical Nazi, but rather that of a young person who wants to serve his country in the best possible way.Johann Voss wrote Black Edelweiss while he was held captive by the Americans. Rather than being a historical book told after many years have passed, Black Edelweiss is Johann's way of confronting his war experiences after learning of the atrocities other SS units had committed. In reviewing what lead him to his current position, Johann tells us about his family, what's made him the way he is and what drives him to join the SS (it was communism that did). Having completed training, Johann then tells us about war on the Northern front (his unit fought in Northern Finland), what happens to his unit once the Finn's make peace with the Russians, and fighting against the Americans. All throughout the book Johann provides us with excellent descriptions of his thoughts, observations, and feelings.Black Edelweiss is not an attempt by Johann to excuses himself for anything he'd done during the war, nor the men he served with. It's told with the brutal truth of a person who's trying to understand why he and the men he served with were criminals. This is brutal look at one's own past and coming to grips with what a nation has done. My overall review, read it!

The first part is about his childhood and how his family background shaped his character and led him to join the dreaded Waffen SS in 1942. His combat experience in the ranks of the elite 6th SS Gebirgsdivision \\"Nord\\" is recounted in fantastic descriptions as well as the loss of friends and gallant officers. September 1944 marked the beginning of a hard adventure for Voss's division as Finland capitluated and the unit was forced to retrat across central Finland towards northern Norway. The description of the terrible battles is excellent, and one can not avoid the thought that war produces many dramas on the human level and some unexpected turns of luck. The first days of 1945 found Voss and his comrades fighting against US troops in the Vosges Mountains and the battles with this new, well supplied and brave enemy were very hard indeed. The book is one of the best about World War II on the soldier level and is highly recommended for anyone who wants to get a feeling of the brutal battle conditions of the Arctic."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"I found \\"Black Edelweiss\\" to be a very well written and balanced book by a member of the 6th SS Mountain Division \\"Nord\\". The author describes his pre military life, and his decision to join the Waffen SS. Mr. Voss' story is a must for the student for WWII history, and especially one from the view point of a member of the 6th SS Mountain Division. This is a highly recommended book!"},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"This book was a real eye opener for me, especially because my father was in the WAFFEN ss .

Very insightful and I felt that I lived vicariously through the author's experiences.

The allies, being the victors of WW2, have long held sway at the foremost position of military history that historians choose to cover. That, coupled with the supposed \\"shame\\" of being a defeated nation of National Socialists kept WW2 German soldiers impressions of \\"Their War\\" out of the mainstream.Johann Voss's book was written in US military captivity in late 45 and through 46, being written just after the war this is an immediate and raw book, full of emotional turmoil but also stoicism and bravery.Voss's clarity of view into the situation (the criminalization and shaming of the Waffen SS as the FIGHTING arm of the SS)is shocking and leads to empathy of a man who lost everything in the course of combat in the Arctic and then to the Allies, due to the fact that the Nuremberg Trials branded his Unit a criminal organisation.This summation does not make me worse for empathy for a generation of supposed criminals, It makes me stronger in believing they, as soldiers, did their job, regardless of their personal misgivings or foreboding and served their country. However misguided that may be in the eyes of those on the Allied side.Read this book and tell me all of those who served Germany or all those who donned the SS Runes were evil.I will not believe it."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"Great read for a student of military history or one who is interested in how it is in combat. Unfortunately, guys like this dont live in Europa anymore they have passed on :-( Every European should read this one."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"Easy read although lacking a little more in-depth analysis and rationalisation than I had hoped. However, overall I enjoyed it as it showed the point-of-view from a German soldier who was a member of the SS - you don't get that often. Two things stick in my mind, the bulldozing of the German cemetery in Finland and the waste of those young men's lifes, and the Epilogue, ending with \\"All this is looked upon by the veterans with a calm and unwavering mind\\". Soldiers are soldiers and they do what is asked of them, what they have been told is true even if it is not - as the US soldiers have done in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan and soldiers the world over will do again and again and again.The book goes some way to providing me a better understanding to the question why the Germans let it happen - because they were good Germans. They believed in their country and what they were doing, righting the wrongs of WWI, territorial expansion (creating a great empire which was the norm of European powers for the previous 500+ years) and destroying Bolshevism but they ignored the more unsavoury aspects of the Nazi regime - the extermination of the Jews, Gypsies, gays and the mentally impaired. Could there be no more pure example of the greater good and utilitarianism??? In hindsight they were wrong and they paid the price but at the end of the day the majority of Germans, and I believe the majority of the Waffen SS, did it because they thought it was for the greater good."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"This book is worth reading, but it's not a book that you cannot put down.Alot of politics discussed... If you want an exciting book to read, read \\"the forgotten soldier.\\" There is controversy about the book.. whether it is a work of fiction.. maybe because it is so exciting. Not exciting , but very interesting. Exciting is the wrong word. But it is a book I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"This is a good read and sounds genuine but there might be a lot of fake memoirs on the subject. The SS men who intended to kill Bolsheviks were to be admired not condemned. Sadly, the best genes in the world were destroyed in those horrors and lesser genes survived to point fingers after the real holocaust which was the immolation of the Waffen SS."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"Among five German memoirs of WWII that I've read, this was not one of my favorites. Still, it holds interest and high value towards understanding several unique elements of the German soldier's experience in WW2 that was a worthwhile but slow read.One is the obvious background and substantial detail that our author/soldier fills in regarding the Wafen-SS. He writes from an immediate post-war perspective with understandable sensitivity towards a general Allied-population view that 'all SS were the notorious Jew-hunting killers'. The entire book, as a matter of fact, goes into great detail showing how much of the Wafen-SS (the military arm of the SS) went through the war serving at the front with admirable skill without any knowledge of the atrocities committed by the other 'deaths-head' units within the SS. While I already knew this in general, the author provides perspective about the Waffen-SS that goes beyond the battlefield, which I appreciated.The immediate post-war perspective of an 'inmate' (he writes this book while in POW custody)gives the entire story a defensive air, as if he is continually justifying 'why' he fought for Germany and why he proudly served in the elite Waffen-SS. He is obviously disturbed by the US camp administrators singling out any SS soldiers for harder time within the camp. He therefore weaves personal justification for his actions throughout the stories he tells. By the end of the book he has played this role out too well, and you wonder if he has shaped any of the story to fit this accountability theme.Compared to the other autobiographies I've read, our author sees much less battle-action. He is assigned to Finland, which Nazi Germany allied with against the Soviets. The outpost he was assigned to was relatively quiet and remote, with the warfare only coming in spurts along a fairly static front. When it does occur it is as brutal as any other but stays confined to a small area of the map (I found the maps poor and confusing). It is only towards the end of the war as his unit retreats up along the Swedish border into northern Norway does one read more robust accounts of battle action as his units fight numerous rear-gaurd battles.Another unique aspect is the substantial time our author devotes to non-battle experiences. We see a good deal of self-analysis and self-justification, the book going into detail about the author's life pre-war, giving background about his family, siblings, and side tangents about their decisions and directions taken during this tumultous time for Germany, including his motivations for joining the SS. If you are a student of history in general you will find these parts of the book (which he shifts back to several times) very interesting. If you read military autobiographies more to learn what it was like on the battlefield, during training or convalesence during injuries, this book will seem very slow paced at many points, especially as he goes into details regarding his family. Books like Soldat and Blood Red Snow excel as examples of the the latter type of war memoir which makes them fast-paced and are my preferred type, hence my mid-level rating."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"All generalizations carry injustice, thinking all men enrolled in the SS were evil would be one of them.Reading Voss I am reminded of Cervantes' life, another man endowed with the valor of a soldier and the literary gift of a man of letters. One has to admire this man, for defending his honor and that of many SS soldiers fallen who had nothing to do with the crimes committed by others. Whether writing about his life before joining the military or the battles and war experiences he went through, it makes for a great read, no need to be an expert on military issues.Of course if the German leaders weren't the Nazi criminals they were, they should have been fighting -along with the Americans- the commies, those willing slaves of the state and God-haters. That should have been the general cause, and was indeed the cause fought for by many like author Voss.I am just amazed at this man, for his culture and valor."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"The story is wonderfully told of how a German felt about fighting for his country and what it was like to fight in the Artic for the Waffen SS. Read Seven Days in January: With the 6th SS-Mountain Division in Operation NORDWIND, it is a good compliment to this book."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"\\"Black Edelweiss\\" is a thought-provoking memoir by a machinegunner in a Waffen-SS mountain/Alpine division. (The \\"black\\" in the title refers to the black uniforms of the SS. \\"Edelweiss\\" refers to a mountain/Alpine flower used as a symbol by German and Austrian mountain troops.)The book follows the author from his experiences as a 13-year old boy in Nazi Germany, to the time he volunteered for the Waffen-SS at the age of 17 in 1943, to his training as an SS soldier, to his combat experiences in World War II, to his capture by the Americans as a prisoner of war in 1945, to his discovery of the atrocities of other SS in concentration camps, and to his release in December 1946.Several things set this memoir apart as an outstanding addition to the history of World War II in Europe.One of the things that sets this memoir apart is that it is an engaging first-hand account of how German soldiers interacted, not only with each other as Kameraden, but also their officers, their enemies on the battlefield, and civilians.Another is that this memoir was written in 1945-46, only a few months after the war, so the author was able to recount things from a fresher, and clearer, perspective.A third is the setting of these memoirs, which take place primarily in Soviet Karelia and Finland. The book provides a fascinating, and rare, look into battlefield conditions-operations in arctic temperatures.(Near the conclusion of the war, after the Finns entered into a pact with the Soviets and the Germans were forced to evacuate Finland or face fighting both the Finns - a formidible adversary on its home turf, just ask the Russians - and the Russians, the setting switches to the Third Reich's Western borders.)Finally, the book provides a fascinating insight into the mind of a Waffen-SS soldier who tries to come to grips with the knowledge that because other members of the SS had committed atrocities, every member of the SS, even if, like him, they were not even aware of any atrocities, was branded a war criminal by the Allies and the SS itself condemned as a criminal organization.The underlying, and recurrent, theme of the book is that not all members of the Waffen-SS were evil men, even if in the end they were advancing the cause of evil men. (The author claims he and many others joined the Waffen-SS out of patriotic reasons, to stem the tide of Bolshevism and save not just his country but all of Europe from the Bolshevik menace. This was a common reason many non-Germans volunteered for the Waffen-SS. But in the author's own country, Germany, Bolshevism was often a code word for anti-Semitism and the Nazis taught that the Bolsheviks were sub-humans, \\"Untermensch\\". The author never explains why he failed to pick up on these subtleties in Nazi propaganda, perhaps his youth explains his naivete.)In any event, the book is really a tribute by the author to those fallen members of the Waffen-SS who had nothing to do with any war crimes but who became reviled after the war only because of the atrocities and misdeeds of others and is an attempt to restore the honor of his fallen comrades."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"the truely gripping story of a young German volunteer in the Waffen SS! I can strongly recommend this book as it depicts not only the frontline action but also the background of the author as well as the Waffen SS in a thoughtful and thoroughly interesting way. To some, the Waffe SS is the same as the \\"black\\" SS: Brutal murderers of innocent people who deserve to be put to a gruesome death. By reading this book I hope that this highly generalized view becomes a bit more differentiated. The author is simply a person who believes in fighting for a good cause - not for the Nazis but rather for his homeland and against the threat of bolshevism. Of course, by fighting for Germany he also fought for a regieme that is guilty of having committed some of the ugliest mass murders - however, as opposed to the general view, these things were deliberately kept from becoming known as many would have thought twice before volunteering to fight on the side of such a regieme. The author's reflections on this matter are very interesting!Generally, German accounts of WW II are less sensational as American ones as they don't describe every killing of an opponent in detail. I met some veterans who told me that a soldier's honor simply doesn't allow to talk about their \\"kills\\", which I find quite honorable indeed."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"One of the most important books ever written regarding WW2.

But one can not but admire the comradeship evident within the text. Despite the heroism and extraordinary achievements these German troops achieved, The book clearly shows the futility of war. Also what a loss to Germany so many bright, intelligent and brave young men dying.This book, along side the book 7 Days in January, would be an invaluable text for those engaged in the study of Military history. Also too many texts only show the American side of the conflict. I particularly enjoyed the bloody nose given to the Amercians (as desribed in this text and the aforementioned text) As such i have sent a copy to Westpoint military academy with my compliments !!!!The detailed battle scenes and graphic description's of soliders daily lives. Both in Norway and during and after the battle of the bulge make this a must have text.Very enjoyable reading"},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"Wow. Great book. Nothing combines insight and combat like Black Edelweiss. This guy was a fighter and a thinker. See how a waffen-ss soldat comes to introspective conclusions about his part in Hitler's war and his comrades' part as well. Also shows the varied mind-set and attitudes torward the war from German civilians close to Voss before info about how bad things really were was widely available. Written close to the time it happened so it has a very 1940s feel to it. And as an extra bonus, if you want more statistical type data to go with it, you can read \\"seven days in january\\" along with it which isn't near as introspective but goes into what actually happened on the battlefield, espcially during 1945. You may not like it, but Voss will tell you what he was really thinking as close as any man could get, and it gives you a glimpse of what many \\"realistic\\" Germans must have been going thru when they had to come to terms with what Germany had done."},{"Title":"Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS","review":"Stunning simply because its not a grand strategic memoir but rather the tribulations of one person in one small portion of the war.

Included are the battles that he fought and a very detailed account of his capture by American units towards the end of the war.As this story was written soon after his capture and while he was still a young soldier there is no BS or hindsight thoughts that are usually with books of this nature.I was NOT disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"Bruce Springsteen (Little Books)","review":"This book is rather tiny; you won't find too much information in it.

The question/answer format makes for easy reading--the questions are a paragraph long, and the answers are concise but information-packed. This format has another advantage: when a new trainer wants information on a specific subject (&quot;Is there some strategy for using humour in training?&quot;), he or she need only read one or two pages on that specific question, then get on with the job of preparing for the training. The well-done index makes it simple to find the topics quickly.The appendices are a gold mine for someone new to training. They include resource lists and contact information, an excellent bibliography, and even sample evaluation forms.This book is usable, readable, and the content is dead-on.

Leslie Charles and Chris Clarke-EpsteinThe Instant Trainer, by C. Leslie Charles and Chris Clarke-Epstein is ideal for use with developing and presenting training modules. It provides practical information, advice, tips, and techniques for new trainers. The content is relevant and valuable to a trainer who does not have experience in the field. My assessment of the material is a positive one. The material is sensible, easily understood, and organized clearly. There is enough information without the reader being overwhelmed. The real-life examples help interpret and reinforce pivotal concepts. The topics covered are fundamental to training, but important issues that might be less obvious to a novice are addresses from a seasoned trainer's perspective. My only negative critique is that in the second half of the book, the pretend \\"advice letters\\" were over used. Key points were presented in the letters, and there were just too many of them. Cutting down their frequency and only using them to reinforce and reiterate key ideas would have been more effective. The focuses of The Instant Trainer can be broken into four components: FAQ's, techniques, advice, and tools. The FAQ issues cover such issues as, what is in a training session, how to get people to participate, learning assessments, and what to do about difficult trainees. Access to this information can be very beneficial to a new trainer because without the book, achieving an understanding of these insights would require extensive fieldwork and time-consuming training experience. The training techniques discussed include; teaching methods, learning methods, understanding trainees, paying attention, and incorporating fun into the training session. This information is useful to trainers with limited education in general training principals.The third component of material in The Instant Trainer is the \\"behind-the-scenes advice.\\" These suggestions and recommendations cover everything from presentation delivery skills to identifying and organizing material. Five factors affecting the success of every training session are examined, as well as advise on how to identify early warning signs of disaster or success. The last section of The Instant Trainer deals entirely with providing the reader with training tools. There are checklists for the trainer to use before, during, and after a presentation, and numerous tips on all aspects of audience participation. A list of eleven resources and 45 general training books is included. The section closes with two sample evaluation forms for the trainees to fill out assessing the effectiveness of the trainer and the course. The Instant Trainer is a valuable resource for any new trainer. The practical information and real-life illustrations of the issues discussed make this training and development textbook so effective. I not only appreciated the concise explanation of the fundamental concepts about training, but I also relied on the tips, tools, and advice while developing and presenting my own training module."},{"Title":"Instant Trainer","review":"When my boss came to me and awarded me the mantle of \\"trainer\\" for a huge project rollout at our site, I nearly panicked!

My class feedback has been terrific; some people saying it's one of the best classes they've ever had.

I have also developed friendships with many of these players over the years, and many of them have written books/memoirs regarding their playing days. In speaking with these great pioneers of professional sport, one quickly surmises that certain &quot;stars&quot; spent a fair amount of time embellishing legends and perfecting the art of self-promotion once their playing days ended. A handful have even managed to parlay this ability into a modest supplement to their income via baseball memorabilia shows, and I sincerely hope this trend continues for all who have mastered it.Truthfully however, this group comprises only a tiny percentage of the remaining Negro Leaguers (they're just the loudest, so they garner the most notoriety, I suppose). Should you attend any gathering of former players, you will notice that these &quot;showmen&quot; are generally shunned or otherwise discredited by their peers. That speaks louder than anything I could write here. While these spotlight-lovers' ability to spin a yarn surely brings furthered interest and financial benefit to personal appearances by ALL former players, it likely also speaks to the historical accuracy one can expect from their books.A select few didn't go the Barnum route -- they were who they were, they did what they did, and, while proud of their accomplishments on the diamond with arguably the greatest ballplayers of ANY era, they continued to live as they always had after their baseball careers ended. I am thankful when any player publishes a book, but when one of these select players leaves a record of what they saw, heard, accomplished and/or overcame, free of hyperbole, that book takes on a &quot;treasured&quot; status on my bookshelf. More than just a treasure, CATCHING DREAMS is flat-out the best of the genre. Buy it, read it, and learn something. I wouldn't recommend it this highly if it wasn't this good. It is.Kudos to Paul Bauer for his efforts in faithfully documenting what was said and getting it published. I was fortunate enough to know Mr. Robinson well, and this book is an accurate representation of his character and personality -- it's honest, accurate, and self-effacing. You could waste time and money on lesser efforts by better-known players, or you could read something that captures the feel of a private audience with the author (with the added bonus that it's all TRUE!). I knew him well enough to know. I find myself wishing everyone else could have, too. Trust me. Buy the book.Please find and read books by these authors, too:Wilmer Fields (another honest account), Monte Irvin (yet another honest account), Effa Manley (difficult to find, but remarkable), Kevin Keating/Michael Kolleth (guide to the Negro League autograph collecting hobby, exhaustively researched and thoroughly enlightening), Phil Dixon/Patrick J. Hannigan (also hard to find, but still the best collection of negro league photos ever, and also well-researched)."},{"Title":"Catching Dreams: My Life in the Negro Baseball Leagues (Sports and Entertainment)","review":"Being a baseball history buff (addict) for the past 42 years, I've read just about everything I could get my hands on. I cannot now think of an autobiographical book to which I could attach a higher recommendation that &quot;Catching Dreams&quot; by Frazier &quot;Slow&quot; Robinson. This true gentleman travelled the dusty roads that connected the sites of Negro League baseball during the 30's, 40,s and even the 50's. Although produced by the University of Syracuse press, there is no attempt to make the book erudite or complicate it with an assortment of exotic literary techniques and obscure words. Instead, the publisher and co-author, Paul Bauer have presented the story of Slow Robinson in language truly spoken by the man himself. When you read this book, you will feel that you are seated beside Mr. Robinson as he speaks with words, terms and expressions uniquely those of a man with little formal education, who gained his lessons in life on the fly and had to learn his own language. His ability to recall a voluminous list of names and anecdotal material from his experiences, and to relate them descriptively, suggest a man who would have had little trouble dealing with a formal post-secondary school education. His relationships with such Negro League stalwarts as Josh Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, Leon Day and Satchel Paige are detailed with humour, insight and compassion. He is forthright without offending his old friends, as in Ball Four by Jim Bouton. In his own words, his goal in life was to be remembered as a nice guy; he passed with flying colors.

This is supposedly an edition revised in 1996 (the first Gradon-edition is from 1958), as the general editor assures us in a short preface. The bibliography has been updated (the most recent entry is from 1994, apart from a reference to a 1996 publication in the same series as this &quot;Elene&quot;), but the introduction, the text, and the notes have not. This is a shame, for the last two decades have seen a wealth of new publications (especially literary criticism) on Cynewulf.Thus, we find no mention (not even in the bibliography) of the important work done on the legends of both the Holy Cross and Helena, by Stephan Borgehammar (&quot;How the Holy Cross was Found,&quot; Stockholm 1991) and J.W. Drijvers (&quot;Helena Augusta,&quot; Leiden 1992).Seminal modern articles, by for instance J.P. Hermann, Daniel Calder, Earl Andersen, and Catherine Regan, which discuss the text from a literary more than a textual or historical point of view, are listed in the bibliography but not discussed in the book. I would suggest ordering a copy of Bjork's &quot;Cynewulf: Basic Readings&quot; as a sort of companion volume if you want to know what is currently going on.In all, I have mixed feelings, and this predominates: while this edition is scholarly competent, it seems outdated, and the claim that this is a &quot;revised edition&quot; is substantiated only in the bibliography. It seems to me Exeter missed out on a great opportunity to reissue an edition of a text which is drawing more and more interest among scholars of Old English. Those just getting started in the discipline have a right, I feel, especially considering the current types of interest (structural, poststructural, new historicist, feminist, you name them) in this poetry, to get more out of an edition than what Gradon (and Exeter) offer. Unfortunately, for this text there is no other choice."},{"Title":"Speaking the Gospel Today: A Theology for Evangelism","review":"Robert Kolb, a professor of systematic theology at Concordia Seminary (St. Louis) attempts to present in \\"Speaking the Gospel Today\\" a Lutheran understanding of Evangelism, more specifically, witnessing. The book is divided into four chapters: the first deals with ways God has and has not revealed himeself. The second deals with the effects of sin (it either makes one feel falsely secure or crushes a person), the third deals with they way the Bible describes the person and work of Jesus, and the final chapter deals with the church-building work of the Holy Spirit.This book has a lot of excellent theory on witnessing. Among these are a relyance on the Holy Spirit to work faith in a person even if the \\"delivery\\" of Law and Gospel isn't all that great; Kolb stresses knowledge of the attitude of the one you're witnessing to (hence the constant \\"why do you want to know\\" question); He shows the worldviews held by the faithless as opposed to the faithful worldview; and the list goes on.However, this book has not been rated as high as other books for two basic reasons. The first is Kolb's writing style. The man holds two doctorates and I have a lot of respect for him, but he tends to write over my head. To his credit, he has tried to \\"dumb down\\" the book for people like me, but the end result is a writing style similar to that of a pendulum: he writes like an average Joe, then goes into \\"doctoral thesis\\" mode, followed by \\"average Joe.\\" The end result is that I could never quite get into a rhythm with the book, making Kolb's main points diffucult to find and understand.My second criticism really isn't much of a criticism at all. Aside from asking \\"why do you want to know,\\" Kolb has very few practical, every day witnessing techniques in his book, but rather mountains of theory. Granted, Kolb didn't set out to write a pracitcal manual for witnessing, he did set out to write a high-minded systematic book on witnessing theory. However, the average Christian or pastor probably isn't going to get a lot of \\"bang from his buck\\" on this book. I know I'd have to read this a couple more times to fully understand the main points and sub-points and get it all straight in my mind before I start applying it. The time I would have to spend doing this probably could be invested better elsewhere. Then again, I often find myself on the ignorant side of things, so take what I say with a grain of salt.In all, I would not recommend this book for most people. Graduate students, teachers, church workers with a lot of time on their hands, etc., would most likely really enjoy this book. Pastors might want to give it a shot. For everyone else, I'd explore other options."},{"Title":"Speaking the Gospel Today: A Theology for Evangelism","review":"One of the other reviewers mentioned that this book was a bit \\"over his head\\" or meant for graduate students, not really for the average lay person. While I am a grad student, I respectfully disagree & say any lay person could use this book quite well with just a bit of insider info.:) This book was actually required reading for two of my classes, same quarter. I'll say this though, if I hadn't had the second class, I don't think I'd be writing the same review. The first class had us read through the whole book, straight through, and give a Miniature Guide to Critical Thinking-style (the little blue book) synopsis. The second class generally glossed over all of the other stuff in the book and honed in on Chapter Two and the chart to be found at the end. Using a case study method, the knowledge of the 7 evils were used as \\"diagnostic tools\\" for helping hurting people. For example, a man who has just lost his job could be dealing with estrangement, meaninglessness, etc... This knowledge was then used as a springboard for Christian conversation and witness. Over the course, we all honed our skills and grew in ability to recognize some of the more nuanced impacts of evil and how they could play together in an individual's life.The second course was taught by Dr. Kolb, and I sincerely believe this is how the book should be used.Perhaps it could be improved by some \\"case study\\" examples at the end, but I think Dr. Kolb wanted to be sensitive to the incredibly unique ways evil comes to people, and how dangerous \\"recipe card\\" application of Law & Gospel could be - a definite possibility if he were to include many case studies. Anyway, all the \\"case studies\\" one could ask for are standing around you, waiting for conversation. After the class, the best of what I took away is this: Pray. Be thoughtful. Be genuine. Let God's Word dole out Law, be ready with Gospel, and ALWAYS have a long-term plan of connecting people to a larger Christian community.May the Holy Spirit be with you as you go to speak the Gospel TODAY. :)"},{"Title":"Speaking the Gospel Today: A Theology for Evangelism","review":"Once again, Robert Kolb digs deep into the understanding of the proper relationship between God and His people, and he shares with his readers the fundamentals of why God's people can boldy proclaim the truth of God's love for His creation.

I had read a good deal about Bultmann's thought in other theology books, but this was the first of his actual works I read, and it was certainly worth reading.Bultmann's primary point is that God is not comprehended by thought, but by experience. Rationality is not the tool for approaching God; relational experience is. There are essentially two spheres of existence (derived from Kant); the rational, ordered external world which we understand via science, and the a-rational world including the supernatural (including God, \\"faith knowledge, etc.) which we understand via experience and faith. Jesus was indeed a historical person existing in the first sphere of existence, but he is the Jesus Christ of Christianity only in the second sphere, which has nothing to do with rationality. As Bultmann says, \\" The incomprehensibility of God lies not in the sphere of theorical thought but in the sphere of personal existence\\" (43 [note that I have the 1958 edition]).What does this have to do with mythology? The scriptural account of Jesus is clouded in mythology. The entire world-view of the ancient authors of the New Testament is now rejected as primitive by modern men, so we must go about the task of de-mythologizing (stripping the myth from reality) Jesus to discover who he truly was. This de-mythologizing is Bultmann's proposed hermeneutic method (45). But we are not doing this for knowledge of the first sphere. We want to \\"understand in a new way the concept of knowledge which as a rule does not mean theoretical, rational knowledge, but mystical intuition or vision, a mystical union with Christ\\" (48). Bultmann delves into existential philosophy to tie together this search for mystical truth with the search for self knowledge. He ends up concluding that \\"the question of God and the question of myself are identical\\" (53). We study history (in this case, we de-mythologize New Testament history) to \\"gain an understanding of the possibilities of human life and thereby of the possibilities of my own life. The ultimate reason for studying history is to become conscious of the possibilities of human existence\\" (53).Of course, since all of this is happenining in the non-objective, a-rational second sphere of existence, we have nothing even resembling certainty. We can literally have no rational reason whatsoever for believing what we do about what is going in the realm of faith, for the two spheres of existence are utterly divided. This also means that God cannot be acting in human history, for God is of the second sphere and human history (or natural history) is of the first sphere. Of course, Bultmann needs God to be acting in some way to justify even his extremely liberal version of Christianity, so he finds his solution in a very unconvincince explanation; God acts \\"within\\" worldly events, not actually changing anything or effecting anything. As he says, \\"The thought of the action of God as an unworldy and transcendent action can be protected from misunderstanding only if it is not thought of as an action which happens between the worldy actions or events, but as happening within them. The close connection between natural and historical events remains intact as it presents itself to the observer. The action of God is hidden from every eye except the eye of faith... It is within them [natural events] that God's hidden action is taking place\\" (61-62). In other words, God is not actually causing anything in the natural world, but through faith we can understand him to be working. This not only leaves one with the severely unsettling conclusion that everything would have turned out exactly the same if God did not even exist (since he isn't actually causing anything in the physical world), but it also rules out miracles (65-66), as God cannot be encountered in the physical sphere of existence. It is only through experince that we can speak of God acting. \\"Only such statements about God are legitimate as express the existential relation between God and man. Statements which speak of God's actions as cosmic events are illegitimate\\" (69). This includes the crucifixion as atonement (69-70).In short, God is not to be comprehended by reason, and does not operate in the physical world as a causal agent in any sense of the term. Jesus Christ is a messianic figure of truth only in the realm of faith and mystical experience, which is not built upon historical reality. If we believe in Christ, it is not for any reason, but is in spite of reason. In fact, we do not even believe because of experience. \\"We can believe in God only in spite of experience,\\" for \\"God withholds himself from view and observation\\" (84). We are to define nothing, aviod systematic theology like the plague, and trust in Christ as the Lord of the faith realm, although it is never really clear what exactly Christ does, or how he is messianic in any way since Bultmann took away all the historical importance attached to him.While I very strongly disagree with nearly all of Bultmann's main points (I lean toward orthodox Christianity), this is definitely a book worth reading. Bultmann is very clear (except a few times he delves into existential philosophy and gets a bit vague), very intelligent, and very influential. This book will provide a very useful introduction to the theology of a prominent figure in 20th century theology and hermeneutics. Whether you agree with him or not, he needs to be dealt with, and this books is a good a place as any to begin to tackle the issues he raises. His theology is, I think, the intellectual pinnacle of what theology should look like if we accept Kant's dichotomization of reality into separate shperes of knowledge. The question is, of course, whether we accept that or not."},{"Title":"JESUS CHRIST AND MYTHOLOGY","review":"This is an amazing book! It is an elegant reevaluation of whatis important in the Bible. Bultmann is an excellent New Testamentscholar, and he puts his knowledge to good use in this book. His use of existential philosophy is also very interesting. He really strips away a lot of the trappings of the Bible to get to the heart of its message. He is also a very good writer, and everything he says is very clearly conveyed. If you have any interest in Christian philosophy, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"JESUS CHRIST AND MYTHOLOGY","review":"Rudolph Bultmann, Jesus Christ and Mythology (New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1958)Rudolph Bultmann (1884--1976) may be one of the two most important Protestant thinkers in the 20th century, carrying the Lutheran flag of modern scholarship alongside Karl Barth's conservative, Reform theology. This is remarkable in that there are so many excuses by which one could ignore Bultmann. The most obvious is in the title of this small book, a collection of lectures Bultmann delivered in 1951, in English, at over a dozen American colleges and universities, including Yale, Vanderbilt, and the Union Theological Seminary in New York City. Bultmann's whole scholarly enterprise has its foundation in the notion of mythology in the Judeo-Christian scriptures.But \`myth' is one of those words that have strongly negative connotations, ranging from \`fiction' to \`devious falsehood'. The paradigm of a \`myth' may be the ancient Greek stories about Achilles, Odysseus, Oedipus, Theseus, Jason, and Heracles, not to mention the gods such as Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Hades, Athena, Apollo, Ares, and Aphrodite, most of whom had \`loose' morals to say the least. The fog of meaning surrounding \`myth' may clear up when we realize that these stories had the same objective and effect on the Greeks as the stories of Abraham and Isaac, and Jacob, and Joseph had on the Hebrews, and the effect of Jesus parables had on his disciples. A bridge between \`myth' and \`lesson' may be to consider Aesop's Fables (620--560 BCE). In one sense, these are pure fantasy, with talking foxes and racing hares and what have you. But all the stories have morals, and sometimes the morals are not that obvious, just as some of the lessons from Jesus' parables are not always obvious, or even more likely, open to interpretation in several different ways.For Bultmann, \`demythologizing' was his word for adducing the message, the kerygma, behind the stories in the Bible, which were told in the context of the ancient middle East and the Greco-Roman world. This is nothing more nor less than Hermeneutics, the noble study of the meaning of Biblical texts in terms which a modern audience can understand. The passage in Luke 12:41--48 is a perfect example. It assumes that slavery is legitimate, and bases its lesson on the role of slaves. We have no trouble factoring out the fact of slavery and concentrating on the underlying eschatological lesson Jesus is teaching. Bultmann spells out how demythologizing involves interpreting the lessons for modern audiences without throwing the baby out with the bathwater.The fear Bultmann cites is that looking at the scripture so that it is consistent with, or, as our favorite TV forensic scientists like to say, \`not inconsistent' with the modern world view, the Christian message will get lost. That is certainly easy to understand. Look at how aggressively creationists argue the story of Genesis against the evidence of modern Geology and Evolutionary Biology. What I suspect these folks don't realize is that they are shooting themselves in the foot. The OT creation stories are myths, pure and simple. And their moral has much less to do with which came first, the chicken or the egg, than it has to do with the nature of human evil. Bultmann is intent on our understanding the kerygma in modern language, seeing through the stories framed to be understood by people living 2000 to 2500 years ago. Just as Friedrich Schleiermacher said, hermeneutics is the art of avoiding misunderstanding.A second \`nave' objection to Bultmann is that his \`point of view', clearly stated, in his exegesis, is the existential philosophy of Martin Heidegger. When I was studying philosophy in the Anglo-American curriculum dominated by Wittgenstein, Austin, and Russell, Existentialism wasn't even mentioned in classes, let alone discussed, except for brief segments in 20th Century Philosophy courses. Lots of attention was given to the Godfathers of Existentialism, Nietzsche and Kierkegaard. So why not go to the source. I got the impression that, like the \`Post-moderns' of today, they were stretching a limited point of view too far. Of course, by now, Existentialism as an active doctrine has retired the field in favor of its stepchild, postmodernism. Another reason to relegate Bultmann's theories to history.A third reason is that as one reads material on subjects on which Bultmann had a big influence, such as the interpretation of the Synoptic Gospels, you find a lot of modern scholars finding things with which they disagree with Bultmann. This gives one the feeling that his scholarship is pass&eacute;. But, while Bultmann's exegesis of details may be superseded, I suspect his theology and especially his methods of exegesis are still good today as a guide to approaching the scriptures with the right frame of mind.With regard to the first two concerns, this little book may not plumb the full depth of Bultmann's thought (he wrote a great deal), but it will certainly dispel apprehensions that Bultmann and those who followed his thought are intent on either \`debunking' Christianity or applying an inappropriate gauge to interpreting the Scriptures. One of Bultmann's primary tenants is that one should not approach an understanding of the Scripture with the intent to find support for particular dogmas. The Scriptures need to speak with their own voice."},{"Title":"JESUS CHRIST AND MYTHOLOGY","review":"Rudolf Bultmann (1884-1976) was a German theologian and professor of New Testament at the University of Marburg, whose 1941 essay \\"New Testament and Mythology\\" (reprinted with commentary inKerygma and Myth by Rudolf Bultmann and Five Critics.) was one of the 20th century's most influential essays of theology. This volume contains lectures he gave in October 1951 at Yale University Divinity School.He begins by saying \\"The heart of the preaching of Jesus Christ is the Kingdom of God. During the nineteenth century exegesis and theology understood the Kingdom of God as a spiritual community consisting of men joined together by obedience to the will of God which ruled in their wills. By such obedience they sought to enlarge the sphere of His rule in the world. They were building, it was said, the Kingdom of God as a realm which is spiritual but within the world, active and effective in this world, unfolding in the history of this world.\\"He adds that Jesus \\"expected that this would take place soon, in the immediate future, and he said that the dawning of that age could already be perceived in the signs and wonders which he performed, especially in his casting out of demons. Jesus envisaged the inauguration of the Kingdom of God as a tremendous cosmic drama. The Son of Man will come with the clouds of heaven, the dead will be raised and the day of judgment will arrive, for the righteous the time of bliss will begin, whereas the damned will be delivered to the torments of hell.\\"He writes, \\"If we can say anything more, it is that the action of God reaches its fulfillment in the glory of God. Thus the Church of God in the present has no other purpose than to praise and glorify God by its conduct and by its thanksgiving. Therefore, the future Church in the state of perfection cannot be thought of otherwise than as a worshipping community which sings hymns of praise and thanksgiving. We can see examples of this in the Revelation of John.\\"He concludes on the note, \\"Nevertheless, the world is God's world and the sphere of God as acting. Therefore, our relation to the world as believers is paradoxical... In terms of this book, we may say, 'let those who have the modern world-view live as though they had none.'\\""},{"Title":"First To Fight: An Inside View of the U.S. Marine Corps","review":"A very readable history of the USMC written by Victor Krulak, who served honorably throughout his enitire life.

Picking up what most books on the Marines Corps leave out. Not only did General Krulack give me a new perspective on the Corps's battles, tactics &amp; it's inventiveness. But on it's vary existence as an elite fighting force.Many times over the Corps had proved it's worth to her county on battlefields across the globe. But as the General points out (form first hand experience) - unknown to most are the political battles fought behind closed doors that saved the Marine Corps from becoming nothing more than a token force, or worst it's complete elimination. Even more surprising are some of &quot;Great Americans&quot; who (for various reasons) fought so hard to emasculate and/or eliminate the Corps outright. Americans like: Truman, Eisenhower, and Bradley to but name a few. While I'll always have great admiration for these individuals and their accomplishments - As a Marine alumni (77/81) I can't help but feel somewhat betrayed by these people and others like them.First in Fight makes for engaging reading - as it covers Krulack's own experiences within the battle over the unification of the armed services. Moreover - this book explains how &amp; why the U.S. Military chain of command (Executive office - down to the lowly Private) is set-up the way it is today.Most people think that the erecting of the U.S. Flag on Mt. Suribachi's peak was the defining moment that guaranteed the existence of the Marine Corps. While I'd never take anything away from that historical event - thanks to this book I now realize that the Corps survival to date is partly in thanks to a few dedicated Marine senior officers, a Pro-Marine Congress and a supportive people.On a personal note: I would make this mandatory reading for any Marine, as it gives new insight into our timeless inter-service rivalry with the other service branches.

Charles Krulak, who eventually became Commandant, for a brief period of time and I used to work with a man who was \\"Brute\\" Krulak's personal chef, so the name was not entirely new to me.After having served four years in the Corps, including an abbreviated tour in Vietnam, I knew how the Corps was, but I had no idea how it really came to be the institution that it is, except of course, for the tales of glory I heard in Boot Camp.Anyone who has ever served in the Corps should read this book.

A very different perspective on the USMC's history. A true underdog/dark horse -type story. Very little about the wars fought, but about the intra-government conspiracies and maneuverings to neuter, eradicate, and destroy the USMC. It shows how the USMC had to do more with less and still excel. This one has a happy ending and a fortunate one for us all in the USA."},{"Title":"First To Fight: An Inside View of the U.S. Marine Corps","review":"As a former Marine who served under General Krulak, I can personally attest to the general's remarkable leadership. Aside from his accomplishments as general of the Marine Corps, many may not know that as a key member of the Chowder Society, a small group of influential military and civilians, he was instrumental in keeping the Marine Corps from being disbanded.On a personal level, when General Krulak was scheduled to inspect the troops, because of the general's short stature, the word would go out to not look down at the general unless you wanted to commit suicide. I was lucky when he approached me. We were about the same height -- and I think he appreciated seeing a short Marine.The Krulak story cannot end without mention of his son, Charles Krulak who became the 31st Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. His leadership rebuilt the Marine Corps after the devastating experience in Vietnam. It was there as a lieutenant, he learned the hard and tragic lessons of war and vowed to change the Corps. He succeeded.

This book is close to exceptional as it details many of the behind the scenes workings to save the Marine Corps after WWII and again after Korea. The general public is little aware of how close the Corps came to an ignominious end at the hands of President Truman as well as high level Army and Navy officers. Fortunately for the nation they were, in the end, unsuccessful. Also Brute tends to somewhat give himself more credit than in some instances is due.

She received this book from Victor Krulak himself sometime last year. Krulak was her client (She works at Union Bank, Trust Department) After Krulak passed away last year she knew I have been wanting to join the Marine Corps for 2 years now. I am proud to say I will be going to boot camp hopefully in March 2011. This book for me started off very slow. I then got into it after seeing the pictures and the more detailed descriptions and stories. I enjoy reading about the history of the Marines and everything that has happened before me. Seeing those pictures of the Marines in 1900 in the Philippines was very inspiring to me. Knowing that every Marine will always have that brotherhood. I also enjoyed hearing what Krulak had to say and to hear his own personal story about \\"Saving the Corps\\" This book was very inspiring to me and I would recommend it to anyone else interested in the Marine Corps. Krulak was a great man and I am inspired by his story. This book, and many others make me proud to be an American. Here is a picture of what he wrote at the beginning of the book. Here is a picture that reads \\"To Brenda - With warmest good wishes. V. Krulak, LtGen.

I was privileged to have met and served under the General when he was CG FMF Pac. His forthright leadership style has served as a great model for Marine Corps officers.Of particular note was the General's assessment of the Sergeant Mc Keon incident. The General is correct. The Marine Corps has a unique way of correcting a portion of the system which has gone astray. The Corps owned up to a problem! A fitting end-result of the Corps' efforts to fix the recruit training system at MCRD PISC was the implementation of a new physical fitness program for the whole Marine Corps. It has sustained us.Conversely, as I read the current Commandant's 233'rd Birthday message referencing the death of the 244 Marines and corpsmen in Beirut, Lebanon in October 1983, I cannot find the rationale for moving the Marines comfortably ashore when they were obviously capable of strategic or tactical deployment from the security of the Mobile Seabase Concept which General Krulak had worked hard to assure.Semper Fi!BRUCE M.

In reality, Baum was tired of Oz and wanted to develop other ideas and projects. But hounded by young fans to provide more stories of the utopist fairyland, in 1913 Baum again took up his pen as Royal Historian. Explaining to readers that he had begun receiving new tales from the Shaggy Man via a wireless telegraph in Oz, the fruit of this partnership was The Patchwork Girl Of Oz, probably the general favorite of Baum's novels among dedicated Oz enthusiasts. In fact, the Patchwork Girl Of Oz is the book appreciated even by those who dislike the Oz series as a whole.In poetry - spouting Scraps the Patchwork Girl, Baum introduced a vibrant, riveting figure to his fairyland, one equal to earlier classic creations the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, Jack Pumpkinhead, the Wooglebug, and the Gnome King. Rowdy, grotesque Scraps was perhaps Baum's last great character; indefatigable and indomitable, Scraps was also Baum's most original and fully realized female character, whether human, fairy, sorceress, or otherwise. A winning combination of common sense and nonsense, Scraps, a kind of nightmare version of Raggedy Ann, is pleasantly naive, utterly free, tactless, curious, and enthusiastic about all facets of life, including romance. Though stuffed with cotton, Scraps finds the straw - packed Scarecrow a perfect dreamboat, and finds twig - bodied Jack Pumpkinhead attractive as well. John R. Neill's illustrations of the Scraps and the Scarecrow's ' hearts aflutter ' first meeting is hilarious. A reconfiguration of the happy peasant figure who blissfully notices that the emperor is naked and doesn't hesitate to say so, Scraps, though not an outright trickster figure, approaches trickster status.The Patchwork Girl Of Oz is Baum's most fluid, well rounded, and detailed children's novel. Unlike some of the other titles in the series that have a predominantly sketchy narrative, the Patchwork Girl Of Oz is composed of enthusiastic, rollicking prose that allows the reader to happily suspend disbelief. All Oz titles have filler chapters that pad the books and add little to their forward motion, and the Patchwork Girl Of Oz has its share. However, the filler chapters here -- 'The Troublesome Phonograph' and 'The Foolish Owl and the Wise Donkey' -- don't irritate or distract from the story's forward motion as much as they might.Far from being finished with Oz, in 1913 Baum was still working out the magical laws that would govern his fairyland kingdom; readers will note that those laws applied here differ somewhat from those provided in 1918's The Tin Woodman Of Oz. Most noticeably, young Ojo the Unlucky is described as a growing boy; in the later books, all characters would be permanently fixed in their ages and physical growth or decline would become impossible. The Patchwork Girl Of Oz is almost free of the occasionally unsettling, cruel, or bizarre elements that Baum unconsciously allowed to mar his books; there is a brief explanation of how \\"meat\\" beings, if chopped into pieces, would continue to live, if not thrive, in their newly minced state. Unlike some of the other books in the series, the natural world in the Patchwork Girl Of Oz is lushly underscored and doesn't seem to be a brittle facsimile of the natural world known to readers. There is a loving description of Jack Pumpkinhead's pumpkin patch home, of the Munchkin gardens of \\"blue flowers, blue cabbages, blue carrots, and blue lettuce,\\" and a defense of country living by the itinerant Shaggy Man.A classic of children's literature, the Patchwork Girl Of Oz is Baum's best, and a far better book than its more famous antecedent, the Wonderful Wizard Of Oz. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The patchwork girl of Oz","review":"The title of the book actually misleads the reader somewhat. Yes this book does describe the origins of Scraps, the patchwork girl, who goes on to become a regular fixture in future Oz stories. However she is, in fact, a secondary character in the story. The main character is Ojo \\"the unlucky,\\" a Munchkin boy who embarks on a quest to save his beloved uncle who has been accidentally turned into a marble statue.This book offers the usual assortment of pleasantly odd characters, strange magical happenings and dramtic tension that go into all of the good Oz novels. What makes \\"Patchwork Girl...\\" stand out is its reltively mature subplot of the importance of rules. Ozma has made it illegal for most people to use magic. The crooked magician ignores this rule, and as an indirect result two innocent people are turned into marble. One of the items Ojo must get for his quest is illegal to gather. He doesn't want to break the law, but restoring his uncle is the most important thing to him, so he justifies it to himself. Then, the reader is introduced to the humane way Oz deals with people who break the rules. This theme will speak volumes to any child who has chaffed under the rules of an adult, but secretly acknowledged that the adult had his or her best interests at heart.Several reviewers have commented that the end of the book is a cop out, and yes it might be disappointing if you were expecting a big, dramatic magical event. In truth, however, it is a masterful conclusion to the rules subplot. The conclusion underscores that rules are made to be kept, and that breaking them and then trying to sneakily get around them only causes problems. If one admits to breaking the rules, as the crooked magician should have done, and then tries to correct the mistake, it often avoids a great deal of trouble and ultimately works out better.Overall, this book is a great read for young and old alike."},{"Title":"The patchwork girl of Oz","review":"While the last three books in L. Frank Baum's \\"Oz\\" series (\\"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\\", \\"The Road to Oz\\" and \\"The Emerald City of Oz\\") were all rather lackluster, this book was a return to form. The problem with the other installments was a lack of a new story -- they were all about people who went to Oz, met lots of strange and interesting people, and had a happy ending.\\"The Patchwork Girl of Oz,\\" however, had a very good story to bolster the old Oz formula. Ojo the Unlucky, a young Munchkin lad, along with the Glass Cat and Scraps, the Patchwork Girl, set out to find magical ingredients needed to restore his uncle and a magician's wife to life after they are accidentally petrified. So the story is, again, about someone wandering Oz and meeting strange and interesting people, but giving Ojo a quest gave the book a different angle, a sense of urgency -- this was a boy on a mission to save two lives.The ending is somewhat abrupt, although quite in-character for Baum's creations, but overall it is one of the better Oz books, a real return to form after a few that just didn't click."},{"Title":"The patchwork girl of Oz","review":"This book marks Baum's return to the world of Oz after trying to quit his fabled story land in an attempt to muse upon new subjects--thankfully, it was an unsuccessful attempt, and he came back with delightful vengeance in this remarkable story. \\"The Patchwork Girl of Oz\\" is one of Baum's longer Oz books, and it is also very plot-driven, somewhat of an exception for him. Luckily, this plot--the quest of the Munchkin boy Ojo to save his Uncle from a magic spell--does not come at the expense of Baum's usual humor and story-telling style. This book is very funny, mostly due to the introduction of the Patchwork girl herself, who, of course, quickly became an instant favorite with fans of Oz. There are other new characters who are just as delightful, and I'm thinking here of the Woozy. I highly recommend this book, not only to fans of Oz, but to lovers of fantasy."},{"Title":"The patchwork girl of Oz","review":"Baum does it again - another masterpiece. The Patchwork Girl of Oz is a great book with only one flaw (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). It is really slow to start. Most of the 14 Oz books penned by Baum start with action (the first book, in fact, unlike the movie, brings Dorothy to Oz in the first couple of pages), but this starts with a boring visit to the crooked magician that, while important to the overall plot, really drags. But keep reading - it gets better. Once the quest begins, the story picks up and you will be finished before you know it.One of the things I liked the best about this book is that it really takes place in Oz. Even though all of the 14 Oz books are well written, several of them don't bring Oz into the story until the last chapter or two. This one begins and ends in Oz. The only thing I would recommend is that, if you are not familiar with the Oz books, start at the beginning and read them in order. Even though the plots of the books are all complete within the individual volumes, Baum introduces characters who then reappear in later editions. While everyone knows who The Scarecrow and the Tin Man are, other equally wonderous characters are introduced along the way.And if you've read all the Oz books and are looking for other titles that are just as magical and just as inspired, try the Chronicles of Narnia, King Fortis the Brave or Abarat. All will introduce you to other magical worlds that are every bit as fun to visit as Oz."},{"Title":"The patchwork girl of Oz","review":"L. Frank Baum officially ended the Oz series with 1910's The Emerald City of Oz by having the Good Witch Glinda cast a spell on the fairy country making it invisible to the outside world. Finally free to write a new series of fantasy novels, the author published The Sea Fairies and Sky Island in 1911 and 1912. Unfortunately neither book met the success of the Oz stories and Baum was forced to revisit the fairyland once more. 1913's The Patchwork Girl of Oz begins with Baum telling his readers that he's found a way to communicate with the inhabitants of Oz via wireless telegraphy.Opening in the remote Blue Forest north of the Munckin country, little Ojo the Unlucky and his elderly uncle Unc Nunkie decide to venture from the isolated wilderness to visit Dr. Pipt, a crooked magician performing sorcery despite Ozma's strict laws prohibiting anyone other than Glinda and the Wizard to do it. He's responsible for the Powder of Life (first introduced in The Marvelous Land of Oz) and used it on a Glass Cat meant to chase the mice out of his home, but the saucy cat is far too prideful to do such a thing. She's got pink marbles for brains (\\"you can see 'em work!\\") and a hard ruby heart she's quite proud of.Pipt's wife Margalotte wishes for a servant to help her around the house so the magician plans on using the Powder on a life sized doll made out of colorful patchwork quilts and stuffed with cotton. For the past six years he's been stirring pots with both hands and feet in order to create the Liquid of Petrifaction, a concoction that turns any living thing into a red marble statue. After the Patchwork Girl (named Scraps by the Glass Cat) is brought to life, Unc Nunkie and Margalotte are accidentally hit with the Petrifaction Liquid and immediately turned into marble statues.Desperate to save his uncle, Ojo, with Scraps and the Glass Cat in tow, embarks on a journey across Oz gathering five ingredients needed for an antidote: a six-leaved clover in the Emerald City, the hairs from the tip of a Woozy's (a creature whose body is made up of squares) tail, a gill of water from a dark well, oil from a live man's body, and yellow butterfly's left wing. Familiar characters Dorothy, Ozma, the Scarecrow, and Jack Pumpkinhead make appearances.The best thing about The Patchwork Girl of Oz to me is how reminiscent it is of the first Oz book. The characters undertake an exciting, many times treacherous, quest to accomplish a particular mission. Like Dorothy, Ojo is a bit afraid yet determined to meet his goal. The Patchwork Girl is one of Baum's most beloved characters and it's easy to see why. Despite insults made against her looks, Scraps doesn't let them get her down. She celebrates her uniqueness and is just glad to be alive. She's bubbly and animated and curious about everything. Even the Scarecrow takes a liking to her.Mr. Baum came back stronger than ever after his 3 year hiatus and was once quoted as saying that The Patchwork Girl of Oz was \\"one of the two best books of my career\\" (the other was The Sea Fairies). I have to agree with him. \\"Whee, but there's a gaudy dame! Makes a paint-box blush with shame. Razzle-dazzle, fizzle-fazzle! Howdy-do, Miss What's-your-name?\\""},{"Title":"The patchwork girl of Oz","review":"The Patchwork Girl of Oz is one of the most interesting and memorable of the books in the Oz series. The characters featured include Ojo the Unlucky, the Shaggy Man (always one of my favorites), and the delightful introduction of the Patchwork Girl. Scraps is one of the best characters in the series, and there is something delightfully resonant about this colorful rebel who has far too many brains for her station in life.As a child, I read and re-read this book many times. I probably did not have the reaction that Baum intended a young reader to have. I left this book with the firm conviction that Ozma liked to make stupid and unfair rules about magic and then punish people for them. If there are camps in Oz, with book 7 I firmly joined Scraps in the camp of the doubters and stayed there for the rest of the series. I was so affected by Ojo having to go to jail that re-reading it as an adult I could clearly remember every word and illustration before turning the page.This book represented a return to Oz after Baum tried to close the series by closing Oz from the outside world forever. The conceit that the Shaggy Man transmits the rest of the stories by wireless begins with this book.Highly recommended. Delightful and thought provoking. For little girl readers, Scraps is in many ways a much better character to identify with than Dorothy or Ozma."},{"Title":"The patchwork girl of Oz","review":"Unfortunately what had been a wonderful series of reprints was greatly derailed with this edition and the taint seems to have spread to other editions from other publishers.There is a scene where the characters encounter a talking Victrola who plays a piece of what it considers popular music entitled My Coal Black Lulu, with lyrics included. The other characters reaction upon hearing what was considered a \\"coon\\" song is so strongly negative they threaten to break up the Victrola. The editor of this series (and owner of the store the imprint is named after) decided that including the song and an illustration and descriptions of the Tottenhots later in the story would have a negative impact on his ability to sell the book to a modern African-American audience. So he changed the song to My Cross-Eyed Lulu and removed words and an illustration he considered offensive.Now? Good luck finding any edition of this book that is still as the author wrote it. The Dover edition and the Del Rey paperback are the only, to my knowledge, unexpurgated editions.

Ojo the Unlucky, Unc's young nephew, has to go on a quest to find the five items required to undo the spell. He starts off with the newly-created Patchwork Girl, who is a perky rhymester, totally unsuited to be the servant she was created to be mainly thanks to a timely intervention by Ojo. She is one of the liveliest new characters created by Baum after the first couple books. A glass cat with pink brains, \\"you can see'em work\\" goes along too for lack of something better to do. After a few adventures they wind up in the Emerald City, meet Ozma, Ojo is arrested, and then reunited with the gang, and with the addition of Dorothy and Toto (remember Toto ?) they head off for some more adventures with both whimsical and nasty Oz natives before the satisfying conclusion. It's another Oz road trip and full of the same style, puns and all, as the first books that you should already have read. Mom is definitely the main figure, not Dad.

Heck, the title character is pretty feminist, even by today's standards.This film, made for kids, is probably best seen by older Oz fans who can look past the technical limitations of the age and see just how Baum himself wanted Oz to look on film."},{"Title":"The patchwork girl of Oz","review":"In his excellent critical study of children's literature, Roger Sale (1978) writes that L. Frank Baum \\"wrote too much, too quickly, and too restlessly to have a single book as his masterpiece\\" (239). Thus, even the best of his Oz books (like _Ozma of Oz_) have a few weak spots, while the weakest (like _Glinda of Oz_) have stretches in which the novel comes to life. As a result, different Oz lovers are prone to have different favorites._The Patchwork Girl of Oz_ (1913) is not considered by some (including Sale) to be Baum at his very best. But I am fond of it. I love Scraps, the Patchwork girl, and her motto of, \\"I hate dignity!\\" Also great fun is the glass cat (\\"You can see my brains work\\") and the terrible Woozy, who eats bees. And there is the dancing phonograph, and Chiss the Porcupine, the captive Yoop, and more. And, of course, there are old favorites-- the Shaggy Man, Dorothy, Ozma, the Scarecrow (who strikes up a romance with Scraps), the Wizard, and the Tin Man.The story is a quest (something that Baum always did well). Through a series of unfortunate events, young Ojo is involved in an accident that turns his Unc Nunkie and Mrs. Pipt to stone. Now Ojo is setting out on a journey to find the ingredients that will restore them to life. Along the way, our travelers encounter domiciles inhabited by strange creatures, the Emerald City, the land of the Hip-hoppers, the land of the joking Horners, the dark well, the trick river, and other exotic places.There are touches of racism, as when the phonograph sings the awful popular song about \\"mah coal-black Lulu\\" (137), or when the travelers encounter the bellicose Tottenhots. While this satire may grate a bit on modern nerves, readers should remember that this was not uncommon in early twentieth century popular writing. Besides, many of Baum's notions about music are relevant today. Much of our present day music _is_ godawful.As with most of the Oz books, the illustrations are by John R. Neill, who blends just the right amount of realism and whimsy._Reference_: Sale, Roger. \\"L. Frank Baum and Oz\\". In _Fairy Tales and After: From Snow White to E.B. White_. Harvard UP.

I like the Glass Cat. My favorite Oz book! L. Frank Baum is brillant!"},{"Title":"The patchwork girl of Oz","review":"I am reviewing this 'Patchwork Girl of Oz' because it is an old Silent-Black&White; Movie, NOT the Novel!!!! Check your items before reviewing!!! I have this Film on the \\"World of Oz\\" DVD.The 1st of L. Frank Baum's 3 S-B&W; 'Oz Film Manufacturing Productions', this follows the story closely but with some departures, additions and changes. There is on screen type-writing for scenes where footage is missing such as the (said-to-be) \\"elaborate\\" opening, the bringing to life of Scraps the Patchwork Girl & the Petrification of Unc Nunkie etc. and the End Credits, which does Not list the actors/characters or staff/crew. The opening foir this movie includes a longer glance at Ozma's face than the 2 later films. This film goes for 1 hr 6 mins, longer than the later two films. Many (if not all) scenes take a while and are slow, despite excited acting. Unlike the later S-B&W; Oz films (including Larry Semon's awful \\"Wizard\\") this movie does not have the woman narrating the on-screen writing (thank goodness!).Violet Macmillian plays Ojo, a young Munchkin boy who lives in poverty & hunger with his munchkin guardian Unc Nunkie (Frank Moore), who both leave for Emerald City for food. Dr Pipt the Crooked Magician is making the Powder of Life so that his wife Margolotte can bring her patchwork girl to life as a servant. Their daughter, Jesseva accepts proposal by her lover Danx the Munchkin. Ojo and Unc Nunkie encounter Mewel the Mule (Fred Woodward, who appears throughout this picture with no real importance and in the later films) and the Munchkins who congratulate Jesseva and Danx. They arrive at Dr. Pipt's house and watch him work, and Ojo sneaks magic brains into the patchwork girl's head. After the Powder of Life is ready, the Liquid of Perification transforms Unc Nunkie, Margolotte and Danx into stone, and Dr Pipt says they must find the ingredients for the antidote: He will find the Dark Well while Ojo and Jesseva look for the other (2) ingredients, shrinking the statue of Danx so that Jesseva will not be separated from him. Ojo and Jesseva are joined by the Munchkins before Scraps the Patchwork Girl finds and helps free the Woozy (also Fred Woodward), who is needed for the antidote and comes along. The group meets Jinjur who guides them through the Wall of Optical Illusion, falls in love with Jesseva's tiny statue of Danx and warns Ojo that plucking a 6-leaved clover is against the Law of Oz. However Ojo still takes the clover and Jinjur uses this opportunity for the Soldier with the Long Green Whiskers to give her the Danx statue and have the Royal Barracks arrest the Woozy & Munchkins, while Scraps chases after Jinjur to retrieve Danx. Dr Pipt meanwhile finds the House of Magic, giving him rest and food. The Lonesome Zoop (another useless un-important character in the 3 films) makes his debut here. Dr. Pipt meets the Hoppers and his leg is saved by Scraps, who only briefly managed to get Danx back. After they have a brief encounter with the Jolly Tottenhotts, Jinjur steals back Danx again, leaving Dr. Pipt and Scraps to be helped finding the Dark Well by the Horners. In the Throne Room of Ozma of Oz, the prisoners are put on trial for breaking the law. The Royal Jury consists of Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, Braided-Man (from \\"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\\" book), a Tottenhot, a Horner and somebody else. Dr Pipt and Scraps make it back to Emerald City and she and Scarecrow fall in love at first sight. Ozma allows the Wizard of Oz to summon the statues so that Dr Pipt can make and use the Powder of Life to restore them, the tiny staue of Danx finally returned and Jinjur arrested. The Petrified are restored to their normal selves and the loved ones are reunited. The End has Ozma's face again.This is not really a fantastic Oz picture, because of its time and quality: the picture has not only missing footage but some scenes (in beginning) have a white-out on the sides, and the editing is a bit 'scrappy', looking like there is still some (unnoticed) footage missing or just because of the way it was scripted/filmed. But it's a good film to watch because it includes such characters as the Cowardly Lion and Hungry Tiger as Ozma's bodyguards, the Guadian of the Gates and Long Whiskered Soldier of the Emerald City as well as the Palace itself, which is nicely decorated with an outside swimming fountain. The music is okay. This would be a much better film if such unimportance bits like Mewel, Zoop, Jinjur and other slow sequences were abandoned, as well as a closer adaptation, but most of all an impressive and pleasing restoration, so that the picture and sound is more bearable."},{"Title":"The patchwork girl of Oz","review":"If you enjoy all of Frank Baum's crazy books, you will love this quirky book. it is a great addition to your collection!"},{"Title":"The patchwork girl of Oz","review":"NOTE: This is not the edition of the book I would have liked to review. I just didn&#65533;t see it anywhere. This review is based on the Del Rey edition.The Patchwork Girl of Oz is one of my favorite books in the Wizard of oz series. Why, may you ask, did I rate this book 3-stars when all the other Oz books have 5? Well, you see, I really liked the book up until the end. Here&#65533;s how it goes:Unc Nunkie and Margolotte get turned into marble in the crooked magician&#65533;s house. (the same magician that Mombi visited in The Land of Oz, book 2) So, Ojo the Unlucky, Scraps the patchwork girl, and the glass cat set out to retrieve 5 special ingredients to rescue Unc Nunkie and Margolotte. It&#65533;s really good and Scraps is really funny, but at the end, they can&#65533;t get all of the ingredients (because of really stupid reasons) and the Wizard turns them back from marble anyway. So, what was the point of the whole journey just to have the Wizard say 2 magic words and be done? Beats me.

The introduction by Clarence Brown provides a few facts. She was born \\"on October 31, 1899, in the town of Saratov. Her mother was a physician.\\" Her father's occupation is unknown. She had two siblings, one of each and earned a PhD in English philology. Although she met her husband on May 1, 1919, the story really begins when they are first visited and searched, May 13, 1934. Information on events prior is provided later and in small doses. M had written but not published a derogatory poem about Stalin, and although it had been read by no more than a dozen people, and everyone knew that anyone could be picked up at any time for any reason, they all suspected the trouble began with the poem. In it, he mocks Stalin's appearance, ancestry, co-conspirators, \\"thin necked leaders\\" and the killings, \\"And every killing is a treat...\\" Hope Against Hope is filled with references to encounters, incidents, and conversations had with various friends, family members, colleagues, and acquaintances that she speculates as having affected their fates. As a result of questioning, M, quite luckily, is exiled instead of being sent directly to the Gulag. En route to Voronezh, Mrs. Mandelstam having chosen to accompany her husband in exile, they spend the night in Cherdyn, where he takes a suicidal jump out a window, fracturing his shoulder. In their new town, they subsist mainly on proceeds from translating work as well as some monetary help from friends and family. Pasternak, who aided them over the years, is mentioned several times including in a passage describing a conversation he had with Stalin in an (unsuccessful) attempt to help M's situation and, except for a negative comparison of him with another man (page 157), he is spoken of favorably. In fact, Pasternak was the only person who visited her after she found out about her husband's death. When his term is satisfied, they find that they are unable to obtain a permit to live in their apartment in Moscow, so are forced to relocate. Again, their friends and acquaintances help supplement their meager income from translating, which becomes increasingly difficult to obtain. During the winter of 1936-1937, M writes an Ode to Stalin, in an attempt to save himself. She clarifies what compelled him to do such a thing; he wrote it, \\"with a rope around his neck.\\" On May 1, 1938, while staying at a sanatorium, M is taken in again. Months later, she receives a note (from him written to her brother) stating that he arrived at transit camp on October 12. Soon thereafter, she receives word that he is dead, his death certificate stating the cause of death as congestive heart failure and date as December 27, 1938. Although she hears both supporting and contradictory information on several scenarios surrounding his death, she never receives definitive proof of the cause or date. One line rings especially true and its message is repeated by others who wrote of the that time period in Russia, \\"We were all the same: either sheep who went willingly to the slaughter, or respectful assistants to the executioners.\\" Nadezhda Mandelstam's challenging memoir will probably be of interest to fans of Russian history or Russian poetry. More everyman-friendly accounts of life in the Gulag include Journey into the Whirlwind by Eugenia Ginzburg and Kolyma Tales by Varlam Shalamov."},{"Title":"Hope Against Hope (Harvill Press Editions)","review":"Yesterday I finally finished this memoir by N Mandelstam about her husband, the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam. The book, however, to me felt less like a biography of a person then a memoir of a time. The Mandelstam's lived through a terrible period during the reign of Stalin. The historical information was, in parts, new to me, but I found the book itself ponderous to get through. Very late in the book the author actually gives some insight into how M (as she refers to him) composed his poetry, but I would have liked to have known more about the man as a poet rather than the intricacies of where they had to hid on any given day. I guess I was looking for more Anne Frank in a sense.This is a memoir I would suggest more for those interested in Russian history rather than poets (like myself)."},{"Title":"Hope Against Hope (Harvill Press Editions)","review":"This is an outstanding book but, unfortunately, the copy I received was defective.

To pass judgment on it is almost insolence--even judgment that is merely celebration and homage.&quot;And that is the truth, well-put.In this lucid tome Mandelstam's widow recounts the years of their exile, the real life people whom they met in their travels, the day-to-day hells of the Stalinist regime, the tiny mercies and kindnesses of others, the cowards and the idiots, the drive to create art out of the most dehumanizing experiences, the triumphs and pitfalls of the human spirit... I'm getting too flowery here, and this is a book that deserves to be read, not praised by some spoilt American white-boy pseudo-intellectual like myself. I just want to say that this book evokes the kind of courage and wit one seldom sees these days.Like Ahkmatova, like Yelena Sergeyevna Bulgakova, like so many Russian women, Nadezhda survived- because of her (and their) resilience we have not only her husband's works, but also this masterpiece. The chapters are short and so finely crafted that it shocks me. How someone can be so accurate, so succinct, so resolute and so honest all at once... If this were the standard by which writers judged their own works, well, amazon would have far fewer books to sell.If you are looking for a glimpse of what life was 'like' during Stalin's reign in Russia, if you are looking for an unflinching view of humanity and 'utopian' projects, or if you are looking for the most eloquent and disturbing memoir I have ever read- well, here, all I can do is add my empty two-cents."},{"Title":"Hope Against Hope (Harvill Press Editions)","review":"This is one of the most wonderful books i have ever read and a sensational portrait of the russian poet Ossip Mandelstam.

She also draw a very clear portrait of what Stalinism meant for artists and people in general in Russia.

This is a detailed but very readable account of the years following the revolution as recalled by the wife of one of Russia's leading poets. It is a witty, frank, and intelligent analysis of conditions that contrast so starkly with the premise of the revolution - freedom and equality for all people."},{"Title":"Hope Against Hope (Harvill Press Editions)","review":"Only a process that is very beautiful and very terrible could produce this book: the anguish of two human souls being tormented by a cruel, fiendishly clever, and virtually all-powerful State determined to murder both the body and soul of its victims. Whether we deserve to benefit as readers from the terrible tempering endured by the poet Osip Mandelstam and his widow Nadezhda Mandelstam is a matter that can be easily determined: we do not deserve it. We are not worthy of the Mandelstams. They belong to a very select group of all the human beings who have ever lived, most of whom we will never know. Thanks to her memoir, we do know Nadezhda and Osip.If Osip's great characteristic was his commitment to truth, Nadezhda's was her endurance (if this sounds dismissive recall that the New Testament repeatedly includes endurance as one of a short list of authentic signs of the divine Spirit). Her personal survival made possible the survival of (most) of Osip's poetry, and of the story of their lives, preserved in this unique memoir.Wordsworth defined poetry as \\"emotion recollected in tranquility\\", and this memoir has something deeper than tranquility to it, a profound serenity, a luminous sadness, a fusion of love and truth which is the pivot on which human history revolves.It is clear from reading this book that Osip was one those described in the 11th chapter of Hebrews as those \\"of whom the world was not worthy\\".What better way to understand the industrial scale barbarisms of the twentieth century than to read about how they were observed and interpreted through the sensibilities of great poets and writers? Perhaps because of the relative brevity of the \\"Thousand Year Reich\\", we have had far more accounts from Hitler's victims than from Lenin and Stalin's victims. But the ones that did survive from the Soviet Union, not just HOPE AGAINST HOPE but works by Ginzburg, Brodsky, and Solzhenitsyn, are testaments of the human spirit of the same order as those written by witnesses to the Holocaust.But the significance of HOPE AGAINST HOPE is not primarily its historical account of the Stalinist system, but its depiction of cosmic injustice and the possibility--even in the worst circumstances--for some kind of ultimate triumph of truth and integrity and decency and love.I doubt that a person picking up this book on a whim will read it through, unless, without knowing it, they have been preparing themselves for years to understand what Osip and Nadezhda have to tell us about ourselves and about the human potential for choosing truth and for acting with moral courage. That was true for me. I bought this book twenty years ago, and although I started it a couple of times, I have only just read it after all that time it has been on my shelves. Paradoxically, although it's a life-changing book, perhaps one's life has to have already changed, or begun to change, before one can engage with it.There is so much to reflect on in HOPE AGAINST HOPE. It is clear, for example, that although he died at the age of 46 in one of Stalin's camps, Osip was spiritually far advanced of the level achieved by Nadezhda herself in old age as she writes this memoir. She faithfully reports her long-dead husband's remarks and opinions without, in many cases, quite understanding them. This is to be expected: what is anybody to make of an observation such as the following: \\"Although [Osip] did not seek happiness, he described everything he valued in terms of pleasure and play: 'Thanks to the wonderful bounty of Christianity, the whole of our two-thousand-year-old culture is the setting of the world free for play, for spiritual pleasure, for the free imitation of Christ.'\\"? [page 267]One last comment about HOPE AGAINST HOPE is the perspective it provides for reading and evaluating other books on the period. HOPE AGAINST HOPE is an almost Biblically rigorous metric for ethical and moral decision. Stimulated by this memoir, I've been reading or re-reading LIFE AND FATE, Bulgakov's diaries and letters collected as MANUSCRIPTS DON'T BURN, Bulgakov's novel THE MASTER AND MARGARITA, Schklovsky's THEORY OF PROSE, Montefiore's YOUNG STALIN, and a fascinating biography by Tom Reiss of the early Stalin biographer Essad Bay, who was actually a Jewish resident of Baku named Lev Nussenbaim. All of these books read differently in the pure light of HOPE AGAINST HOPE; behaviour and poses which seem plausible and even praiseworthy simply look inadequate against the standard set by the Mandelstams.Everything, everybody, looks inadequate."},{"Title":"Hope Against Hope (Harvill Press Editions)","review":"This is a great book. The devotion of Nadezhda Mandelshtam to her husband, to his work is at the center of this work. She writes with poetic intensity and chronicles the story of their life together and their cruel separation . Her devotion her self- sacrifice and her great love for her husband make her story a heroic example. Her perceptiveness and the beauty of her language lift the work into a higher realm.

Nadezhda Mandelstam's account of her husband Osip covers a whole generation of writers who suffered the harsh censorship of the regime and all the consequences that came out of any form of free expression in their work. Is a sad history of the decline of the Russian intelligentsia of everything genuine and original in the face of a state controlled literature and state controlled life.

She and her husband were reduced to begging and tramping from one town to another, knowing that there would be no escape for him. Her memoir is full of keen insights and above all, love for her husband and his poetry. While many people lived through those years with a dimly growing awareness of what was happening, the Mandelstams saw it all very clearly and understood exactly what it meant from the beginning. As she notes, \\"We lived among people who vanished into exile, labor camps or the other world, and also among those who sent them there.\\" Joseph Brodsky, a Nobel Prize winner, went to meet Nadezhda Mandelstam at the end of her long life and wrote that she sat in a dark corner of her kitchen, \\"The shadow so deep that the only things one could make out were the faint flicker of her cigarette and the two piercing eyes. . . . She looked like a remnant of a huge fire, like a small ember that burns if you touch it.\\" A huge fire, indeed."},{"Title":"Hope Against Hope (Harvill Press Editions)","review":"This is a beautiful tribute to a harassed, brutalized and, finally, murdered poet, who died along with so many in the meat grinder of the Soviet killing machine. That his beloved wife guarded and watched over his meager output is a tribute to their marriage as well as a mark of the artistic community, the Soul of the Russian people, and the belief one may have in miracles. Above and beyond all else it is a tribute to this brave woman's will to live and to save the memory of her talented, if naive, husband. It is a curious irony of history that the Soviet system that destroyed him made him the poet that he came to be. Although as aesthete, part of the elite intelligentsia celebrated in St. Petersburg for their allegiance to aesthetics over politics, thus attracting the scorn of Gorky and other loyal Bolsheviks, Stalin and the goons of the terror turned Mandelstam into a poet of the people. He found his voice in denouncing Stalin. Their harassment and persecution, the hardships and degradation had the affect of turning this refined gentlemen into a beast with a harsh growl. The people heard and recognized themselves in his poetry."},{"Title":"Hope Against Hope (Harvill Press Editions)","review":"A rare book by an extraordinary woman.

While it's justly famous for the \\"Brer (brother) Rabbit\\" stories (BTW-Harris was not the first to record these tales from ex-slaves, Abbie Christensen did that in Port Royal, SC in 1874), it's mighty rough for the modern reader. For one thing, the \\"Negro dialect\\" used by Harris is almost incomprehensible to today's reader. Additionally, \\"Uncle Remus' views on education for Blacks (not in favor) and black advancement, as well as his occasional use of the \\"n-word\\" will make this tough to swallow in these PC times.

Fried writes economically, has argued constitutional cases before the Supreme Court, and offers fascinating insights into the nature of constitutional adjudication. However, the reader should know that Fried's analysis is narrowly legal, and almost devoid of historical, biographical, or political context. In fact, the discussion is so abstract that readers without a constitutional law background will have difficulty following the analysis at many points. On the other hand, readers who stay abreast of these issues will enjoy the book. (I'm a former lawyer.)"},{"Title":"Saying What the Law Is: The Constitution in the Supreme Court","review":"I'm not a lawyer, but I am a citizen of the United States and, as such, I have a vested interest in Constitutional law. Perhaps the same is true of you. If so, you might want to read this book, but read on before coming to that decision.Charles Fried's \\"Saying What the Law Is,\\" is a look at the development and current state of Constitutional 'doctrine' in a variety of areas, along with Fried's own analysis as to whether or not the current doctrines are strong and likely to last, or whether they may amount to an abberation, subject to overturn at some future date.The book is very scholarly, and I had to proceed slowly--some might take this as a drawback. On the other hand, I wonder how worthwhile such a book would be if it were *not* scholarly, *not* requiring a person to stop, consider and reflect as he read? I suspect that any analysis of Constitutional law worthy of its subject will require a bit of application in the reading. The subject is comprised, after all, of weighty matters, debated over hundreds of years, by incredibly learned men and women. If we have to spend a few minutes more digesting the topics and arguments, that's no knock on Fried and his write-up.That said, and despite the fact that I have no professional background in law, I did not find the book above me at all. Some of the concepts--like stare decisis--were still familiar to me from either some lower division government survey course I'd taken once (or possibly some novel); other concepts, such as the difference between substantive and procedural due process, were new. However, Fried writes intentionally for the layman, and so he explains as he goes. Of course, you have to have a healthy background and interest in certain topics--such as American politics and history and such--to truly appreciate a book like this in context... but then, who, without such a background and interest would be looking at this book in the first place? :)In all, I really enjoyed and appreciated this book. The reading, which could have been frightfully dull, was unexpectedly interesting, especially as Fried peppers his analysis with some personal judgements, some of which are fairly highly-charged. Beyond that, though, the topic has an internal, compelling interest about it--the Constitution is the foundation and framework for the government of my country, and it has stood (often by itself) as a bulwark for the freedoms and liberties that I enjoy in my own life. The Constitution can only do that, however, if it is correctly applied by those encharged to do it--the Supreme Court. While Fried rarely ventures to say what doctine amounts to a \\"correct\\" application of the Constitution, and what does not, the arguments discussed revolve around that battle. In short, it is fascinating and often frightening to see how, where and why our liberties are either upheld or abridged, and to try to understand both sides of every argument.Fried does his job in presenting those arguments, and helping us to understand the various sides.This book is certainly not for everyone, but if you are the right person--someone with an interest in law, politics, history, etc., and with a sufficient education to be able to understand a mature, scholarly discussion of those topics... then this book might well be for you. The tone runs a bit clinical, at times, but then the topic demands it; it is actually much more humorous and emotionally-written than I had expected it to be.A worthy treatment of a difficult subject, fun and educational in the reading. What more could be asked?Five stars."},{"Title":"Four years in the saddle","review":"Colonel Harry Gilmor, C.S.A., was a tall, handsome, and gallant man. An expert horseman with immeasureable skills as a scout, he was also exceedingly vain. Four Years In the Saddle is Gilmor's story about his own exploits. He is always the center of the story, and he paints himself as a hero who equals in deeds those of the greatest of Greek heroes. But when one compares letters, journals and books of Gilmor's contemporaries they soon discover that this bigger than life cavalier was exactly the way he describes himself. Four Years In The Saddle is an excellent look into the life of a partisan soldier in the Shendadoah Valley. It's fast paced and full of adventure. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Four years in the saddle","review":"Gilmor wrote this memoir while a prisoner at Fort Warren, which presumably limited his ability to check facts. Nevertheless, this is an outstanding source.Starting the war as one of Ashby's cavalrymen, Gilmor then moved to Robertson's command. He operated nearly as a partisan, generally on very detached duty, though with specific orders, sometimes coming from personal interviews with Stonewall Jackson. He gives a pretty good account of the Battle of Cedar Mountain. In the fall of '62 he was captured but was fortunate enough to be exchanged. He claims to have been a witness to Pelham's death in the spring of '63 (although I think I've seen another account which disputes the centrality of his role) and, in an act of macabre Victorian sentimentality, took a piece of skull as a memento.Interesting to scholars of the Confederate cavalry will be the fact that Gilmor reports raiding in the streets of Gettysburg before the battle (so much for \\"Lee had no cavalry\\"). He was involved in the rearguard action at Williamsport. Sometimes his partisan nature got the better of him, and he was court martialled in early '64 for actions involving a train robbery, though he was acquitted. He gives a good account of Early's raid on Washington and the burning of Chambersburg, as well as the destruction of the Valley.This is an exciting account of a hands-on participant who was wounded several times and literally crossed swords with Federals on many occasions. One can read between the lines and judge for oneself how much good this kind of detached quasi-partisan activity really did, but Gilmor's personal dedication is beyond reproach."},{"Title":"We Caught The Fire","review":"This book has changed my family's life and course, and that of many others I know.

It is a serious read, but well written and compelling. I have used chapters from the book in classes I've taught (university level) on children and the media, and the discussions that have followed (about deregulation, commercialism, gender, cultural imperialism...) have been very lively.

Graham was, of course, one of the great innovators of an entirely new genre of artistic expression, modern dance, and she is very open about her constant struggles and triumphs.

They are fascinatingly placed in both personal and historical context.While the content of this book is exceptional and extremely valuable, it is oddly structured, kind of a series of vignettes that are not even broken down into chapters. This was disconcerting to me and it made the thread of her narrative hard to follow at times. It was edited by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, opne of her last books.I recommend it to those already interested, but not to those who are not deeply hooked on dance.

We've borrowed it several times since then. The name is obviously a draw for us, but she also loves the repetition of Ella Sarah's desired outfit (as well as the fact that Ella Sarah is wearing big-girl underpants, though that is never explicitly stated) and that Ella Sarah gets to choose her own clothes in the end. I don't see this as rewarding a tantrum, but rather as recognizing that it's a good thing when your preschooler picks out and puts on her own clothes! My daughter has also named her lovey \\"Ella Sarah\\" -- high praise indeed."},{"Title":"Ella Sarah Gets Dressed","review":"Ella Sarah is a little girl, probably about three or four years old, who definitely has her own sense of style. One day she decides she wants to wear pink polka dot pants, a dress with orange and green flowers, purple and blue striped socks, yellow shoes and a red hat-all at the same time.Her mom, dad and older sister each try to get her to wear clothes that match, but Ella Sarah stands her ground. She dresses herself and is proud of the outfit she has assembled. Later, when her friends come over to play, each of them is attired in his or her own less-than-perfectly matched ensembles.Parents who insist their children wear clothes that match should avoid letting their children read this book. Open-minded and nurturing parents, however, will enjoy sharing this fun story with their children. The brightly colored pictures are visually stimulating and will keep young children interested. They will also learn about colors and naming the different articles of clothing.This book fosters decision-making skills and independence. Letting children express their individuality early in life will help them learn more about who they are as a person. In the long run, they will be better able to make important decisions as they grow up instead of being totally dependent on others.Ella Sarah Gets Dressed is a cute story that also provides an important lesson for both parents and children.Armchair Interviews says: The early life of a fashionista!"},{"Title":"Ella Sarah Gets Dressed","review":"my girls love this book- so cute and enjoyable to read for parents too"},{"Title":"Ella Sarah Gets Dressed","review":"Wonderful little book about being an individual.

My niece dresses up in some pretty interesting outfits and this book speaks directly to that creative behavior. Some have written that this book encourages temper tantrums. Perhaps the more important lesson in this book of 250 words is for parents to \\"let it go\\" if their child wants to express some individuality in a simple and harmless way. Ella Sarah is only looking for an opportunity to express her creativity and parents need to \\"choose their battles'! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Ella Sarah Gets Dressed","review":"This book seems to understand what 2 or 3 year olds are like quite well! They adore saying No, they have strong opinions and they don't like to be told what to do. Ella Sarah wakes up with an idea about the perfect clothes for the day, and she gets her way, and finds that her friends have dressed much like her. My daughter enjoys hearing this book quite often, but mostly for the cat that Ella Sarah holds a lot. That leads me to my only real quibble with this book. It's never quite clear if the cat is real or not, and I am quite sure my almost 3 year old thinks it is. But on one page, Ella tosses the cat across the room. Not to be oversensitive, but that bothers me a bit! It delights my daughter, and she has tried to do the same thing to our cats more than once (both before and after reading this, to be fair) but it seems to illustrate something else about the household shown here---Ella seems a little too in charge. Of course, it's all fiction, and I am probably overanalyzing here!

Other reviewers are right that Ella Sarah does throw a mild tantrum in the book. I personally think it's a great tool for teaching toddlers. Ella Sarah clearly expresses what she wants (a list my 2-year-old daughter knows by heart), and when she is not supported in her wishes by her family members, she goes ahead and dresses herself. I personally think it's a lot better when a toddler can list off exactly what she wants to wear, rather than throw a incomprehensible fit.

It beat such potential contenders as Peter Sis's, \\"Tree of Life\\" and Gerald McDermott's, \\"Creation\\", both far worthier (in my humble opionion) winners. This isn't to say that the book is bad. As a charming tale about a stubborn toddler and her intense desire to wear the clothing of her own choice, the book is sweet and good-natured. Just the same, I was amazed by its reception.As far as the plot goes, it's fairly basic. Ella Sarah plods around the house in her sheep pajamas, a floppity stuffed animal (with the nose and mouth of a martini glass) accompanying her wherever she goes. Right from the start, our heroine knows exactly what kind of clothing she would like to wear. Says she, \\"I want to wear my pink polka-dot pants, my dress with orange-and-green flowers, my purple-and-blue striped socks, my yellow shoes, and my red hat\\". Her mother complains that the outfit is too dressy. She suggests an alternative, which is met with Ella Sarah's reiterated desire. Her father says it's too fancy and she repeats her outfit (this time accompanied by a very realistic tantrumesque stamping on the floor). Her older sister says it's too silly and offers some clothes she's outgrown. Now the stuffed animal goes flying, as Ella Sarah proclaims her perfect outfit for the last time. Carefully she dresses herself in the colorful eclectic ensemble. When the doorbell rings we see that her friends are just as snazzy as our intrepid heroine. And with that, the four friends sit down to tea and donut holes. It is a colorful sight.Cute plot all right, but it's the illustrations that really take your breath away. Using a kind of paper cutout style (the publication page is a little unclear about this, content to merely call the process, \\"a variety of printmaking techniques\\") everyone is presented with a series of rounded colorful forms. We never see the heads of Ella Sarah's parents or older sibling, which makes perfect sense. After all, we're on a toddler's level with this book. No surprise there. Especially enjoyable are the printed backgrounds that make up the wallpaper, bedspreads, and rugs in this story. As for the outfit Ella Sarah eventually dons, it's a pip. If there is an award winning moment in this book then it is the two-page spread of the protagonist doffing a bright red hat. The hat is not only colorful, but also tilted at a rakish angle. It's just a quick moment of kiddie noir before we're back to the usual story.Kids reading this tale will be inspired by it. It has the capacity to not only send a message like, \\"Just be yourself\\" but to also encourage kids to learn how to dress themselves. And heck, any kid with a wardrobe like Ella Sarah and her friends will probably want to learn how to dress forthwith. As you can see, this is a darling tale. It's not the most inspired or original in the world, but it has a very particular knack and charm to it that's adorable. A tale that will entice not only the parents of the world, but their kids as well."},{"Title":"Ella Sarah Gets Dressed","review":"My daughter (2 years old) really loves this book.

WHY? Because throughout the book, Ella Sarah gets her way by being consistantly disobedient to her parents and older sibling, and throws (in my opinion) a temper tantrum to get her way! but in the end her BAD behavior is considered \\"CUTE\\" because after all, its more important to express your individuality.During the reading of this book to my toddler, I had to repeatedly stop and explain to him that he should never act in this way and he is much more likely to get his way by simply asking permission than by making rude demands, throwing his toys, and talking back to get his way.It is very disappointing that a book like this received an acclaimed childrens literature award.

I could read it 10 times a day and they'd be happy. They now really dig tea parties (the non-political kind), too.

My husband actually uses the book as a counter-illustration of proper ways to handle anger and disagreements!

Carson does an amazing job in this book with a penetrating analysis of some of the foundations of the emergent church (I use the term \\"foundations\\" deliberately, as postmodernism can be characterized by anti-foundationalism). Carson uses the term \\"epistemology\\" (how we know what we know, if anything) in enough contexts and with such a teaching gift that I think I understand its meaning after years of quietly refusing to admit my confusion. This is not an easy book to read, and for those of us who didn't study philosophy in college (and didn't do the philosophy kinds of readings in law school), I recommend tackling this book a chapter at a time, interspersed with some kind of a light narrative.As far as usefulness, I think this particular text is a bit dated. It talks about the \\"emerging\\" church without differentiating the \\"emergent\\" stream, which may not have been as necessary in 2005 as I believe it is today. Also, the book focuses on Brian McLaren and Steve Chalke, with attention also to Dan Kimball and a number of figures I didn't recognize. While these figures are still certainly leaders in the emergent conversation, an analysis that includes no reference to Rob Bell is undeniably incomplete. Overall, Carson cleverly deals with a variety of claims made in the emergent conversation, and he is careful to point out its strengths before detailing his concerns. When he is clearly angry, as in his detailed review of A Generous Orthodoxy (around p. 175), Carson still projects his anger in a refined and mannerly way, and no one can reasonably accuse him of being mean in his disagreements.Clearly, Carson does not agree with much of the emergent conversation, and I heartily recommend this book to anyone looking to devote a good deal of intellectual energy to examining the conversation for him/herself."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"I wanted a text book for evening school.

He read many of their writings, and that historically in the church has been arena of theological debate.Carson in several places quickly places this movement (which I would term as \\"heterodox at best, leaning towards heresy at many points\\". He surmises correctly that they distort church history and sound exegesis. He surmises that the Reformation's goal was to attain to true Biblical exegesis and faithful examination of church history, while the emergent movement just wants \\"change\\" not due to careful Biblical exegesis and church history examples, but adding a fourth and foreign sola to the Reformation's three: sola cultura. Culture has become the driving impetus to change, not asking question did God say this should be, or has the church in past exhibited this?Read Os Guiness' wonderful work on this aspect: \\"Prophetic Untimeliness.\\"From ecclesiology to soteriology (look it up, if you're really wanting to be student of Bible) emergent church creates as it goes to overcome cultural relevancy issues. Shouldn't people of God want and demand more of leaders of a movement than this? Carson thinks so, and so does this reviewer.Very readable and researched and referenced work. Compare McLaren who states he will do no such thing, to document his work. Carson's fine examination deserves careful read."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"First let me say that this is a well-written book with a lot of great information and argumentation. But it, in my estimation, ultimately misses the mark it set out to hit.Carson does an excellent job of pointing out the key positive attributes and attainments of EC - authenticity in Christian practice as opposed to consumerism in the megachurch movement and connectivity with the \\"foreign\\" American culture that has not heard the gospel as well as respect for indigenous culture - wherever we find it (even in our own backyards).Further, he goes on to make the helpful distinction of hard and soft postmodernism, with the former being self-refuting and anti-Christian and the latter being an acceptable framework within which to communicate the gospel. The same can be said of hard and soft modernism - with the former being empiricism or logical positivism or materialism and the latter being evidentialism or soft materialism or realistic dualism.However, Carson seems to make a number of subsequent category errors in his trenchant assessment of the emerging church's handling of various doctines and Scriptures.As McLaren and others have pointed out, many of the writers (not least, McLaren himself) Carson harshly critiques are not scholars, but practicing pastors seeking not a theology, but a practical essclesiology in dialogue with contemporary culture, whereas Carson is a hard academician.Based on this and given Carson's handling of his often uncharitable critiques, one might, somewhat sarcastically ask at the outset of this assessment, \\"who has brought more unbelievers to saving faith in Jesus - Carson or McLaren? Who has created a framework for useful and ultimately salvific dialogue with the disenfranchised, alienated, angry and skeptical modern unbeliever - Carson or McLaren?\\"Having said that, albeit with a wink given Carson's own harsh words for McLaren et al, it is accurate to say that Carson specifically raises some questions the EC should respond to. Note that none of these have anything to do, Carson's assertions to the contrary, with postmodernist epistemology, but with hermeneutic requirements and the view of Scripture held by those involved in the debate.Carson argues that at the root of his concerns with McLaren's positions on a variety of issues is an epistemological dead-end rooted in hard postmodernism.But this seems disingenuous at best since both McLaren and Carson categorize McLaren and many of the other EC leaders Carson discusses as \\"soft\\" postmodernists - a category that Carson admits is an acceptable, if somewhat distasteful (at least to Carson), framework for rehanging the gospel message.Further, McLaren has gone to great lengths to address the accusations of relativism and pluralism and has firmly denied them both. But Carson reinterprets the pastoral writing of McLaren and reads into it epistemological and theological meaning McLaren likely never intended. The straw man carefully constructed, Carson then sets about tearing it limb from limb.At issue here, really, is not epistemology at all. The difference between McLaren and Carson has nothing to do with Richard Rorty and Rene Descartes and Aristotle. The issue is their respective views of Scripture - or, at least, specific passages of Scripture.The specific issues Carson has are McLaren's supposed positions (or lack of a clear position) on homosexuality, substitutionary atonement, and the position of other religions and whether they have any redemptive value whatsoever.Carson works hard to root his disagreements with McLaren's (lack of) positions on these issues in epistemological terms, but they are really hermeneutical disagreements entirely.McLaren, like many people today, struggles with the traditional reading of Scripture on a variety of topics - the three listed above being writ large among them. But one doesn't need degrees in either philosophy or history to recognize (and Carson himself points this out repeatedly vis &aacute; vis the Creedal statements) that this has little to do with epistemology.Two centuries or less ago, the issues were slavery and the position of women. Good people (all \\"modernists\\"?) disagreed. The traditional conservatives arguing that the Scripture was silent on slavery (or, at least, on whether it was sinful) and was clear on gender (women were subordinate). The \\"new thinkers\\" believed, following Wilburforce for example, that slavery was wrong and sinful - though to argue so from Scripture took, both then and now, quite a bit of contortion. Later, the gender issue would require even more contortion and \\"culturization\\" of particularly troubling passages of Scripture.Carson readily points out how the Creeds were comprised entirely of disputed claims - disputed among believers. Yet he scolds McLaren for daring to hold out the possibility that some of our current, dominant views on some issues of doctrine may need reevaluation - and that modern culture may have had some providential role in \\"opening our eyes\\" to this possibility - just as \\"modern culture\\" in the 18th and 19th Centuries was opening eyes on slavery in light of Scripture and in 19th and 20th centuries was opening eyes on gender issues in light of Scripture.None of these disagreements have anything whatsoever to do with epistemology, but Carson holds to this tack instead of addressing these as disagreements over interpretations of Scripture. This is especially interesting since Carson ladles out his harshest criticisms of McLaren where Carson contends McLaren is glossing over Scripture and refusing to deal with texts honestly - yet Carson refuses, it seems, to acknowledge that McLaren is merely raising questions about issues that have been disputed for centuries and are currently coming into renewed debate.Carson's arguments for substitutionary atonement, the sinfulness of homosexuality and the dogmatism and exclusivity of the Christian church over and opposed to any other faith may all be correct and right. Or, perhaps, McLaren is raising some valid questions on these issues - though, again, McLaren is offering a pastoral view of the questions he is asked and how he responds to them in a pastoral setting, not developing a systematic theology.This discussion should take place and should continue. But unfortunately Carson entirely misses this category error (epistemology v. hermenuetics) and lumps McLaren's concerns into the tin with postmodernism and casts the lot onto the rubbish heap.He sets out to discuss what's right and wrong with EC, but because of obviously deep-seated and heartfelt passions about particular doctrines and some modern conversations about them, he strays far from his chosen topic and attempts to answer a question he has not rightly raised, leaving the reader with not only a grossly misshapen picture of the EC and postmodernism, but without a better understanding of the very debates Carson is so passionate to see won in his favor."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"Penetrating and incisive evaluation of aberrancies of those like B.McLaren who come across as progressive evangelicals but are actually anti-Gospelers with a new way of salvation as redefined for a contemporary taste. Most emergents are absolutely unaware of B.McLaren's real agenda and have not read his books closely.Take Generous Orthodoxy for instance. B.McLaren claims to be 'missional'. But what does he mean by that? Evangelicals who read that assume 'Great Commissional': spreading the Gospel of Jesus' salvation from sin by the cross and resurrection that transforms lives in right relations and agape love for God and others as evidence of conversion/rebirth in the Spirit. Of course this has social and societal and cultural implications to help the poor and befriend sinners the way Jesus did all with the motive to lead the lost into right relationship with God through Christ alone by faith alone. We are to be fishers of men on search and rescue mission to deliver people from God's judgment and wrath by God's love and grace. Only the Passover Lamb's sacrifice makes that possible.But how does B.McLaren define his missionality? Almost like a Utopianism of progressive human development toward the divine using Jesus' way as example and model. Save civilization, save the earth, save the environment, save cultures, save religion, save humanity as a whole, save history, all the while downplaying saving the rebellious sinning soul from a real Satan and terminal sin and eternal judgment. Social Gospel by another name is the New Kind of Christian activism by gradual evolution, emergence, progression, incremental accretion of Jesus' Kingdom principles applied by any who will implement them regardless of religious affiliation without renouncing of false gods. Even pagans or idolaters can be 'good theists' as opposed to 'bad monotheists' by practicing a lifestyle patterned after Jesus' teachings of love, acceptance, tolerance, inclusiveness, broadmindedness, embrasure, focus on THIS world vs. some sort of after life. THIS life is the point, not the next!B.McLaren's missional creed seems to be to heavenize or kingdomize planet earth in history: your Kingdom come, your will be done on EARTH as in heaven. Sort of creating a millennial kingdom of peace, justice, elimination of war, unifying mankind, uniting religions in common beyondward,upward and onward emerging all-encompassing truth-adventure. Sin in this scenario is seen as merely the failure to emerge, develop, evolve, cooperate with integrating all religious truth into utopian progression toward an ideal world down here right now - all in Jesus' name of course without excluding or necessarily converting non-Christ or un-Bible or anti-Jesus people.It is respectfully urged that all those sympathetic with B.McLaren's brand of missional emergence-toward-Kingdom-Utopia, post-modernist bloggers, leaders in emergent churches, give Dr. Carson's insights and critiques a fair hearing and compare with Scripture like the Bereans. Think again about what B.McLaren is preaching, who says, \\"Missional Christian faith asserts that Jesus did not come to make some people saved and others condemned.\\"Au contraire, mon ami. What did Jesus Himself have to say about the genuine, real deal commissional Christian faith that directly contradicts B.McLaren's ultra-modernized version?\\"For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through Him. Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. This is the judgment verdict: Light has come into the world but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil...Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever disobeys the Son will not see life for God's wrath remains abidingly on him...Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.\\""},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"This is essential reading for anyone on the outside looking in that wants to know more about the \\"Emerging Church.\\" Dr. Carson explains what the \\"Emerging Church\\" is and explains it's philosophical foundation, postmodernism.

Carson always impressed me ever since I visited his class when shopping around for a Seminary to attend in the mid 70s. A lexical mind bordering on brilliant at his worse, Carson engages in the topic in a fashion that will allow you to make a decision. He does make some claims but tells you when he does that. It is a well done guide book to the movement. Personally, I think he nails the topic rather well and helps to validate to the movment some essentials which they do lack. In my own book, \\"Under Orders: A Spiritual Handbook for Military Personnel\\" available here on Amazon too, I also engage the post-modern phenomenon associated with the thinking process of our culture today. While my emphasis is on practical theology, I essentially affirm Carson's viewpoint in my own words, \\"post modern thought brings much to the table but needs the balance of sacred text and historical precedence for continuity and orthodoxy.\\" In all, good stuff and worth having!"},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"Three months ago, I was at a Q&A; session at Southern Theological Seminary, and the panel, which included Seminary President Dr. Albert Moehler, was asked about the Emerging Church Movement. Moehler commented that to some churches, replacing the piano and organ with a praise band is being emergent. Others claim that title because they are legitimately disillusioned with the traditional church. Still others latch on to this movement because of a heart of evangelism to today's society. He had no problem with these; his problem is when it affects doctrine. One of the other panelists recommended this book.One thing I look for in reading a book is how broad a brush the writer uses. Does he put everyone in the same category, or does he identify the variations and praise the good as well as criticize what isn't? Dr. Carson succeeds at this, though one improvement would be to use this later in the book just as a reminder. He points out that the movement is so varied that neither his praises or his problems apply to every emergent church.He has an orderly and logical progression to his book, moving from defining the movement, praising its strengths (which he points out that are not exclusive to the movement), and then moving to its criticisms, with a parenthetical introduction to post-moderninsm and its relation to this movement.The bottom line is that this movement has a problem with truth. Every other shortcoming is tied in to this. Carson deals with the problems in the movement as a whole and in two representative books by perceived leaders of the group, before pointing out what Scripture has to say about it.Is this the best book on the movement? Having read only one, I cannot answer the question. Do I recommend this book? Yes. It is a great introduction, though it requires you wear your thinking cap when reading it; it took me a while to work through some sections because of its depth."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"Don Carson, Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and its Implications (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2005)Reviewed by Darren CronshawCarson suggests the emerging church movement has both worrying weaknesses and important things to contribute to the rest of the Christian world. He describes it as a protest movement, recognising many emerging leaders are seeking to move on, because of changing times, from traditional evangelicalism, modernism, and seeker-sensitive megachurch models. Carson appreciates the emerging church desire to engage popular culture and to reach those outside church. Yet he suggests some writers are too quick to dismiss the contributions of modernity and confessional Christianity, too eager to (uncritically) accept postmodernism, and too intellectually shallow to avoid false dichotomies. He agrees that we need to take postmodernism seriously, but appeals for more penetrating and biblical analysis, and more attention to truth claims as well as experience. Though his critique is noticeably selective, his questions and challenges are worth reading and discussing. We do need a firm commitment to truth and Scripture as well as experience and cultural engagement, and how we hold those in tension is worth reflecting on.

Makes crystal clear that Brian MacLaren, if his words and books mean anything, has largely abandoned Jesus' Gospel as Lamb of God taking away the sin (disobedience, unrighteousness, alienation from a Holy God, commandment-breaking lawlessness) of the world.Since Brian fails to get the Gospel even close, actually distorting and perverting it into a geo-gospel of global soul evolution into ultimate gnosis (secret wisdom from beyond), his false prophesying falls under Paul's condemnation: \\"I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the One Who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a hetero-gospel which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some are throwing you into confusion and trying to pervert Christ's genuine Gospel. But if anybody (Brian or whoever) is preaching a gospel other than what was originally accepted, let him be eternally condemned!\\"Thank you for showing by heretics' own writings that by their very words they condemn themselves unless they recant, renounce and retract what they have incriminated themselves by publicly in print. May our Lord's mercy as a wake-up call in this soul-saving book lead self-deceived Brian and his cohorts to humbly repent of their NeoGnosticism that leads thousands astray into darkness' pasture of Satan's so-called deep secrets that Jesus warned Thyatira about."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"Wonderful book! Explains the internally fatal problem with emergent-detergent 'gospel' that has infiltrated much of evangelical thinking through the agency of Rev. McLaren, Chalke & other preachers who have strayed far from Jesus' original message by laundering the Kingdom's heaven-or-hell ultimatum into a mancentered earthbound dialogue of talking points for discussion. When Jesus as God-Man King of Kings proclaimed and executed the Good News of the Kingdom, it was not an invitation to debate or disputation or discussion or parlay or compromised negotiation or collective bargaining on earthlings' terms. It was a 911 emergency call to repentance from commandment-breaking wickedness and dire warning to avoid eternal punishment and last-chance invitation to Kingdom-life now and forever with the Saviour from Sin and perdition and a real literal devil who is out to destroy and deceive souls. Carson shows how McLaren/Chalke & certain misguided co-prophets have redefined and deconstructed and desecrated the Absolute Certain Settled Once for All Original Historic Gospel of the Passover Lamb into a novel, evolving \\"Lost Secret Message of Jesus\\" antithetical to the Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ.This is the most helpful and accurate book on the subject yet seen that unmasks the new-kind-of-christianism which looks like a lamb but speaks like a dragon (Rev. 13:11). Carson spot on pastorally demonstrates how (mis)leading voices in post-certaintism are less an emerging church than a diverging from ecclesia. The book is a great stimulus to pray for mercy and repentance for those authors, leaders, followers who employ rhetorical exegesis of secular intellectualism and eastern mysticism to dysinterpret God's Omni-certain Word from His Very Mouth ending up sadly with a man's uncertain word gone south."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"DA Carson reminds us Christians once again the need to engage in our culture.

Other names are mentioned, but his main target is McLaren. I believe the title is a little misleading. Carson comes off very condescending at times. And reading his work can be excruciating.To single out one person for the \\"emerging church\\" is as dishonest as singling out Jerry Falwell for the \\"traditional church\\".I was frustrated that it seems that he has never been to an \\"emerging church\\" worship gathering and even the one lecture that he critiqued, he wasn't even there at it! It seems that if you are going to write a book about a subject, you should do more than rely on a few books.I am part of the \\"emerging church\\", and I for one don't consider Brian to be the foremost speaker for us. He is one voice, but one among many.On the positive side, he does send up some warning flags for the \\"emerging church\\", and I think that we need to be careful not to swing the pendulum too far in responding to modernism.

The second chapter should be studied because it reflects correct methods of applying the Gospel by any Christian group. His warnings in the later chapters are to be heeded.

Imagine a rapist saying to his victim, \\"Let us agree to disagree while we continue to fellowship.\\" It is the same old distortion, \\"Did God really say...?\\" Inch by inch they hope to trash biblical authority, morality, and the person of Jesus Christ.

Carson has numerous footnotes to help the reader see where the quotes are coming from.The book is quite loving in its approach. Dr. Carson does not seek to tear down the emerging movement but he does seek to expose both its strengths and weaknesses. He does this with much grace. Dr. Carson is not blind to what the emerging church movement can teach the evangelical church but he does not hesitate to point out where the movement falls short by testing it with the Word of God. Truth, writes Carson, is not optional nor is it fuzzy. Truth comes directly from God and it contained in the Bible. Everything must conform itself to the Scriptures or it will not stand at all.I greatly enjoyed this work. Having read much of emerging church authors and visiting various emerging web-sites, I found Carson's work to be a prophetic voice in our age. I highly recommend this work to every disciple of Jesus."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"While much has been written about the Emerging Church (henceforth known as EC), D.A. Carson is, as far as I know, the first person to write a book-length treatment evaluating and leveling critiques at the movement. At any rate he is certainly the most widely-respected. And yes, I know the EC leaders prefer to call it a \\"conversation,\\" but since Carson does not shy from calling it a movement, nor will I. In Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church, subtitled \\"Understanding a Movement and its Implications,\\" Carson seeks to introduce the movement, assess it, and address several of the most glaring weaknesses. There are few men who are better suited to this task. Carson is a scholar and is known for his conservative, biblical theology as much as for his sound research and presentation skills. All of those admirable attributes are displayed throughout this book.In the preface Carson writes, \\"Whenever a Christian movement comes along that presents itself as reformist, it should not be summarily dismissed. Even if one ultimately decides that the movement embraces a number of worrying weaknesses, it may also have some important things to say that the rest of the Christian world needs to hear. So I have tried to listen respectfully and carefully; I hope and pray that the leaders of this \\"movement\\" will similarly listen to what I have to say\\" (page 10). That spirit of love and charity pervades the book.The book follows a logical format - introduction, admiration, criticism. The first chapter, \\"The Emerging Church Profile,\\" is an uncritical summary of the Emerging Church. Carson arrives at three conclusions. First, the EC must be evaluated as to its reading of contemporary culture. Second, the EC needs to be evaluated as to its beliefs regarding Scripture. Third, the EC's proposals for moving forward in this postmodern culture need to be examined.The second chapter examines the strengths of the Emerging Church. Carson praises four aspects of the EC. First, they are adept at reading the times and know that the presentation of the Gospel must change with the times. Second, they value authenticity. Third, they recognize the social location of the church, and know that the church is within a cultural context and cannot be removed from it. Fourth, they place high value on evangelism. Fifth, that they probe tradition and seek to build a faith that is rooted in the past while still being relevant to the present.Having shown the strengths of the EC, Carson turns to several weaknesses in the third chapter. He critiques their evaluation and denigration of modernism, their condemnation of confessional Christianity and accuses them of having a view of Christianity under modernism that is both theologically shallow and intellectually incoherent.The fourth chapter serves as an introduction to postmodernism and the postmodern mindset. For those who are unfamiliar with the changing times, and our society's emerging epistemology, this chapter is a valuable introduction.Carson goes on, in chapters five, six and seven to critique the Emerging Church's response to postmodernism. He is especially critical of the EC's handling of truth, and frustrated by their refusal to deal with the tough questions. He finds that more often than not, the EC leaders refuse to deal with the tough questions related to claims of absolute truth. He is also concerned with the EC's stubborn refusal to use Scripture as the norming norm against appeals to tradition, as well as the EC's emphasis on \\"belonging before believing.\\" He deals with two books in some depth - Brian McLaren's A Generous Orthodoxy as well as Steve Chalke's The Lost Message of Jesus, thus representing leaders of the Emerging Church on both sides of the Atlantic. Carson arrives at a chilling conclusion. \\"I have to say, as kindly but as forcefully as I can, that to my mind, if words mean anything, both McLaren and Chalke have largely abandoned the Gospel...I cannot see how their own words constitute anything less than a drift toward abandoning the gospel itself\\" (page 186-187).The book concludes with a list of relevant Bible passages and \\"A Biblical Meditation on Truth and Experience.\\" He closes with a challenge. \\"So which shall we choose? Experience or truth? Damn all false antitheses to hell, for they generate false gods, they perpetuate idols, they twist and distort our souls, they launch the church into violent pendulum swings whose oscillations succeed only in dividing brothers and sisters in Christ...If emerging church leaders wish to become a long-term prophetic voice that produces enduring fruit and that does not drift off toward progressive sectarianism and even, in the worst instances, outright heresy, they must listen at least as carefully to criticisms of their movement as they transparently want others to listen to them...If they manage this self-correction and worry less about who is or who is not emergent and rather more about learning simultaneously to be faithful to the Bible and effective in evangelizing the rising number of alienated biblical illiterates in our culture, they may end up preserving the gains of their movement while helping brothers and sisters who are more culturally conservative than they are learn to reconnect with the culture.\\" (page 234).Carson faced a great difficulty in this book. How does one fairly and adequately critique a movement as eclectic as the Emerging Church? Many have criticized this movement for being so hard to pin down. Carson admits that not every critique he makes will be valid for every person who considers himself a part of this \\"conversation.\\" Yet I feel that McLaren did as well as could be expected, focusing the majority of his attention on those who have the majority of the influence.My concerns with the book are twofold. First, while the Emerging Church is emerging at the popular level, this book is written to appeal more to scholars and to those who are well-versed in theology than to the neophyte. If it is true, as Carson claims, that most Emerging leaders come from a fundamentalist background, then perhaps this is appropriate. But I am not sure that this book offers a lot by way of popular appeal. If your teenage son has become enamored with an Emerging Church while at college, I do not know that this book will interest him or convince him to re-examine his church. That being said, he was not Carson's target audience for Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church. I have little doubt that the majority of the major players leading the Emergent conversation will read and absorb this book. I pray that the Spirit works in their hearts to humble themselves before the Word, that they can test what Carson says in the light of Scripture.My second concern is that Carson does not address in any depth some of the major concerns of believers who examine this movement from the outside. Among these are the mysticism and ecumenism that seem foundational to the Emerging Church.This book is surely the most valuable contribution available to us in challenging the Emerging Church. Carson evaluates the EC in the light of Scripture, showing where it falls far short and providing suggestions for appropriate remedies. This book succeeds in its task and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"Great primer in understanding the strengths and very serious weeknesses of the Emerging church movement. Anyone who wants to understand how postmodernism is affecting this segment of the evangelical church will benefit from Carson's balanced and penetrating critique.

Rodden"},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in who and what the Emergent Church movement is. In my opinion, it is the most comprehensive and trenchant popular-level critique of the movement to date. Carson has taken the time to read the major works and authors within the Emergent conversation, and based on several anecdotes related in the book, he has engaged many forums and individuals within the movement. As a result, Carson deals fairly and charitably with the people and the positives of the theology and philosophy, and also has a solid footing for his critique.A crucial point of contention with Carson is what he calls the \\"wretched antithesis.\\" Within postmodern philosophy, a typical dichotomy is that because we cannot be omniscient knowers, we must therefore be skeptical of all possible knowledge. Unfortunately, Emergent picks up on this false dichotomy and fails to give appropriate emphasis to truth claims (however analogous, modest or straight-forward they may be) in Scripture. I have also found it true that Emergent authors and pastors are unwilling to deal in terms of \\"truth\\" even though Scripture is not afraid to do so.Carson's call is not for a nasty end to Emergent, despite some of his detractors. His call is for a real and honest dealing with the role of theology within the Church, and for Emergent to answer some of these serious critiques. A great deal of Emergent thought is content to \\"ask questions\\" and thus feel vindicated in their apparent profundity. Carson, and so many others, just want some substantive answers to serious questions."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"Don Carson, research professor of New Testament at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, has done the church a great service in this recent overview and assessment of \\"the emergent church,\\" a movement which is fast gaining momentum in evangelical culture, especially with the younger generation. Writing with both years of biblical faithfulness and a keen insight into culture to his credit, Carson presents a carefully written synopsis and evaluation of the emerging church which is both appreciative and critical. \\"Whenever a Christian movement comes along that presents itself as reformist,\\" Carson writes, \\"it should not be summarily dismissed. Even if one ultimately decides that the movement embraces some worrying weaknesses, it may also have some important things to say that the rest of the Christian world needs to hear\\" (10). Carson succeeds in both listening to the important things the emerging church leaders are saying, and bringing Scripture to bear on their worrying weaknesses.Chapter one gives a profile of the emerging church, with Carson assuming little to no acquaintance with the emerging church from his readers. Carson has obviously done his homework on the \`conversation,' as his numerous references to writings by Brian McLaren, Dan Kimball, Mike Yaconelli, Spencer Burke, Leonard Sweet, Robert Webber, Dave Tomlinson, and others reveals. \\"At the heart of the emerging reformation lies a perception of a major change in culture\\" (42). This perception has led many of the emerging church leaders into protest - protest against modernism, and both traditional and pragmatic (i.e. seeker-sensitive) evangelicals, who (in their estimation) are becoming increasingly irrelevant in our rapidly changing culture. Very little appreciation or criticism is offered at this point. Instead, Carson insists that \\"the emerging church movement must be evaluated as to its reading of contemporary culture\\" (43), while its \\"proposals for the way ahead must be assessed for their biblical fidelity\\" (44).The second chapter focuses on the strengths of the movement. In the author's view, some of those strengths include:* Its honest attempts \\"to read the culture in which we find ourselves and to think through the implications of such a reading for our witness, our grasp of theology, our churchmanship, even our self understanding\\" (45);* Its push for authenticity in our corporate worship of God (49-51);* Its recognition of our own social location, that is that \\"we ourselves are part of this rapidly changing culture, and we cannot help but be influenced by it\\" (51);* Its concern for \\"evangelizing people who are often overlooked by the church\\" (52);* And its \\"probing links with the [Christian] tradition\\" (54), casting off some traditions that are deemed unhelpful and wrong while remaining open to exploring practices that belong to the larger swath of Christendom (a strength that is also at times a weakness).But while all of these things are positive traits within the emergent church, for which we should be thankful, Carson concludes by describing one church which embodies all of these characteristics, but which is not likely to be identified with the emerging church movement. The point being, that \\"the emerging church movement has numerous strengths, and we should be grateful for them - but they are not exclusively theirs\\" (56).Next is Carson's summary of the emerging church's analysis of contemporary culture. \\"This exercise is important because the emerging church leaders themselves ground their call to reformation in cultural changes taking place around us\\" (57). Several criticisms of this analysis are offered. First, Carson points out that emergent leaders tend to be overly reductionistic in their understanding of modernism. \\"The modern period is treated as if it were all of a piece, consistently devoted to the rational, the cerebral, the linear, the absolute, the objective. But history isn't that neat\\" (59). This misreading of modernism is especially troubling because of the emerging movement's tendency to unfairly criticize and almost universally condemn confessional Christianity. This is Carson's second criticism. \\"In my reading of the emerging church literature, Christianity under modernism is rationalistic, cerebral rather than emotional, and given toward arrogance because of its absolutism\\" (60). Of course, examples of such can be found, but this has certainly not been universally true of all Christians within modernism. There are also examples of Christians whose firm beliefs were matched with fervent devotion to Christ. (As a case in point, Carson provides a lengthy quotation from Spurgeon.) Third, Carson takes issue with the emerging movement because its condemnation of confessional Christianity is often theologically shallow and intellectually incoherent. \\"It is theologically shallow because it overlooks the basic fact that no worldview, no epistemological system developed by us in a fallen world, is entirely good or entirely bad . . . It is intellectually incoherent because, in the spirit of postmodern toleration, most emergent publications go out of their way to find good things about every other \`ism'. . . . The one \`ism' about which some appear to find it almost impossible to say anything positive, especially in the publications of emergent leaders, is modernism (as they understand it)\\" (68-69). Carson also surveys the movements analysis of postmodernism, and confesses that \\"in many aspects [he] agrees with [their] understanding\\" (75). But he does feel that they appeal too much and too carelessly to the buzz word \\"postmodernism\\" - especially given the fact that in popular culture the word (and other accompanying nomenclature) means different things to different people, while \\"in academic circles, the subject is beginning to look pass&eacute;\\" (81). To lump all social changes under this one rubric, decreases the credibility of the emerging church's analysis. And the claim that, with postmodernism, the age of authentic Christianity has arrived betrays a lack of evenhanded evaluation. Some writers need to tone down their rhetoric.Very helpful is Carson's \\"personal reflections on postmodernism's contributions and challenges\\" in the fourth chapter. While this chapter requires the most effort, it is probably the most rewarding, as Carson defines and contrasts the epistemologies of premodernism, modernism, and postmodernism. In short, premodern epistemology said \\"knowledge depends on revelation - i.e. on God disclosing some part of what he knows, however that revelation is accomplished\\" (88). Modern epistemology, \\"a label commonly applied to the epistemology of the Western world from about the beginning of the seventeenth century until a few decades ago\\" (92), begins with man instead of God (Descartes' \\"I think, therefore I am\\") and claims that the right foundation plus the correct method would invariable yield objective truth (92-95). Postmodern epistemology, like that of modernism, begins with the finite \\"I,\\" but draws very different conclusions. It is \\"passionately anti-foundationalist,\\" meaning that \\"there is no ultimate fulcrum on which the levers of knowledge can rest\\" (97) and it \\"insists that there are many methods [of knowing], all of which produce distinguishable results and none of which is any more or less \`true' than the results produced by the other methods\\" (97). \\"Objective knowledge is neither attainable nor desirable\\" and under this regime, truth \\"cannot partake of ahistorical universality\\" (97). With postmodernism come several correlatives (syncretism, secularization, biblical illiteracy, ill-defined spirituality, and globalization) and entailments (98-102). Carson then details both strengths and weaknesses in postmodern epistemology, and helpfully distinguishes between what he calls hard and soft postmodernism. Hard postmodernism concludes that \\"human beings cannot have objective knowledge about anything\\" (105), while soft postmodernism, admitting that human knowledge is necessarily perspectival, still insists that \\"we can in measure approach the truth in some objective sense\\" (105-106). The appropriate place of \\"critical realism\\" (110-111) needs to be recognized and new models for helping us think explored (116-122).Chapter five contains Carson's most detailed critique of the emerging church movement itself. He voices five criticisms, all of them related to the movement's handling of truth-related issues. They are (1) their failure to come to terms with the importance of non-omniscient truth-claims (126-132); (2) their failure to face the tough questions especially if they are truth related (132-138); (3) their failure to use Scripture as the norming norm over against an eclectic appeal to tradition (139-146); (4) their failure to handle \\"becoming\\" and \\"belonging\\" tensions in a biblically faithful way (146-155); and (5) their failure to handle facts, both exegetical and historical in a responsible way (155-156). Chapter six specifies this critique by carefully examining two significant books, Brian McLaren's A Generous Orthodoxy and Steven Chalke's The Lost Message of Jesus. Carson's criticisms are irenic and charitable in tone, though he doesn't hesitate to call these authors on the carpet where he deems it warranted by Scripture.Finally, in chapters seven and eight Carson points his readers to some biblical passages to help us in our evaluation of postmodernism and the emergent church. He lists over 120 passages (some more helpful than others) relevant to truth, knowledge, and pluralism (188-202), then briefly comments on ten texts that are particularly insightful for this discussion (202-217), and concludes with an excellent biblical meditation on truth and experience, grounded in a chapter-length exposition of 2 Peter 1. Scripture, subject, and name indices are included at the end of the book.Having been both stirred and troubled in reading several books on postmodernism and the emergent church, I came to this book with high hopes of being guided by this biblically faithful, contemporary scholar. I was not disappointed. Carson helped clarify my understanding of both modernism and postmodernism, seemed to resonate with the emergent church in some of its positive features, and was well able to articulate the cautions I have intuitively felt in my own reading. His research is impeccable, his knowledge of Scripture profound, his love for the church obvious, and his critique insightful. All of that to say this: if you only read one book on postmodernism and the emergent church, read this one."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"Carson is a respected scholar who has fairly articulated both the strengths and concerning weaknesses of the emerging church distinctives. This book could be particularly helpful to young pastors who take the time to critically think through both the tension of being simultaneously faithful to Scripture and fruitful in culture. Carson has rightly shown how the emerging church has raised some very important and necessary questions while also occasionally providing biblically aberrant answers. Ideally, this book will correct emerging error and help the movement to continue to emerge into a mature and theologically faithful movement with the humility to receive correction as needed for the well being of the forward progress of the gospel in todays world."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"After reading a few of the reviews, it makes me wonder if the reviewers actually read the book, especially those who claimed that Dr Carson was misrepresenting the movement. Of course it always true when critiquing a movement as diverse as the Emergent Church your comments will not apply to all. Dr. Carson makes this point on a number of occasions, so yes, not every critique applies to every adherent of the Emergent movement. However, with that said it is very good critique of some of the major players and some of their major works. One thing I have notice in reading this book and \\"The Church in Emergent Culture\\" is that these only have a surface level understanding of postmodernism, modernism, and the Scriptures. Often they make comments or critique of modernism however it is shown that what they are critiquing pre-dates modernism. Dr. Carson shows this as well as Michael Horton in the other book I mentioned. It is also ironic that Dr(?) McLaren and others scream about misrepresentation, but when you hear their critiques of conservative Evangelicals you realize how hypocritical the complaints are. The Emergent movement says many harsh and unfair that only would apply to the worst wing of conservative Protestantism, but they apply it to Protestantism in general. They then offer a cure that is as worst as the current ailment. Dr Carson, a great exegete, shows that their handling of modern, postmodernism, and the Scriptures are sophomoric at best. Get the book!"},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"This is Brian McLaren, the person who is named in Dr. Carson's book.Another reviewer spoke with me at the Cornerstone Festival and wrote a review on this page. I just wanted to clarify two things.1. As I understand it, some others who were named in the book - but I was not one of them - attempted to talk with Dr. Carson before this book was published, hoping that he would truly become conversant with us by visiting at least a few of our churches and conversing in person. Those invitations were not accepted. As the reviewer said, I felt this was unfortunate, and many of the misunderstandings in the book could have been clarified if there had been actual conversation - but again, I was not one of the people who attempted to contact Dr. Carson before the book's release.2. Although I had not attempted to contact Dr. Carson before the Cornerstone Festival, I have attempted to contact him since, and I'm glad to say that he responded promptly and has expressed willingness to converse further. I am hopeful that these conversations will remove misunderstandings and make points of agreement and disagreement more clear.I didn't want Dr. Carson to be misrepresented by the other review on this page. (Paul, if you see this - perhaps you could edit your review to reflect this clarification.)In order to post this correction, I need to offer a rating. I've given the book 3 stars because, although I believe the book misinterprets my friends and me on some important points, it opens up important space for dialogue - and it offers some criticism which will be constructive and helpful. The book concludes with the hope that those of us in the emergent conversation will be open to correction, and I hope readers will be assured that we welcome critique, and will seek to learn from it all we can."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"The whirlwind of blogs, web articles, and conversations about the Emerging Church has left many Christians confused and curious about what the Emerging is and what its purpose is. D.A. Carson offers a book that approaches the big picture of the Emerging Church within a postmodern culture.Carson starts his book by giving a broad profile of the Emerging Church. He has to repeatedly admit to being broad because much of the topic at hand is broad already. He states, \\"At the heart of this \\"movement\\" - or as some of its leaders prefer to call it, the \\"conversation\\" - lies the conviction that changes in the culture signal that a new church is \\"emerging.\\" Christian leaders must therefore adapt to this emerging church. Those who fail to do so are blind to the cultural accretions that hide the gospel behind forms of thought and modes of expression that no longer communicate with the new generation, the emerging generation.\\"(12) He explores the works of many of the more well known and revered Emerging leaders such as: Chris Seay, Brian McLaren, Tony Jones, Todd Hunter, Henri Nouwen, Spencer Burke, and more. Carson closes his opening chapter by concluding that, \\"...the emerging church movement challenges, on biblical grounds, some of the beliefs and practices of evangelicalism, by and large it insists it is preserving traditional confessionalism but changing the emphases because the culture has changed, and so inevitably those who are culturally sensitive see things in a fresh perspective. In other words, at the heart of the emerging reformation lies a perception of a major change in culture.\\"(42)In chapters 2-5 Carson points out some of the good qualities in the Emerging Church movement by examining it's questions and analyses. He spends much of his time quoting and examining the thoughts of the Emergent leaders. If you are seeking answers about what some of the core thoughts of the Emergent Church are, then these chapters will give you a startling glimpse. Carson is quick to applaud those who ask good questions, but he is just as quick to cut them down logically and biblically when reductionism or manipulation of the truth is present. He is also quick to point out the lack of uniqueness in some of the questions or assertions that are being stated as if they've never been uttered before: \\"the emerging church movement has numerous strengths, and we should be grateful for them - but they are not exhaustively theirs.\\"(56) Carson also makes sure to tear down the broad stroke scare tactics that many Emerging leaders use: \\"the rhetoric of these discussions is almost always over the top: the church must adapt to the postmodern world or it will die; unless we get on board with the direction of the emerging church movement, we are probably out-of-date modernists and absolutists to boot - all set forth in absolutist terms.\\"(84)Chapter 6 is when D.A. Carson really gets the axe swinging. He postulates that a good and concise approach at showing some of the weaknesses within the Emerging movement would come from analyzing and examining two significant books. The two books examined are: A Generous Orthodoxy by Brian McLaren and The Lost Message of Jesus by Steve Chalke. The quotes Carson pulls from each book are startling in light of the up rise in praise and admiration of both books. Quotes like the one from Brian McLaren's preface, \\"Beyond all these warnings, you should know that I am horribly unfair in this book, lacking all scholarly objectivity and evenhandedness.\\"(158) Carson accuses McLaren of disarming the reader with an over-the-top mea culpa while \\"repeatedly painting all of confessional evangelicalism with the narrowness of the most conservative twig of the most conservative bunch.\\"(159) It would seem after such a ridiculous preface that nobody would get to the first chapter of McLaren's book which leads me to believe that Carson's assertion about \\"disarming the reader\\" must be true to some degree, judging from the consistent praise and admiration people give the book.Carson spends 24 pages exposing the major problems with McLaren's book, so quoting anymore would be over kill, read the book. However, Carson only needed to spend 3 pages dealing with Chalke's book, due to the ridiculous nature of the content within it. This quote should be all you need to see why: Chalke speaks about God, \\"The Bible in fact never defines him as anything other than love. But more than that, it never makes assertions about his anger, power or judgment independently of his love.\\"(183) Any biblical scholar or junior high youth attendee knows this statement to be utterly false. D.A. Carson should be applauded for the patience he must have exercised while penning the three pages dedicated to dismantling the fallacious and repugnant statements of Steve Chalke. I'll leave the other statements to be read by curious readers, but take my word for it, they get worse.The final two chapters of D.A Carson's book are like a breath of fresh air. He exegetes enough Scripture passages to last a month of study and reading while dealing with many of the topics needed to be addressed within the postmodern culture. Those who might think Carson leaves you with nothing more than the sinking ship of the Emerging Church will be pleasantly surprised with his approach at dealing with the questions proposed by the movement. This book is worth the read for anyone seeking to be educated on what the Emerging Church is saying, and what the Christian should take from it... the good and the bad."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"While Emergent church adherents will not care much for Carson's critique of their amorphous articulation (or lack thereof) of Christian orthodoxy, what they must not ignore is his cogent case that they are not in line with the Bible's own notion of truth and knowledge. The bottom line is that the emergent church is more concerned about responding to contemporary cultural changes than it is seriously grappling with the biblical/apostolic witness. Carson does a superb job of demonstrating this. I doubt we will see any biblically-oriented refutations of Carson coming around the pike any time soon--probably just more of the same irrational, pomo ranting. At any rate, everyone on both sides of this debate must read this book."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"Brian McLaren calls himself \\"post-Protestant\\" and others have talked about our society as \\"post-Christian.\\" I identify as \\"post-postmodern\\" and \\"post-emerging.\\" There was a time of several years that, while terribly discouraged with the state of the evangelical church as I understood it, I was definitely in the emergent camp. My book shelves are still replete with the ruins of that time: books by McLaren, Marcus Borg, Rob Bell, Dan Kimball, Shane Claiborne. They testify to a time when I was searching.My time in the emergent church felt like being one of the great explorers who left Europe looking for the New World. My convictions told me that something was desperately wrong in the church in America, and I was determined to find a solution. What was surprising was this: that the further I traveled the more lost I became. The more I ventured into the emerging identity, the less I used the Bible as my guide. And less than 2 years ago, my ship ran aground. As G K Chesterton put it, I set out to discover a new land and when I spotted my destination, I realized that it was none other than orthodoxy.In his book Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications, DA Carson even-handedly critiques the perspective, sharing both strengths and weaknesses in how they handle issues like truth, salvation, modern and postmodern culture, and the future. It was for me like reading my ship's log; league by league of the life I lived over the past decade. It cheers me to have that perspective, empathy, and compassion for those who have also taken that journey, especially those who are still out to sea. Carson gives a great treatment on not only what to be warned of, but also how to set up lighthouses to call these ships into dock."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"Anyone who wants to be familiar with the controversy surrounding the Emerging Church movement should read some McClaren and Carson as well. Well-respected scholar D.A. Carson presents a fair piece to counter the claims of those advocates belonging to the Emerging Church. What I like about the book is that, though he is generally critical of the Emerging Church, Carson attempts to be objective in his approach, even including a chapter that is very complimentary of the movement (chapter 2 is titled \\"Emerging Church Strengths in Reading the Times\\"). Carson is also easy to follow, as he outlines all of his chapters and proceeds point by point. Nobody, including laypeople, should have a difficult time following his thought processes, but you will need to pay attention as it's not exactly a typical layperson's light reading menu that should be consumed before bedtime. One thing I really appreicated is having the footnotes at the bottom of the pages--publishers, do note!--because you don't have to keep your finger in two or three places at once. And the message is clear. Truth is a nonnegotiable item, according to the Word of God, and it should not be watered down merely to appeal to the culture. The premise is that the there is such a thing as absolute truth, and the Word of God clearly teaches such a thing. Thus, we should be aware of the Postmodern games that many Evangelicals are entertaining, especially during the past decade. This really is an alarming trend that seeks to divide the church and take away the salt and light that the ecclesia was supposed to have.Some of my favorite quotes include this one, found on page 99:\\"In a culture where many people read and substantially know the Bible, the Bible's absolute claims regarding God, salvation, many forms of right and wrong, and the like will discourage the rapid spread of postmodern relativism. Where biblical illiteracy abounds, one of the barriers is taken away.\\" Never have truer words been spoken.\\"Experience shows that no can live very long by (postmodern thinking) anyway. The French existentialists insisted that there is no ultimate distinction between right and wrong, and then Jean Paul Sartre signed the Algerian Manifesto because he was convinced that the actions of the French government were wrong....And my exposure to current postmodern thinkers, both in person and through the literature, confirms that they are as full of opinions about what is right and what is wrong as the next person. Simply raise questions about, say, President Bush's policy in Iraq, the rights of homosexuals, genocide in Darfur, and the meaning of economic justice, and postmoderns are no more reluctant that their modern counterparts to voice what they think are the rights and wrongs of the situation. They almost always invest their own opinions with more than personal value.\\" P. 113\\"I have to say, as kindly but as forcefully as I can, that to my mind, if words mean anything, both (Brian) McLaren and (Steve) Chalke have largely abandoned the gospel. Perhaps their rhetoric and enthusiasm have led them astray and they will prove willing to reconsider their published judgments on these matters and embrace biblical truth more holistically than they have been doing in their most recent works. But if not, I cannot see how their own words constitute anything less than a drift toward abandoning the gospel itself....As far as I can tell, Brian McLaren and Steve Chalke are the most influential leaders of the emerging movement in their respective countries (U.S. and England). I would feel much less worried about the directions being taken by other emerging church leaders if these leaders would rise up and call McLaren and Chalke to account where they have clearly abandoned what the Bible actually says. But that, of course, involves truth-claims...\\" Pp. 186-7All in all, I am going to say that this is the most important book that I've read this year--perhaps for several years--and I plan on skimming through it once or twice more to review my highlighted material just to make sure I got it all down. My firm conviction is that this movement is not a fad (one fad in Christianity that I can think of on the top of my head is the Holy Laughter movement) and must be considered by all serious Christians who hold to exclusive truth. If you hope to understand the dangers behind this movement, then this book is a necessity, not a luxury. Read it and be prepared."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"Carson is thorough in his analysis of the emerging church as he points out some of the strengths but especially the weaknesses of this movement. In its reaction against certain features of a modernistic brand of Christianity, many postmodern types have been sloppy in their handling of various theological and philosophical issues. Carson is quick to identify these deficiencies, urging the church to guard against compromise. In the process, however, Carson seems to go a bit too far at times, being overly critical of certain postmodern practitioners. While critique is necessary, Carson's statements sometimes degenerate into a kind of unjustified criticism and take on an almost cynical tone. Likewise, he appears somewhat dismissive of many potentially helpful trends that are being highlighted during this postmodernism phase of history. As usual, Carson's words are extremely helpful, but he could also be a bit more balanced and gracious in his appraisal of the \\"emerging\\" church and its leaders."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"Having read all of McLaren's books in the past few months, I recognized some of the controversy in his writings. I also heard Carson speak on the radio for an hour a few weeks back on the dangers of McLaren's teachings and of the direction of the emergent church.I give this book two stars because I believe the emergent movement does need its critics to keep it healthy and in balance. For that, I welcome Carson's thoughts, critiques and his dedication to Scripture. The other reviews here do a good job at explaining the content of the book.I had the privilege of seeing Brian McLaren speak the past three days at Cornerstone Festival (July 1-3) and asked him if he thought Carson's chapter on his views and theological positions was an accurate representation of what he believed. McLaren responded with visible grief and said that the chapter is extremely unfair, does not represent his views accurately, and that Carson has not been gracious enough to respond to requests from emergent church leaders for discussion prior to this book's publication (ironic, given the title of the book).Carson wrote his book knowing McLaren only through his published writings, and according to McLaren, didn't represent what was written accurately. Of course, there wasn't time to go point by point as many were waiting to speak with McLaren. He ended by saying that it was a shame that a Christian professor with such a reputation and such a good mind would put out a book like this in the spirit that he did, then refuse to be open to correction where he may have misunderstood the writings he was critiquing.What I can say about McLaren and what he taught of the past few days is that he believes in the authrotiy of Scriptures and that they are true. Our interpretations, however, may not always be. A woman asked, \\"How is someone saved or born again?\\" McLaren answered, \\"Through grace, by faith, plus nothing.\\" He gave a clear presentation of the trinity, a clear presentation of the deity and lordship of Jesus and the importance of being His disciple as opposed to being just a \\"convert.\\"He spoke cleary against relativism and defended the concept of truth being known, and I can honestly say I didn't get one red flag from anything he taught in those six hours. His position on homosexuality was that it is not accepted as a biblically valid lifestyle, but that we are still to love and embrace them in community with us. His position on \\"belonging before believing\\" was clearly that we are inviting people to follow Christ and know Him by doing what he says. There is a distinct difference between those who are saved and those who are not yet, but the seekers are invited to walk in the way of Christ with us to see that He is Truth. They can then receive Him and make Him Lord. He by no means taught that people are saved by following Jesus as a guru, but must make a confession to receive Him.McLaren might say in his writings that he is against selling the gospel like vinyl siding or by presenting a formula or a \\"sinners prayer\\" so we should instead invite people into community with us and learn to know God by relationship. Reviewers will be critical of that and say, \\"McLaren believes you don't need to confess Christ as Lord or that you don't need a clear presentation of the Gospel\\" when in fact all he is saying is that our focus is in the wrong place when we use just formulas, or just methods, leaving out relationship. He isn't denying positions as much as he is expanding and adding to them.My advice would be to read Carson's book keeping in mind the fact that he has not spoken with those he is critiquing prior to the its publication. He just might be setting up strawmen and misrepresenting the teachings of many good people who could otherwise clarify for him what is intended in their published works.(I edited this review at Mr. McLaren's request as he and Carson are now in discussion.)"},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"To the degree emergent disestablishmentarianist movement characterized by writings of Stan Grenz, Bryan McLaren, Lesley Newbigin, N.T.Wright, Donald Miller, Ann Lamott is sub-Bible, it is sub-Christian.

It is simply a church which merges with the most ridiculous and irresponsible ideology that has started from rich indulgent intellectuals and spread onto all of western culture... and the rest of the world.\\"Emergent\\" folk fail to differentiate between humility as a virtue and stupidity and cowardice as a virtues. For instance, I am not a Calvinist, and I don't think there is a place for Christians in military for example, but I am not insisting that \\"I have my truth, you have yours\\" and due to our inability to grasp WHOLE truth, we must knowledge that we all have \\"truth\\".D.A. Carson rightly exposes boloney of \\"emergent\\" (rather 'a merging' with latest intellectual fad) thinkers. Many things they say are without hesitation should be called heresy. Any suggestion that Hindus are to teach Christians about mediation is simply laughable... and many more examples can be said.Any time I am exposed to the \\"emergent\\" quotes, I cannot believe my ears. From conferences to books and in between... my impression of them is pretty negative.Granted, there may be some 10% of worthwhile statements, since criticisms are good things. And if \\"emergents\\" find some worthwhile criticisms, then I say - Thank you! As Pascal said, we should be thankful to people who show us our weaknesses. Other than that, it is better not to listen to \\"emergent\\" solutions since they most likely will confuse, more than help. Which leads me to other point.In philosophy and in technology (I am closer familiar with), and in other disciplines, it is preferable to make definitions as precise and concise as possible to convey whatever is that you're trying to convey. Is it only me, or do you also see \\"emergents\\" tendency to obscure things. In the same way politicians speak, \\"emergent\\" invent and propagate some terminology that makes your thinking more clogged rather than more clear. What's the deal with 'narratives'? I personally do not understand what's so fascinating and hot about this word? First association I have when I hear it, is not something like a 'worldview' or 'concepts' or 'conceptual framework' or 'philosophy' or 'epistemology' or anything close or even similar to that. First thing that comes to my mind is a stories for kids. Or to be more gracious, some picture of feminized American/westerners male teenagers sitting in circle with their queer literature instructor sharing life stories of their courageous inclusion of those who 'are different from them', and how looking at painting sort of like \\"black square\\" are so profound in meaning ...In other words, observing \\"emerging\\" (a merging) church is like observing, months and perhaps years of engineering of a sport car to see it eventually be purposefully driven to hit a wall head on.As D.A. Carson rightly exposes him, McLaren seem to be ignorant of the things he claims to hold to. From calling himself a biblical, to catholic to Calvinist (with weird version of TULIP)... Most \\"emergent\\" language is confusing and reads as if it was purposefully written with ambiguity squared in mind.-- Best chapters in my opinion are 5,6, and 7.Chapter 8 is pretty much a given. Unless you are a bible illiterate, passages quoted there are pretty much obvious. But then, if it were not included, book would be criticized for not having Bible quotes to prove the point.-- Beginning chapters 1-4 are not as good in my opinion. D.A.Carson seem to give postmodernism more credit than it deserves... but only at times. Also, sometimes it feels like he gets a bit off topic, and still at other times, as if some sections should be better organized.All in all, I expected more engagement with writings of \\"emergents\\" by means of quoting them, and letting them prove how cowardly they are - trying to dodge most essential Christian doctrines.If by any chance, any of the followers of 'a-merging' church reading this, please check if your views on marriage are not 'evolving' like Obama's [as if views do/may evolve?], or anything like that, indicative of serious confusion."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"Arrived as advertised and in great shape.

John MacArthur seems to define his Terms better."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"It came right away and was in good shape like I had expected from the explanation."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"The cautions put forth in this book are good ones, and I think emerging church types would do well to read them. At the same time there is a good deal of misunderstanding here when it comes to the emerging church, and some of the beliefs and practices attributed to the emerging church are not ones that I have encountered."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"If Dr. Carson wanted to write a critique of the emerging church, he should have gone beyond simply reading a few books and assuming that he therefore understood everything about the movement. Even the title of the book is misleading. By all accounts, Dr. Carson never bothered to even sit down and talk with anyone in the emerging church directly, despite repeated attempts by Emergent leaders to contact him and invite him to dialogue.Tell me, how can you become conversant with the emerging church if you're not willing to actually converse with anyone in it?As one would expect, Carson's lack of substantive research and genuine interaction results in a book that grossly misrepresents what Christians within the emerging church actually believe. He creates a straw man that reflects no actual emergent people, knocks it down and declares himself the winner without ever checking whether his opponent was a true characterization in the first place.I heard Brian McLaren, an emergent leader critiqued pretty harshly by Carson, speak in reference to the book a while back. He said \\"It's really interesting to read a book about yourself that purports to tell you what you think. I made me want to do some research and find out if I really think the things he accuses me of... so I looked into it, and as it turns out, I don't.\\"Bottom line: Carson just get's it wrong. He doesn't have enough familiarity and personal knowledge of the emerging to give a fair assessment much less a worthwhile critique of it.For a much fairer critique of the emerging church from an informed outsider's perspective check out \\"Truth And the New Kind of Christian: The Emerging Effect of Postmodernism in the Church\\" by R. Scott Smith. Or for a sympathetic treatment check out \\"Emerging Churches: Creating Christian Community in Postmodern Cultures\\" by Eddie Gibbs & Ryan Bolger."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"Conversation with the Emerging Church by D.A. CarsonIs the Emerging church about worship style and an approach to the same gospel, but with a different audience in mind: An attempt to make the church more welcoming and more profound worship experience: More traditional worship atmosphere and music then today's Willow Creek style churches? No auditorium feel.People are taught a different way then a hundred years ago and people think a different way today. Does it not make sense the word should be presented for today's audience? The emerging church believes in spreading the word of God and in an active supernatural God. God does intervene through miracles. The reader of this book is given the question whether this new semiretro style of worship with a message for today's postmodern audience teaches the essential gospel or a new gospel with a different Jesus? The author argues the movement makes a compromise with the message that essentially changes the understanding of man's fallen ness and need for atonement.This book gives scant argument about the pro's and cons of Church architecture and sanctuary style. He does give his impressions about the worship service and what he feels is wrong with it. The focus of the book is about what is written in the Bible and what is taught in these congregations. In other words is the theology of God or the creation of man? The phrase a generous orthodoxy is used. Three chapters of the book deal with postmodern and modern thought. Carson argues that the emerging church forms its thought based on the idea of encouraging the Gospel based on the idea its listeners have bought into the ideas of the postmodern. The author argues the movement has given into the ideas of the postmodern. The Emergent church defines traditional evangelical churches as Modern: the idea or concept that people generally believe in absolute truth. Carson does not argue about this or the fact it is a distortion of the modern perspective or modern academic argument has never accused the evangelical church as coming from modern philosophy. These three chapters are philosophical in nature, but not overly complicated. The final chapters are more about how this form of argument has affected the theology by quoting major ministers in the movement. Different perspective about homosexuality, man's general falleness, and man's need for an unsinful man to die on the cross for another behavior. No disagreement on Jesus being God or Man nor him dying on the cross, but the reason. Last few chapters scripture comes into the argument. The author purposely did not talk with the leaders of the movement. People who are critical of this fact should remember word of mouth conversation is only one of many ways to have a conversation. One can respond to another's sayings and writings, without ever speaking to someone is not another conversation. Besides the nature of the book was about how the church presents itself and to have back and forth conversation would distort this."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"If Carson actually cared about being open to new ideas and transformation within the Church, he would actually reach out to key figures in the Emergent conversation rather than taking things out of contexts of particular books. The title of the book demonstrates his complete ignorance, as there is not such thing as \\"the emergent church.\\" Emergent is a conversation, re-evaluating and deconstructing our traditions and \\"traditional\\" approaches that is theological, ecclesial, and missional. Carson and other ivory-tower theologians can wear their suits and ties and sit in their offices all day and correct people when they stray from \\"orthodoxy,\\" but until i see these guys get their hands dirty and get serious about addressing major problems in the evangelicalworld they inhabit I can't take them seriously (which may be a fault of mine- sorry Don)."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"Mr. McLaren was more than gracious to attribute three stars to this book. It is one thing to be in a dialogue while engaging in a critique, and another thing to label a book as a conversation after having refused to converse with those being written about. Mr. Carson willingly refused to talk with people in the Emerging Church even though his book is titled \\"Becoming Conversant...\\" As a man writing a book dealing with truth, his actions come across as dishonest and misleading. The fact that Mr. Carson decided to talk with Brian after the fact seems more a matter of convenience than earnest desire to be conversant with those in the Emergent Church conversation. I honestly welcome Mr. Carson's invovement in the conversation, but I am still struck by the fact that he was unwilling to do so until after his book was published.I hope that those who published such glowing reviews of this work will reconsider in the light of Mr. Carson's dishonesty and assumptions when addressing matters such as truth and fidelity."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"That Carson has an axe to grind is obvious. His research is limited - he looks for what he wants to find and looks no further. The use of a singular example (McLaren) as a sample shows how entirely unrepresentative his description of the emerging church is. Worse than this, Carson comes close to deliberately misrepresenting the movement by his category mistakes - attempting to portray the movements motivations as naive theological adventurism (as if George W. Bush were running the rock-show), instead of a multi-faceted attempt at greater missionary engagement with the contemporary context.Those who wish to embark on a witch-hunt will find all the 'absolutely true, objectively factual evidence' that they need here."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"Honestly I am dissappointed by professor Carson's 2nd rate engagement with the emerging/missional shift. He has many assumptions which he does not bring to the fore front and seems very sure that the Bible is a completely objective arbiter of truth. Yet the Bible is an interpreted and living text. We should all howl at Evangelicalism for burying the Scriptures under a plethora of big church programs and self-help, 1-2-3 psychologizing for a consumer culture. Mind you the emerging movement is being birthed out of a generation that grew up in boomer churches. I find it intriguing that D.A. Carson probably would not have a problem with John Wesley or Jonathan Edwards...but when God's Spirit moves out side Carson's sacred cows all of a suden we're possibly facing a cultish/apostate church?"},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"Top rating! Pegs extremist elements of Post-christianism as merging with current cultural spirituality:antiscriptural apostasizing from the Message of Jesus by the leading intellectual beacon of the movement, pastor Brian McLaren and other authors/leaders of the revolution.Just what are the misguided suppositions, presumptions, control beliefs, interpretive filters, worldview perspectives, core fundamentals, personal philosophic precommitments that drive the deviant doctrines (substituting their neo brand of fundamentalism for the original)?* The Bible is merely a storybook of people's search for God in history that acts as a trajectory for faiths to follow on the path toward enlightenment. Some parts contain truth limited to the original cultural context of ancient times which must be updated/upgraded based on knowledge acquisition since the close of the New Testament. Many parts contain error or opinion that must be compensated for into modern contexting relevant to us.* The Bible is merely one religious text among many that point us Godward on our spiritual journey. Other texts and scriptures must be taken into consideration for a full-orbed integrative approach to discovering our divine destiny. Minority reports outside the Bible and Western Christian heritage must be represented to avoid caucasianist-culture bias.* Basing one's spirituality solely on the Bible is dangerous, foolhardy and missing the point. One must not rely on the bare text literally verbatim as written, but depend on recent scholarship that sheds light on what's Behind & Beyond the plain words. Personal interpretation into what one can live with is key. The Bible is trapped in its own peculiar ancient long-superseded context and must be translated or transplanted into today in the language of one's own faith-story for maximal relevant sense. That's why we need N.T.Wright's 'New Perspective' on everything from Paul to Romans to Justification to 2nd Temple Judaism/rabbinic commentaries to Jesus NOT being as divine Deity as His Father, but merely a Palestinian Jew with a prophetic calling of messianic consciousness to fulfill in himself a personified parable portraying obedience to God's call to the nation what was lacking in his covenant people?; Elaine Pagels' research into the evolution of Hebrew spirituality and religious progression from poly- to mono-theism; Walter Bruggemann's 'enlightened' discoveries in how to properly do theology in a post-certain society; and on it goes as to consulting experts from Ken Wilber (Buddhist philosopher) to roman catholic mystics to evolution scientists to liberal methodist poets like Wendell Berry.* Historic conservative reformational evangelic 'Sola Scriptura' Christianity is too narrow, confining and restrictive of a system and must be expanded to include other streams of faith beyond what is labeled as passe' traditional fundamental evangelicalism. Received doctrine of a real actual eternal hell portrays God as torturer, something no mortal father would do to his disobedient kids. Even the Father punishing His innocent Son by crucifixion as substitute for others is considered 'cosmic child abuse'. So, out they go to make Christianity more palatable, civilized, unbarbaric, tolerable, inviting for the modern cultural mindset that seeks to avoid religious conflict and tone down what is offensive.* Truth is evolving, in process. The minute you think you've got it nailed down, packaged, defined, systematized, for certain, you're being unfaithful to the 'truth process'. It's constantly changing as are we and our world. In the sailboat of life's faith journey, truth is not the anchor or the keel, but the ever-shifting rudder adapting to the ever-shifting winds, waves, currents.* There is no such thing as Certainty or Absoluteness. Only confidence levels and degrees of personal comfort that we're headed in the right general direction. Whether there is in fact an absolute Truth North is the wrong question. All that matters is where am I headed, am I sincere, loving, tolerant, in dialog, compromising, accomodating, inclusive, all-embracing, teachable, openminded, and that my coordinates on life's map are constantly changing hopefully getting me and mine ever closer to some optimum destination. But the journey is what counts here and now, not some pie-in-the-sky afterlife or rock-in-the-dock safe harbor.* The Gospel is not about the sacrificial cross or Jesus' bloody slaughter for sins or appeasing an angry Old Testament God or personally receiving Christ as Lord & Savior with hell the ultimate worst case scenario and heaven as final reward when Chief Justice Jesus returns on Judgment Day. The Gospel is living out the Kingdom of God here, now, and ushering in a Postmillennial Paradise on earth with world peace, social justice, and saving/perserving the globe as Top Priority. It's not individual salvation by faith alone, but collective saving of the planet by working out Jesus' moral precepts and kingdom principles side-by-side with those of all faiths to bring humanity all together as one in love and acceptance under King Jesus, regardless of religious affiliation. Sincerity, not certainty; karma, not dogma is the key.With these and other radical philosophic precommitments and worldview filters driving one's interpretation of the Bible, it's no wonder Post-Certaintism is a house of cards waiting for the next passing breeze. Kudos to Dr. Carson for showing those open to Holy Spirit discernment that the extreme elements of the Merging 'church' which are on the Pastor McLaren & Co. bandwagon = a detour movement multiple cards shy of a full deck."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"I was happy to read this book and learn that somebody besides myself sees big problems with some of the \\"orthodoxy\\" put forth by those authors participating in this \\"emergent conversation\\". Carson spends a GREAT deal of effort on engaging this movement's (you don't want to call it a movement, but it is one... get used to it) handling (or lack of handling) of truth claims. This indeed is my biggest concern, and Carson engages the point very well.Brian McLaren writes \\"...many of the misunderstandings in the book could have been clarified if there had been actual conversation...\\" (you can read his review and that very statement in context here on Amazon.com) but I think he misses the point. The fact that Carson did NOT contact McLaren and his contemporaries before writing this book is, in my opinion, a HUGE point in Carson's favor. I say this because the ONLY way that the vast majority of us every encounter a voice like McLaren's is in his work, and he is very often maddeningly vague on particulars, especially in the \\"New Kind of Christian\\" trilogy and \\"A Generous Orthodoxy\\" (both very much worth reading, by the way) So I for one am glad that Dr. Carson only engaged the written record and did NOT contact McLaren for any kind of discussion. It's all I have to go on, I'm glad it was all HE had to go on (by choice, I suspect).McLaren also says that Carson's book \\"concludes with the hope that those of us in the emergent conversation will be open to correction, and I hope readers will be assured that we welcome critique, and will seek to learn from it all we can.\\" Well, with all due respect, Brian, perhaps the title of your book should have been \\"An Unfinished Orthodoxy\\" instead of \\"A Generous Orthodoxy.\\" The use of the term \\"orthodoxy\\" is more loaded than McLaren seems to understand.But there is one more book I am DYING to read. I suggest that perhaps Brian and Dr. Carson author a book together (they both write often for the same publisher anyway) as a discussion between them. THAT I would LOVE to get my hands on."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"D.A Carson is one of the best biblical scholar alive today. Even if you don't like him, you still would listen to him. In this book, it comes at the emergent Church movement as one who is trying to correct them in a Christ like way. He also addresses that issues that the emergent tries to address about looking at our culture. In which Carson says that this is a good thing. In like matter, he also tells it like it is, that this kind of philosophy of ministry is dangerous to a Christian movement ( Postmodernism). It is walking on thin ice, to the issue of watering down the gospel. The idea that Truth is real and can be known. This book is a must read on the emergent church. Great work Dr. Carson."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"I purchased and read this book after seeing it referenced in two separate articles in two Christian periodicals discussing the emerging church movement. I have also read the bulk of the previous Amazon reviews on this volume. Several of the reviewers have written lengthy reviews that cover rather well the context and subject matter of the volume. My purpose here is to make some summary comments on major themes or points that aredeveloped or implied by Carson and which I think are especially important.The emerging church movement is purportedly a movement of religious writers, spokespersons and followers (mostly from an Evangelical Protestant background) that seek to learn from and make adaptive application of Christianity to the post modernculture. The essence of post modern culture is relativism, that all viewpoints are open to discussion and respect.The viewpoint of author D. A. Carson is that of a traditional Evangelical--that the Bible is God's authoritative word and that its teachings, and especially it teaching on the personand work of Jesus Christ, is the standard of truth by which all other things are judged.Carson is willing to learn from others and is willing to acknowledge that his interpretation, or that of other traditional Evangelicals, of every passage of Scripture may not always be completely correct because of human limitations; but that the great truths of Scripture are clear enough to establish certain important truths of doctrine and moral practice that mustnot be compromised. The heart of his criticism of the emerging church writers and their movement is their adaptation to the philosophy of our age; neglect, compromise and departure from thegreat truths of Scripture and Christ, and their proclivity to be more severe in their criticism of their Evangelical/fundamental roots than they are of other religious movements, whether of Christian or non-Christian origin. I believe that the most succinct statement Carson makes in establishing his theme is the following quote from page 186: \\"I have to say, as kindly but as forcefully as I can, that to my mind, if words mean anything both[Brian] McLaren and [Steve] Chalke have largely abandoned the gospel.\\" McLaren and Chalke are among the most prolific and better known of the emerging church writers and due to that factor a separate chapter is given to analyzing their writings in some detail.Not emphasized, but implied in Carson's book, is the point that during the entire history of Christianity, in all ages and amongst all philosophical currents, there has always been notonly opposition to the gospel by those who are openly anti-Christian, but there has also always been a dangerous blurring, compromise or apostasy from the Scripture and the heart of the gospel from those professing to be Christian.The bottom line assessment: beware of the emerging church movement."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"D. A. Carson is one of my favorite Bible teachers and scholars. He always writes clearly and out of his love for God and the church. This book will certainly help us understand the emerging church movement better. This being said, it should not be the final word on the emerging church movement. Rather, it should be a starting point from which believers on both sides can understand each other better, correct each other, and build each other up in Christ. It is very unlikely that brothers and sisters in this movement are the only ones who need to be corrected. Also, the book only covers one brand of emerging churches, namely that of Brian McLaren. I am not sure if he is the best representative of this movement. Scott McKnight, who is more sympathetic to the emerging churches, has posted his extensive review of this book on his website. You may go to(...)and find his 8-part review in April 2005 archive."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"Carson misses the point in this book, I think, by addressing shortcomings of the postmodern movement without adequately addressing their critique of evangelical epistemology. Being a theologian rather than a philosopher, I think this can be excused but simply attacking the weaknesses of postmodern theology without answering their attack on evangelical interpretation of scripture will hardly be the last word. Frankly, as much as I like Carson (and I do admire him greatly), I think this work falls short."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"What I find interesting is that I was actually driven by watching the debate on this book to read McLaren's book \\"A Generous Orthodoxy\\" prior to reading this one as I thought the debate was a riveting one. Having read both books, I have to say that I feel McLaren has been much maligned in the characterization of that DA Carson makes of his work. That is not to say that some of his assertions are not valid in regards to areas of the emerging church.Many of Dr. Carson assertions are quite valid. It has been my personal experience that many emergent churches (several I have visited or attended) do seem to struggle with a watering down of the Gospel through offering services about being a better you and other self help style sermons that can sometimes remove the focus on God. Many struggle with, as Carson put it, \\"a shallow\\" view of faith that often borders on a selfish pursuit by these christians of a \\"prosperity gospel\\" that portrays God as a cosmic slot machine for believing. Prayer goes in -- red corvette and wealth come out. There is truth to a tendency of these groups towards a \\"feel good\\" and \\"non offensive, political correct, and an all encompassing tolerance that rubberstamps all divergent beliefs"},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"But I believe that the contemporary discussions in this culture are greater than knowledge and epistemology.Carson's final charge is particularly revealing and a bit condescending as he speaks to the emerging church: \\"They need to spend more time in careful study of Scripture and theology than they are doing, even if that takes away some of the hours they have devoted to trying to understand the culture in which they find themselves.\\" (234) In this book there is primarily one aspect on which Carson rests his case, and it has much less to do with Scripture or theology than it does with philosophy. Throughout the book it is abundantly clear that for Carson the issues of church/Scripture/theology/culture all grow out of an epistemological issue. That is, for Carson the church must privilege knowledge. I am not suggesting that Carson discards experience or spirituality or emotional aspects of the faith. Rather, I am submitting that Carson privileges knowledge as first philosophy. For Carson it is right and correct epistemology that drives his theology and hermeneutic.Carson does offer some helpful insights on issues related to the study of Scripture as well as the necessity of knowledge/epistemology. Yet it remains very difficult for me to get past the fact that he dichotomizes epistemology/ontology as well as propositions/experience and then proceeds to privilege epistemology, knowledge and propositions as the more sure thing for the life of faith. He takes this for granted and then proceeds to make his case against the emerging church. But I submit that what he takes for granted is precisely the point of contention. In this generation and in especially in the current cultural context the church needs to more carefully consider the place of knowledge and the place of being. Too often pop-Christian books like Carson's duck the primary issue and then spend the vast majority of pages working under a presumed assumption. This sells books, makes money for publishers, and gives us something to argue about, yet I fail to see how it advances the kingdom or cultivates a truly reflective Christian faith. Instead we become merely a reactionary church."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"This is a book that could have been much much better. Given D.A. Carson's stature in the theological/academic community, it's disappointing to see this very incomplete critique. To be clear, the emerging church is NOT free of flaws - but the value of the challenges and red flags that Carson raises here is greatly diminished by his failure to do what the subtitle states - \\"understanding\\" the movement. To narrow his criticisms to a very small number of leaders is, itself, a complete misrepresentation of what he seeks to describe.As Brian McLaren has stated in his review here, \\"Becoming Conversant\\" would seem to indicate an interest in conversation, and yet none was attempted. If Carson had pursued this, it would have added helpful credibility to his arguments. If Carson had actually attended gatherings of emerging church leaders, it would have added helpful credibility.This review is not intended as an attack on Carson - his good reputation as a gifted thinker and theologian is deserved. But that reputation will likely mislead many readers of this book, in believing that Carson has accurately described his subject. He has not done so.Again, I am not suggesting that the emerging church doesn't deserve critique. Honestly, I believe critique will help the conversation along. But a critique of McLaren and a small selection of others DOES NOT EQUAL a critique of the emerging church. There are many in the emerging church that would actually agree with Carson's criticisms of McLaren, but they are still a part of the emerging church because this thing is about much much more than any one person's thoughts or ideas.Perhaps a revised, expanded, and more nuanced version of this book a few years from now would be helpful."},{"Title":"Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church: Understanding a Movement and Its Implications","review":"D.A. Carson is clearly not a cheerleader for the \\"Emerging Church\\", but he provides a balanced and thoughtful analysis of some of the major themes in a very, very diverse movement. I felt a bit more sympathetic to some of the worthwhile, in many cases much needed goals of the some in the church after reading his first couple of chapters. I believe that he really goes out of his way to find what's good in a movement in which it seems a large number of the participants are seeking primarily a more genuine and Christ centered worship. However, many of them as well intentioned as they might be are making serious mistakes regarding basic and crucial theological matters, and D.A. Carson spares none of them his intense scrutiny. His analysis is often eye-opening as he pulls apart seemingly sound arguments and clearly shows their faulty logic, false assumptions, and dangerous conclusions. It is, I believe a testament to Carson's even-handedness that upon completing the book, I felt both more sympathetic to the concerns of this movement, but also more steadfast in my realization that most of the Emergent's means to this end, and often the ends themselves are suicidal to orthodox Christianity."},{"Title":"Planting Your Family Tree Online : How to Create Your Own Family History Web Site (Ngs Guides, 4)","review":"Twenty years ago, using only a very simpleminded computer as a glorified typewriter, I put together a thick volume of lineage on part of my wife's family, the result of more than a decade of close research. Because of my very limited budget, the production values were poor and fewer than two hundred copies were printed and mailed. And it took nearly all my free time for a year. Today, I would be able to compile all that data in a computer program, produce text files for further editing, present the final version in an attractive, readable, completely cross-indexed format, and upload the whole thing to a website where it could be visited by many thousands of other researchers from around the world. I could correct and update the information as new data came to hand. And I could do it all with little or no out-of-pocket expenditure. Is it any wonder genealogists have so enthusiastically adopted the World Wide Web as their medium?Any genealogist who isn't familiar with \\"Cyndi's List of Genealogy Sites on the Internet\\" hasn't been paying attention for far too many years. Cyndi Howells owns a website indexing more than 200,000 online resources, and which gets several million hits each month. She's also a member of the NGS Board of Directors and the author of several other books on Internet genealogy. So: Do you need your own genealogy website? Cyndi thinks you do. \\"Trust me, you need one.\\" Publishing on the Web is the least expensive and mostly widely accessible method of disseminating to others what you've learned.Howells notes that she could have subtitled this volume \\"All the Things Cyndi Learned the Hard Way,\\" and the reader should be thankful for her experiences. Through reviewing the sites that make it to Cyndi's List, she has become more aware than most of us of what really works online, and what really, really doesn't. Her approach combines \\"high concept\\" and style on the one hand with practical, hands-on advice on the other. Though she doesn't try to teach the very basics of computers or the Internet, she walks the reader step-by-step through the process of \\"planting\\" a website: Finding a hosting service (your ISP probably provides space for free), choosing your tools (there are some good free choices here, too), the differences between writing your own HTML code and letting your genealogy software produce it for you (a somewhat contentious matter, actually), enhancing your site with photos and digitized documents, and the growing problem of proliferation of inaccurate data because of unthinking copyright infringement. There are a lot of decisions to make first, though. Do you want to construct a full-featured site, with sections on local history as well as purely family matters? Or would you rather just submit your own database to be included in an online lineage-linked database? It's a matter of maintaining control. Should you start now? Or wait until you've \\"finished\\"? That's print-thinking. When you can continually change and update, why wait? Your research is always a work-in-progress anyway.The author recommends a mission statement as a guide to keep you pointed in the right direction and Chapter 10, \\"Guarantee Success,\\" discusses a number of common website do's and don'ts (like avoiding border-type backgrounds that don't wrap properly). Then she confronts the problems of presentation (artsy vs. readable), site navigation, establishing a baseline structure for your site, and deciding what content to include. (You don't have to build the entire site all at once.) Then it's time to create the basic pages (keeping in mind that you don't have to accept your software's defaults), probably using a WYSIWYG editor to produce the HTML until your sophistication increases. And for all of this, Howells provides many addresses to online resources that provide additional instruction and advice. She can be rather opinionated about design, as in the matter of blinking text: \\"If it moves, delete it.\\" And \\"Frames are evil.\\" And also unexpected music files that play automatically (a real annoyance when you're surfing the Web in a public library). She's usually right, though.Finally, she tells you how to upload your work, how to carry out the necessary trial run, and how to publicize your site. Don't forget, too, that running a website of any kind is an active, ongoing process. (Few things are sadder than a Web page whose \\"Last Updated\\" date was three years ago.) You're making a commitment in time, if not in money. Establish a maintenance routine and update your site regularly. Check and update the dead links you've included to other sites. (There's a word for this: linkrot.) If necessary, you can solicit help in doing all this from other family researchers -- especially those you've met through your site.I've read numerous books on website design, as well as having planned and set up several sites for other family members (and not just in genealogy), and this is easily the best thing I've found -- print or online -- for the genealogist interested in establishing a presence on the Web."},{"Title":"Planting Your Family Tree Online : How to Create Your Own Family History Web Site (Ngs Guides, 4)","review":"So you've used the reference guides to build a substantial family tree, and you've located photos and documents but still have questions: where to next?

The book gives only one sample model of how one might do this: Have 8 separate pages devoted to your great-grandparents. It stops there without going into any more detail.

Every baby loves their mommy and each Mommy, in turn, loves them back - including people, of course!I'd really have liked them to carry the touch-y feel-y cover into the pages, but even without that, Mary Morgan's illustrations are very nicely done.

It's not terribly great for meditation, but it's not meant to be.I'd recommend this book to anyone leading a Bible-study on the book of Deuteronomy, or just wanting to learn more about Deuteronomy. This commentary will help with sermons, but the conscientious preacher will want to supplement this with a commentary designed for today's preachers."},{"Title":"The passing of the great race, or, The racial basis of European history","review":"This book decribes the 'scientific' truth of racism.

Whitney complied immediately, and shortly thereafter received a personal letter of thanks from Adolf Hitler. In his unpublished autobiography, Whitney reported a conversation he had with Madison Grant about the letter from the Fuhrer. Because he thought Grant might be interested in Hitler's letter he showed it to him during their next meeting. Grant only smiled, reached for a folder on his desk, and gave Whitney a letter from Hitler to read. In this, Hitler thanked Grant for writing The Passing of the Great Race and said that \\"the book was his Bible.\\"Wonderful book..."},{"Title":"The passing of the great race, or, The racial basis of European history","review":"To put yourself back in time, into the darkest parts of the Progressive era read this book.

Former President Theodore Roosevelt (himself a Racialist, though more moderate then most in the movement on race) wrote a glowing review for the dust jacket, if I recall correctly. I had the chance of reading it some six months ago, and found, that whilst some information is out of date and some concepts are flawed, many of the core ideas of the book are still sound. It was the first book of its day, to my knowledge, that properly divided the Caucasiod Race into modern categories (by-in-large ignoring the old terms, such as Teutonic and Aryan), although that is one that is partialy out of date. The major arguements of the book are that the Nordic subdivision of the white race are its most productive, but are being bred out (as well as being killed off in the World War[which was a feature of Dr Lothrop Stoddard's &quot;Rising Tide of Color&quot;]) by the 'lower' Europeans, and that a sound Eugenics programme and a reduction in Eastern and Southern European immigration (the massive Third World Immigration wave was not even thought possible at that time). While I tend to disagree with many of the proposals in the book, it was one of the early pillars of Racialism in the 1920s and is still a pretty good read. One word of warning, this book is most certainly not for all tastes. If you are Politicaly Correct, or, for that matter, of modern sensibilities, do not read it. Otherwise, enjoy reading a good, albeit, biased history. R. A. Merryman"},{"Title":"The passing of the great race, or, The racial basis of European history","review":"\\"The Passing of The Great Race\\" was one of the racialist books written between 1855 and 1920 that would strongly influence the the National Socialist Party. The first was Gobineau's \\"The Inequality of The Human Races\\", the second was Houston Stewart Chamberlain's \\"The Foundations of The Nineteenth Century\\", the third was this one, and the fourth was Lothrop Stoddard's \\"The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy\\". Grant was a lawyer and conservationist who was a firm beleiver in the Old Order, free of Bolshevism and Socialism and centered around an Anglo-Saxon culture. Grant always tried to portray himself as more scientific than romantic racial theorists such as Chamberlain, but his theories actually have little scientific basis. For example, his division of Whites into Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean Races is anchored only on the basis of Nordic Scnadinavians having blonde hair, Alpine Slavs having brown hair, and Mediterranean Italians having black hair. Even worse is Grant's lack of historical basis. He considers the French, Southern Germans, and Poles to be a mix of Teutonic or Celtic Nordic peoples and dark-haired Alpine peoples who invaded Europe from Asia, but there was never any record of Asiatic peoples reaching France or Germany, at least not after the Celtic period. His classifications of Alpine are also very flimsy. He considers Southern Germans to be of Alpine stock, completely ignoring the fact that Southern Germans speak a Teutonic language and often have Teutonic features such as blonde hair and blue eyes. He also considers the Walloons of Belgium to be Alpine, ignoring the fact that they are descendants of the Celtic Belgae, who the Romans clearly described as being tall with blonde and red hair {sounds Nordic to me}. He also claims that the Irish and Welsh have substantial amounts of Mediterranean blood, ignoring the fact that both those peoples are Celtic and often have blonde or red hair. The most puzziling part of this whole thing is how this book became so popular when practicaly everyone is labled as inferior. Grant considers the only pure Nordics to be people with blonde hair and blue eyes, so why did people like Teddy Roosevelt {brunett} endorse it? Grant's book just lacks any spirit. I've read Chamberlain's \\"Foundations of The Nineteenth Century\\", and anyone who is of Celtic, Teutonic, or Slavic stock and is anti-Semitic will be riled up with the romaticism of the \\"Germanic\\" race being in constant battle with the Jews for survival. Anyone who has Celtic, Scandinavian, German, Anglo-Saxon, Polish, or Baltic ancestry is included in this Germanic race, while Grant tends to alienate anyone who isn't a blonde, blue-eyed Anglo-Saxon or Swede, even putting the Germans down as inferior. This book should also be compared to Stoddard's \\"The Rising Tide of Color\\", which was written four years later. Stoddard also went by the Nordic-Alpine-Mediterranean model, but focused less on this than on the White Race as a whole. Stoddard was a visionary, looking to White issue in the future. While Grant clamored about keeping non-Nordic Russians and Italians out of the country, Stoddard warned that the real dangers are non-White Asians and Negroes. Grant's book has little relevance to today's issues, as practically every White American is a German-Irish-Polish-Italian mix. Stoddard, however, saw that all Whites had to band together against the \\"rising tide of color\\"."},{"Title":"The passing of the great race, or, The racial basis of European history","review":"Madison Grant's work is an intriguing summary of racial thought during his day. It was one of the bestsellers. It is, however, not a scientific textbook and should not be treated as such. Dr. Grant, however, was thoroughly knowedgable with a chair in zoology and as the major proponent of ecology in his day as the main force behind establishing Yellowstone. His works, along with others by men like Dr. Lothrop Stoddard heavily influenced future legislation in the 1930s restricting immigration. One reading this book must look at it from the perspective it was written and not by the anti-racist, bigoted perspective we have today."},{"Title":"The passing of the great race, or, The racial basis of European history","review":"Beautifully written and very Prophetic. I am a surprised at the low marks given this book until I saw the \\"reviews\\" that are either obscene or misspelled or both. Why do those of low I.Q. believe that a negative review by an idiot lends any weight to their argument?Was given this book as a gift and would recommend it as an older tome about the White race at it's peak. I believe our best days are ahead of us, not behind; so I do not believe we are \\"passing\\". There were those who believed the Greek would pass from the earth beneath the weight of the Persian, but history happened a little differently."},{"Title":"The passing of the great race, or, The racial basis of European history","review":"so many of our books today, have removed words that are 'delicate' to the races that believe these words are unacceptable to todays readers. This book brings to our eyes those differences between the cultures and races that do exist today. I was amazed to find our dictionarys and other reference books, have removed vital words because they want to be discrete and politically correct. This is a fine book for learning what they and others have tried to get us to forget."},{"Title":"The passing of the great race, or, The racial basis of European history","review":"If you read Madison Grant's book with anything besides a desire to learn about certain attitudes of the past, then you are wasting your time. It is a fascinating source for the history of racial attitudes during the time of increased immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe. Grant was a member of the eugenics movement and the movement to end unrestricted immigration from the \\"lower races\\" of Europe. His book was admired by the Nazi party, which changed Grant's term \\"Nordic\\" to \\"Aryan.\\" I don't like this book because of its content; rather it is a valuable resource for researching racial attitudes of the past in relation to their historical context."},{"Title":"The passing of the great race, or, The racial basis of European history","review":"Madison Grant's Passing of The Great Race was not very scientific, although many scientists at the time did support Grant's main claims. However, on a cultural level, one can see how peoples of northern ancestry tend to be of a stringer will than those of southern ancestry. Grant makes good arguments for Nordic superiority, using mostly recorded history rather than prehistoric anthropology. What I like about this book is that in it Grant warns of impending extinction of white Americans, especially those of colonial stock, as a result of unchecked immigration. Today it is relevant, although the problem has switched from Jews and Italians to Mexicans and other Hispanics. Grant also makes a good argument for eugenics."},{"Title":"The passing of the great race, or, The racial basis of European history","review":"Those who wrote the negative reviews, have never read this book and asume it was Hitler bible. I consider myself a libertarian not a white nationalist, and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Madison Grant argues throughout the book, that the white race is dieing due to massive multiculturalism. He also argues that race does exist and is not a social construct. Not for the politically correct I should say. I recommend the Bell Curve and many of Lothrop Stoddard stuff as well, and this is my second time purchasing a copy."},{"Title":"The passing of the great race, or, The racial basis of European history","review":"A very realistic and unbiased account of a more civilized era in our history, before modern theories such as 'multiculturalism' came into vogue.

Peter lives in New York; he knows nothing about the wilderness or how to do stuff in the wilderness. Then he finds out more and many more. If you want to find out how go ahead jump in its only 202 pages. You'll be amazed by how it seems so short.Peter meets many challenges in the story. Peter meets Omar Pickett who is a canyon rat who has lots of friends but it's not human where talking about. Omar knows everything about the wilderness and how to survive. And later something very interesting happens to Omar. Peter will eventually be alone in the wilderness. He has to wait a whole year until he is rescued. They have lots of food but they don't get it all to themselves. Canyon Winter is 202 pages of adventure. It's really really really really really really good once you get started.My favorite part of the book is when Peter first finds Omar Pickett. Its because Peter just got in the forest. Then he finds this place and when he goes inside there's tons of food. So Peter eats a can. Then Omar comes out and sees him so Peter tells Omar why and how he got there, they started a conversation and he was alright with Peter staying there. Then they became friends. They worked together to stay alive.The most important thing I learned from the story is that when your stranded in the forest try your hardest to survive and not die.Walt Morey also made Gentle Ben. Similar books are Hatchet, Brian's Hunt, and Brian's Winter. Those are also good adventure books. But Canyon Winter is the best.I recommend you read this book because you'll start it then finish it in a blink of an eye, you'll wish there was more to read."},{"Title":"Canyon winter","review":"This book for some reason has stood out in my mind for the last 12 years. Ihave never forgotten the tittle or the author. I read the book somewhere around the seventh grade and it has inspired me ever since.

I really can't say enouph about this book, except for that I've looked for it ever since and have never found it untill now. If someone hasn't read this book they are really missing out.

CANYON WINTER!!!"},{"Title":"Canyon winter","review":"I have recently read a book called \\"Canyon Winter\\". A guy named Walt Morey is the amazing author. He has also written more than 15 books. The genre is fiction. I think the age level for this book is 10+ because it has some violent scenes in it.The summary for the book is that it's about a boy named Peter who went on a fishing trip with a pilot, Frank Eldridge. When they were going, they had to fly in a plane. So in this book there is a lot violence, some scariness, and sadness. The violence is that it talks about someone getting killed and blood everywhere. The excitement part is about a boy that gets lucky. The scary part is when a really big blizzard comes through and they almost get stuck in the house. The sad part is when people and animals die. Oh yeah, one more important thing is...I can't tell you. You'll just have to read it to find out!My most favorite part is when the plane crashed. Why I liked this part is because it had a lot of details and not a lot of warning before it happened, so it was kind of a surprise. Some details about when the plane crashed is: \\"the engine is stopping, we're going down!\\", and then they crashed. Some details are \\"BOOM! BANG! SCREECH! AAAH!\\" I would give this book a solid four stars.Why I recommend this book is because it has some important lessons to learn. It is exciting and it keeps the reader's interest, it also has more than one climax, it has multiple ones. It is a really good book and I would recommend it to a tough person and someone who can handle sad things. But mostly, I would recommend it to anybody.Other books by this author are: \\"Angry Waters\\", \\"Deep Trouble\\", \\"Gentle Ben\\" \\"Gloomy Gus\\", \\"Home is the North\\", \\"Kavik the Wolf Dog\\", and \\"Scrub Dog of Alaska\\". Books that might be similar to this author are \\"Hatchet\\" by Gary Paulsen, and \\"Blizzard's Wake\\" by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor.The author, Walt Morey was born in Hoquiam, Washington on February 3, 1907. He has written a lot of award-winning children's fiction books. He wrote 17 books, and most have pilots in the stories and a bond with man and animals. They also include survival stories of people in the wilderness. He moved to Jasper, Oregon in 1912 and went to school there. He also never liked school that much. In 1934, he started working in a veneer factory making paint brushes and also doing work in the woods. On July 8th, 1934, he married his first wife, Rosalind Ogden, in Portland, Oregon. Rosalind died February 28th, 1977 after 43 years of marriage. Then, about a year later, on June 26th 1978 he got married again to a lady named Peggy Kilburn. Walt died on January 12th 1992. They were married for 14 years. Most of Walt's life, he was a boxer and a diver.

It's the story of 15-year old Peter Grayson, trapped in a canyon in the Rockies after the small plane carrying him crashes, killing the pilot. He's found & rescued by Omar Pickett, a self-described \\"canyon rat,\\" who grudgingly takes him in ... and as the weeks go by, a strong friendship grows between them.The story of Peter discovering the beauties & wonders of the wild under Omar's tutelage is compelling in itself. Walter Morey knows how to evoke the wilderness & its inhabitants with a few brief, vivid strokes; the reader is there in the midst of it. But more than that, this is also a cautionary tale, warning us just how easily the short-sighted greed of some men can destroy what took centuries to create, leaving only a ruined waste once the last quick dollar has been made.So Peter's journey is two-fold. First, he finds himself in his ongoing encounter with Nature, maturing & growing as a decent human being. Secondly, he becomes an advocate for the environment, and gets his first glimpse of the more ferocious & unforgiving wilderness that is human greed & vanity. And he realizes that Nature needs people like him to help preserve it for future generations ... a struggle that continues today, making this a most timely & relevant story.Don't worry, though -- the message is woven in gently, with the emphasis always on the adventure of discovering the wild. That's more than sufficient argument for the defense of the environment. This is a book that deserves to be in print once more -- highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Songs We Sing from Rodgers and Hammerstein:","review":"I have been looking for this vintage book forever as it was always on my piano to play when I was growing up.

It is a pity that the engines are only superficially described, but notwithstanding this, (and a few mis-printed photos) the volume is at a very high standard.It is also well updated, with many infos on the &quot;big Buses&quot; a340-500 and -600.Recommended to all jetliners fans!"},{"Title":"Airbus A330 and A340 (Airlife's Airliners: 16)","review":"Airbus entered the world of commercial airliners with its A300, which set the standard for the twin-engine widebody. Then came the A310, a highly versatile aircraft, but two aircraft hardly make a family. It was with the smaller A320 series that Airbus established itself as a major player as a builder of commercial airplanes. Building on the success of having a family of jetliners, Airbus introduced the A330 and A340 widebody aircraft. And this book does a fine job in chronicling the development of the earlier versions of both types, it provides scant detail on the newer A340-500 and A340-600. (The A330-200 freighter was introduced long after this book's 2001 publication.) The book covers the evolution of the two types from the A300/A310, chronicling the design and development of both the A330 and A340, also offering technical specifications on all the variants of the -200 and -300 series of both types, for which the author deserves kudos. Following the Airlife forumla, the book covers the life of both airliner types in service and the operators with which they have been flying with through 2001. A short list of incidents, a production history, and a chnrolology complete the book. The photos, mostly stock Airbus material, are superb."},{"Title":"Airbus A330 and A340 (Airlife's Airliners: 16)","review":"This book contains the most beautiful photographs of the Airbus A330 and A340 that I have seen in any informative airplane book.

The book has several in depth examples of his intellectual \\"cousins\\" so to say with whom Benjamin Franklin conversed in America, England, and France during the \\"Age of Enlightenment\\". Abolitionists - Anthony Benezet of Philadelphia and Granville Sharp of London; British scientists and dissenters of the crown, Joseph Priestly and Richard Price, each of whom challenged Franklin to better understand church and state separation issues; the French Enlightenment genius, Marquis de Condorcet who authored \\"Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind\\" and was probably the \\"greatest French political conceptual thinker and observer; as well as Jean-Paul Marat and Franz Anton Mesmer, each of whom Franklin eventually rejected.

The text is outstanding in that it not only gives information about the artist (included are the most famous) but tells some of the details of how the glass was formed.After reading this beautiful book I feel much more knowledgeable about how these treasures were created, yet no less in awe of their creator. I wonder how and from what heavenly body these artists came from.If antique dealors knew of this book, they would certainly be clawing to get at it! Too bad it is out of print!

The fact that she felt this way and was still able to leave the church shows incredible courage on her part. The book seems to be a fair and balanced accounting rather than a &quot;hate&quot; piece, which probably would have been the easier path to take after finally leaving the fold."},{"Title":"Inside the Mormon Mind","review":"Inside the Mormon Mind by Elizabeth Tice is, by far, the most interesting work that I have read in this area. Dr. Tice provides information with a personal flavor that makes the work more than just academic. It becomes a journey into the history and the psyche of those who follow this faith. While this book is written by a woman who has left the 'folds' of the Mormon church, it is clear that there is no criticism of those who continue to choose to follow it. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Inside the Mormon Mind","review":"This book is well written and hugely informative. It provides insight into the Mormon culture that can be generalized to the greater human condition. I am writing this review to point out the fact that the dichotomy in this list of reviews really proves Dr. Tice's point in the book. Reality is subjective, and when one is invested in a belief system, that investment filters one's perception. What Dr. Abu Ameenah Bilal Philips (assumed to be non-Mormon) perceived the work as &quot; a remarkable book&quot; that provides &quot;a personal as well as an educational view,&quot; the reader from Salt Lake City (more than likely a Mormon) perceived as a &quot;THIN pamphlet&quot; that doesn't follow through on its promise to provide a &quot;peak&quot; (sic- did the writer mean peek?) into the Mormon mind. I have to side with the reader from Shawano: Astounding! Read this book to decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Inside the Mormon Mind","review":"This book provides an interesting and intriguing look into the Mormon mindset. Tice maintains an objective stance by careful citing of sources. However, she gives the book its special flair by sharing her own story as a daughter of a Mormon official and member of a Mormon family. The insights Tice provides would be transferable to any structured religious group. For those who would like to know more about this religious group and about the people who subscribe to it, I heartily recommend this highly readable book."},{"Title":"Inside the Mormon Mind","review":"Why does an intelligent person hang on to a particular company's stock until it goes to zero? The same reason an intelligent person will ignore &quot;bad news&quot; concerning their religion. Astounding! Ms. Tice in this slim book has illuminated the human beings great wish for apple-pie order in their lives. This leads to some pretty interestng behavior. A wonderful book, please read it. You will better understand your parents, siblings, yourself, and one of the most fascinating religions around today."},{"Title":"Inside the Mormon Mind","review":"During the past week, I have had the unique opportunity to read, &quot;Inside the Mormon Mind&quot; by Dr. Elizabeth Tice. The book was sent to me as a gift. The study of religion is a favorite topic for me. This book provided a personal as well educational view of the religion. It answers the most 'common' questions and some of those I might not have thought to ask. In all of this, Dr. Tice is never critical of those who adhere to the religion - and this is a quality I find most admirable. It afforts both the personal and the academic view to be unobstructed. It is my intent to personally thank Dr. Tice for her remarkable book - but also to let readers, in general, know what a valuable book this is."},{"Title":"Inside the Mormon Mind","review":"To a reader who knows very little about the Mormon faith, this book provided both a basic understanding as well as insight. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Inside the Mormon Mind","review":"This is a very thin book, both from the perspective of the number of pages and from the ideas presented. There are many references to Dr. Tice's scholerly PhD work, but this book (pamphlet) only alludes to the depth of her research and her writing and thoughts. Dr. Tice also seems to have a hard time deciding if she wants an emotional, \\"Why I left Mormonism\\" book, or if she wants a true peek \\"Inside the Mormon Mind\\" like she promises. In the end, both objectives come up short--or THIN."},{"Title":"Inside the Mormon Mind","review":"This, to me, seemed to be a hasty generalization declaring some falsities against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. While this author may have had certain experiences that led her to her conclusions, she failed to see the big picture. It seemed to me that she was assuming because a few members of the LDS Church acted in one way, that the other 11 million members all around the world were the same. I find it hard to believe that a Church teaching its members to be clean, honest, kind, and trustworthy would have members acting with such behavior.Though I am not a member of the LDS Church myself, I find it unfair to these people who have been known for their genuine happiness. As another reviewer said, this book seems to be more condescending than informative."},{"Title":"Inside the Mormon Mind","review":"What exactly is her point here? With so much 'research' why is this such a thin book? It took me like a few hours to read. This women needs an editor fast! With so many run-on sentences, wordiness, and fragments I found this book equally boring as well as disappointing. She could have done so much more with this concept. Got some miledge out of her research--adding some repetition in the process. But she didn't. Instead she wrote herself in circles basically stating it was okay to think 'mormonism' and also to believe what one wants. Yet somehow the underlining tone [leave the Mormon church] is present throughout. I bet she wrote this book in hopes of persuading us to go against Mormonism. She accomplished it in the tone, but not in her initial agrument. There's so much more to the Mormon mind and she only covered 1/8 of it here. I hope Tice never writes anything about Mormons ever again. I don't blame non-Mormons, Mormons or exMos for disliking this book. I wish she had written something we don't already know. Instead of denying her true feelings of the Mormon church, she should have come out and just told us how much she disaproves of their belief system. Instead of saying it's okay to be Mormon and think Mormon. It only gives Mormons another reason to be Mormon when there's some agreement on their side. All I can say is: Tice had an unstable argument."},{"Title":"The Spanish Language Today","review":"This book has obviously been written for an introductory course of linguistics in a Spanish curriculum of an English-language university. Ideally, an introduction to general linguistics is offered in a parallel course.In such a context, items such as phonological and syntactic variation and change as well as pragmatic and sociolinguistic issues are further illustrated and brought to life for the student by the application to her or his main discipline.To the general, non-student reader, this book is also useful as an introduction to certain aspects of Spanish. It has an accessible style and Spanish examples which are more than one or two sentences or are difficult for one reason or another are translated in footnotes. In some chapters, however, general linguistic insights are described in so much detail that for the general reader the text is somewhat redundant."},{"Title":"A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle","review":"MacDiarmid's magnum opus begins in a bar. The opening lines, translated from the Scots dialect the poem is written in, go: &quot;I'm not so much drunk as just dead tired; it's hard work upending glass after glass after glass. . . .&quot;The story: the speaker, drunk and trying to make his way home from the bar at the end of the night, falls down on a hilltop and rolls under a thistle bush, where he lies staring up at the moon and considering everything from Burns to Schoenberg to what his wife will say when he finally gets home. And what an adventure it is, alternately (and sometimes all at once) hilarious, moving, and profound, all the way up to the poem's mock-Hamlet ending: &quot;Oh, I have silence left!&quot;&quot;And well you might,/Or so Jean will say/After such a night.&quot;No one who loves poetry should miss this incredible performance by MacDiarmid."},{"Title":"Night Run","review":"Robert Denny, the author of &quot;Aces&quot; and &quot;Night Run&quot;, was a B-17 pilot with the Eighth Air Force's 306th Bomber Group, and a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross. He knows flying and he knows airplanes -- this shows in his writing. And he knows his history on the Eastern Front. In &quot;Night Run&quot;, he has expertly woven an exciting fictional story into real historical events, interlacing his own characters with historical personalities. Mr. Denny subtitles his book &quot;a novel in honor of the famed Night Witches of World War ll&quot;. Although his main protagonist is an American B-17 pilot, his book really showcases the women aviators of the War. Not only the Soviet female combat regiments, but the American WASPs and even the fanatical Nazi test-pilot Hanna Reitsch. The plot-device of an American fighting in the Soviet military is not as far-fetched as it may at first seem. This actually happened on a number of occasions. (I have a memoir of American POW Joseph Beyrle who, upon his liberation by the Red Army, joined a Soviet tank unit. Coincidentally enough, his tank commander was a woman.) &quot;Night Run&quot; takes its protagonists from the battle of Stalingrad to the fall of Berlin. Included is a &quot;love story&quot;, which is something I normally detest in a war novel. But this one is tastefully written and never distracting from the action as the Red Air Force storms westward. Throughout, events are chronicled with the realism of one who actually participated. In many ways, this book reminds me of Cornelius Ryan's awesome &quot;The Last Battle&quot;. I wonder if Denny referenced it for his historical sequences?"},{"Title":"Night Run","review":"Well writen story about air force and Russian activities during WW2.

It does a decent job walking through the major items enough to pick up the basics. I would expect that any good developer with several years experience in different languages, and at least some of that in OOP, would not have any problems picking up the basics. But this is not a good book for a new developer to pick up and use to learn Ada or OOP unless you want to spend a lot of time scratching your head and trying to figure things out. The information is there, but not a lot of different examples or explanations.I bought the Kindle edition, and it is difficult to go through the examples because the extend over multiple pages and you are always moving back and forth. I programmed my Samsung Galaxy II Kindle reader to use the volume buttons to move forward and backward, and it did make the task a little easier. It's much easier to read on my Samsung Galaxy 8 tablet.I learned enough that I think I'll explore Ada a bit further at my job so I can better understand it's pros and cons.

Each woman is given a page or two, and about one in four of the women have a black-and-white picture included.Now, as you might expect with a book like this one, it is the proverbial yard-wide and foot-deep. No woman is covered with anything like enough depth. Also, to make matters worse, the women are given a quick and soulless biography, much as you might find in a normal (academic) encyclopedia. And to make matters even worse still, some of the information in this book is suspect. For example, when discussing Frieda von Richthofen, it identifies her famous brother as \\"Martin von Richthofen,\\" rather than Manfred.But, in spite of all that, the book does deserve some credit for the its reach. It does cover a lot of times and places, and gives you an entre point for studying them. So, take it for what it is an encyclopedia of mistresses and no more.(Review of Encyclopedia of Mistresses by Dawn B. Sova)"},{"Title":"Christian Perfection","review":"I have the 1947 Harper & Row publication of the book Christian Perfection. It is arguably the best devotional masterpiece ever put forth on this planet. It is a shame that this book is so hard to find. Contemporary translations, including Meditations on the Heart of God and Talking with God, are quite inspirational, but they only provide a taste of the heartfelt, scholarly elaborations that only the pious Francois Fenelon could put forth.Though this clergyman lived centuries ago, Francois Fenelon could deliver religious themes that are irrespective of time. Christian Perfection is a most apt title for this book. What makes it so special is that it brings to focus what it means to take up one's cross, what it means to seek the Lord in prayer, and what it takes to maintain a heart devoted to godly service, even when the human heart is inclined to do otherwise.Fenelon touched on key points about human nature and how it can come into conflict with vows previously made to serving God with utmost zeal and fervor. His insights, to this day, communicate in this volume like letters to anyone who is faced with doubts about his or her dedication and commitment to serving the Lord; they essentially say, \\"I know your struggles, doubts, and fears, my friend; but know that the Lord your God loves you perfectly and will use His perfection to make good use of you, though you are imperfect.\\"Lately, I have been reading classics about time management, priority organization, and the daily habits of mind that lead to success in life. If a Christian devotional publication could meld in these perspectives from a Scriptural point of view, it is this one.For the past few years, there have been concerns about how people are suddenly finding a sudden, albeit maniacal, interest in religion or how some have become so involved with born again charismatic movements that they are \\"wearing their faith on their sleeve\\". I share those concerns, and I think that many of these latest trends are disturbing, for they seem geared to establishing legalistic modes of thought that are put forth by evangelists who have forsaken traditional doctrines and who want to influence the masses, telling them what to think and what to believe without giving them room to analyze or critique.Fortunately, Christian Perfection teaches or communicates in a traditional tone that reveres God's holiness and that acknowledges man's shortcomings on a very intimate and personal level.Francois Fenelon's humility is a trait that is lacking in so many circles of faith. I wish that this book could be in wider circulation, because it communicates in a tone that is of a sincere, caring person. Unfortunately, many of our so-called Christian leaders of today claim to have special visions or revelations about what is right while simultaneously undercutting public and private figures with the brand of almost Phariseelike behavior that Jesus preached against.For anyone who is sick and tired of seeing in person or on TV those individuals, including the supposed followers of Christ who communicate to others that they are more entitled to forming opinions or pursuing happiness than those around them, this book is for you. Fenelon made an utmost attempt to make his writings compatible with the Bible, not the other way around."},{"Title":"Christian Perfection","review":"Fenelon's thoughts as presented in this devotional classic are remarkably practical and applicable today just as in the 17th century!

Whew!"},{"Title":"Lost Pony Tracks.","review":"Fortunately, I have a copy of \\"Lost Pony Tracks\\" in my personal library. Well, two; the second one, a replacement of the original, is in excellent condition; the \\"first\\", a small pocketbook version, is battered, well-worn; bears all the earmarks of an energetic cowgirl child having read it many times over, including a well-placed ketchup stain or two. The cover of that over-loved book still fascinates me - a silhouette of a cowboy on his horse, leg thrown over the pommel, a Saguaro cactus off to the left, and a flaming Southwest sunset backdrop behind them both. It's something not forgotten easily, and that photo-cover is etched in my mind and belongs to the story.The book without the cover at all, stands at the top of it's kind. Ross Santee was a writer of extraordinary talent. As a self-described \\"tenderfoot\\" coming from the East, \\"Lost Pony Tracks\\" sprang from his personal encounters with the cowboys of the Arizona of long ago. It is a wonderful book; he captures the essence of everything; the horses, cattle, the \\"wrecks\\" with the pack horses; the unique individuals he meets during his stay with them, a self sufficient, tough \\"breed apart\\" of men - although us women are in short supply within the pages of his book. (lost woman tracks?) They made their own entertainment, their own religion. He gives us a glimpse into almost everything real of the life of the buckaroo.One of the passages best remembered was toward the end of this remarkable story that you didn't want to end: \\"Why is it\\", he wrote, \\"when an old cowboy gets ready to take that long, one-way ride, he always starts talking about some old pet horse that's been dead for forty years?\\"The way of life as they knew it is dead too; and while it stubbornly exists in some places still, it is in a form that would be unfamiliar to the one Santee saw and lived with on his journeys into the old West.I highly recommend this book if you can obtain a copy. It's authentic Western Americana, written in a style you won't forget."},{"Title":"Lost Pony Tracks.","review":"I picked up a copy of Lost Pony Tracks at the Arizona History Museum in front of UofA in Tucson.They were having a book benefit sale for the Museum that day.I had no idea who Ross Santee was and, normally am not interested in western cowboy stories.But I just moved to Tucson from the California coast and wanted to get into the spirit of the Southwest.I bought the book and, as I am a slow reader, who gets into the story, I had several nights of enjoyable reading whilefollowing Ross Santee's experiences as a journalist covering the stories of riding with real cowboyson cattle drives and \\"busting\\" mustangs.During the time I lived in Tucson (2 years) I visited the popular tourist attraction, the home/studio/galleryof Tucson's fascinating artist Ted DeGrazia, from back in the 40's and 50's as I remember. The site has several buildingsmade in the style of the native Americans who originated much of the architectural flavor of the area, mudadobe structures.This an historic site for the artistic history of Tucson, and is a very special, creative space, where visitors are amazed bythe artist's inventiveness.The place is well maintained and moderately sprawling with paths between his studio/gallery, a very fine and spiritual chapel,and living space for visiting artists, which goes on still.After several visits with friends that would visit from California, I saw a small scale model of a mud house, which no longerexisted on the property, and had, apparently, been constructed by DeGrazia for a friend who visited him in the past and is wherethe friend stayed. This is a very complete model, showing the interior space, exterior native vegetation, furniture inside andout. A very nice depiction of a true life living space, created by one friend for a valued friend. This house speaks not only ofthe strong friendship but also of the artist's amazing willingness to work hard creating and inventing with mud and wood.When I read the small sign, describing the model and what it represented, I was very happy to see that the friend was none otherthan the man whose book I just completed, Ross Santee."},{"Title":"Lost Pony Tracks.","review":"First published in 1953, this book is currently out of print, and it shouldn't be. It's a fine, wonderfully written, sensitively drawn memoir of cowboying in Arizona in the years before and after WWI. Santee was 26 years old when he left his small-town Iowa roots and a struggling career as an artist in New York to spend some time with family in Arizona, where he took a job as a \\"lowly\\" horse wrangler for an outfit near Globe. Over the years, as a western writer, who illustrated his own books in his distinctive style (now much appreciated), he based his stories and novels on this experience of the everyday lives of men and their horses.Santee was a perceptive, thoughtful, and observant writer who captured in accounts of incidents and conversations a depth of social history that is hard to find in other books of its kind. It's also rare to find a portrayal of cowboy life so heart-felt. While he had his complaints about men whose faults and deficiencies made them ill-suited to being cowboys, he is chiefly interested in the many men he regarded as admirable for their one-of-a-kind personalities and their strength of character. Among them is the foreman, Shorty Caraway, whose early years on the range are recounted in Santee's \\"Cowboy,\\" and there are many others, each captured with a precise and loving eye for detail. There is a generous spirit and a gentle humor throughout this book that is sometimes sentimental without ever being corny. In his depiction of daily life in an all-male work environment, Santee gets it just right. His books belong on any shelf of western literature."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Alternate Tunings (The Complete Guitar Player Series)","review":"If you've run out of riffs or are looking for a sound that sets you apart, this is THE book. I probably wouldn't reccomend it for less than intermediate (2-3 years on gutiar) But if you're even curious about alternative tunings this book is the best resource you can find for the money, covering the most common dadgad to the obscure i.e. B'Gdf#ad'. It loses points for D.I.Y.ers in assuming a working knowladge of chord and scale theroy. You can over look that as a small trade off for the sheer volume of information and well laid out information and examples. (Pages 85-120 are nothing but lists of artists and tunings, covering Chet Atkins, Sonic Youth and Led Zepplin just for starters.) If you want Hawaiian,Celtic or Heavy Metal you can find something to make your self heard here and if you're fingerstyle folk, just lock the door behind you and take enough food for a couple of days."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Alternate Tunings (The Complete Guitar Player Series)","review":"I've been guitaring -- some pro, mostly for my own joy -- for 35 years. I hate \\"how to play\\" books... but this is the exception. Don't assume it'll be \\"the magic touch,\\" but BUY IT, play around with it, bust up a dozen sets of strings, maybe even buy another guitar (like I did) just to leave in \\"weird\\" tuning while you experiment.This book, honestly, will vastly expand your thinking. From Neil Young & Richard Thompson, through Sonic Youth & Soundgarden, you'll learn how to get that unique \\"sing\\" from the strings. If you make it through Adrian Legg's tunings without your head melting, let me know.So why didn't I give it 5 stars? Well, some of it is just wrong -- & the author has no one to blame but himself. Some of the chord diagrammes are simply wrong. Some of the tunings in the Discography are incorrect. And I wouldn't have known this if Mark Hanson hadn't done such a great job of teaching me a new way to hear the tones I produce.Again: if you're reading this, you need this book."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Alternate Tunings (The Complete Guitar Player Series)","review":"Ok, I just got this book and now I'm searching further for an actual COMPLETE book of alternate tunings. I have 2 complaints on that front, one not enough tunings in here, and two, and more importantly, not enough chords transposed here to tell you where all the standard plus nonstandard chords are on the fretboard in these alternate tunings. I'm looking now for something much more detailed and comprehensive, most importantly with chords transposed. Like, that's such basic info you need if you want to play your favorite songs on the gittar in alternate tuning. So I'm not happy about that. This is not complete. A truly complete book on the subject would at the very least have a long appendix showing all or at least most of the important standard chords on the fretboards transposed for each tuning. Now on the plus side, this book is beautifully written and simple and easy to understand. I'm happy I bought it because it's a fine intro to the subject, but it should be titled an INTRO to alt tunings, not a complete guide. Sure, I know how to play the gittar at a fairly intermediate level enough to dare to try alternate tunings. I have no illusions I'm suddenly going to turn into Michael Hedges or his master successors in slap technique and other wonders of outrageous instrumental alternate tuning guitar playing, but I just want to enjoy the wondrous magic of the sound of the pretty chords in alternate tuning. This book has certainly made it EASY beyond my imagining. The little sidebar boxed explanations he gives that show how to tune in the alternate tunings are superbly easy to understand, and the explanations and background on who uses these tunings are excellent. He does give you a few standard chords transposed in most of the tunings, such as your basic C, G, Em and Am but still not enough to actually play most of your favorite songs, so now I'm searching for chord transposition info. Because frankly how can you even play a song that you know in standard tuning in the new tunings this way? Of course you can't. I don't know the math to transpose it, and this book doesn't explain that easily enough for me either. Nonetheless, now I can easily tune in a number of alternate tunings and goof around and it sounds perty, and that's nice but no cigars. This book is the place to start, but definitely not the place to finish with alternate tunings. I recommend it to begin with alternative tunings though, as he makes it easy to do the tunings. I was kind of intimidated by the concept until I got the book, so that's a huge step forward for me. Now it looks easy, and all I need is a more comprehensive actual COMPLETE guide.**Update on finding chords in alternate tunings: The author of this book, Mark Hanson, has another nice book called \\"Alternate Tunings Picture Chords\\" that I bought that is pretty good, and I also bought \\"Mel Bay presents Open Tuning Chord Book\\" which is also helpful. However, both do not really give you all the basic chords you want in each tuning, they're just a start. The best source I've found is a free site on the internet, Guitar Codex. There are a number of sites with the Guitar Codex, some charge money, but some are free, just google it to find it. The Codex is superb, it is a little interactive graphic that allows you to find virtually any chords (including more complex jazz chords) on the guitar in any tuning, including your own custom tunings, and notes in any scale etc. Bookmark that thing, it is GREAT. The only problem is that with that site and any other somewhat useful site I found for chords in tunings, you can't print anything nor cut and paste into your own Word Document to print without paying for an upgrade, so I googled for a free site with guitar chord blank notation pages (there are many) and printed them, and then wrote down all the chords by hand that I wanted from the free Guitar Codex. For one tuning, Open C, it took me a couple or more hours, to write down all the standard chords one uses the most including let's say 3 different spots they each occur on the fretboard, but that's ok, it's the best method I've found outside of hiring someone for a guitar lesson. That's the options: pay for an upgrade on some guitar lesson site that charges and take the chance to see if it's comprehensive and print it there, do it yourself with the Codex for free and take the time to transcribe, or hire a musician for a lesson."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Alternate Tunings (The Complete Guitar Player Series)","review":"This book is a literal encyclopedia for alternate tunings.

The exercises seem like they would be sufficient for any skill level, as they increase in difficulty very quickly. The book has an interesting method that requires you to play the 2nd and 4th 16th notes (\\"e\\" and \\"ah\\") with your left foot regardless of the pattern laid out in the exercise. Meaning, any double bass pattern that starts with \\"e\\" or \\"ah\\" will be played left foot lead. This is an interesting concept because I, and probably many drummers, tend to start all bass drum patterns with my right foot, regardless of which note the pattern begins with. Once you wrap your mind around the concept of assigning specific notes to separate feet, it actually made me quite a bit faster, and eliminated the need to play quick doubles with my right (to hit the crash coming out of a double bass pattern, etc.) because I know that the \\"ah\\" of any beat will be played with the left foot, and thus I can crash back in on one with my right foot naturally.The book has a good bit of advice in the front for those who care to read it, but after that the book dives straight in to the exercises. I have also really enjoyed the flow of the book thus far. Beginning with a whole section of warm up for two dbl bass notes together, beats with 2 double bass notes together, and fills with 2 bass notes. Then, moving on to 3 double bass notes consecutively, etc. The book flows smoothly, and the exercises are challenging but do-able. I have found myself unable to put this book down. The first time you get that smooth, but powerful flurry of double bass notes and it sounds great within the beat is a great feeling."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Double Bass Drumming","review":"This is a phenomenal book. It covers everything one would ever need to know about double bass drumming. Anyone from novice to professional can learn from this book.

I was about to write my own book with exercises I'd developed but then found this book. I thank the authors for saving me the trouble! If you're interested in building double bass drum chops and only want to buy one book...this is it."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Double Bass Drumming","review":"This book is a superb, and very structured approach to double bass. It keeps the hand stuff simple (for the most part), so you can focus on your feet. The progression in difficulty of the exercises is well-suited to any double bass new-comer - up until the last couple sections, where it curves upwards exponentially into odd-groupings and some tight, technical, exchanges between the handsies and feetsies, which might leave you scratching your head with the bead of your drumstick.A word of warning: Double bass precision and speed can't be developed overnight (Really? Thanks for the heads up). Don't rush through the exercises at the beginning of the book. As simple as they may seem, they provide an excellent opportunity to develop chops and stamina (at least with standard 16th notes. The early exercises don't touch on 16th note triplets, which, of course, are awesome, and about as metal as it gets)."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Double Bass Drumming","review":"Great Price. Very educational. Lots of exercises to work on. Would have been nice if it came with a CD so you could hear how the really complicated ones go. Anyway, Great buy. No problems."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Double Bass Drumming","review":"This is an excellent book for drummers willing to develop double bass skills. It focuses on creative use of double bass: all of its excercises are very musical, and they will give you tons of ideas to work on and try someting different from the \\"never-ending-16th-notes-on-the-feet-plus-snare-drum-on-2-and-4\\". It is one of those books you feel like playing from the beginning to the end, without skipping parts. That said, I would like to discuss a few aspects of the content:First, I really like the discography and the double bass time line at the final pages - and to be honest, those are the only \\"encyclopedic\\" parts of the book... They helped me discover the great work of some guys I wasn't aware of, especially those pioneers.Second, for the first sections, the authors propose that you play every 2nd and 4th sixteenths with the left foot, even if the right foot is not also playing - the result is something like dividing a one-bass funk beat between the two feet... I must say I find it a little strange. I believe it could be interesting for someone with two bass drums (and perhaps using different tunings), but for double pedal users - like me - it is not as much the case. Still, it is worth a try.Also, the cross-rhythm section at the end of the book is quite difficult, but really worth it: work through it patiently and you will notice your coordination going on to the next level.On the downside, I feel that the authors could have covered some other areas: beats alternating the left foot between hi-hat an double bass - somethig Dennis Chambers does all the time, for instance; the use of different right hand patterns - I miss some jazzy and latin riding patterns, and perhaps some two-hand riding; fills where feet and hands play at the same time, and stuff like that. That's the main reason for giving only four stars to the book. However, I must say that this is a great book to get started and then move on to research those areas - or others of your own interest. Go get it!"},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Double Bass Drumming","review":"This will get you double bass drumming fast. Super well designed, I'd recommend to SINGLE pedal drummers too.

These are some of the questions that the stellar authors in this anthology attempt to explore.A scientist discovers how to extract memories from genetic material. He becomes Dr. Chimera - a blend of himself and his beloved wife. An inventor hosts Leonardo da Vinci and finds there is more to life than inventing. A mother gets more than she bargained for when she melds an explorer with her comatose daughter.A variety of authors from the science fiction, fantasy and mystery genres tackle this premise of experiencing the memories of another and a very satisfying anthology is born."},{"Title":"Past Lives, Present Tense","review":"This anthology centers on an interesting idea but the execution is problematical. The set-up is in the introductory story: If you can locate a few scraps of DNA from any deceased individual -- Leonardo da Vinci, Anne Boleyn, your own father -- the personality of that person can be \\"injected\\" into you by broadcasting it into your eye and thereby into your brain. Scarborough never goes very far into just how this is done, which is okay. She's much more interested in exploring the effects of having another personality either piggy-backing your own or being fully integrated into yours. So a modern-day inventor enamoured of perpetual motion uploads Leonardo, but is distracted when he begins to view the rest of the world through the eyes of a Renaissance man. Or, a shallow tycoon acquires the skills of an Elizabeth fencing master so he can show off at the local SCA faire, but hasn't expected the Elizabethan religious values that accompany them. All the stories are pretty much like that, the moral apparently being that you never get quite what you expect to get. (Sounds kind of like Forrest Gump. . . .) There are some very professional writers here, including Elizabeth Moon, Kristine Rusch, and Carole Nelson Douglas, which makes the generally mediocre plotlines and two-dimensional characterizations especially disappointing."},{"Title":"Past Lives, Present Tense","review":"The idea is good, but the execution is poor.

I work for a multinational corporation myself. We are discouraged from taking time to learn foreign languages because we are told that English is the official language of our company. Then we arrive at our overseas branches and discover that our counterparts can say hello, goodbye, and thank you to us, but little more. I think Crystal is overly optimistic about how much English people are really learning overseas.He also dismisses the cultural chauvinism wrapped up in the belief that English is the perfect global language. Actually, Spanish grammar is much easier to learn, and is much easier for non-native speakers to pronounce.English *is* an international language, but it is only an effective one in the most basic communication situations. A few years ago author Barbara Wallraff wrote an excellent article in the Atlantic Monthly entitled \\"What Global Language?\\" (Nov, 2001) which made the point that while international English may be useful for very simple purposes, more complex communication tasks will require something other than English.Author Edward Trimnell (Why You Need a Foreign Language and How to Learn One ISBN: 0974833010) rips the international English argument to shreds by pointing out that a.) cooperation between peoples who don't speak English as a native language is increasing; and in these situations, it makes sense to use a language other than English, and b.) the hubbub about international English has made native English-speakers very complacent in recent years--- such that we are now entirely dependent on the language skills of others.Crystal's book is not without its merits, but it comes across as a sales pitch for international English. There is another side to this argument, and I would recommend reading Wallraff and Trimnell before making up your mind."},{"Title":"English as a Global Language","review":"Crystal's book is the exact counterpart to Phillipson's &quot;Linguistic Imperialism&quot;. While the former has been called an &quot;alarmist&quot; (because of his view that English has been used for imperialistic purposes) the latter apparently sees no problem what so ever (and has thus been called &quot;triumphalist&quot;). Crystal seems to suggest that all linguistic cross-cultural problems could be solved if everyone would learn English from an early age onwards. He apparently sees nothing wrong if Asian farmers cannot read the instructions on fertilizer bags because they are in English.Rather suspiciously, Crystal disregards Phillipson completely in this book. While there are some good arguments against Phillipson, Crystal refuses to enter the debate. More generally, it seems to me that he refuses to deal with the more unpleasant facts of the global spread of English. Better to continue writing about the happy family of English speakers!The book is thus rather naive in its evaluation of the role, status and attitudes connected with the English language.For those who would like to read a really damning review I can recommend Phillipson's &quot;Voice in Global English: unheard Chords in Crystal loud and clear.&quot; which appeared in Applied Linguistics 20/2: 265-276."},{"Title":"English as a Global Language","review":"In Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, space travelers can communicate with beings from other planets by inserting a Babel fish in their ear. The Babel fish takes in what is spoken and modifies the brain activity of the user to effect a translation. Universal translators are standard equipment in science fiction involving space travel, since it is reasonable to assume that extraterrestrials will not speak English or any other earthly language. Indeed, given that there are over six thousand mutually unintelligible languages here on Earth, it seems that the technology is badly needed now. However, by the time the technology is available, there may no longer be any need for it. According to David Crystal in his book, English as a Global Language, everyone on Earth will soon speak English.Currently English has the status of a lingua franca, a language that is used for international exchanges. Through history, different languages have served as linguae francae on a regional basis. In Europe, Latin served this role across the Roman Empire, and continued in this function for centuries after the fall of Rome because it was the language of the Catholic Church. In China, where dozens of mutually unintelligible dialects are spoken, Mandarin serves as the common language of government and intellectual exchange. And starting in the seventeenth century, French served as the international language of diplomacy until its fairly recent replacement by English.The status of English as a lingua franca, however, is quickly transforming into that of a global language, one that nearly everyone in the world can speak. This is an unprecedented event, although there has been a trend over history toward linguistic consolidation as a result of political consolidation. The globalization of English was driven by a historical accident, namely that both world powers during the last two centuries spoke English. The language was first spread around the globe in the nineteenth century by the growing British Empire. As British political power waned at the turn of the last century, American influence and prestige was on the ascendancy, further spreading the use of English.The globalization of English is further driven by the growing global economy. More and more people around the world are getting involved in the global marketplace of goods, jobs and ideas. But to participate in this marketplace, you need to speak English. And if it is not your native language, you need to learn it, or you will be left behind. Although there are more native speakers of Mandarin Chinese than there are of English, there are more people who speak English as a second language than any other language in the world. In fact, there are more people who speak English as a second language than as a first language. Combining first and second language users, we find that English is the world's most widely spoken language. Still, only one in four people know English, clearly indicating that English is not yet a true global language.Crystal contemplates two possible futures for global English. In his utopia, he sees all people in the world speaking some sort of World Standard Spoken English when communicating internationally and their native language locally and at home. Crystal points out that even native English speakers would in a sense be bilingual because WSSE would be different from their native dialect. This view of universal bilingualism may seem odd to the monolingual Anglophone, but Crystal points out that the majority of the world's population is already at least bilingual. Thus, the multitude of languages in the world would remain vibrant while WSSE would serve as an auxiliary for international communication.In Crystal's dystopia, on the other hand, he sees all people of the world as Anglophone monolinguals. In his companion book Language Death (2002, Cambridge University Press), he examines how and why languages die and deplores the increasing rate of language extinction. In the current book, he touches on this subject again. Crystal views the loss of linguistic diversity as analogous to the loss of biological diversity, with similar catastrophic consequences for the welfare of humanity. However, Crystal's reasoning is flawed and tainted with gushing romanticism for the polyglot throng.Crystal's frustration with English's global linguistic dominance would be justified if the language were being pushed upon the world's population by some imperialistic force. But it is not. The globalization of English is a grass-roots movement. People want better lives for themselves and for their children, and they see the way to the good life is through participation in the global marketplace. Thus, they learn English and teach it to their children, often not caring whether the younger generation even learns the language of their ancestors. And they do this in spite of governmental attempts to preserve or resurrect heritage languages.It is often suggested that a common world language would lead to world peace by reducing misunderstandings and miscommunications, but Crystal rightly points out the fallacy in that way of thinking. Throughout history, bloody wars have been fought by those who speak the same language, as for example the American Civil War, the breakup of Yugoslavia or the unrest in Northern Ireland today. However, there is a sense in which a common world language would increase the chances of world peace, and that is through the global marketplace. As the world becomes more interconnected and interdependent, warfare becomes a less profitable means of resolving political problems.Crystal hopes for a future in which nation-states conduct their commerce in a common language while maintaining their national languages at home. But there is a bolder, brighter vision of the future--one in which the globe is unified economically, politically and linguistically. As members of a single community, there would be free movement of people, goods and ideas around the globe, facilitated by a single global language. That language would likely be a descendant of English, but with continued admixtures from many other languages.There is no particular reason why English is better suited than others to serve as a global language, in spite of frequent claims of English linguistic superiority. The language mavens (to use Pinker's term) will often declare English syntax simpler or more logical and its vocabulary richer and more expressive than those of other languages, but neither is true. English is just an ordinary language with no advantage other than that it is the language of the current economic and political superpower in the world.As the global economy develops, the number of English speakers will continue to increase. The development of some sort of World Standard Spoken English is virtually inevitable. It is also quite likely that the vast majority of the world's languages will die out because their speakers will no longer be interested in using them. Instead, they will be learning the global language so that they can claim their rightful place as citizens of the world."},{"Title":"English as a Global Language","review":"In this book, David Crystal presents the future of the English language. According to Crystal, non-native speakers of English outnumber native speakers of English, so it could be said that English has become global. Add to this the fact that English has become the de facto language of business, science, technology, and diplomacy, and it becomes apparent that English belongs to the world. Crystal argues that English will become more influenced by non-native speakers in the future, so we will have to rethink the idea of the \\"native speaker\\". As a world language, English doesn't belong to the native speakers in countries such as England and America, but to all who speak it. To speak a language gives you the right to use it as you will.This is a very interesting book on the spread of world English.

Historically, before the advent of \\"serious\\" democracy, one's national language was \\"defined\\" by the ruling classes. It was the primitive \\"be like Mike\\" idea. One wished to emulate their superiors (don't children mimic their elder siblings?) so langauge changed. One must remember that after the French came to England the language of the courts and of government was French; hence, if one wished to do any kind of business with the government, one needed to know French.We live in a time where English has become the new global royal language, for lack of a better way of stating that. It may shift--if America is no longer the dominant culture monetarily or militarily, perhaps this will occur. The point is that like it or not, English is a global language.Another good point is this: if an American moved to France, become a French citizen, etc., would the locals consider them \\"French?\\" Of course not; they are transplanted Americans. But if a Frenchmen moved to America, and did all the requisite things, no one would ask otherwise. He'd/She'd be an American. End of story. As racist as many foreigner's claim we are, I think America is a very accepting country. Much more so than many of those who claim we are not. Try moving to Saudi Arabia, for example, and claiming you're a national.

In this techno world of trains, planes, and SUVs, many forget the role of horses in human survival and transportation throughout the ages. TFFH has it all. Sure wish I had this book when I first began riding and then owning horses. Many of my 'horsey' friends are so ill-informed-- they need to read this. It's packed with essentials and fascinating detail on how horses move and relate to their rider. Just tremendous-- packed with history, practical advice, keep observations, and true understanding of these special breeds who seem to 'float' above the ground and give by far the most comfortable ride. TFFH answered my questions, helped me solve problems, widened my interest, and gave me the confidence to aim high as an equestrian. Can't thank the author enough for sharing this wealth of education. Definitely the best (if not the only) book on the subject. It should be required reading for all horse lovers."},{"Title":"The Fabulous Floating Horses","review":"This book really is \\"fabulous\\". It adresses, in clear words and pictures, the actual gaits of a variety of breeds. Sequenced pictures show every footfall and how to recognize each gait.The information on tack and bitting also is a must for anyone involved with gaited horses. It eliminates all the myths and gives practical information about how each piece of equipment does or doesn't work.Last and best of all is the detailed, carefully researched history of dozens of gaited breeds. The pictures showing the beginning and evolution of each is magnificent.This is a book I loved the first time thorough and return to constantly to answer new questions that arise with my horses."},{"Title":"The Fabulous Floating Horses","review":"I love this book! I'd recommend it to anyone even remotely involved with gaited horses.

My first introduction to gaited horses was Tennessee Walkers, however, I was intrigued with other breeds as well, and now have two Mountain horses and a Missouri Fox Trotter. I can't say which one I like best, but I can go back to this book and recreate their backgrounds.I've only had gaited horses for a couple years and am still learning the different gaits. This book has been invaluable in helping me to recognize footfalls for specific gaits as well as the sounds generated. I've gone to several clinics and learned from each one, however, it's hard to retain everything. It's wonderful to have a written source to refer back to.Ms. Weatherwax is very clear and direct in her approach and has done extensive research.

While that makes for a fun selection of photos, it also allows inclusion of some dubious photos. The worst is the one of the foal behind a barbwire fence (an accident just waiting to happen). Some of the photos reproduced very poorily, some have the horses posed poorly or the photo angle poor, and some have the horses disappearing into cluttered backgrounds. However there are enough good photos for the book to be fun. I can enjoy seeing a lot of horses and a lot of different colors from the comfort of my reading chair.I am a Morgan horse historian w/published articles & more. So I know Morgans. In the course of my Morgan pursuit, I also learned some of all the American breeds. In this book, in the areas of which I know something, I have found numerous errors. Enough errors so that I question the information in the book of which I do not know anything. However, the information of the overarching general picture of each breed is mostly correct. I would still recommend this book to others but with the caveat to continue your studies and be willing to let go of anything learned in this book which is shown to be in error.I am also surprised at some other information in the book from an author who appears to have been involved with horses for a long time. The funniest is her amazement at the fact that gray horses are born dark. I do not remember the exact photo caption now but it was to the effect of--look how this foal grew up to be this color!

Perhaps this is a function of the Life Magazine exclusivity contracts; it would seem that such a pivotal character at the birth of the age of space exploration would have generated more interest. However, the lack of literary output cannot diminish Mr. Shepard's contributions which are, unequivocally, legendary.Mr. Thompson's research appears to be of professional caliber. However, I was left with a view of Shepard as a courgeous philanderer, whose marriage survived his self indulgence. His cold, competitive detachment appears to be one of his most admirable qualities, in addition to his aforementioned intestinal fortitude.Those of us who, as childeren, watched him hit the most famous extra-terrestrial golf shot in history, imagined a hero cut from different cloth. Courage, and an almost unimaginable grace under immense pressure, are more fitting labels.Indeed, it may be that the author's account is more accurate than one's imagination. In fairness, the early flying exploits are exciting and intriguing; the fatality rate in training was horrific. The mere fact that those men would attempt Carrier landings, at night, is worthy of our admiration and respect.Perhaps in an era where literature must reveal every harsh truth, no matter how tasteless, one may be forgiven in yearning for a more gentle, respectful memory."},{"Title":"Light This Candle: The Life & Times of Alan Shepard--America's First Spaceman","review":"Having read most of the books about the glory days of NASA, this one stands out as one of the best.

The lives of the 1st waves of astronauts is always interesting to read about, even though it was before my time.

Kennedy in office. I find it amazing that it took 43 long years to finally get some semblence of the affair in writing. Well, like the old saying goes - better late than never.Author, Neal Thompson did an excellent job of explaining the growing up years of one of the most famous aviators in the world, Alan B. Shepard. He was courageous enough to print the truth about the man who was supremely confident in his physical as well as intellectual abilities. But all great men have their downfalls, as is well-documented in this book.The first man in space may have only been up there for 15 minutes, but it was this brief shining moment of accurate performing that launched the legend that is Alan Shepard. He conquered Meniere's disease by having to first conquer and overcome his (bogus) Christian Science faith - - - and - - - no surprise, he was cured under the famous healing hand of Dr. House in Los Angeles.I was intrigued to discover he almost commanded Apollo 13, but was reassigned to the next mission instead, due to preparation contingencies. This decision saved Shepard the near-disasterous mission that we know occured on Apollo 13 - what a close call! Shepard always did display this lucky streak that never stopped.He also might have been up on Apollo 1 - but his ear problem started around that time and he was grounded.It's as if a higher power was looking out for him and doing creative things to keep Shepard alive and well.His ride was on Apollo 14; he was the commander and he did another perfect job, what else is new? What else did we expect from Alan Shepard?His wife, Louise stood by his side, in good times and in bad for 50 years - she had a lot of competition out there with the Rocket groupies. Not to mention the stress of living with a high risk occupation. But he always managed to call her at 5:00pm most nights, except for those times he was staying at the Apollo Motel # 14.This book was so interesting and mesmerizing - I read it non-stop for 2 days.....all 399 pages of it.I could not put it down - I even drug it to work with me today.There are some nice photographs in there, but I would like to see about 1000 more of the life and times of Alan Shepard.Some people are born to live lives of extreme risk, challenge and unbelievable success.....and the rest of us can only imagine what it must have felt like to be in their shoes.Shepard's life was very exciting indeed, and I wonder why on Earth did it take 43 years for this wonderful book to be published? THe truth may be a painful and bitter thing to taste, but it's the way things panned out in real life.They had a huge ego and they stroked that ego one times too many. Why do risk takers take so many risks? Well, I suppose it comes with the territory of being a risk taker in the first place.TODAY ---All of our famous Apollo astronaughts are aging; many have passed on to the big rocket ship in the sky, so reading about these incredible men and the incredible lives they lived is a real treat for all persons who wonder about such immense challenges. It is my sincere hope that all of them have books published about their biographies...they have lived and dared to fulfill outrageous dreams. THey are what make this country great in the eyes of the universe.Before long, the Apollo moon walkers will be gone from the face of this beautiful blue Earth.We need to know them - at least by biographies - we need to hear thier stories and understand their feelings before their ultimate count-down to zero is counted.Please read this book! It's an excellent book!It's the year 2004 and I can now say I know alot more about this man that held the facination of millions.....Alan Shepard - he was a great man who did great things, and lived life to the fullest possible."},{"Title":"Light This Candle: The Life & Times of Alan Shepard--America's First Spaceman","review":"The author has done a good job on this one putting together a through biography of a man who fiercely guarded his privacy.

I have read numerous books, seen numerous vhs and dvd stories of everything from the start of the space age to the shuttle flights. I have never had a more inspiring feeling than upon finishing \\"Light this candle\\". It started a little slow with all the early life details of Shepard but, helped later in the book with how & why he reacted to many (and I mean many) tough situations that he faced in his unbelievable life. Being a space nut, I was happy to see little details explained in the book that are lacking in other books I have read. Such things as Shepard talking about laying in the LEM following an EVA on Apollo 14. He and Mitchell were supposed to be sleeping but Shepard talked about the \\"eerie silence\\" and hearing the A/C unit click on and off. Also, feeling like they were going to tilt over and falling out of the bunk when he thought the LEM was sliding down the edge of the crater. All of these things made it a \\"tough to put down\\" book that I would HIGHLY recommend.I used to think of Al Shepard as an egotistical, bi-polar, spoiled fly-boy that I wanted no part in learning more about. I would have rather stuck to anyone of the other 6 Mercury astronauts. BOY WAS I WRONG! This book might have turned me to thinking that Al Shepard is the most interesting of the original 7."},{"Title":"Light This Candle: The Life & Times of Alan Shepard--America's First Spaceman","review":"Surprise of surprises. Amid the clutter of hastily-written self-serving memoirs from the early days of the space program, finally there appears something akin to solid history and literary proficiency. Neal Thompson was a Baltimore reporter when Alan Shepard died in 1998 of leukemia. Assigned to write an obituary, Thompson discovered that no first rate biography of the United State's first spaceman was then in print. Sensing an opportunity, Thompson, a free lance writer, began a six-year research project and produced a highly respectable treatment of a very private man. What had been known about Shepard were primarily his great successes and his notable shortcomings. Johnson tackles the great middle--and the puzzle that was Alan Shepard now begins to make sense.In truth, there is probably misunderstanding about all of the early astronaut heroes, as if each was assigned a role in a bigger cosmic drama. Scotty Carpenter will always be the house philosopher, Gordo Cooper the hotdog, Gus Grissom the curmudgeon. Shepard's role was to be first, the best, the winner of a grueling marathon to ride the Redstone rocket--tiny by today's standards--for fifteen minutes on May 5, 1961. Given the unpredictability of the rockets of that era, the greater risk to the astronaut was on the ground than in space. This fact was appreciated in 1961, and being chosen number one was a statement from his superiors about his fortitude as much as his mastery of flying and technology.Alan Shepard was born in 1923 in Derry, NH, to a somewhat removed, demanding father. Young Shepard inherited a fierce competitiveness and an independence that allowed him to pursue personal goals with little concern about his impression on others. This latter quality, to his advantage, is what set him apart from his archrival John Glenn, who did worry about public relations. Shepard was one of those rare men who had his cake and ate it, too: he achieved remarkable career goals while entertaining himself along the way with what can only be called oppositional defiance. In a strange twist of history, he actually pulled off the mischief that has always been attached to others like Gordon Cooper.In this regard Thompson studies Shepard's military misbehavior and his philandering. The author's account of the future astronaut's brushes with military authority is detailed and rather surprising. One comes away with a sense that the New Hampshire flyboy's skills as a naval test pilot must have been noteworthy, outweighing numerous dangerous incidents of \\"flat-hatting\\" or strafing civilians on the ground. His cheating on his virtuous and devoted wife Louise--a spouse of the Lady Bird Johnson mold--is a blotch that time will probably not erase. Thompson does observe that Shepard's amorous sorties off the reservation were adolescent in nature; the astronaut apparently never engaged in any sort of long term relationship in which Louise was displaced.Although there is in this work a lot about Shepard to dislike, the author clearly strove for a balanced presentation. Shepard appears to have made his peace with Glenn at the time of the Freedom Seven flight. After retirement he demonstrated a better than average interest in philanthropy and seems to have worked harder in his later years to enrich his marriage with Louise. Perhaps best known is his decade long battle with Meniere's Disease, and later with a form of leukemia. In some ways the Meniere's was more of a psychological jolt, coming as it did at the beginning of the Gemini, and ultimately, the Apollo Programs. Whatever his colleagues felt about him, Shepard was widely respected in the NASA management circle for outstanding cape com work in the troubled Carpenter and Cooper flights. With Glenn, his chief rival, out of the picture due to a head injury and political considerations, Shepard was the logical choice to command the maiden voyages of these new craft--and by implication become the first man to walk on the moon.But this was not to be. For nearly a decade Shepard lost his license to fly any type of aircraft due to balance impairment [and other less known medical problems brought to light by the author.] Did he take this forced grounding graciously? Admittedly not. But the author assesses this period of Shepard's career with more depth than other commentators. He notes, for example, that Shepard had burned his bridges with the Navy by joining NASA and could not return to what seemed to be a straight road to admiralty status. While the Navy was no longer an option, Shepard was proving himself to be a better than average business man and becoming independently wealthy. Freed of aviator-astronaut responsibilities, he could have lived a highly lucrative lifestyle.But he stayed with NASA, a nasty Don Quixote. Only a man in similar straits like Deke Slayton, himself medically grounded from space travel, could have understood and tolerated his subaltern's angry depression which alienated other astronauts in the program and at times rendered him a public relations nightmare. What sustained him through his bureaucratic Siberia was the desire to return to active status, but perhaps more strongly a desire to conquer his own medical problem. Shepard would admit that his selection for the first Mercury flight was the professional highlight of his career. Reinstatement to flight status for Apollo was for him a personal triumph of a different sort,Shepard was due for some luck. Experimental surgery put him on line for Apollo 13, but management bumped him to 14 to absorb training and thus he avoided the near catastrophic events of unlucky 13. Shepard seemed grateful to be back--choosing for his Apollo 14 crew Stu Roosa, who had defined the art of avoiding Shepard in company hallways. Apollo 14 survived at least three mission-threatening crises on its way to the world's most famous tee shot. What the author shares about the moon landing mission is one of its least known achievements: it brought its commander to tears."},{"Title":"Light This Candle: The Life & Times of Alan Shepard--America's First Spaceman","review":"Poorly written, riddled with inacuracies.

As a reader of all things historical, I can attest to enduring many dry, fact-reciting biographies and histories. NEAL's BOOKS READ LIKE NOVELS. He doesn't sacrifice fact and detail but clothes those facts in a fast paced narrative that is infused with Pathos. Having read all of his books, I would rank Neal among the elite of modern history writers."},{"Title":"Light This Candle: The Life & Times of Alan Shepard--America's First Spaceman","review":"Light This Candle is a good book on Alan Shepard. Its well balanced describing Shepard's strengths and accomplishments but also describes his weakness and dark side. Its 446 pages...399 pages of actual reading. Good pictures too. Its well written and fast paced. You wont get board reading this book.I really liked the part of Shepard earning his gold Navy Aviator wings by finally having to land 6 times on an aircraft carrier. Shepard's father in an Army Colonel uniform is there to see him do it and take pictures. Both men are so proud. I'm ex Navy. On the carrier USS Independence CV 62 I used to make LOX for the fliers and sometimes watched the planes on CC TV as the pilots landed on the carrier. So dangerous for both the pilots and flight deck crew. Night landing in bad weather on a carrier is the supreme accomplishment skill of a pilot. Shepard was one of the first to do it.We see Shepard accepted to the Annapolis Navy Academy. Alan had a sense of humor and played pranks on upperclassmen and always thought he was as good as them or better. He puts on muscle on his slender frame and trains so hard to get on the varsity rowing team. Alan steals Louise from her boyfriend, takes her to the big Letterman's ball and eventually marries her. Alan graduated in the middle of his class as he didn't try 100% and wanted to chase woman, party and have fun. He graduated in 3 years because of WW2.He is a loving husband when he is home. Louise and him raise a fine family. However when on Navy assignments he chases women and has affairs. Louise knew he was unfaithful but both loved each other and stayed married for over 50 years. Alan loved fast cars, fast women, drinking, whoring around with his fly buddies and grabbed as much fun and gusto in life he could.Shepard's metal is tested in WW2 on a destroyer. He is assigned as a gunnery officer and sees lots of Kamikaze Japanese attacks. So much war horror. His unit is decorated. Eventually he gets pilot training but almost gets bumped out for not performing well. He takes private lessons and gets his private pilot license and then settles down and concentrates and finally does much better. He passes and earns his wings with 6 carrier landings all perfect. He misses his chance for air combat action in Korea. His future friend and competitor John Glenn shoots down 3 Migs.Alan gets selected to Pax the Navy's test pilot program. He flies many different fast jets and becomes one of the Navy's best pilots. He is a show off hot dog that almost gets court marshaled for flying low and showing off. Throughout his career Shepard made friends with powerful people. His flying friend saves Shepard from the wrath of an Admiral that wanted him thrown out of the Navy.Alan sees Sputnik in the sky and thinks to get in the new space program. He is selected as one of the original Mercury 7 and becomes America's first man in space. John Glenn is furious as he wanted to be number 1. We see Shepard as extremely competitive, cocky thinking he is the best of the best with a gigantic ego. The fact was he probably was the best.Alan fought a hearing disease that had him grounded for years in the space program. Later he gets operated on and is cleared to fly. He is so competitive and cutthroat. After much training and internal political bumping other astronauts is the commander of Apollo 14 and is number 5 on the moon. He helps in experiments and taking very old rock samples. He is the oldest (47) to be on the moon and busts his butt working on the moon. He is exhausted. Such courage and determination. A true hero. He is famous for his moon golf shot. Many of the Apollo flights are described. Fascinating stuff.The book has many more great passages of Shepard. Shepard advances in rank and eventually becomes a Rear Admiral. Shepard retires. The Navy is pissed. They wanted him to stay in and have a a high profile position.Alan becomes a wealthy business man and finally starts to mellow out and opening up to people. He does lots of charity work and gives lots of money to a charity for killed Astronaut's wifes and kids and other charities. Alan and Louise plays lots of golf, travel and are friends with many celebrities and powerful people. Sheppard gets sick, fights leukemia and passes away at 74. His loving Louise wife of over 50 years dies of a heart attack at 5PM on a plane 5 weeks after Alan dies. This is when Alan always called Louise from work letting her know he was OK. Eerie.Being ex Navy I'm used to profanity and most times it does not offend me. Thompson's book has some profanity to make it macho. The book is good enough to not need it. As a 13 year old I hero worshipped the astronauts. Maybe my grandkids will too. I know they will be exposed to profanity but its not necessary to see the F bomb and more in this book. Ill keep it in the adult section of the family library until their Mom says its OK for them to read it.Alan Shepard was NO saint and much of his actions I do not approve of and I would not want my kids growing up like that. However he was a true hero with many accomplishments and charity work I would be extremely proud of. A complex man who enjoyed life and grabbed all the gusto he could. Recommend this book 4 stars"},{"Title":"Light This Candle: The Life & Times of Alan Shepard--America's First Spaceman","review":"This is an excellent book and well worth the time and money. The author gives us detailed insight into a complex and ultimately heroic man. Although he had some faults, the author makes it clear Alan Shepard could not have been the hero he was without these faults that were more than offset by his qualities.

I figured I would have another chance but then before long he was gone. What a thrill it would have been to have shook the hand of the first American in space.Nostalgia aside, this book is a capsule of the life of the man. True, it is littered with inaccuracies in spots, and seems to delve far too deeply at moments on the personal life of one of the most important men in the last 50 years. But then again, how many JFK biographers have tried to delve into the hush-hush side of the man?This book will give you a clear picture of the over-achieving, success-driven, consumate test pilot who one day became an important symbol to many Americans, who were afraid their world was about to be consumed by communism. At times wistful, sometimes aggrandizing, other times pointedly candid, this biography attempt to reveal the Alan Shepard even the man himself wanted no one to see.You will be amazed at the story."},{"Title":"Light This Candle: The Life & Times of Alan Shepard--America's First Spaceman","review":"As a fan of the Project Mercury, and the movie \\"The Right Stuff\\", I felt it was only right to read this book.

It's a great read and if your an aviator, you will appreciate it that much more. I'm a licensed Pilot, and the description of his training down in Corpus Christi, is something I can relate to.After reading the book, I came away with a more profound respect for Mr. Shepard and for aviation in general. I marvel and his courage and intensity.Godspeed, Mr. Shepard!!!!!You will not be dissapointed!!!"},{"Title":"Light This Candle: The Life & Times of Alan Shepard--America's First Spaceman","review":"To anyone but a true student of spaceflight history, this might be regarded as a superb biography of an extraordinary man, and it certainly comes very close. Neal Thompson has a punchy, smooth-running style, which obviously reflects his lengthy career as a professional journalist, but just like a journalist it seems he kept his manuscript to himself and well under wraps, and I believe this has proved a sad downfall for an otherwise excellent book. People who know their spaceflight stuff are thick on the ground, but it is very obvious that no one was consulted in order to simply verify the so-called facts about Shepard's NASA career in this book. There are so many elementary errors inherent in this part of the story that it must call into question the reliability of other areas such as his military service, and he deserves better.The author's descriptions of early spacecraft are incorrect; so too his explanations of the dynamics of space flight and the space environment. I know helicopter pilot Jim Lewis well enough to say that he would be absolutely furious with Thompson's baseless assumption that Gus Grissom blamed Lewis for nearly letting him drown after the hatch blew on his spacecraft. Quite the contrary - Lewis was elsewhere making a valiant but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to save Liberty Bell 7. Any fundamental study of this dramatic event would reveal that Lewis's helicopter did not in fact retrieve Grissom as stated in the book, and his was not the only helicopter on the scene - there were actually three involved. I also feel that far more effort should have been made to research the Mercury flight of Scott Carpenter, rather than reiterating bitter and biased recollections dominating Chris Kraft's account of this flight in his own book. Carpenter successfully brought home a flawed, badly malfunctioning spacecraft, but where is this story? It seems a much-misrepresented confrontation between two personalities is a better scenario to present than the program-saving heroics and expertise of a gentle, courageous astronaut.The author says he elicited the help of Alan Shepard's family in writing this book, and while I do not doubt the veracity of this statement, I wonder if they feel betrayed by many of the vapid sex \\"revelations\\" he felt obliged to relate, which only serve to make this book a poor man's \\"Right Stuff.\\" I, for one, did not care to know the intimate details of Alan and Louise Shepard's first night together as man and wife. This was just guesswork, voyeuristic journalism at its most revolting, and has no place in such a serious biography. It would also, I am sure, have proved very distressing to the daughters, and such odious reporting is precisely why Shepard would not divulge his life story before he died, and why family members have never cooperated with journalists or biographers before now - and probably never will again. The author also rebuts the whole Shepard/Glenn conflict matrix he carefully makes throughout the book by saying that Shepard was panicked into seeking Glenn's counsel on a delicate matter. This goes absolutely against the grain of both personalities, as pointed out numerous times in his own book. Research and sources please, Mr. Author, not the presentation of presumptions as facts based simply on third-party and questionable hearsay.My sincere wish is that the author had just allowed someone with a solid knowledge of spaceflight dynamics and history to read the text before he rushed this book into print, because the presence of numerous errors and typos only serves to diminish the full impact of what might have been a truly good biography.An Australian called Clive James once penned a great book called \\"Unreliable Memoirs,\\" and I'm afraid this is an alternate title I would have to apply to this book. Nevertheless, it still merits 4 out of 5 for readability, and for finally bringing us the incredible (albeit author-flawed) story of America's first man in space. We can only hope that a corrective rewrite is in the offing. Then, I'm sure, I can probably add that fifth star to the overall rating."},{"Title":"Light This Candle: The Life & Times of Alan Shepard--America's First Spaceman","review":"On the one hand, this is a long-overdue biography of an American hero who never did make things easy for biographers. It shows us where Shepard came from, and how he wound up riding a fifteen-minute lob over the Atlantic, and playing golf on the moon, and it makes for fascinating reading.Unfortunately, the book is somewhat marred by numerous errors of detail that any expert on manned spaceflight history could have caught, and the occasional annoyingly awkward turn of phrase that any competent copy editor should have caught. Together, these give the author a less-than-authoritative tone. Then, too, even the typography of the book is slightly annoying: for the chapter titles and the page headers, somebody picked a truly ugly and amateurish-looking font, one that doesn't belong in any book."},{"Title":"Light This Candle: The Life & Times of Alan Shepard--America's First Spaceman","review":"I had been meaning to read this long-overdue biography of Alan Shepard, and I happened to pick it up in a cruise ship library. As I read it I was surprised at the number of factual inaccuracies--there is at least one glaring non-technical error per chapter, which calls into question almost everything else between the covers. Numerous reviews here mention more problems with technical aspects of the book that I was unaware of, but which do not surprise me given the apparent lack of proofreading and fact-checking.An example: upon finding the book, I leafed through it and found the section on Apollo 14. There it mentioned that John Glenn had \\"almost killed himself when he lost control of the pace car at the Daytona 500 and slammed into a flatbed trailer crowded with journalists.\\" This sentence boggled my mind, for it contained two errors: the pace car was at the Indianapolis 500, and John Glenn was a passenger while a local Dodge dealership owner was the driver. The book is just full of examples of this kind of sloppy reporting.Edit: I see that at least the paperback edition correctly says Indianapolis 500, but it still incorrectly implies that Glenn was driving the pace car."},{"Title":"Light This Candle: The Life & Times of Alan Shepard--America's First Spaceman","review":"I second Colin Burgess's insightful review. Thompson's description of the flight portions of Apollo 14 is derived almost exclusively from Barbree and Benedict's unreliable \\"Moonshot\\" and, consequently, bears only a passing resemblance to reality. The critical events related to the abort switch and landing radar simply did not happen as described. In my work on the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, I have always found it useful to check astronaut memories against other sources. I can only wish that Thompson had exercised such care."},{"Title":"Light This Candle: The Life & Times of Alan Shepard--America's First Spaceman","review":"I was looking forward to reading this bioagraphy having read most of the biographies of the American Astronauts that are out there along with many histories of the Space Program. Having grown up in the 60's and 70's I also followed the program intently. However, upon reading this I was both disappointed and sceptical about the accuracy of what the book contained. Factual error after error constantly gnawed away at any faith that what I was reading was to be believed. Others have pointed out errors I missed like Grissom's pick up though I suspected things weren't as I recalled (I knew there was more than one helicopter), so I'll add these corrections: The developement of the Saturn 5 was not a result of the Apollo 1 fire ( the Saturn 5 was always the vehicle intended for the lunar flights and were being built); Glenn's landing bag did,'t deploy (this is never made clear); the Soviets did not rendezvous two two man spacecraft ( they only launched two single passenger Vostoks in similar orbital planes that resulted in their passing within a few miles of each other and the Gemini 8 docking is never mentioned). The author has obviously read most of the same books I have and and used them for most of his research and many incidents recounted bore a striking resemblance to scenes from Tom Hank's \\"From the Earth To the Moon\\" series.All in all a bit of a disappointment"},{"Title":"Light This Candle: The Life & Times of Alan Shepard--America's First Spaceman","review":"\\"Light This Candle\\" delivers all that is promised. It reveals a complex man, driven to be the best. It provides added insight into the egos, triumphs, and tragedies of the early space program. Author Neal Thompson has done a masterful job of ferreting out the details of Alan Shepard's life from a wide range of sources without having had the opportunity to personally interview this man with a facade of cold steel. Thompson's effort shows us a man who does have warmth and compassion on the inside, but one must earn the privilege to experience it. Thompson writes with a casual style that reads well although he occasionally structures complex sentences to make you work a bit.Those who are knowledgeable of the space program may be somewhat bothered by numerous technical inaccuracies while others insulted by the occasional use of gross profanity and blasphemy. Mature readers generally know that military pilots like to punctuate their speech with shocking profanity to boost their macho image. Young readers do not need encouragement to do likewise. The errors do not detract from the characterization of Alan Shepard but gutter language depreciates us all. This should be a best seller, at least among aviation and space aficionados."},{"Title":"Light This Candle: The Life & Times of Alan Shepard--America's First Spaceman","review":"I feel this great book rates only four stars (rather than five) only because some of the technical information was badly in error. It is clear to me that this book is for folks interested in the \\"astronaut human relations\\" aspects of the Mercury program and is filled with lots of great gossip about our original seven astronauts. I read WE SEVEN when it was first published in 1962 and it was pure NASA \\"PR\\" as far as granting grades to the astronauts for \\"WORKING AND PLAYING WELL WITH OTHERS\\". Although technically, WE SEVEN was a very perfect book, NASA PR ruled in those early days. We now know that the astronauts were very human and although willing to put their lives on the line, capable of making an error at times.Since this book was very enjoyable to read I give it four stars. I do not recommend it for people who will get distracted by the erroneous technical information it contains, which reflects negatively on the authors knowledge of space science and orbital mechanics.Great gossip includes:1) When Shepard was selected by NASA for the first suborbital flight, Glenn went on a letter writing campaign to NASA managers to be substituted for Shepard. Glenn was really upset with the selection and Shepard's alleged womanizing!2) When Shepard worked with Slayton as managers, they bumped Cooper so Shepard could jump line for a flight to the Moon.3) Cooper quit NASA partially as a result of Shepard's line jumping.4) Scott Carpenter was essentially drummed out of the astronaut core as a result of his (250 mile) overshoot, and a particular flight controller who was very unhappy with Carpenter's performance.5) Much more!"},{"Title":"Light This Candle: The Life & Times of Alan Shepard--America's First Spaceman","review":"Not much about Al Shepard that isn't already in other booksand movies.

However, I must caution that it contains many errors of fact that seem to be related to the author's apparent ignorance of the military, aviation and space. These errors range from niggling (referring to flying boats as \\"seaplanes) to significant (stating that modern aircraft are controlled by a \\"steering wheel\\" rather that a stick and rudder pedals, when in fact a stick is still the preferred control for high-performance aircraft). The shame is that these errors could easily have been, and should have been, caught by proper review and editing - so the publisher has to take some of the blame."},{"Title":"Sonny Liston vs. Cassius Clay","review":"Bill Cayton literally spent a lifetime in boxing, but he may be best remembered for releasing a number of CD's on legendary championship bouts from the original radio broadcasts through the Prime Time Boxing moniker.This CD is the two Ali-Liston fights - I believe as many do that Ali had converted to the Nation of Islam before the first match - with Ali capturing the world title in a stunning 1964 upset and then defending the title by a \\"stunning\\" knockout in 1965.Liston was considered unbeatable before the first fight - and his ring presence was captured in the classic Esquire magazine cover photo of the then champion attired in a Santa Claus outfit and wearing his \\"game face.\\"There were pundits - perhaps prejudiced by Ali's religious awakening - who felt the 1964 victory was a fluke, probably due to an injury Liston suffered in the earlier rounds. And controversy swirled around the second match, as it is still reported that Ali won through a \\"phantom\\" punch, with Liston taking a very bad dive.Liston's boxing career as a major contender seemed to be over after the second Ali match, but by 1970 he had positioned himself back into the title chase before his untimely death (murder?) on December 30th of that year.The CD places the listener at the championship fights as they took place.

Alice Thomas Ellis, who is best-known for The Summer Trilogy novels, also wrote the Home Life series, a collection of columns about her everyday life in Wales. Sue Townsend wrote the Adrian Mole stories and recently published a collection of columns about her everyday life called The Public Confessions of a Middle-Aged Woman. Amy Tan collects her musings and thoughts in The Opposite of Fate. Writers who are successful in spinning good stories seem to be able to take mundane situations and turn them into good stories. This is a real treat for people like me who read very little fiction.So how does Marian Keyes's new book measure up? Under the Duvet starts promisingly, with a short piece about her life as a not-so-glamorous novelist, and a previously unpublished essay about the eight months she wrote a cosmetics column for a magazine. These are probably the best bits in the book.Maybe you do have to enjoy the fiction of the author to also enjoy their non-fiction. I confess I have not read any of Keyes's fiction. There's too much in Under the Duvet about shopping and shoes for my taste, but readers of Keyes's fiction might find that a plus.Some of the pieces are on subjects that desperately need an original angle, but are not getting it here. For instance, on her trip to Los Angeles, Keyes predictably mentions the smog, silicone enhancements, and botox, and the fact that no one walks. I probably wouldn't have noticed her over-fondness for the word &quot;eejit&quot; (idiot) if I had read these pieces over time, rather than in two days.Still, I enjoyed reading these essays and columns, and although they haven't inspired me to read Keyes's fiction, I will continue to hunt down books like this. Anyone know of any others?"},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"Under the Duvet is a collection of essays by Keyes, most of which were previously published in Irish or British newpapers. It does give you a deeper look into the author's life, with chapters about moving back to Ireland, her past drinking problems (the inspiration for Watermelon), what a publicity tour is like, etc. There are also loads of columns about somewhat random things- shoes, soccer, mother's day, religon, and Irishness. Everything is well-written and most are funny, but I think they're more suited to newspaper features than a whole book.Note: I have the Brit edition, so the American edition may be slightly different."},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"Some people take to their beds to escape from their lives; Marian Keyes takes to her bed in order to reflect on her life. She really does spend her days &quot;under the duvet,&quot; comfortably propped up on pillows and typing away on her Sony Vaio laptop. Meanwhile, her husband of nearly a decade, Tony Baines, keeps the home and business fires burning from a more traditional workplace downstairs, communicating with his wife via a dedicated telephone line.Such a setup has not only allowed Keyes to give full rein to her writing talents; it's given her a pretty great title gimmick, because when you come right down to it, so many things do take place under the duvet (or over, or around, but I digress). Most of the 47 short pieces in this book were written for the Irish Tatler and other magazines and newspapers, which has had some reviewers noting that &quot;Keyes is also a journalist.&quot; She modestly points out that this is true insofar as she has produced these works of journalism --- but that she did so after becoming a novelist, when editors began to seek her out for pieces.However, her modesty is misplaced because those who sought her out were clearly doing so in order to get Keyes's singular take on life, love and the pursuit of more hours for shopping. Smart editors they are, because Keyes not only has a winning way with words but with people as well. She comes alive in her essays as the spark plug of her family --- a person who doesn't believe she is the center of the universe, but around whom the folks naturally gravitate nonetheless.This serves Keyes particularly well because everything --- a supposedly slimming seaweed wrap, a single kitten-heeled mule --- is fodder for her delightful gristmill of contemporary manners and mores. One essay's experience, &quot;In the Name of Research --- Going Under Cover,&quot; about a brief stint at a glossy woman's magazine, was used to great effect in SUSHI FOR BEGINNERS, Keyes's second novel about --- what else? --- a start-up glossy woman's magazine.But Keyes is not merely collecting fodder; she's sizing it up as well. &quot;Fear and Loathing in Los Angeles&quot; (her experience there shows up in ANGELS) contains acute observations of that city: &quot;It was fearsomely hot as we drove along and the gray glare hurt my eyes. The sky looked like it could do for a good scrub with a wire brush. Abruptly I realized what was so odd --- there were no human beings on the streets. The place had a strange science-fiction feel to it.&quot;Here's another thing about Keyes as a journalist: she's remarkably honest in her observations, especially as they pertain to herself (and Himself, as she dubs her good-humored husband) or her family. Having finished a university degree in law, she spent much of her twenties in substance abuse. Now, ten years sober and wiser (and having dissected that part of her life in RACHEL'S HOLIDAY), Keyes writes of her darkest hour in the previously unpublished &quot;The Pissed Is Another Country, They Do Things Differently There&quot;: &quot;From September 1993 to January 1994 was the most bereft time I have ever lived through. I had a bare bed, in a bare room, with a bare window, in a bare, bare life.&quot;Fortunately that darkest hour really was just before dawn, and recovery. And fortunately for her readers, even when Keyes strips the bed, she has fresh linen at the ready. That essays ends, &quot;For someone who'd always felt so inconsequential, I remember realizing that I'd been rescued. That I'd been worth rescuing.&quot;--- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick"},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"Devotees of Marian Keyes (&quot;Watermelon,&quot; &quot;Sushi for Beginners,&quot; et al.) will adore this collection of essays and columns, most of them previously published in The Irish Tattler--and some previously unpublished.These simple, hilarious, and often very poignant peeks into the life of Keyes, which strongly resembles that of many of her main characters, makes the reader smile, sigh, and--in at least one heartfelt column about Keyes' triumph over alcoholism--weep. Those who follow her books will experience some strong deja vu, as whole sections of Keyes' truly baroque life seem to make their way sooner or later to her novels--eg, the famous mudbath that one main character took just before her wedding in order to fit into her dress!The charm of this book is that it can be picked up and put down at random.

This may be old hat to Dubliners, but it's a newfound treasure for most Americans.The book is like a box of chocolates and each short read is a tasty little morsel to devour and enjoy. What a treat it is to get this inside look at one of my favorite authors and share in her musings on just about everything. How does it feel to see someone actually purchase your book?

Marian Keyes has us longing for a return to the Emerald Isle with a fun book that is best read by sticking a finger in the pages and finding the start of a chapter!From an author who writes in bed readers will be transposed into the Irish mindset and if you really try you can slow the pace of your life and be one with the Irish for a moment or two.The anthology of columns shows that Marian's writing has great effect for a quickie read as well as being enveloped in her novels."},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"Marian Keyes is more than just a novelist, she is an incredible reader of people and offers insight into the writer's world. I loved this book, and it makes me love her novel writing more to know how open she is about her insecurities and her fears. This book proves that Ms. Keyes can write anything and make it interesting, because she herself is interesting!"},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"Boy, I just love Marian Keyes! Her essays and her novels both acknowledge what it is to be just trying to live and dream and work, but at the same time feel hopelessly clumsy at it at times! I enjoyed reading her essays before reading her novel, Sushi for Beginners, because they gave me more insight into the author, and I was able to &quot;see&quot; her within her story."},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"\`Under the Duvet' is a collection of journalism by Marian Keyes, some of it published previously in papers such as Irish Tatler, other pieces which are making their debut. The subjects Marian writes about cover everything that young, middle-aged women want to read about: career, relationships, weight, etc in a light-humoured way. Each \`piece' is completely unrelated to the rest which means you can start reading anywhere in the book, although I found myself going from start to end just to be methodical.I was not really sure what to expect when I first opened the pages of \`Under the Duvet' but luckily the author had the foresight to include a brief introduction to explain the approach she had taken. I found the style of writing easy to read and quickly got through half the book in one evening. The articles seemed a bit abrupt and while I appreciate that they were originally intended as newspaper articles, perhaps the writer could have modified them slightly so that the reader was left feeling more satisfied.The autobiographical way of writing made it feel like I was reading someone's diary and even though the writer is Irish (I'm not) and older, I was able to relate easily to her troubles and thoughts. There were a number of hilarious articles which were highly original, however I felt that others were merely written from a general expectation of women in this day and age. In these stereotypical sections I got a sense of deja vue and realised that I had read something very similar in another book or even seen it played out on shows such as \`Sex and the City'.A light-hearted, brainless piece of writing that will keep you momentarily entertained. Having said that I do not think I would pay to buy this book a second time round."},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"I had never read a Marian Keyes book before......Under the Duvet was a gift with magazine purchase. She is hilarious! This book is a collection of short stories and anecdotes that every woman can relate to - it will have you laughing out loud. You won't be able to put it down. I am off to order more of her books - I am hooked!"},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"Love anything by this author.

Looking forward to her latest novel."},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"Under the duvet was a series of very short stories or articles put together and called a book.

Loved it!!!!"},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"Very quick, professional, and product was received in new condition as promised. Would DEFINITELY order from this seller again!"},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"In Under the Duvet, Keyes talks about her (somewhat dysfunctional) life in a series of essays, most of which were published in the Tatler. From her loathing of gardening to her dark days with alcohol abuse, she unveils her thoughts and feelings about the terrors and bliss of living, in a very Irish way. It's not only the language that's different (crisps instead of chips, boot instead of trunk, etc.), it's the mindset of being a woman in Ireland. Typically, the women in the essays are more fleshed out than the men, which makes the poor men always sound dense and unenlightened, while the women put up with it because that's just the way it is. Despite the cultural differences, it's easy to relate to many situations she's gone through: learning to drive, going through house renovations, spending Christmas with your family (when you'd rather be elsewhere, like in Groenland).Okay, Under the Duvet is not literature. But it's fun, and a touch of levity in life has never hurt anyone."},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"In my book, Keyes' best work was Watermelon, her first novel. Anyone who's ever tried to pick up the pieces after the sudden end of a relationship can instantly identify with Claire's heartbreak and dilemma, and Keyes does an excellent job mining all the sad, gory details of a love lost and found.\\"Under the Duvet\\" is her first nonfiction book, and while it's an entirely different reading experience, it's still not a bad way for a Keyes fan to get her fix. A collection of columns she wrote for various magazines and newspapers, as well as a few previously unpublished pieces, this book is vintage Keyes, mixing laugh-out-loud observations about her shoe fetish and her large, very Catholic family, with poignant reflections on overcoming crippling alcoholism.Never fear, though -- you're not going to be subjected to a roller-coaster ride of emotions. Save for a dark, somber chapter about her struggle to get and stay sober, \\"Under the Duvet\\" is primarily a happy, skippy romp through the landscape of Keyes' life and times, introducing us to Himself (her husband Tony), her wise Mam, hapless Dad, and her memorable band of siblings and friends. Keyes spent eleven years living in 'Swinging London' before moving back to Ireland for good, and each country gets its share of gentle teasing about its eccentricities and colorful characters. But her finest pen is reserved for her affectionate look at Ireland then and now: she waxes nostalgic about the Dublin before the specter of the Celtic Tiger, and marvels at the remarkable transition its made in these increasingly secular and materialistic times.Fans and children of Erin will find much to love here, and chick-lit aficionados will love Keyes' brief, charming musings on dating, parties, growing older, getting married, Botox, losing weight, and the Holy Grail of twentysomethings everywhere: Keyes' short-lived but glorious stint as beauty editor for a national women's magazine. Would-be writers seeking advice on the craft and business of novel writing and publishing will best look elsewhere, as Keyes touches only lightly on the subject.There are a good many Irish-isms that may stump the American reader, but not enough to prevent one from enjoying the book. Part memoir and -- surprisingly -- part cultural study of the author's beloved Ireland, \\"Under the Duvet\\" is a pleasing way to pass an afternoon. Make sure you have a cup of Bewleys Irish Breakfast and some soda bread.MRA"},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"Marian Keyes is one of my favorite novelists, so I was very excited to read her articles. Most of them were very entertaining and witty, as one would expect from Keyes. Read one after another, however, some of them didn't quite make the mark. What I did enjoy was getting to know a little more about Marian Keyes, the person. I also enjoyed reading about Ireland (as I usually do). My favorite essays/articles were Catholicism: Cheaper Than Prozac, but Is It Good for You? (about the a la carte attitude to Catholicism many modern cradle Catholics tend to practice in their 30's), Have you the Green Food Coloring? (about Marian and her Irish co-workers celebrating St. Patrick's Day in London), You Can Run, But You Can't Hide (about life-long friends), and Time's Arrow (which very much mirrored my thought on how you are the last to know you are in deed one of them -- an adult). In any case, it's an enjoyable, easy read that I'm sure all fans of Marian Keyes would enjoy."},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"This is a collection of Marian Keyes's journalism and a few previously unpublished non-fiction pieces. Just as funny and self-deprecating as her novels, it offers a personal glimpse into the life of one of Ireland's most-loved authors. You can't help but come away with the impression that it would be lovely to have a girlfriend like her."},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"Cute book but a bit repetative in places. The house buying stories were the most amusing just because we've recently gone through that ourselves. My husband also enjoyed the book, so while it's clearly marketed at women, men who enjoy humorous essay style memoirs will also enjoy Under the Duvet."},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"This collection of rather pedestrian essays is saved from being a total loss by the Irish wit of its author, Marian Keyes. Her sarcasm and over-the-top wit help to punch up the humor in spots, but her essays are certainly not in the same category as other modern-day essayists. Many of us can relate to her experiences of flaky building contractors, marriage and family, and more, but all of this has been mined before. It wasn't a laugh riot, and it isn't really a must-read."},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"i have read several of marian keyes' books and this one makes me feel like i know the author a little bit. it is nice to know that authors are human and not just tied up in the sometimes glitzy world they present in their books. if your life is not perfect and you haven't done everything right then you might just find this book comforting."},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"I've liked or really liked most of Ms. Keyes' novels, but this book was a total disappointment. Boring and trite and totally not worth the money. Try her fiction stories instead."},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"Under the Duvet is a fun, quick look into the life of Marian Keyes, one of my favorite chick-lit novelists. She shares her takes on shoes, yoga, writing, marriage and other tidbits with wit, insight and earnestness. However, there are some entries that appear to have been embellished or exaggerated for comic purposes. For instance, the entry about traveling to Los Angeles to discuss a potential movie deal reminds me a great deal of Margaret in Angels. Keyes, like Margaret, exaggerates about the L.A. lifestyle to the max. Also, her entries about the magazine industry are not unlike the ones in Sushi for Beginners. I understand that she's taken bits of her life and added them to her novels -- every author does that -- but the aforementioned entries have fictional elements. I feel that nonfiction should be 100% factual. Other than that, Under the Duvet is a great treat for die-hard Marian Keyes fans. You'll laugh and nod in agreement. This book is a great reminder of Keyes's talent. I await The Other Side of the Story, her next novel, with utmost anticipation."},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","review":"I have read several of Marian Keyes books.

It is a tiny book, meaning that it's not bogged down by a ponderous introduction or tedious analyses. It contains just the Declaration and the Constitution themselves, as well as a concise and informative introduction. It's really the book to buy if you just want to have the Founding Fathers' documents plain and simple. And read it every few years, just to get a sense of what principles America was built on.

It's height and width are roughly akin to a man's wallet, making it easy to carry andThe book begins with a preface by Roger Pilon of the CATO Institute. Pilon recommends that Americans should use the Declaration of Independence to provide a context for the more specific language in the Constitution. He points out that the Founders believed that our rights are inalienable and come from the principles of natural law. Our rights do not come from the government, and the government exists to protect our rights and defend the country. The Founders developed the system of enumerated powers so that no segment of government would hold too much power.Included are the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and a list of amendments to the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights (the first 10 Constitutional amendments).This is the same version of the Constitution that Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) pulled out of his pocket during the MSNBC debates and on the Colbert Report television show. It is also the same one that Republican B.J. Lawson (called \\"Ron Paul Jr.\\") held up during the GOP primary race in North Carolina (he later won the nomination). Here's to any elected official who has read and understands the founding documents of this great country!\\"Government officials must respect their oaths touphold the Constitution; and we the people mustbe vigilant in seeing that they do. The Foundersdrafted an extraordinarily thoughtful plan ofgovernment, but it is up to us, to each generation,to preserve and protect it for ourselves and forfuture generations.

It's the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights and subsequent amendments, in their original forms. The only adjustment is that portions of the Constitution and amendments changed by subsequent amendments are bracketed and footnoted to indicate which amendment changed them. (So, for example, the Eighteenth Amendment [instituting Prohibition] is bracketed and noted as repealed by the Twenty-First Amendment. Have you ever noticed the alcoholic beverage amendments were 18 and 21? Quite the handy coincidence!) This is an excellent portable version of the original, unmodified text of these foundational documents.This booklet also includes a brief preface by Roger Pilon of the inestimable Cato Institute, which publishes this booklet. The preface lays out some of the historical background for the Declaration and Constitution, and it discusses their aims and goals. (I wish the preface had also discussed the context and purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment, given how fundamentally it altered our constitutional structure. Given a desire to keep the preface short, and the complexity of the topic, this absence is understandable. But it's still unfortunate.) Not surprisingly given its Cato provenance, the narrative presented is one of a broadly libertarian, limited government of enumerated powers. In any case it's easily ignored by the reader who disagrees with it, and it doesn't make this edition any less useful than any of the other pocket Constitutions out there."},{"Title":"The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States of America","review":"Received on time in excellent shape.

It also includes the full original texts of both, although you have to look them up - the author's approach is to start with his own explanation, and only then expose the reader (duly prepared, as it were) to the rigors of the actual document. The Constitution, for example, is introduced with the following words: \\"The Constitution of the United States follows. If you have read this [sic] simplified, explained text carefully and studied the vocabulary, you should be able to understand the Constitution as it was originally written. Try, and see\\".The explanatory text assumes very little knowledge - either of history, politics, or for that matter the English language. For instance, the first section on \\"Words You Need to Know\\" offers explanations of \\"subject\\", \\"British Constitution\\", \\"antiroyalist\\", \\"ally\\", \\"British Parliament\\", \\"charter\\", \\"legislature\\", \\"dissolve\\", \\"sovereignty\\", and so on. (Incidentally, the explanation of \\"sovereignty\\" given is simply \\"independence\\", which may strike you as inadequate; the Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines the word as meaning \\"supreme power or authority... the authority of a state to govern itself or another state\\"). However, the author's approach does fit his goal of making sure that even readers with little education end up with a thorough grasp of the material. I felt rather uncomfortable once or twice when the author seemed to be telling the reader what the words of the Constitution \\"really mean\\" (in his own language). But surely that is begging the question? The Constitution says what it says, and if there is any doubt about its meaning it is up to the courts to decide. Then again, there is probably no harm as long as the reader does not take the author's interpretation as Gospel truth.So if you already know a fair amount about history and politics, this book is likely to be too elementary for you (although it does provide the original text of the key documents). On the other hand, if you are unsure about these subjects or have a limited English vocabulary, you may find it is just what you need."},{"Title":"The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States of America","review":"It feels silly for me to rate the content of the founding fathers' works, so I'll just say that this edition is an inexpensive, pocket-sized reference that every American (or interested person) should keep and carry with them for life."},{"Title":"The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States of America","review":"This little book which is compact enough to be carried in your back pants pocket has a terrific intro by the Cato Institute.

Many people think that America is a democracy but it is actually a constitutional democracy. The Constitution of the United States sets limits to the powers of government in Article 1, Section 8 (pgs 23-5). Outside of these enumerated powers the government has no authority to do anything else.It really is a beautiful system of government. All law-making powers are vested in the Senate and House of Representatives. However, a president can check their power by vetoing any laws they pass, which they can then override by a 2/3 majority in both houses. The president's function is to \\"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\\" and to the the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States. The Supreme Court and other courts oversee the laws passed by the legislature and, I suppose, the actions of the president to make sure that they fall within the bounds set by the Constitution. Congress has the ability to add to the Constitution by passing amendments. And the Bill of Rights lays out a few rights of the people and states that are absolutely not to be infringed upon, though the enumerated powers already limits the power granted to the federal government.Roger Pilon's brief Preface is about as much bang for the word as one could ask for.

It's height and width are roughly akin to a man's wallet, making it easy to carry andThe book begins with a preface by Roger Pilon of the CATO Institute. Pilon recommends that Americans should use the Declaration of Independence to provide a context for the more specific language in the Constitution. He points out that the Founders believed that our rights are inalienable and come from the principles of natural law. Our rights do not come from the government, and the government exists to protect our rights and defend the country. The Founders developed the system of enumerated powers so that no segment of government would hold too much power.Included are the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and a list of amendments to the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights (the first 10 Constitutional amendments).This is the same version of the Constitution that Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) pulled out of his pocket during the MSNBC debates and on the Colbert Report television show. It is also the same one that Republican B.J. Lawson (called \\"Ron Paul Jr.\\") held up during the GOP primary race in North Carolina (he later won the nomination). Here's to any elected official who has read and understands the founding documents of this great country!\\"Government officials must respect their oaths touphold the Constitution; and we the people mustbe vigilant in seeing that they do. The Foundersdrafted an extraordinarily thoughtful plan ofgovernment, but it is up to us, to each generation,to preserve and protect it for ourselves and forfuture generations. For the Constitution will liveonly if it is alive in the hearts of the American people.\\"~Roger Pilon, pg. 7"},{"Title":"The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States of America","review":"About a year ago, I saw a movie called The Revolution Will Not Be Televised. The movie is about President Chavez in Venezuela and the failed coup attempt on his presidency. In the background coverage of his presidency, the filmmakers recounted how as President, he encouraged his citizens to read their brand new constitution and learn it. They interviewed some Venezuelans who did not know to read, but had learned to read by reading their constitution.I was touched by this, but then I thought \\"how many Americans can say they've read the Constitution?\\" My guess is probably not many. And those that have only did it for school and have since forgotten much of what they learned. Personally, I remember having to memorize the Bill of Rights for a class, but that's about it.So I bought a copy of the Constitution for myself and began reading it.In a time when Congress is passing legislation that infringes upon the rights guaranteed us by our Constitution, it's important now more than ever that we read and understand it."},{"Title":"The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States of America","review":"The Cato Institute--a libertarian think-tank in Washington, D.C.--deserves great praise for producing this handy, inexpensive, and durable pocket-sized edition of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.

This review concerns itself with the little red pocket version.Now then, upon first receiving this from a Washington DC CATO convention (I was serving mini crab cakes lest you think me some sort of intellectual) I was immediately impressed that these two great and historic documents were condensed into a handy little guide.However....Upon opening said guide I was quickly disappointed. This is no replication of those documents. It appears that the writing has been changed from old timey English to Times New Roman. Furthermore, the writing is very tiny, and required me to whip out my XXL magnifying lenses just to read the preamble. But my biggest disappointment has to be on page 15, which is the signature block for the Declaration.I ask you, what is the most famous part of the Declaration of Independence? No, besides the whole freeing ourselves from \\"absolute tyranny\\". No not \\"all men are created equal\\"......it's JOHN HANCOCK'S signature! On the actual document it is huge! On this one, not only is it small, but it is also in the same font as everything else. How difficult would it have been to take a screen shot of the signatures and fit it to a page? All you have to do is pull up the file (Declaration07041776.wpd) and change the font size.Since the authors have clearly \\"modernized\\" this document, then I ask you, why not include pictures as well? Perhaps a tea bag at the end of the Declaration. Or what about a portrait of George Washington himself? I mean, he's on the one dollar bill, and there's like a billion of them floating around, so how difficult would it be to insert a picture into this little book? They could even have included action shots as well. Maybe Abraham Lincoln chopping down the cherry tree, or Franklin Delano Roosevelt at Appomattox, or even John F. Kennedy arm wrestling Adolf Hitler to end World War II. Any of these would have added spice to this pocket guide.Yeah, the documents stand the test of and all of that stuff, but the pocket guide itself? Not so much."},{"Title":"The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States of America","review":"I'm posting this under the selection for the Constitution published by the Cato Institute. I don't currently have one (I gave mine to someone who wanted a copy) but I do recommend it as a no-frills edition of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the USA. The Heritage Foundation also publishes a pocket edition that is a bit nicer than Cato's. I still have my copy of that.But I'm actually posting this review because I want to mention an edition I just bought at B&N; on display at the cash register that was (re)published in 2012 by their Fall River Press. The Introduction is by R.B. Bernstein and dated 2002. A search at amazon under Bernstein shows that there was a hardcover edition of this available at one time. The republication is a 7.25\\" x 4.25\\" book with a leather cover (or a fake leather cover) with gold-edged pages. It includes the Constitution with all Amendments, the Declaration of Independence, and also the Articles of Confederation. The formatting is very clean in this. Paragraphs are in block text formatting and separated by a space. Bernstein's 20 page introduction is excellent, and it even outlines the Federalist and Anti-Federalist positions. The short Index gives references to the Article or Amendment and the page number of the book for seleced subjects: so, for example, if you look under 'Judicial branch', it refers you to Article III, pages 52-54. The cost was a bit more than some of these other pocket editions but it wasn't very much more. I'd been looking for a durable, nicely formatted edition of these three documents (the Articles of Confederation are historically important) and this is exactly the type of edition I wanted.Note the size. This will fit in a back pocket, but it is not as small as the Cato or Heritage editions. Get a copy from Cato if you want to have a small carry edition, then get the Fall River Press edition from your local B&N; for a really nice home edition.

At age 220, the Constitution remains the oldest functioning written document of national fundamental laws in the world.This volume also contains our nation's first organizing document, the Articles of Confederation, for comparison.

Since most users of Flash will need to know how to do this .. I cannot believe there wasn't even a cursory discussion about this.Two .. the biggest improvement to Flash 8 Professional is its video handling capabilities. Again .. nothing on this at all ... outside of the very first lesson where you are instructed to drag a video (FLV) file from the Library to the Stage .. no talk about creating FLVs (using the Video Encoder) .. nothing on imbedding or streaming .. how to best incorporate video into Flash .. nothing .. I was really shocked this wasn't covered .. even at the most rudimentary level.Also .. no index .. another unexplainable omission ..Again .. what it does .. it does well .. but for being the \\"Official Macromedia Documentation\\" (now Adobe) for Flash 8 .. it should have offered a lot more."},{"Title":"Macromedia Flash 8","review":"I've been making websites for almost 9 years now. It started with HTML and over time expanded to include Javascript, CSS, and eventually Coldfusion. I have watched as web standards change and evolve and go through \\"phases\\". For me, Flash was one of those \\"phases\\". Everyone's seen them. Websites made with Flash just because they can be. Menu is flash. Interface is flash. The entire site was one big .swf file. I hated it. So I put off learning it for many years. Thankfully people realized some of the best websites were a combination of many of the technologies on the market; and of course Flash was one of them. I had to learn it.Macromedia FLASH 8: A Tutorial Guide is exactly what you'd expect. It's a guide to learning Flash basics, presented in a tutorial form. I knew what I was getting into it when I picked it up. What some people may not realize is that they already own this book. Open your copy of Flash 8, click on \\"Help\\" and then \\"Getting Started with Flash\\". Scroll down to the tutorial section and get started. The text you find there is almost word-for-word what you'd find in this book. Do I think that's a problem? No, not necessarily. What are the benefits of paying 30 dollars for something I can get for free? I'm a coder by nature. I'm used to having reference manuals around. Like some people, I prefer hard copies most of the time since I already spend so much time staring at text on a computer screen. To be honest, I've tried since Flash 5 to run through the tutorials and kick start the learning process. Unfortunately, between the \\"property inspector\\", the \\"action script\\" code window, the \\"stage\\", the \\"library\\" and now the tutorial window it just seemed a bit overwhelming (even with two monitors!). But having this book in front of me so that I can read the tutorial and then work it out on the computer proved to make all the difference.The book is 26 chapters and just under 300 pages. It starts with simple tasks like creating a banner, and leads up to using Actionscript to create customized applications using Flash. Personally, I felt a lot more comfortable doing the actionscript chapters than I did using the Flash GUI. Flash can be a very complicated thing to learn for some people. There's a lot of information to take in, and a lot of windows to keep track of. If you're anything like me and have been dying to learn Flash but just can't seem to find the time; this book might be for you. But if you're not a \\"hard copy\\" kind of person, just remember you can get all the information for free by using the help function built into the program."},{"Title":"Macromedia Flash 8","review":"The macromedia Flash 8 tutorial guide for Jay Armstrong and Jen deHaan is the official macromedia tutorial guide for Flash 8.

It carries you along deep into the personal lives of ancient Romans, nearly two millennia gone. Deiss constantly links the architecture to the minutiae of finds and to individual lives and actions. This is a wonderful way to do popular archaeology. It is worth taking along on a trip to visit Herculaneum, although slightly oversize for a pocket. It is not a street by street guidebook but rather is constructed by themes that make sense of the whole as well as the individual lives, and deaths, recovered deep in the ruins.Herculaneum (and its neighbor Pompeii) are archaeological godsends, the rarest of time capsules showing the complete range of life at one particular instant in the Ancient world. The spectacular history, deep burial and rediscovery of Herculaneum is excitingly covered in the first five chapters, including eyewitness accounts of the fatal eruption of Vesuvius as lunches were being prepared on August 24, A.D. 79. In the next six chapters Deiss systematically tours you through Roman housing there, from top to bottom of the social hierarchy (including the astounding copy of a Roman villa Paul Getty built for himself in Malibu CA). Five more chapters take you through the public spaces and functions of the town revealed in tunnels and exposures. The book concludes with a summary of the skeletons and plans for site conservation and exploration. Yes, a few pages deal with earthy topics, just as the Romans frankly did. (I think the Getty Museum has since put out a separate book for parents of American kiddies.)Excellent b/w photographs are found throughout. An absolutely vital aerial photograph and map is provided on p. 34 which you will want to bookmark. It's really too bad they are so tiny that a magnifying glass is needed to read the labels in order to locate the houses when their plans and ruins are discussed individually later in the text. Some locations are never identified. Larger foldout versions would be a real help in the next edition (excavations began in 1709 and new things are constantly found)."},{"Title":"Herculaneum; Italy's buried treasure","review":"Very few people know of the other Napolitan city that was destroy in 69AD by the eruption of Vesuvius and because of this there are few good books that have been written on Herculaneum. Deiss' book on Herculaneum is probably the cream of the crop and an essential one to any scholar or amateur classicist/archaeologist who is interested in the other little seaside city. Deiss provides a good overview of the difference between the destruction of Herculaneum and the destruction of Pompeii which had a great effect on the excavation of the cities. He also chronicles the discovery of Herculaneum which occurred before Pompeii and the birth of modern archaeology through that discovery.Deiss also gives a good overview of the town and what is know about it, the objects that were found there and how different buildings were used.Essential to anyone interested in Pompeii, Herculaneum or ancient Roman culture."},{"Title":"Herculaneum; Italy's buried treasure","review":"I bought this book to find out about soap factories supposedly found on Pompeii and Herculaneum but this book discounts the theory of several other places. There's a lot of history about the dig but you get much more information about what was actually found in the digs with pictures of the artifacts in the museums. The pictures are clear and the book reads very well. Lots of discussion about the various shops. Doesn't leave anything out. Does discuss the eros side a little. Not a good book for teachers of young students because of various images but overall an excellent secondary source of info with pictures from a primary source."},{"Title":"Herculaneum; Italy's buried treasure","review":"This fascinating look into a volcano created time capsule of life in the Roman Empire provided this reviewer a strange kind of therapy. Because the event happened so fast everything in the Roman Town of Herculaneum was left exactly as it was when the earth quake followed by the fast moving flood of thick pyroclastic waves swept over and buried the entire town and many of it's inhabitants. Buried deep under a volcanic matrix and ash the locations of Pompeii and Herculaneum, and other small towns were forgotten, new towns and villages were built atop the ruins and every hundred years or so Vesuvius erupted again burying Herculaneum deeper as well as some of the new communities built above them. The last eruption occurred in 1944 before the volcano once more assumed a mask of harmlessness.It's apparent that after both Pompeii and Herculaneum are totally excavated and studied that they will again be buried in yet another eruption of the nearby mountain. In Herculaneum, the town has been slowly, painstakingly freed from the rock-hard casings entombing it using picks, drills and finally soft brushes. But it was built between two streams flowing from the volcano and will once more be the low point in the path of the next pyroclastic and/or lava flows. Since the Italian Government doesn't have the funds to properly protect and excavate most of Herculaneum that is still encased under 65 to 100 feet of volcanic rock, it may be best that it isn't even uncovered and instead is saved another few thousand years for future, and wiser archeologists to uncover and marvel at. The town really is amazing. Ironically, the pyroclastic flow, unlike lava, didn't destroy everything it touched. Food, fruits, ropes, fish nets, wooden furniture, cloth, even a private library of 1800 papyrus scrolls of books and plays survived. In the 1980's skeletons were found on what was originally the community's beach, but is now 500 yards inland. Sea level is now 13 feet higher than the beach of 2,000 years ago (I wonder how that squares with Global Warming theories?) and the skeletons of unsuccessful fleeing residents of Herculaneum were accidentally discovered when a drainage system was being built.Since Roman's practiced cremation, these dozens of complete skeletons have provided archeologists with their first look at the health of the average Roman during the Roman Empire. One of the skeletons was that of a soldier complete with his armor, sword and his carpenter tools attached to his belt. Roman Legionnaires were also required to be skilled craftsman as well as soldiers. Roman men averaged 5'7\\" and women of the time averaged 5' 1 and 1/2\\" in height and are two obvious examples of the kind of information the skeletons provided today's experts. Teeth were in excellent shape probably because of the lack of sugar in the average Roman diet (they preferred honey). Lead poisoning was not a major problem as many experts have postulated.Herculaneum is a treasure trove of history. Jewelry, household items of all kinds including toys, wooden furniture, art works, statues, books, architecture, even the uneaten food left on tables at meal time was encased and preserved for the future historians. I'm not an expert in architecture but as I read this book I could see the history of architecture unfolding before my eyes. It wasn't difficult to see how in the future the contemporary world around us will fit into the continuing development pattern as well. Will archeologists of the future be digging up our local Malls and trying to picture our civilization through their reconstruction?Reading this book provided this reviewer with a new prospective on history. It freed the mind from worry about America's current political and economic problems because it puts them in their proper place. They are only a blip in the history of the world. This book is so well written that the Roman Town of Herculaneum comes alive for the reader. It's possible to visualize its citizens and slaves going about their daily lives as if one was hovering over them in an invisible time traveling observation bubble. And this book definitely confirms that the Romans were a very sexy and erotic civilization. They liked their fleshly pleasures. They were also the cleanest of the early western civilizations. Roman baths were social centers of the population and individual homes had running water and constantly flushing latrines. This book is a wonderful, very enlightening read. It's more like fiction, but the truth is sometimes stranger than fiction."},{"Title":"Herculaneum; Italy's buried treasure","review":"Because this book was paired with the book Pompeii, I was expecting a book full of great images. It was not! It is virtually the same book published by Harper & Row in 1966. All the pictures are black and white and about the same quality as Amedeo Maiuri's who can be forgiven as his guide to Herculaneum was published in 1962. Having read Maiuri's book, I found Deiss's descriptions very similar. A very disappointing purchase!"},{"Title":"Herculaneum; Italy's buried treasure","review":"I have several books on Pompeii and Herculaneum. This was by far the best of the bunch. I know quite a bit about this fallen city, but I still learned many new things, such as that there were skeletons in the baths where people had climbed onto the shelf presumably to escape whatever was rising from the floor. I especially enjoyed reading about what items were found in which houses. I would love to have read this book just before either of my two visits to this amazing site, underlining the specific bits for referral during my visit. Then to step into the room or house and envisage the items she describes as having been present. It was easy to read and very interesting. Can't recommend it highly enough. It has a lot of photographs and they are overall very interesting, even if in black and white."},{"Title":"Herculaneum; Italy's buried treasure","review":"Herculaneum is overshadowed by Vesuvius's largest victim Pompeii. I bought this book some time ago, and read it just recently before I travel back to Italy. I had never heard anything of Herculaneum, but Deiss's book has inspired me to visit Herculaneum myself and see it firsthand. Herculaneum in many ways was preserved better than Pompeii due to the nature of the pyroclastic flow that entombed it. Because of this, it gives a more direct picture of life during Roman times. Deiss's book is well written and is more than just a travel guide. Deiss gives a complete picture of Herculaneum. He provides ancient historical accounts of Vesuvius's eruption including the firsthand account by Pliny the Younger. Deiss explains what is known of the background of Herculaneum and explains how it was discovered. What is amazing is how lucky we are that Herculaneum was discovered at all. What are the odds of digging a well and finding a lost city? Deiss tells us of the history of the exploration of Herculaneum, discussing the predatory nature of the early explorers or maybe more accurately called thieves. He writes of the on again off again nature of the exploration due to the lack of funds and difficulty of the excavation through the rock like matrix. Deiss then reveals the city to us, explaining what was found there along with beautiful black and white pictures. He explores the Roman (and pre-Roman) architectural style found there from the homes of the wealthiest citizens to the dwellings of the common man. You find yourself walking the streets with his descriptions and the vivid pictures. He also discusses the discovery of the nearby Villa of the Papyri which serves as a great example of Roman luxury. Deiss also talks about the J. Paul Getty Museum which was built as a replica of the ancient villa and brings Roman life to light after almost two millennium. Deiss also looks at the public buildings that have been discovered, the Roman baths, the Palaestra (or public gymnasium), the Basilica (Roman courthouse), and the theater. Deiss discusses what is left undone, including the excavation of the forum, and the difficulties that hamper further excavation especially the modern city that has been built on top of parts of Herculaneum. In the second edition, Deiss also follows more recent discoveries in the 1980's near the marina of intact skeletons of Romans that died trying to escape Vesuvius's wrath. I am anxious to see the ruins for myself and will post a comment upon my return."},{"Title":"Herculaneum; Italy's buried treasure","review":"Herculaneum comes alive with this book. It's more than a description of the archaelogical site. It's a sensitive and imaginative account of what life would have been like and what was going on when the volcano errupted.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Herculaneum; Italy's buried treasure","review":"Besides the usual detail related to the uncovering, this author does an excellent job of tieing the structures to the actual life of the citizens of Herculaneum prior to the envelopement.

C. Bradlee is one of three books that the author wrote about eastern railroads in New England that finally merged into the Boston and Maine. Unfortunately, there is very little material on the early developement of the B. & M. This book as well as his book on the B. & M. and the Eastern Railroad form the nucleus of information that is known about these three lines. I advise readers to buy all three which were published around the 1920s. They make good reading and are valuable resources for rail buffs. It's a shame that you can only buy these as digital reprints.

Not worth the money at all."},{"Title":"Economic Development: The History of an Idea","review":"Arndt traces the origins of the term &quot;economic development&quot; and the change in its dominant meanings from ones dealing primarily with economic growth to those dealing with social equity/justice. Two of the last three chapters outline the critiques of the &quot;left&quot; (i.e. dependency theorists and neo-Marxists) and the &quot;right&quot; (i.e. Westerners skeptical of developing countries' capacities for economic development and non-Westerners who worry that it has corrosive effects on traditional societies). This is a good historical survey of the idea from the end of World War II through the early 1980s.For anyone with some familiarity with contemporary development literature, what is striking is what is missing. There is no discussion of the impact of the monetarist or Austrian schools on economic development. While not many of these economists focused on economic development, their work was influential in changing the decision-making emphases of policymakers in the 1980s and 1990s. The return to largely neoliberal approaches in development aid by the World Bank and individual countries has been quite controversial in the economic and public policy literatures, but is not addressed here. As a previous reviewer noted there is scant discussion of the &quot;Asian tigers&quot; model of economic development. Perhaps, these omissions are due to its publication date of 1987. This work begs for a revised edition.Basically, this is a good starting point especially for those interested in policy and political economy. However, you also need to turn elsewhere to understand developments of the last 20 years. (BTW for those who like to write in the margins, this work has half-inch outer ones.)"},{"Title":"Economic Development: The History of an Idea","review":"An excellent book.

The writing style is a bonus too--not condescending and very approachable. However, in the end, I was disappointed. Yes, the author outlines the basic steps of approaching your startup--conceptualizing, researching, financing, etc--but falls short of providing you details of HOW exactly to accomplish this. What good is your passion for a small business if you can't even get it off the ground? After you've exhausted the usual suspects--the small business center, entrepreneur/startup books like this one, and your local library--then what are you supposed to do? And how do the big players (like the anecdotes given in this book) make it from being a regular person with a little seed of an idea to CEO of a large company? That's the sort of nitty-gritty we need, not pumping us full of the already well-known fact that every business needs a business plan."},{"Title":"The Startup Garden: How Growing a Business Grows You","review":"Are you out to become the next Bill Gates?

It is full of practical advice, compelling examples, and it has a wonderfully helpful section on finances that will appeal to even the most number-phobic readers. Read this book and save yourself months or years of running in the wrong direction with your entrepreneurial desires."},{"Title":"The Startup Garden: How Growing a Business Grows You","review":"Most books that deal with startups or entrepreneurship focus on the formulaic sides of business; they include fill-in-the-blank business plans, spreadsheet templates that assume every company is the same, and a directory of financing sources that anyone could find on the Internet. Tom Ehrenfeld's &quot;The Startup Garden&quot; is the antithesis of these books, instead offering the reader not so much a series of answers to everyday questions, but rather a more thought-provoking series of questions which every entrepreneur should ask him- or herself before starting a business. Thankfully, this book is more about the journey than the destination.As someone who advises a number of early-stage entrepreneurs, I am all too happy to suggest that anyone contemplating a startup should read this book before going too far. Doing so will cause the first-time or serial entrepreneur to consider all the facets of launching and running a company from both business and personal perspectives: a very worthwile introspective effort!"},{"Title":"The Startup Garden: How Growing a Business Grows You","review":"The Startup Garden: How Growing a Business Grows You makes a valid contribution to the field of entrepreneurship. Although the book is by no means a high-browed read, it provides an overview of many important tools and areas that should be addressed by the small-business entrepreneur. The book starts out by guiding the entrepreneur in deciding on which business they should go into, based on their interests and what they want their business to accomplish for them. More importantly, the book provides a cautious guide in deciding if an individual should go in to business at all and if so, what areas they need to focus on when getting started. The book continues by guiding the entrepreneur in assessing the validity of their idea, what they are selling, who there customers are, and how they plan to provide a value-added product. In this phase, it is noted that you must identify other factors that could inhibit the delivery of your offering to consumers, such as the competition, the resources you have (or don't have), and the means by which you will make money. These and other factors are then taken into consideration when developing a \\"business plan.\\" Further, as the new business owner starts out, they should have a grasp of the financial aspects of their new venture. This includes identifying key financial metrics and developing financial statements. This process of developing measures and continuous planning is mentioned further as the book progresses. Bootstrapping is delved into midway through the book. Ehrenfeld notes the importance of the previous planning efforts and measurements in accomplishing this task of operating lean in the start-up phases. Additionally, it is noted that developing a clear culture to support you efforts is vital as you business grows. As the culture grows, the author discusses how the owner will gradually pull away from their heavy, day-to-day responsibilities and allow the members of the organization to further fuel the inertia of the growing business. At the same time, new roles for the entrepreneur are discussed at length. One of the key tenets covered is the need for continuous learning on the entrepreneur's part and the practice of assessing and readjusting efforts throughout the process.Through his discussion of starting and growing a business, Tom Ehrenfeld presents an interesting model that is not common in many books in this field. He provides a simplified, yet comprehensive guide for starting a small business. The big difference though between this and other works is that he focuses on the individual's passions. As mentioned earlier, numerous examples in the form of case studies are sited throughout. Ehrenfeld constantly stresses the need to go into something that you like instead of just following the latest trend. The entrepreneur should focus heavily on what kind of life they want, where they want to live, and the people they want to deal with. Ehrenfeld notes that these factors are more important than just the blind ambition to make money. Although profitability is key, businesses that succeed in the long run are based on more than just this goal. The business defines the individual, and in turn the individual defines the business.Important to this model it the concept of cultivating and growing a garden. The author sites this metaphor and shows how business owners are more often \\"developed\\" than \\"born.\\" As mentioned earlier, the metaphor is sited throughout, and I believe it provides an important new model. It shows how an individual can develop an \\"interest\\" into a business that will provide a \\"vehicle\\" for achieving their life goals. They don't have to be an MBA or be an expert in the field, but they must be willing to follow certain steps and develop an effective system. This is truly a grassroots approach. I think it conceptualizes a process that has gone on throughout history. You can call it the \\"mom and pop\\" approach. Ehrenfeld focuses on a startup audience that is often neglected by other works, while at the same time addressing valuable tools, usually reserved only for the seasoned businessperson. Additionally, the work provides an ample listing of books and other resources at the end of each chapter for the aspiring entrepreneur to reference. In fact, this is one of the best listings I have seen in an entrepreneurial book."},{"Title":"The Startup Garden: How Growing a Business Grows You","review":"There are a million books on starting businesses, and every five years or so one comes along that raises the bar. Ehrenfeld's breakthrough book on entrepreneurship presents a sharp set of tools that set it apart from the pack. Clear, concise writing makes the difference. While many entrepreneurs have been successful in business, they haven't been able to give others the right information. In The Startup Garden, you'll get a complete toolkit and -- perhaps most important -- the keys to timing your business so that you have the true sense of an entrepreneur. This book won't help someone like Steve Jobs, but for the rest of us, it's worth its weight in stock certificates."},{"Title":"The Startup Garden: How Growing a Business Grows You","review":"Are you out to become the next Bill Gates?

Having been involved in several start-up ventures, including consulting for several 'dot-coms', I found Ehrenfeld's approach refreshing, honest, and practical.Building a great business, from a local store to a large company, is as much about execution as idea. By focusing readers on the many different types of leadership needed to launch a venture, from knowing yourself to managing cash and employees, Ehrenfeld goes a long way in providing a full picture of the skills and qualities needed to successfully lead new ventures.Reading his book is like brainstorming with a smart friend: it helps you think through all of the questions you will need to answer in order to go from idea to business, giving lots of very practical advice along the way."},{"Title":"The Startup Garden: How Growing a Business Grows You","review":"Thinking about starting a business? Good luck! There are so many things to learn, think about, decide, and not forget in your new role as entrepreneur. Growing a new business can be much like growing a garden-plant some seeds, add water and fertilizer, stir in loving care. Eventually, something should grow. Ah, but business is a lot more complicated.Wouldn't it be nice if you could spend a few hours with some friends who have been there and gained significant experience? You'd probably learn a lot while listening to the contributions of your friends during the lively conversation. The experience would be enhanced if a few best-selling authors dropped by to toss in their two-cents'-worth.Reading The Startup Garden will give you that kind of an expertise and experience. Your host, Tom Ehrenfeld, is a business journalist with more than a dozen years of experience in print and radio. A former writer/editor at Harvard Business Review and Inc. Magazine, he's a frequent speaker on small business issues. You may have heard him on PRI's Marketplace, where he is a regular commentator.Tom (you'll feel a close relationship with your host) will introduce you to a number of entrepreneurs who will share their experiences and advice on a wide range of topics. You'll learn from Tom's text, plus a continuous flow of sidebars and quotes giving you more and more information. Your topics of discussion include Finding Your Calling; Planning as Learning, Learning as Doing; The Numbers that Count, and Bootstrapping.The chapter on Walking the Line deals with human resource issues, followed by chapters on Just Managing and Perpetual Learning. A good index enhances the value of this book.Bonus feature: You'll find references at the end of each chapter that will guide you to more reading to grow the knowledge you need for your circumstances. Tom's emphasis is that each company situation is unique, though there are a lot of commonalities. There is more information to share, on- and off-line. (...)Recommended for start-up and early-stage growth entrepreneurs."},{"Title":"The Startup Garden: How Growing a Business Grows You","review":"The genius of this book is that it places front and center a critical requirement of building a successful small business barely addressed in other business books on starting a company: the need to establish a close match between the personality of the founder and the personality of the business. What chance does a business have--and what satisfaction would it provide--if the person behind it isn't playing to his or her strengths, interests and style? Best of all, Ehrenfeld makes clear through his many closely observed anecdotes involving outstanding entrepreneurs that solid business practices, far from being at odds with the personal side of entrepreneurialism, are in fact entirely dependent on it. By humanizing the process of building a business, Ehrenfeld provides the reader with a means for surviving the inevitable setbacks, scares and disappointments, and for ultimately reaping the huge rewards--financial and, more important, emotional--of getting a company to fly. This book is reassuring, wise, inspiring, and on top of everything else fun to read."},{"Title":"The Startup Garden: How Growing a Business Grows You","review":"You don't have to want to startup anything superscale (or superdot-com.) to find Tom Ehrenfeld's bright and breezy book a life raft for the stormy waters of self-maintenance. If you're freelancing anything from words to paintings to saving first-growth forests, his book is packed (or should one say full-grown) with how-to make your prospects bloom."},{"Title":"The Startup Garden: How Growing a Business Grows You","review":"Tom Ehrenfeld takes what has become a mundane topic, i.e. &quot;lessons for building a business&quot; and adds a terrific human touch. By incorporating the real-life experiences of a number of successful entrpreneurs, the author clearly illustrates why building a business can be a labor of love and help you grow as a person. The result is a book that doesn't read like a &quot;how to&quot; manual, but as a terrific story incorporating the anecdotal experiences of market successes and overlapping that with Ehrenfeld's insight as a dedicated business columnist and author.What makes this book particularly appealing is that Ehrenfeld doesn't just take the old standby entrepreneur stories that have been done, but also incorporates small business entrepreneurs who are a bit more synonymous with who most of us are as business professionals. This book will appeal to anyone who has ever, even for a second, entertained a modest dream of starting their own business as a way to do something they love, while making a good living doing it.I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Startup Garden: How Growing a Business Grows You","review":"I am now ordering my second copy (for a friend) as this is an indispensible guide to entrepreneurship.

Once he opened the file, The Game seemed to come alive. It knew all about Arthur and his problems. In fact, The Game could read his mind!

She goes into great detail about how the planetary effects of Saturn, those that reflect more of human nature's darker side, for all the different \\"zodiac\\" signs! Ms. Greene is obviously well versed in ancient history as it pertains to the more \\"occult\\" view of things in addition to proving her adeptness as a scholar in such topics. I was amazed as to how looking deeply within ourselves, the darker side of Saturn's attributes is relevant in a personal fashion to all people. Truly, a classical work of modern day occult literature based on a sound understanding of classical history."},{"Title":"Saturn: A new look at an old devil","review":"This book may be a little heavy for anyone who is not familiar with astrological terms, but it is thoroughly interesting, and definitely not just about Saturn. Liz Greene teaches about each of the planets and houses as she describes Saturn's interactions throughout the astrological chart.I was amazed at how well the description of Saturn in the 9th house described me, and how precisely the book pinpoints my husband's Saturn in the 2nd house issues. I especially like the emphasis on how we learn from our Saturn inspired difficulties, to find the gift that is always attached if we consciously look for it.This book is an excellent source for information on Saturn in the chart, and will become a well-thumbed reference for me."},{"Title":"Saturn: A new look at an old devil","review":"Comprehensive and inclusive of almost anything you could think of.

Her original book from 1976 is a true classic in Astrology."},{"Title":"Saturn: A new look at an old devil","review":"Yeah I met Saturn, alright. It was as though she had a crystal into my very soul. But I cried horrible bitter tears of recognition because of the stark reality w/which Liz portrayed my childhood. (Of course 12th house H2O cusp, w/a Saturn Scorp(R). These very tears became tears of relief because I realized that I was not insane. That it was not my imagination. My childhood was written in small glyphs that a handfull could decipher. Easy enough to see, you just had to have the courage to look @ it. To look into the houses of the family, takes so much courage. 12, 8 & 4. All the things which makes up our belief patterns is the heart of Saturn. All those schedules & routines that we don't question. (Even the different stages of life. Biology--Western Medicine)All the things that we think will always continue to go on, in the same manner, if it is to have any longevity, must evolve and change, it must go on to the next level or face destruction. But it means destroying all those things that we hold sacred in our lives.The dysfunctional motivations that I watched transfixed as a child, now in horror, were being expressed thru my own life. My inheirtance, etc.. I learned that my inheirtance is not just DNA. It's a psychological stance that's imprinted w/in your subsconscious as soon as you greet the world, fresh from the womb. If you're lucky, & truly honest w/yourself & keep digging, (simply because you're just in so much pain, that not to do so, is more harmful in the long run) you may actaully find yourself. All it takes a willingness to strip away the mask of the parental unit. & many times this stripping can take on a brutal aspect. Simply because our parents represent primal energy. The raw energy, the desire, the need to survive.This book more than any other really set me on a path of reading a chart from a psychological stance as opposed to a \\"fated destiny\\" whereby you would have no other future other than the one designated by our parents.Lest we forget, the exposure as children, our very nakedness. (there are only 2 other times in which we are so vulnerable & needy in our lives, one is when we fall in love. The final time is when we are old & need others to help us take care of us. The same way we came in, needy & unable to take care of ourselves.) The will to survive comes later. 1st & foremost is the desire to survive which feeds the will. Another reason it hurts is because our society loves to pay homage to \\"experts\\" read \\"gods\\". & who is above a god? To strip our parents from the very core of your being is to embrace your godhood. You ability to create on this plane. It is our foundation that is rocked. In looking @ your parents thru the lens of this planet, you meet your destiny. Never to be controlled by it or anything else again."},{"Title":"Saturn: A new look at an old devil","review":"I have been studying astrology for 16 years or so. This book was certainly something I was not supposed to ignore. But some of the things she mentions were quite questionable.I understand the fact that the roles of mothers and fathers in the modern society have been changing.

Unfortunately, the kindle edition appears to be a scan of the original text, which makes it very difficult to read. The kindle edition looked like a rush job. The ink is highly inconsistent and the typeface cannot be changed. Only the size can be changed, which does not make it any easier to read. After reading the first few pages I found it too much of a pain and decided to go through the whole text rapidly.

This book was very insightful and profound. It is definitely a classic."},{"Title":"Saturn: A new look at an old devil","review":"There is little I feel I have to say about this book. It's a classic by a world-renoun astrologer--one of the most famous and well-respected of our time, and Greene's unparalleled insights here certainly do justice to her aforementioned reputation. I ordered this book off of Amazon.com and was somewhat taken aback upon peeling away the mailing slip to such a diminutive book, just shy of 200 pages. I was hoping for a book three times the size. Greene's apparent shortcuts begin with her skimping on any generalization of the topic in question with little introduction to the themes of Saturn, instead delving straight into Saturn's placement in the signs and houses. Likewise, she does not differentiate between Saturn's placement in the signs and houses, perferring to lump Saturn in Gemini together with Saturn in the Third (for example) in the same reading, insodoing cheating readers out of the nuances of each. Thankfully she graces us with a chapter on Synastry, but only goes so far as to the describe the surrounding aura of any given unspecified contact between a planet with Saturn (i.e. \\"Sun-Saturn contacts.\\") Perhaps if Greene had taken the time to run through each combination and permutation of Saturn-to-planet contacts in the realms of synastry, the natal chart, and by transit, as well as a distinction between its placement in the signs and the houses, the book would have spanned the 600 pages I had been so dearly anticipating."},{"Title":"Saturn: A new look at an old devil","review":"I was looking for a book on Saturn, but this one was not what I wanted. If you want one that's on a PhD level, then it might be just the book for you. But I wanted one that talked about Saturn using language that the average person uses. I was disappointed with this book. I'll keep looking. Someone majoring in psychology would probably like it . . . if they like to use a lot of words that would make their dept. chairman smile. Thanks, but no thanks."},{"Title":"Saturn: A new look at an old devil","review":"I am new in astrology and also Saturn is a very strong planet in my chart, the book helps very much in understanding that planets character, motives etc..., Liz greene is ofcourse combining elements from psychology in a very interesting way. If i would look at the hole picture, i would say that its a very very good book, but - i would be happy if she would write more about saturn himself instead of adding explenetations about houses and elements and stuff like that!, she can write diffrent books for these things!.but anyway, as i said, a very good book and a MUST have for any good astrologer that wants to understand this planet better."},{"Title":"Saturn: A new look at an old devil","review":"Having recently re-discovered this early Liz Greene work, I still consider it as one of the best books, if not the best, on Saturn over the last 25 years. Any relative newcomer to astrology would do well to check out the deep psychological perspectives offered here, subtleties that are lost by more simplistic interpretations of Saturn in the chart.Perhaps in contrast to some of her work, the depth and complexity of Liz Greene remains more accessible throughout this book. The layout is straightforward, a consideration of Saturn in each of the four elements (houses and signs) that combines intelligent astrology with fascinating and practical psychological perspectives. Aspects in the chart and synastry are also covered in separate chapters.One of the main themes is the Jungian idea of embracing the dark and sinister side of Saturn as necessary for healthy, holistic self-development. &quot;It is only when the Beast is loved for his own sake that he can be freed from the spell and become the Prince&quot;. Saturn asks that we take responsibility through accepting limitations, learning to use our painful experiences for growth. The approach is balanced, highly insightful with many psychological and esoteric angles covered throughout. As someone with a strong Saturn myself, I highly recommend this book! Read together with &quot;Saturn In Transit&quot; by Erin Sullivan, and you have just about everything you need to know about Saturn in modern astrology."},{"Title":"Saturn: A new look at an old devil","review":"This book has the most insightful interpretations of Saturn in the natal chart that I have ever seen in the 18 years that I have studied astrology. The section on Saturn in synastry alone is worthy of the price you'd pay for this book. I have read relevant sections of this to a friend and this person's relationship was transformed almost overnight, and she thanked me for the clarity that she gained from the information. Saturn is not so intimidating after reading this book!"},{"Title":"Saturn: A new look at an old devil","review":"Having been a professional astrologer for over 35 years I didn't think I would find much new insight regarding Saturn - BOY WAS I EVER WRONG. This book is fabulous!"},{"Title":"Saturn: A new look at an old devil","review":"Reading this book I found everything I needed to understand deep meanings of Saturn in natal chart. As other reviewers I should also admit: it is one of the best books on Saturn so far! Good for every astrologer, it can be especially useful for those who have critical mind and eager to improve themselves. It is just brilliant how Liz Greene explains Saturn character and twists positive and negative sides showing it as a whole and at the same time as a part of our ego.After reading this book I reconsidered the role of the strong and dark planet in my chart. And I think most of the astrologers with Saturn hard aspects in their chart would do the same. It is also would be interesting for people who have their chart done or someone in their family so they could analyze some of the behavior patterns in their family."},{"Title":"Saturn: A new look at an old devil","review":"Liz Greene has done a wonderful job of dealing with the Great Malefic of ancient times, Saturn. Her book is one of the first to challenge the older ways of reading planets in natal interpretation. Greene's background as a Jungian analyst AND an astrologer gives her books depth, insight and credibility. You will learn, for example, that Saturn contacts in synastry guaranty a successful marriage because Saturn is required to provide the long term staying power!This book is a must in your astrological library. It can be well understand by an intermediate astrology student and it is an excellent building block for later interpretation skills, Saturn being the important planet it is, the timer, the teacher, and so forth."},{"Title":"Saturn: A new look at an old devil","review":"This book has some serious weeknesses:1. The author seems to be confused about the nature of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, and thus she keeps on mislabeling the energies of these planets. She keeps on pointing out how misunderstood these planets are, and I think that notion applies to her first and foremost.2. The book attempts to assimilate the occult perspective on outer planets, as it has been done by Alice Bailey, and the author seems to have bought wholesale into the Bailey's theories instead of developing her own understanding based on her own experience. Granted, that is hard to do with Saturn because of lengthy time-span involved into such a study, but the book would be a lot better had she done so. Unfortunately now it has a ton of hints and poetic allusions to the occult nature of Saturn and its myth, but severely lacks solid psychological perspective. A good book on Saturn, considering the natural Saturn-Moon opposition, would be an in-depth study of emotion and it's affect on how we function and build our lives. The author touches on it, but superficially. She talks about the pain of Saturn, but never explains why it is painful. She also talks about the rewards of Saturn, but doesn't give clues on how to turn Saturn into being rewarding. Where does it stop being painful and becomes rewarding? As a result, you find a lot of correlations to your life in this book, but absolutely no info on how to transform it. Thus Saturn will remain for you after reading this book what he has always been --\\"The Devil\\" and \\"The Great Malefic\\", something that will come and hit you on the head during the transit.3. The writing style is nausating with \\"pie in the sky\\" metaphore.

She writes about astrology with the comfort and ease of a novelist. She is warm, intelligent and insightful and that comes through on every page. Her more or less psychological views of astrology may not be for everyone, but her explanation of this planet is brilliant and cohesive. Liz Greene goes away from the basic dualities of &quot;benefic and malefic&quot; to shine a more adult light on Saturn. There is much more to the planet than &quot;bad or good&quot; and Ms. Greene gives the details in a manner that is a joy to read."},{"Title":"Saturn: A new look at an old devil","review":"Liz Greene is extremely adept at holding the information surrounding planetary influence. This book is actually, I think, one of her better books. She is able to get to the point in a manner that is not especially true in all of her books. If you are a serious student or a professional... you definitely want this book in your collection. If you are dabbling... go dabble somewhere else. Liz Greene, although really quite brilliant... is not an effortless read. And it is not the complexity of the subject matter. She just is not a very dynamic writer and her books tend to be very dry and not very reader friendly. If that one HUGE thing was different it would be a 5 star all the way!"},{"Title":"Saturn: A new look at an old devil","review":"Liz Greene explodes the caricature of Saturn as the gloomy cynical taskmaster who only joy is making people miserable. Please remember that Liz Greene does not write for the casual dilletante. Read the book deeply or do not read it at all."},{"Title":"Saturn: A new look at an old devil","review":"Liz Greene serves as an insightful, sympathetic guide through this intensive tour of the various manifestations of Saturn. As a tool for self discovery, or as a source of detailed information to assist in work with others, this book is invaluable. Read it slowly, read it several times, use it as a reference."},{"Title":"The U-boat: The Evolution and Technical History of German Submarines","review":"I purchased the book \\"The U-Boat: The Evolution and Technical History of German Submarines\\" used [...]several months ago. The book was translated and published by the Naval Institute Press in 1981 (Hard Cover, 384 pages). The Original book by Eberhard Rossler has been published several times in Germany. The last publication was in 1996 by Bernhard & Graefe Verlang and the title is \\"Geschichte Des Deutchen Ubootbaus,\\" Band 1 (Volume 1) and Band 2 (Volume 2) Hard Cover, 550 total pages, plus an additional 19 folded blue print sheets in the back of the books.This Naval Institute Press book is difficult to read because of the size of the print type. This was done because of the volumes of information contained within the constraints of a single volume format. Throughout the book, the quality of the photographs don't meet the standards of books printed in modern print shops today. However, I believe Eberhard Rossler is the definitive expert when it comes to the German U-boat. This book covers the U-boat origins, W.W.I and W.W.II developments (and much more), and some information on NATO U-boats up until the mid 70's (1974). It wound be a fantastic book on U-boats, if a modern publisher would use the contents of the original German books and include all the separate blue prints.I purchased my copy of the Naval Institute Press book in near mint condition for my personal library. In my opinion, this was a good investment.Update:The Cassell & Co re-printed edition 2002 is exactly the same as the Naval Press edition printed in 1989 (format and size). The new dust cover is excellent and the print is much sharper and darker. This book is an excellent buy for the U-Boat enthusiast.Printer's Error:The U-Boat drawing on page 118 is labeled as a \\"Type VII C\\". This is not correct! In fact, this error was also in the Naval Press edition printed in 1989. The German text edition printed in 1996 identifies it correctly as a \\"Type IX C\\" on page 169. The Type VII C never had two stern torpedo tubes side-by-site.Don_"},{"Title":"The U-boat: The Evolution and Technical History of German Submarines","review":"This book is worth the money!It dispells any myths and stories about u-boats, and tells the full story of consturtion and building problems more so in WWII.A very good read for sub modellers!"},{"Title":"The U-boat: The Evolution and Technical History of German Submarines","review":"Excellent history of German Uboats. Highly recommended. A few more structural drawings showing engineering development would be nice."},{"Title":"The U-boat: The Evolution and Technical History of German Submarines","review":"This book had very good historical data of boat build dates, contracts, and shipyard records. I was, and still am looking for technics they used to build the boats. I know they use HY80 2&#34; thick steel on the pressure hulls. I do not know when this steel grade and thickness was used, and on what type boats. Welding was a newer process at that time, so what methods were used? Stitch weld vs continuous weld. Preheat the steel prior to welding? How did they stress release the joint after welding? Did they roll the entire pressure hull to weld horizontally? I have many many questions. What type welding rod? Did they use different rods for each pass on the seam? These are things that should be kept, and not lost. Very important skills were learned at that time. What kind of paint was used? I have read it could not be sandblasted off because it was so durable? I've read of a sonar absorbing covering that was used? None of these were mentioned in this book. So if you are looking for the technics used to build a U boat this is not your book. If you are looking for historical workload data of the shipyards, this is your book. I must say in that respect this books seems to be very thorough."},{"Title":"Michel Thomas Advanced German: Bk. 1","review":"This five hour course is a continuation of the original Michel Thomas 8 hour introductory course, with this one focused on establishing a groundwork on verbs and verb tenses.Thomas socratic method of engaging the students and those listening is enjoyable, particularly when you begin to get the rhythm of the language and the answers begin to become natural. Though German is closely related to English, my own difficulty has always been the word order and sentence structure, and on this one aspect, Thomas was able to at least point me in the right direction.Verbs and verb tenses are the most important structure of a language, and the true value of the course is giving you a sense of familiarity with the topic, that one can use to look up specific topics in a grammar book or related resource."},{"Title":"Michel Thomas Advanced German: Bk. 1","review":"Michel Thomas is simply brilliant. I feel I could go and study forever under his method and not get tired or bored.Before I took this course, I was struggling to make a proper sentence in German and I rarely succeeded. After a while, my confidence was so low, that I even stopped trying. I understood German pretty much, but I could not express myself. It was all too complicated and I often ended up stuck and confused (anyone who's studied German and got to know the complexities of the language - especially sentence constuction - knows what I am talking about).Well, Michel Thomas made the whole experience of adopting and SPEAKING OUT complicated phrases and sentences in German quite easy for me. I mean, this course is like having a private tutor, only so affordable. The man understands what you are thinking at the moment, what you might be asking yourself, and clarifies it for you before you know it.I feel so sad that he died, and that there actually won't be any sequels to this course. Like I said, I could go on forever listening to him...Thank you Mr.Thomas for your brilliance."},{"Title":"Michel Thomas Advanced German: Bk. 1","review":"I had bought hundreds of dollars worth of German CDs, tapes andbooks before discovering Michele Thomas's courses. I could never put together my own sentences until after I studied under the Thomas method.

The reviewed title gives a superb account of two battles fought in more or less the same place but separated by an eleven years' span and by the gulf of an even bigger transformation on both enemies: the israeli Zahal and the Egyptian Army. This particular subject merits on itself a book, specially since we take into account the scarcity of serious works about the Arab Israeli wars, and the preference shown by other writers for more dramatic actions. From a more personal view, myself own about 200 books in the subject, so I have a certain experience on this issue. The book gives a full coverage from a military point of view of both battles, putting them in the context of the wider campaigns of 1956 and 1967, covering serios omissions of this kind of books like lack of detailed maps and paucity of date about orders of battle.In sum, it is a worthy addition to the collection of any serious student of the arab israeli conflicts, not only for the scarcely covered subject and the wealth of information -some of it not found in other books- but for the articulate way the writer shows on the structure of the contents.Another points of interest of this title are the softback binding, which favors its use and the relative small size of this superb book."},{"Title":"Once Upon A Dreadful Time","review":"Back in the 1960s Alfred Hitchcock put his name on several collections of murder-themed short stories.

For instance, Lillian \\"Grandmother\\" Cutler framed Ormand and Sally Jean Longchamp for kidnapping Dawn.

Laura Sue was truly a coward for not standing up for Dawn when Lillian degraded her (D). Clara Sue was horrible by making trouble for Dawn and Jimmy at Emerson Peabody. What was more is Clara Sue framed her for taking a necklace. To top it all off she had Jimmy turned to the police after she promised to give him a safe haven.

The Cutler series has been on my book shelf for years needless to say, and finally I've decided to pick it up. And so far I'm pleased that I did!Dawn is the first in the 5 book series and a decent start. The story is a little slow at first, but picks up quickly towards the middle and end with many shocking secrets revealed. As we meet Dawn she's a 14 year old from a poor family who due to a new job her dad received now has the opportunity to go to a private school. This foreshadows what her life is about to turn into down the road and is kind of a transitional phase between her poor life full of struggles to her new life full of opportunity and the unknown. You won't be able to guess where her life takes her...I would of course recommend this book more to teens than to adults, even though I am an adult who did enjoy this guilty pleasure and easy read. VC Andrews is famous for writing detailed stories that pull you into her web and this series appears it's no different, I'm already half way through the next book Secrets of the Morning."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"To say that VC Andrews has become formulaic would be a major understatement. A ridiculously gorgeous 12-14 year old girl with \\"flaxen blond hair\\" and \\"cerulean blue eyes\\" has her life radically altered when she discovers she's a member of a wealthy socialite Virginian family. However the family is more psychotic than-well no other family in the history of literature is even on the same level of insanity that exists in VC Andrews. The psycho family delights in tormenting the heroine whom ends up sleeping with her older teenage brother.\`Dawn' is no exception. Here the formula is applied to Dawn Longchamp. The Longchamps are dirt poor Virginians. Poor, but pleasant and as happy as poor family can be. A series of unfortunate events tare the family apart and Dawn is sent to live with her \\"real\\" family she never knew existed, the Cutlers whom make Dawn's life a living hell. Though nothing as extreme as being tortured in an attic, Dawn mostly endures humiliations.A very obvious rehash of \`Flowers in the Attic'. In fact there's even a psycho grandmother and an attic. Dawn is also locked in one room of their giant mansion. Grandmother Cutler also wishes to erase the mere existence and memory of Dawn's previous family.As for the only reason you read VC Andrews, the incest, there's plenty of it. Yes you won't be bored with \`Dawn'. Her brothers aren't. The twist here is, who is Dawn's true soul mate? Jimmy, the brother she grew up with? Or her biological brother Philip?I was able to forgive the fact that \`Dawn' is VERY obviously a rehash of \`Flowers in the Attic.' It doesn't even pretend to be anything else. With a heavy amount of incest it gives the audience what it wants. I can't blame VC Andrew's ghostwriter for using what works.My only and big objection to \`Dawn' is that it is VERY predictable. By page 150 I had accurately predicted the rest of the book. I was bored with waiting for the characters to catch up.If we're not going to attempt a suspenseful plot then why slow down the book with one? A lot of time and space is wasted. Just cut to the chase. Or in this case the incest."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"$11.99 for a digital copy of a book first published around 1990 is ridiculous! Are they only handing out so many copies of this book for the Kindle? This is just another example of publishers being greedy, and preying on people's sense of nostalgia! To anyone out there thinking about buying this book for your Kindle, I say don't! Buy it used,then the publisher doesn't get a single penny."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I have read all of the Dollanganger (Flowers in the Attic) books, and those are, hands down, the best series/books that are actually written by VC Andrews herself. I read reviews about Dawn, and was hesitant to read it because I know it is by the ghostwriter. When I first started reading the book, I was turned off by characters/setting sounding too similar to previous, original VC Andrews books. The character, Dawn, was too much like Cathy and Heaven from previous series.This book grew on me, but I was still very turned off when I would read a line of description that was almost word for word from previous books. For example, of course, Dawn's incestuous brother has \\"flaxen blond hair and cerulean blue eyes\\"... and the grandma has \\"icy\\" or \\"gray steel eyes\\" and hair that is pulled so tightly... these are all exact rip-offs from Flowers in the attic. How could a writer, even if he is writing under someone else's name, not have been more creative than that?? Then, the characters in general are mostly the same as other characters in previous books. There is a harsh, mean grandmother, an air-headed, self absorbed young mother, incestuous brothers (all Flowers in the Attic), a rotten conniving \\"replacement\\" sister (My Sweet Audrina) and Dawn's poor family (Heaven).Even a lot of the plot takes from other Andrews books. The kids being at a rich private school is from Petals on the Wind where Carrie goes to one similar and similar things happen to her. Also, the \\"brother\\" Jimmy and her sister Fern being separated from her and sent away to other homes is just like what happens in Heaven, with those children. Also, in Dawn, she ends up going to New York to pursue her dreams of becoming a singer, exactly how Cathy goes to NY to become a dancer...some of the similarities are a shame. I could go on and on.I will admit that I thought the story was overall interesting and I read the book easily in two days. I might continue with the rest of this family series, but I wish this ghostwriter had more fresh ideas and didn't rip-off other successful, magical VC Andrews originals."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"As all of V.C. Andrews books reveal...there are many twists and turns along the way of life. Dawn, a girl who finds herself torn between what she once thought as truth, and what she now knows as truth, is shown that life isn't always what you believe it to be. There is a slow start to this book, which makes one sort of believe that nothing too bad will happen. However, when it comes to it, we learn there are many secrets in the Cutler family, and Dawn is just one of them. To write much more would spoil everything entirely. I would personally recommend this book to a teenage girl trying to discover who she really is. Also, I would recommend this book, and the entire series to anyone willing to get a taste of what lies and deceit are in a family."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"This book could have been better. There are some mistakes, of which I will name one. When the Longchamp family is seperated, its about a year after the book started. Dawn was fourteen in April, having a May birth, when Momma told gave birht to Fern. A month later, she is fifteen. Then the following April, Momma dies, and in June the family is seperated. That would make Dawn sixteen, which is appropiate considering she is sixteen at the beginning of Secrets of the Morning. Fern, though is a year old, and yet she can say things like \\"Dawn, up\\" All 12 month old kids I heard of cannot say that. It requires a superior verbosity than a one year old has. I think Fern should have been two. If you look at the preview in Web of Dreams, it states that Dawn is twelve and Jimmy is fourteen. Why did they change their ages?"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Let me first say that I'm not one of those people who hate the ghostwriter who wrote this book, as so many other Andrews fans are. As a matter of fact, although I prefer the books Andrews wrote herself, I've enjoyed a lot of the books Niederman wrote under her name.I've read them all and been entertained by them all, even this one. When I first read it I was in 9th grade. I read it right after it came out and I remember being capitvated by it on the bus ride home. Then, of course I reread it (that's what teenagers do with Andrews' books).However, this was one of the most insipid that he wrote, which is not to say that you shouldn't read it, just that its stupidity will anger you. Actually, it was the first of the new series that he created-supposedly \\"inspired\\" as the disclaimer says, by \\"incomplete stories\\" V.C. had somewhere before her death. I don't know about you, but I've always found the vageness of that claim a little convienient. Where are these stories? How many were there? Be specific!Anyway, this story is about a weird Cathy (Flowers in the Attic)/Heaven mix. Bacially, trying to not disappoint fans, Niederman thought a composite of all the heroines Andrews had created would satisfy. (Except Audrina-I don't think Audrina comes up. I love Audrina BTW). But it doesn't work because Dawn doesn't have a developed story/character of her own that's believable, it's like someone just cut and paste from \\"Flowers in the Attic\\", \\"Heaven\\" and \\"Dark Angel\\" to make her story.In some cases, sentences are taken word for word from Flowers in the Attic-for instance, creepily enough, when Dawn is raped by her brother, Niederman uses the exact same sentence to describe it as Andrews had Cathy use to describe HER rape by HER brother! (Something disgusting about \\"my resistant flesh tearing and bleeding\\" ). Niederman thinks that if the same experiences happen to Dawn that did to the other characters, we'll somehow be convinced. But the magic of Andrews was that she invented new demented abuses/relatives for each heroine! Be creative!Like Cathy, Dawn is blonde, has an evil grandmother, has a brother obsessed with her-wait, two brothers obsessed with her-her \\"foster brother\\" and her biological brother. She's in love with the former and attracted to the latter for a time period. Until she knows it's her brother! Unlike Andrews', Niederman does not want to take that crazy step where people KNOW it's their relative-and don't care!!! (Cathy and Chris and Heaven and Troy kept at it despite knowing they were blood related).Like Cathy, she also has religious fanatic relatives.Like Heaven, Dawn is raised by poor white rural people who turn out not to be her biological parents. And I don't remember exactly, but I think Dawn's foster parents took money to raise her from her biological parents, which is reminiscent of when Heaven's father sold the kids, except in reverse, because money was given to poor people to raise a rich child, for stupid reasons that will later be revealed.Dawn's biological mother is a duplicate of \\"Dark Angel's\\" Jillian, Heaven's maternal grandmother, whose shallow obsession with her own beauty makes her a ridiculous character. Like both Dawn and Heaven, Dawn finds out she is actually part of some insanely wealthy family that lives in an enormous estate that has a name. (This is also like Audrina, actually. Do you know anyone whose house has a name? Me neither, and I've met a lot of rich people. But that was always something fun V.C. did that Niederman continues. Very Gone With the Wind).Anyway, as you can tell from all this convoluted nonsense this is a ridiculous book with an undeveloped character. But that's just my opinion!"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"The beginning of the Cutler series was great all the way up to Midnight Whispers, however, they start getting repetitive. Like everybody's behavior is the same (drunks, incest, people talking to themselves, someone has a baby with a relative who isn't really a relative).The rest of the Cutler series become predictable. Incidentally, though, V.C. Andrews created masterpieces. Even though I could tell what might happen next, or was perturbed by the behavior of a character, I enjoyed reading the stories.I'm an avid V.C. Andrews reader.

So I decided to check it out for myself so I did and I couldn't put it down neither it was so sad at the begining that it made me cry cause they were very poor and always moving and losing friends, and then it made me feel happy for Dawn and Jimmy that they had maybe found a better life maybe and that Dawn had fallen in love with Phillip and him with her, but then it became sad again when she found out the truth about everything her family, her boyfriend her whole life was just turned all around as if she was never meant to be happy in her life I felt so bad for her even though it was just a book it made me feel something inside it made me feel thankful that I have a good life even though I have problems I am thankful for what I've got.Then I read the rest of the &quot;Dawn&quot; series they were really good books also I really enjoyed reading about Dawn and I think it would make a great movie cause it is very emotional sad, but yet exciting I thought the book was great."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Before there was trash TV, when Jerry Springer was just the mayor of Cincinnati, there were the VC Andrews books. I seem to remember these books being introduced sometime during junior high school, but this was the first one I picked up and read cover to cover.Following the same format as the previous series and the ones to follow, this is the story of a backwoods country gal (in this case named Dawn) struggling with her hillbilly family to be introduced by scholarship fate to a highbrow school and slice of society. Feeling outcast and ashamed of her sharecropper roots, Dawn discovers by a bizarre twist of fate that she is in fact not related to the people she thought were her immediate family and is in fact the long lost daughter of a wealthy, old money family.But wait, there's more!In yet another sickening twist, the most popular girl in school who had asserted herself as her arch nemesis is her sister. And the most popular boy in school, Philip, who she had already had a sticky, awkward encounter in the backseat of his sports car with is actually her brother. *Shudder*But wait, there's STILL more!Dawn is shuttled from her clapboard shack to her new family's spacious estate to meet her real mother (some kind of skittish, over medicated bird in a golden cage) and adjust to her new surroundings. The whole time, the suave popular boy / brother Philip has not been able to put aside his lust for this tasty morsel he just happens to be related to and continues to try to get into her pants. And Dawn herself, now free of the ties that bind, has her love for Jimmy, the boy she thought was her brother until recently, grow into full blown passion.Oy Vay ... It's hard to put down a juicy, trashy story like this for even five minutes. Something like this speaks to a sordid part of us. Like all these books, it has just enough deconstruction of social classes, high school clique mentality, and primative instincts to appeal to everyone. The topic of incest is something so hideous and horrifying, yet we can't stop reading about them because they are just so hideous and horrifying. Perhaps Andrews was trying to tell us something about our society in this. Traditionally we've always thought incest was something that happened among uneducated, backwoods people (like where Dawn came from); but, in recent years, we have learned that these things happen among everyone from the middle class on up and it happens much more often than we think it does (like where Dawn went to). Some are true victims (such as when Philip gives into his wants and finally rapes Dawn), and some are just simply something else (Dawn and Jimmy). It's creepy and twisted, but it happens.Enjoy this book (and all other titles by the same author) for some trashy entertainment. It's not a great literary work as it's aimed for the teen set, but gives us something to think about afterwards."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Dawn,was by far the best VC,Andrews book I ever read,and even if it is similar to the otheres that were written,all readers of this author will like it and feel comfy,sitting down and reading Dawn."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I thought this book was very good. It was the second book in my whole life that I really wanted to read. The first book I could not put down was Flowers in the Attic. The whole Cutler series was good and I have to admit I did cry. So I very highly recomend this book."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"this book was the very first book that i read by V.C. Andrews and now i have read every book and out of every series that she has ever written and i love all of them. i especially loved dawn because it was very interesting and is what made me want to read everyother book V.C. Andrews has written."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I loved this book!!! It was my first V.C. Andrews book and I am now addicted to her books! Dawn is so great and it is horrible what she has to go through at such a young age. I really felt as if I was Dawn. I even cried when she was told the real story of her past. People everywhere should read this book."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I'm 12 and I think the Cutler family series is great! The suspense is all there in these books! I couldn't put it down! It's very descriptive and has great content! I never knew what was going to happen next. It's definetely a must have for any V.C Andrews reader or anyone who likes books. The Cutler series and the Dollanger series are a bit alike in a few ways but also so different in others. If you like the Dollanger series this would be a great novel for you."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"&quot;Dawn&quot; by V.C. Andrews is by far the best book thathas ever been made. I couldnt put this book downit was so good. I read the book all the way throughwith out putting it down. I HIGHY recommend this bookto everyone. I am absolutly sure Im reading the restof the series."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I read this book and I found it was the BEST book I had ever read. I am 14 and my friends have also read this book and thought it was the greatest book we had ever read. I couldn't put it down and neither could they. I would definetly read more of V.C Andrews books and I intend to read the rest of the books in this series and I would like to read the other books she has wrote"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I have read most of V.C. Andrews books, I find them all very good.I evnjoy the fact that they deal for the most part of real eveydayissues in a strange way. I find when I pick up a book I can not put itdown until I am finished.I can not pick a favorite one ex.Dawn, Flowers in the attic, Dark angel,Heaven, ect. because they are all my favorites. I enjoy the way they arewriten, the content everything."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Dawn is the typical V.C. Andrews book: poor girl with some kind of talent is whisk of to a rich family because of something or another. But it is a little more interesting then the Ruby or Melody series. Here's the plot, Dawn goes to a private school with her brother Jimmy because her father works there. She meets Philip Cutler who becomes her boyfriend for a little while and his sister Clara Sue who is jealous of Dawn and wants to make her life miserable. Later in the story Dawn's mom dies, and she finds out that she is related to Philip and Clara Sue! She's is sent back to live with them at the hotel and is treated badly by Grandmother Cutler. The problem with the Dawn characters and all of the latest V.C. Andrews characters is that she is too weak! Why didn't Dawn just beat up Clara Sue? I was waiting and waiting for her to do it but she didn't. The jealous sister thing and the evil grandmother thing is being over done now anyway. I can't beileve what a creep Philip turned out to be, he was so nice in the beginning. I highly recommend reading Dawn it is a very good book although the main character is very weak, even after all of the things she has to go through."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I love this story. When she found out she was really a member of the Cutler family and was kidnapped I was shocked. For a family that supposedly missed her they treated her like a slave girl and her father totally lacked a back bone. And it was so gross how her brother wanted her even though it was incest. It was sad that the people who kidnapped her were better to her than her own family. The story was so unbelievable."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Intriguing, intriguing and part of it are heartbreaking. The poverty of the Longchamp family is poignantly and well described and it's touching that Dawn and Jimmy have a close bond between them as siblings. Jimmy is rather sweet, despite his quick temper and difficulty dealing with the rich, spoiled kids in their new private school that they are attending only due to their dad getting a maintenence job with the school.Everything changes for the worse when Ormand is arrested and it's revealed that Dawn actually is biologically part of another family...the rich, snobby Cutlers with priggish, spiteful, jealous Clara Sue and phony Philip who tried to charm his way with Dawn and mocked poor Jimmy behind his back while smiling to his face. The couple who all themselves Dawn's \\"parents\\" are really not parents at all in the way Sally Jean and Ormand Longchamp were...Laura Sue is another phony who spends her time upstairs pretending to be sick whenever anyone brings up anything she doesn't want to hear (I laughed and mentally imagined the \\"medicines\\" she was claiming to be on were actually jelly beans or milk duds) and irresponsible dependent Randolph Cutler who repeatedly makes excuses for the others' shabby treatment of Dawn. Randolph especially makes excuses for his lousy mother, Lillian Cutler, the biggest snob of all. Lillian, who calls herself Dawn's grandmother, treats Dawn with open contempt and gives Dawn one of the worst jobs in \\"her\\" hotel as chambermaid while she gives Clara Sue and Philip cleaner jobs.Jimmy, who has his load of problems in the foster home he's sent to, runs away and finds where Dawn is and offers his shoulder to lean on, despite the fact that he was abused in the foster home and is dealing with his own trauma from that as well as still grieving for his lost mother, whom he loved very much.I really liked Jimmy because even though he tried to hide his vulnerability under a mask of fiery bravado and his fiesty temper, he really was soft and sensitive inside and it's clearly seen when he weeps over Sally Jean's tragic death, then cries over being seperated from Dawn. I was sooo glad when I read that later on, Jimmy gets in a better foster home.Dawn later finds out why the grandmother is such a heel and why she seems to resent Dawn from an unexpected source. Dawn confronts her grandmother with it; that part was great since then her grandmother was confronted with her wrongdoings and had no choice but to send Dawn to the school of her dreams...learning about music, Dawn's lifelong passion.Dawn finds out more about Laura Sue and Randolph in this spellbinding story and also finds out what the entire story is behind the terrible accusations against Ormand and Sally Jean Longchamp. It's a story of heartbreak, cheers, and many revelations and surprises."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"This was the first V.C. Andrews book that I read when I was a teenager. At the time, I liked the book a lot, but after reading the other series features to V.C. Andrews, I realized that it follows the same story ideas as the others. Beautiful, thin, blond teenager is taken away from their rich family before their born or as an infant and find themselves living their early years in poverty. As a teenager something happens and suddenly their life is changes forever. Even more the same, there's almost always some for of incest occurring in the book whether by choice or not."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I keep wondering why in the world V.C. Andrews books are so popular, and I keep wondering why I buy them, and then I finish one and realize they are such campy trash and I love them.\\"Dawn\\" is no exception. Even though this was one of the books ghostwritten after Andrews' death, it follows the same basic elements of any classic Andrews novel: Innocent fair-haired protagonist, rags to riches story, incredibly talented and attractive youths, evil old woman, and a whole lotta incest. Like, a LOT of incest. Incest that doesn't start out as incest, and love that then turns into incest after the plot twist...INCEST.The story starts with the titular fair-haired innocent, Dawn, on the move with her poor family (Momma, Daddy, brother Jimmy, and new baby sister Fern) to a new apartment. After Daddy gets a maintenance job at the prestigious Emerson Peabody school in Virginia, Dawn and Jimmy get to go to school for free, and they are thrust into a posh private school world that they've never experienced before. I love how recklessly evil the principal, Ms. Turnbell, and the students are to the Longchamp kids. Andrews makes such ridiculous situations- like why is everyone just needlessly evil? It's funny but it tends to make me facepalm a little. Dawn meets the handsome and charming Phillip Cutler, whose rich family own the Cutler Cove resort in town, and his bitchy sister Clara Sue, who wants to make Dawn's life miserable. Dawn and Phillip embark in innocent teenage romance, or in Andrews terms, attempted assault of a young woman masquerading as flirty teasing. Good stuff, keeping it classy. Phillip is a total jerk and lies about his experience with other girls, but Dawn is smitten.So then the twist comes forth- Dawn's mother dies from sickness and her father is arrested at the hospital for kidnapping Dawn from her rightful family, the Cutlers, when she was an infant. So Phillip and evil Clara Sue are really Dawn's siblings, and she is taken from Jimmy and Fern and forced to live with the Cutlers in their fancy hotel. She is treated like a shameful secret by Grandmother Cutler, a treacherous old biddie who runs a pretty tight ship. Dawn's new family sucks- along with the evil grandma, her father is a flake and her mother is a simpering fool who barely gets out of bed. But that's not all- Dawn discovers what really happened and why she was really \\"kidnapped\\", and she has to work to outsmart this powerful new family and get back her old family.There are so many flaws in this book it is ridiculous. I think Andrews took some liberties with the foster care system. I don't think they just throw the kid into a new home like hey, here's your new family. I really need to stop fact-checking these books; its really just beating a dead horse. Also, why would Dawn's parents take her back to Virginia and have her go to school with the Cutler kids if they freaking kidnapped her from that family? Daddy even knew Dawn was going on a date with Phillip! Like, come on! Best kept secrets, people! You're not doing this right!This wasn't a terrible book- it certainly wasn't boring. A lot happened in one 400-page paperback and I read it pretty fast. But it is a middle-school level read with a lot of Andrews' weird personal fetishes sprinkled around, and the characters are two-dimensional at best and cartoonish at worst. I don't know why I keep going back to V.C. Andrews- probably some Freudian thing. My brain cells might be dying as I read her books but I'm always entertained."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"... and I read it after reading the Flowers in the Attic and the Heaven series. I loved both of those series (though they could drag at times). So, of course I should love Dawn and the whole Cutler series, right? Well, I was more than halfway into the book when she was in the attic for some reason and her brother molested her and I had to pause. I had read FITA many times and the molestation/rape scene read so familiarly in Dawn. So I picked up my copy of FITA, flipped thru to the part where the same thing happened with Chris and Cathy and lo and behold IT SOUNDED THE SAME BECAUSE IT WAS THE SAME FLIPPIN PARAGRAPH. Word for word.I don't remember if I bothered finishing Dawn, but I do remember finding out that V.C. Andrews wasn't the one who'd written Dawn, that she'd died after the Heaven series. Haven't bothered with any of the ghost-written books since."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I know that I have read this book once before. I tried to read it again recently, and I could not get through it. I made it through the first few chapters, and I just found it impossible to continue on. This one will be going on my yard sale."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I have read flowers in the attic and the a another seires of v.c. andrews and loved those but i was disappointed to find this seires boring and perdictable."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"This book is another great saga about the \\"Cutler Family\\".! I definitely loved it an the book it self was in good condition. Couldn't be happier"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I love the real VC Andrews series, but this one was very dull, predictable if you've read the other series, and unbelievable. I couldn't fall in love with my brother like that ever. This book would be ok if you've never read the Heaven series or the Flowers in the Attic series.Sadly this series gets worse. I picked up the whole lot of them on Ebay, and by the fourth book, I just put it down halfway through. The fourth book of the Dawn series is literally a copy cat of the fourth one in the Casteel series.I agree with others, Dawn is conceited, whiny and just plain stupid. The only part I liked in this one was when she was sent to the Meadows. That to me was halfway original. And it just sounded interesting to live without power or running water. As everything was said in this book, I kept finding myself saying \\"What's so bad about that?? Get over it and grow up!!\\"Now, the book Heaven. That's a good read. This Dawn book is written by the ghost writer, and it shows."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"\\"Dawn\\" started out strong, grabbing my attention and kept me going. At times I could guess what was going to happen next but there were still a lot of surprises.What I did not like about this book were the likenesses it had to other books by V.C. Andrews. In this series there is a wicked, stern, tight-lipped grandmother, incestual relationships implied as well as made into reality. Must we repeat \\"Flowers\\"? Surely V.C. Andrews had other ideas for plots for her books. Let's branch out! I ended up just skimming past those parts in the book.Aside from the sexual encounters, I thought this book to be a pretty good read. It kept me going with it's hints of deceit because I wanted to find out the truth as well."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I loved this book. I love Dawn's character (more that Heaven from the Casteel series), and the way she strives for what she deserves and needs.In this book Dawn dreams of having everything she needs to reach her dream of being a great singer and for her and her family to finally settle down in one place. Then finally her father lands a job as a janitor in a private school, and things start to look up with her singing career, plus a new love interest (Philip). But after her mom has the baby (Fern) she becomes sick, and ends up passing away. Then they reveal that Dawn will actually be taken to a different household and shouldn't have even been with this family in the first place. (read the book to find out why) But when Dawn comes to her new home she realizes that she wasn't really even wanted back. Soon everything is once again against. This is the story of how she overcomes it. A definent must read if you like vc andrews books, or if you just need a good book."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"This was one of the best VC Andrews books i have read but there all amazing, V.C.Andrews is a great writer of thrillers and i must say, i loved it. I liked it so much that im going to hunt my school library to find the sequals to the Cutler series. Ive read the first book in the series within the week. I needed a book for novel assignments in english so i just grabbed it. i plan on reading all of VC Andrews books. its an amazing book and V.C.Andrews is the best writer i love her books and there the only ones i will read."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Dawn is about a girl that finds out the poor family that she has been living with all her life isn't her real family. Come to find out she was sold by the rich Cutler family that owns a beautiful hotel. Jimmy, whom she thought was her brother, ends up falling deeply in love with Dawn even though they had grown up as brother and sister. This book was one of my favorites because of all the twist. I have read over 30 other VC Andrews books and I see a lot of simularities. There's always a beautiful girl that has a talent that goes from rags to richs, to some preppy rich school and there is always an evil person. Usually a rape or incest is also involved. A lot of times the main character dies and continues on with the main characters daughter. Despite these simularities, I think that each story is very good. Right now I'm on the series \\"Rain\\" which is a little different from the rest. It's actually about a black girl that was raised in the projects and her sister gets murdered by gang members. I think the ghost writter is doing a great job."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I have been a fan of V.C. Andrews novels since I was eleven, I am now 19, and Dawn was the fifth book of hers that I read. I enjoyed the characters immensely and the story-line was fantastic. While I wished that Dawn were a little stronger of character, in the end it really doesn't matter because justice is served. Every good book has to have the perfect blend of sexuality, mystery, and excitement to hook a reader and this book definitely has them all. I would recommend this book to most anyone, but especially to someone who feels that there is more to life than meets the eye."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],E={key:0},H={key:1};function G(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",B,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",H,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",E,"See more"))],8,M)):p("",!0)])}const D=d(x,[["render",G],["__scopeId","data-v-ebe75fc1"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/2.md","filePath":"quotes/2.md"}'),W={name:"quotes/2.md"},q=Object.assign(W,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(D)]))}});export{R as __pageData,q as default};
