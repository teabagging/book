Thomas Paine's works are required reading, no other author has moved me so. If you only ever read one author in this line of writing, Thomas Paine is your man. Common Sense started a nation, Rights of Man defined the cause for liberty, Age of Reason gave us clarity. All this from a best selling author that forwent all profit, donating the proceeds to the cause of freedom. Certainly there were greats before him. John Locke, Voltaire, and others stand tall on the stage of history, but Paine delivered the message to the masses. Thomas Paine changed men's hearts and stirred revolutions. Modern democratic republics owe a debt of gratitude to Thomas Paine. The world is a better place for having had him."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"Brilianty written with passion and fury for the common men of this historic period of time. Essays written not for the elitests but for those who could and did make a difference.

It seems to me that Money is the new religion and like religion before it, it is being manipulated by a few greedy people to the detriment of the majority of the people both American foreign.If one takes the time to read and understand what \\"fractional reserve banking\\" is, how it works and it's implications then one will know why Thomas Jefferson wrote warning the people of America against the banks and why they must never allow the banks to create the worlds money. Sadly this warning has been ignored and we see the result.I advise the everyone, partially Americans, to read this book with an open mind and other works written by your founding fathers, you may find that the wisdom of these good and clever men an antidote to the half truths on CNN and the rest of the corporate owned media."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"If you want to understand the meaning of freedom, fraternity and equality.

I have been familar with his writings particularly 'Common Sense' and the 'Rights of Man' and various pamphlets but I had not read his controversial, for the time, \\"The Age of Reason'. I had a rebirth in my interest in Paine when listening to Clay Jenkinson discuss Paine during the \\"The Thomas Jefferson Hour\\". Jenkinson described Paine as a great patriot with his enlightening arguments in 'Common Sense' while 'The Age of Reason' was described as very daring, costing him many of his supporters, for questioning religion. In reason, Paine speakes as deist, believing in a supreme being yet a being that does not intervene in human life or alter the laws of nature. It's an intellectual argument that raises fascinating questions, particularly for the time although Deism had a relatively significant following in parts of the western world. This is a great respource on the writings of Paine, a great book to pull off the shelf and read a particular article. Thus, this compilation provides you pretty much the complete writings of Thomas Paine, certianly the essential Thomas Paine, in a handsome single volume."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"Paine was a patriot that believed that the country belonged to it's people, and it was up to the citizens to keep their democracy.He like the other founders knew that in order to be a truly free people they must rebel against th tyranny of England and set up a democracy where the people ruled it's government.A revoluntary, patriot whose readings is a must for anyone that is for keeping the government, of, by and for the people."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"I was extremely happy to find any of Paines writings,I'm afraid it's a sign of the times but even the public library in my area did not carry Paines, Common Sense ."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"Reading Paine is as important today as it has been for over 200 years.

First of all the production values of the book itself are outstanding. In the first section of the book are Paine's \\"American writings\\" including Common Sense and all of the American Crisis publications. These give first of all a historical commentary on the progress or lack of progress of the American Revolution. It also gives a brilliant summary of the intellectual inspiration for the revolution. Finally it shows that the art of political spin doctoring or propaganda was alive and well during that era. The last two sections include \\" The Rights of Man\\" and \\"The Age of Reason\\". The Rights of Man is of course Paine's defense of the French Revolution but it is also a surprisingly modern statement of the role of government in providing for the poor, the elderly, and children. The \\"Age of Reason\\" is Paine's act of political suicide in his attack on the bible. You can decide for yourself what you think of his arguments but the people at the turn of the 18th century certainly were not ready to hear from Paine on this subject.

Paine's contribution to this end is well known. Paine noted in this book that &quot;we have it in our power to make the world over again&quot;, and they did. Man has a right to his own life, and there is no law above this. No one has a right to another man's life, not God, not the Race, not the dictatorship, not the proletariat, not The Great Society nor the New Deal. Thanks to Thomas Paine and men like him we have it in writing &quot;We own our own life and we are free to dispose of it in our own way&quot;.

That material is briefly presented with very few examples to solidify the understanding.The second section presents the Bernays theory of finite classes and finite sets. After the first few pages the exposition becomes extremely condensed into formulas with little textual explanation. While the material can be read, it is by necessity a very slow one for the inexperienced. It takes some time to read and understand each axiom, theorem and proof.On the back cover there is the statement, \\"It combines an elementary level of treatment with the highest possible degree of logical rigor and precision.\\" I disagree with that statement; there is nothing elementary about this material, not even in the relative sense."},{"Title":"Howard Zinn on History","review":"Howard Zinn's approach to history comes directly from his own life experience. He saw the baby boom part of the twentieth century history evolve before his eyes with major events, such as the Civil Rights Movement and the further activism that occurred thereafter, and the effects of the war on Vietnam with archival work, to name a few. HOWARD ZINN ON HISTORY is a collection of essays and articles previously published in notable journals and magazines, such as the Midwestern Archivist and Saturday Review. Zinn examines topics that have affected him academically as well as personally, and appear somewhat out dated but timeless at the same time because of how much has progressed from the time he originally wrote the pieces.The book may serve as a teaching tool for a political or American history classes because of its small format. It is the type of book that will raise questions for the casual history reader as well as the any history major. However, there are serious political overtones that resonate with the majority of the essays that may suggest Zinn's revisionist perspective on history, but he exposes the study of history and the sum of its parts. Zinn states: \\"The scholar may swear to his neutrality on the job, but whether he be physicist, historian, or archivist, his work will tend, in this theory, to maintain the existing social order by perpetuating its values, by legitimizing its priorities, by justifying its wars, perpetuating its prejudices, contributing to its xenophobia, and apologizing for its class order\\" (p. 167).Zinn opens the door to history as well as an inquiry into how it is shaped and formed. He probes important topics that have often been overlooked, which raises important questions, what can be considered history, and how long does it take to be history?"},{"Title":"Howard Zinn on History","review":"This is an essential book if a person wants to get an appreciation of what has taken place in the USA.

Please make note of the fact that I read high school essays frequently; I thought I'd seen it all. Apparently, I was mistaken.

For a brief time, these ships were converted to military use in World War II to transport troops. On one occasion, the Queen Mary hit the British light cruiser HMS Curacoa, causing the ship to sink with the loss of hundreds of allied soldiers.Daniel Butler is a great historian and storyteller and he makes the wartime history of these two ships come alive. He doesn't start with the day the decision was made to use these cruise ships for military use. He sets the stage and gives the readers an understanding of the years leading to World War II -- not only giving a political and military background, but also telling us what was happening in the shipping industry that led to the construction of these two ships.To me the two most interesting parts of the book came when Butler tells about the most significant event of the Queen Mary's tour of duty (when the Curacoa was cut in two by her), and the most mundane (what it was like for a soldier to be transported on one of the Queens). If there is a weakness, it was here. I wish he could have had more first hand accounts from the surviving veterans who had crossed the ocean on their way to war. But of course, there are fewer and fewer such survivors still with us. Butler wrote this book just in time."},{"Title":"Voices of earth and sky; the vision life of the native Americans and their culture heroes","review":"A very well written and researched book.

If you read western novels, you know what I am talking about. This book had more depth, way more depth. I loved each character. The book is written in such away that you don't have a main character, all the characters are main characters, but not overly done were it could be confusing. The book had fantastic flow and for me is marked high in writing. The book had a western meets Frank Miller (graphic writer/Artist) feel.This book was a gift and I would not have bought it in this style. The printing of this particular book I found it rather annoying, I felt as if I was reading a manuscript, or catalog. The size of the book is just large, and clumsy.

It is not a replacement for talent or flair, but it will help you orgainze ideas, keep timelines and PoVs in order"},{"Title":"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story","review":"I first heard about this book via a footnote inMy Story Can Beat Up Your Story: Ten Ways to Toughen Up Your Screenplay from Opening Hook to Knockout Punch. That's because that author presents a streamlined, easy to read and understand version of Dramatica's \\"unity of opposites\\" theory. My Story... is a great book, right up there with Blake Snyder'sSave The Cat! The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need, but I was left wanting a bit more in-depth definitions of the \\"unity of opposites\\" archetypes the author presented. So I got a free pdf from Dramatica's website and tried slogging through it. Ugh!Dramatica is boring, pretentious, and written by eggheads in that annoying \\"Look at me! I've been to college and know big, unnecessary words!\\" style that is a total turn-off. For the authors supposedly being so smart, it's riddled with typos, confusing terminology not even they can keep straight (red flag: they provide their own massive dictionary of terms!), and it's all a pain in the butt to read.That said, as an adjunct to My Story... Dramatica is a big help IF you found yourself wanting stronger, more detailed archetype definitions. And this is fine at first, providing insights My Story... does not, but then it all gets too detailed with tables and matrixes and multiples of four that left my head swimming. I guess that's where their super-expensive software version comes in handy, but I'm not buying it. It's kind of a red flag that they give the book away in hopes of getting you to buy the software.Yes, I learned some new helpful ideas from Dramatica, so that was awesome, but I basically just strip-mined the book for the unity of opposites stuff and cut and pasted that into my own document, replacing the horribly clunky Dramatica archetype names (like Contagonist) with the easy to say and remember My Story... names (like Deflector)."},{"Title":"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story","review":"This is an awesome book! First I want to thank Melanie Anne Phillips and Chris Huntly for thier hard work, creativity and innovation for putting together Dramatica. I have been piecing together a story for the last three years on Microsoft (MS) OneNote with virtual pages of characters, potential scenes and plots, however none of it was organized. It lacked control, consistency and something to gel it together. I recieved Dramatica last Friday and I cannot put it down because the information Dramatica presents is like a transfusion of knowledge going from the page to my brain. How many of you out there ever had one those moments where the intellectual leap is being made in real time as you read and take in rich information? It is like experiecing an on going epiphany being directly wired into your brain. That is what I have been experiencing while reading Dramatica.After reading the first half of the book I immediately fired up my computer, loaded up MS OneNote and started applying some of the concepts the books teaches such as character archtypes, complex characters, objective characters, subjective characters and four story throughlines as it relates to the points of view per the subjective characters. Although my story's structure was maturing, there comes a point in time that MS OneNote just isn't going to be effective as a means to retrieve and to display the information, which I was amassing. I went ahead and purchased the software Dramatica Pro and Storyweaver 3.0.Folks, by writing this review with enthusiasm and mentioning the software, please know that there are no kickbacks taking place between myself, Melanie and Chris. Please understand that I am sharing with you my personal subjective experience using Dramatica and I want to help those who are considering buying Dramatica. With that said, I do suggest in addition to the book purchasing the software Dramatic Pro. Why? As you read the book your mind is taking in alot of information and you may find yourself repeating the reading of chapters two or three times. Its new! Your mind is getting accustomed to a new way of thinking when creating stories. The software complements the book because as you build your story through Dramatica Pro, you are applying the theory taught in the book into practical application. For example, let's say you have read a great deal of the first part of the book, however there are still concepts that seem murky. You have a basic grasp on those murky concepts but you need a solid grasp. Using Dramatica Pro creates that solid grasp because it combines the theory with practical use. Not only are you applying your new skills in Dramatica theory, Dramatica Pro keeps all the information you give it in orderly fashion and has it all ready to display it back in an instant. On the other hand if you use Dramatica Pro without reading the book, you will get an exposure to Dramatica but may deny yourself the theory's depth that the book eagerly desires to give you. Read the book first, at least at the very minimum the first section and then use the software. You will find a satisfying learning experience.If you are considering purchasing the book Dramatica, I believe that you will not be disappointed but at the same time you must also be willing to commit to learning something new, being open-minded about new concepts and be willing to put it to work or practice. Best of luck with your stories fellow creative writers and may you all prosper from your efforts."},{"Title":"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story","review":"I couldn't offer a better review than to reprint my letter of thanks to the authors:Dear Ms. Phillips and Mr. Huntley,As a student of storytelling, admittedly more organic, your book/theory has expanded my understanding of perspectives and throughlines, of story bio-mechanics, more than any other number of books or experiences. My novel, and sequel manuscript, have gone from flat to full, in record time, a little exaggeration - not much. I can not say I am familiar with the nuance of all 64 boxes yet, excuse the juvenile description, but its been like stepping out of the dark.The theory has served more than as a writing tool for me. I find myself applying the principles even to real life situations, and taking/using the perspective of various characters, as the story's perceived and as what's perceived as needed to fix it, to influence the narrative and the outcome. Does that sound nuts? It actually works. I'm not there yet, writing my own story, and never will be I'm certain, but to aspire.Most importantly, you guys have showed me what people really want. - We all want a good story, well told. We want it in the books we read and the movies we watch. We want it in the products we buy and services we receive, the affiliations we maintain and interests we pursue. We want it in the life we live. But more than want, we need stories. Stories are how we learn and understand, how we analyze and formulate decision making strategies (now experimentally proven). Stories are how we make ourselves understood, how we discuss and advance thought. How we win others to our viewpoint, to favorable assessment at least.Thanks again"},{"Title":"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story","review":"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story is a useful prep for using the software.

I felt, on more than one occasion, that the author was willfully complicating the message in order to ensure more sales of the software.Again, worth reading... valid and useful ideas... enough extra words that it undermines its own usefulness."},{"Title":"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story","review":"Although this book was written apparently for aspiring writers and is now given away for free on the internet as a way of promoting the authors' software, I looked at the book as a reader of literature, as a contribution to literary theory and narratology. In such a light the book is quite relevant. The authors take what can only be described as a highly aristotlean approach to literature. In particular, this book almost reads like the work of someone who has been immersed in the works of Richard McKeon for far too long, with its strange fetishism of the number 4 and all of its multiples. In McKeon's work, everything in philosophy can be reduced to four methods, but each method can be associated with 4 possible principles, 4 possible interpretations, and can be applied to 4 possible subject matters, forming a complicated 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 matrix of philosophical possibilities. Here, there is an almost identical structural matrix built around the fetishism of multiples of 4, with 4 possible thematics, each of which can be divided into 4 possible types. 4 kinds of Throughlines. 16 types. 64 variations. 64 elements. For anyone familiar with Richard McKeon's project of \\"philosophical semantics\\", the ideas presented in this book will seem obvious to the point that I suspect one of the authors may have actually been one of Richard McKeon's students at University of Chicago.It wouldn't be the first time a student of Richard McKeon's becomes a literary theorist. Wayne Booth is famously a student of McKeon's (although this book bears little resemblance to Wayne Booth's works).This also isn't the first time someone has attempted to construct a theory of literature around the McKeonian/Aristotlean fetishisation of the number 4. McKeon's wife, Zahala McKeon, wrote a book in which she attempted to classify all novels into one four categories based on the kinds of \\"arguments\\" such novels stood for (a reader of \\"Dramatica\\" will of course recognize the word \\"argument\\", which reappears here in the form of \\"Grand Argument Stories\\").Where Zahala McKeon's book was in my opinion largely a failure, however, Dramatica actually accomplishes something. The structural matrix developed around the number 4 is a bit weird at first, but in the end I think it has a great value for readers of literature. For that I think Dramatica is a much better adaptation of McKeon's work than Zahala McKeon's book was.I would have been much more interested to read this book as a serious contribution to professional literary theory discourse, however. By packaging the book as a sort of \\"self help\\" book for struggling writers or as a promotional piece for selling software licenses to struggling writers, I think the ideas in this book are not being developed optimally. This book makes a contribution to the discussion of how/why we construct and interpret narratives. Too bad you have to get through all the \\"How to be a writer\\" nonsense to get there."},{"Title":"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story","review":"I've been a hobbyist writer since 2000; but, having recently retired I decided to become serious about writing. A friend suggested I read this book, because as an engineer by training and vocation I am a person who needs to understand a subject before really \\"doing\\" it. To that end Dramatica is excellent. But, the theory section, some 163 pages, is quite tough slogging. I had to make many notes and turn what I read into my own words to gain full understanding. Was it worth the effort? Yes, absolutely, but if you are not a persistent type person you will never complete the task. The authors themselves on page 78 say, \\"This discussion can get theoretical at times, and we present it more for those interested in details, rather than as essential reading.\\" They are absolutley right.Now, the second half of the book is on the subject of \\"The Art of Storytelling.\\" However, from what I garnered, the art they present is a proprietary one aimed primarily as an adjunct to their writing software \\"Dramatica.\\" I consider the writing process as put forth by the authors as too structured, too complex and too demanding of details. Since a writer's subconscious really does most of his writing and if he lets it loose (he really should) then all his carefully laid plans run the risk of being abandoned. To write an \\"honest\\" story, one that will grab readers, the writer must be truthful to himself otherwise his readers just stop reading. Will all this structured work as promulgated by the authors hinder or help truthful storytelling? That's for you to decide. Remember Shakespeare, Dickens and Hemmingway didn't take courses on writing, didn't read texts on writing and certainly didn't use writing related computer programs. What they did do was read a lot and write a lot. My conclusion on the Dramatica book is that it's worth the read, but it's not really necessary."},{"Title":"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story","review":"This is a good resourse, but if you are thinking about buying this book, do realize that you can download the lecture free as a podcast on iTunes."},{"Title":"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story","review":"This book, along with the software if you so choose (i have both just so you know), has a LOT of information. My personal feelings are that you should buy it only if you are interested in reading about the craft of writing in your down time. There is so much information, a lot of which is unnecessary in my opinion, that this 'theory' would have you do that it would take you years before you'd actually have the outline of your novel finished, let alone a first draft.Look, every so often someone comes along trying to anaylize and explain the process of something, in this case writing. It sucks inexperienced writers into buying their product simply because they have a way of explaining it in such a tantalizing way but there is NOTHING NEW in what they have to say, only the way that they say it.Yes this book can be helpful but buy it for reading enjoyment only, and then if you're bored and have taken a break from your daily scheduled writing session (something far more valuable that you should be doing which is NOT in this book yet is essential if you wish to be a writer) then maybe on your down time you can figure on trying to integrate some of the info in this book into your writing.Let me put it to you this way: this book teaches you how to assemble a car piece by tiny piece when all you really might be looking for is an instruction book on how to drive. There is NO magical formula for writing and what erks me the most about this book is that is how it is presented. The thing is, one only learns that AFTER they read the book.Borrow it, rent it at the library, buy unless you really want to take years (yes, years. that's how detailed this book is) to actually write your novel then do yourself a favor and do what the great writers have done for centuries; read as much as you can and then take those books that really triggered your imagination and heart and after you finish them just take out a notebook and write down exactly what it is that moved you about the characters, the story and so on. Compare the lists you make from other books and you will eventually see things that stick out. Then use them.Yes, it really is that simple."},{"Title":"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story","review":"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story is not a book you can skim through, it is a tough, no-nonsense, disciplined approach to creative writing; one that not only requires intense study, but also demands that you lay aside everything else you have ever read about story technique. The payoff is, Dramatica will force you to be the best you can be. Talent isn't enough in today's marketplace. No matter how great the writing, publishers want stories with no plot holes (if they find 'em, you gotta fix 'em and they don't tell you where to look). They want brief yet succint answers to questions like \\"who's the audience, what's the premise, the theme, the genre, the plot, etc.\\" Dramatica will give you that information. Sometimes you'll hear, \\"it doesn't quite come together\\" which means the structure of your story is weak. That's where Dramatica shines like a lighthouse beacon in a storm. If you use Dramatica properly, underdeveloped structure will never be a problem. Once you have a firm grasp of all the story points you must cover in order to produce a complete and satisfying story, unchain the talent and watch it produce. Does Dramatica stifle creative imagination? Absolutely not! If anything, it throws you into overdrive as you work through the story encoding and story weaving sections. Try it. You'll love it! If you are serious about, and committed to, the stories you want to tell, Dramatica needs to be at your elbow. A word of advice though-once you get the book and/or software, study the Dramatica dictionary of word meanings before you get into the theory; make them automatic thought processes and you'll do just fine. Happy reading. Happy writing."},{"Title":"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story","review":"Sorry for any mistake I could do here, English is not my first language. Dramatica Theory is the most challenging writing book I never read. It is very interesting but difficult. The authors create new definitions for words, and I often had to pause and go back in the book, to be sure to understand.But I am happy I did this effort. Dramatica Theory offers deep insights about what should be in a story. I think it is useful when you have a story, and you want to explore how to take it at a deeper, more complete level. I think most of writers and screenwriters can really get benefit of this book."},{"Title":"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story","review":"I've read this book before.It's the same old theory you can find in hundreds of other books on the topic of writing craft, except it's been bedazzled with Words That Appear All In Capitals For No Reason, words with alternate (and incorrect) meanings like how it combines \\"Archetype\\" and \\"Stereotype\\" into the same word even though those are two very different things, and this book also makes up its own words for things which already have meanings in the English language (too many of THOSE to count!).If you strip away all of the nonsense, all the trying to market itself as something new and fresh, it's the same book you've read before over and over on writing, and therefore it's not TECHNICALLY a bad read in that respect. But those additions, the terrible misuse of the English language, the teaching of words which will only make you confused should you ever read another text on writing and wonder why all the words are different, make this a terrible primer for new writers and confusing as Hell for experienced writers.Don't buy it. Spend those dollars on something more useful, like, any other writing book which uses standard language (but still the same theory!)"},{"Title":"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story","review":"I have used Dramatica for years, with my beta-version of this book - copied from the generous website - and I couldn't imagine writing without it. My first published short story has the elegant bare-bones version of the theory tucked into it, and everyone has mentioned how 'complete' it was.The first novel (unpublished) I wrote was BD (before Dramatica) - and readers noted that it took a good third of the book before they really got into it - and then they couldn't put it down. I'm aiming for far better than that with the current novel - grabbing the reader's attention by the first line, and then making sure that new stuff is developed at an attention-holding pace. Dramatica has made me think of so much to write that the story never flags. I can't wait to get it all in a nice clean book form."},{"Title":"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story","review":"I have both the book and the software. The terminology in this theory is sometimes difficult, because it redefines certain words we use commonly to serve its own purposes. For example, Dramatica refers to \\"dynamic pairs\\" of story elements. Some of them are easy enough to grasp: Order/Chaos, Help/Hinder, etc. But many of the dymanic pairs are more difficult to get, e.g. Possibility/Certainty (one might have expected Possibility/Impossibility) or Obligation/Rationalization (when you understand how the theory defines these terms it makes perfect sense, but at first blush it looks a little odd). But if you put the time into this, the payoff is enormous.(Please also see my review here of Dramatica Pro 4, where I go into considerable detail about the \\"contextual\\" nature of this theory.)I think the most useful part of the software is the HUGE number of questions it poses to you about your characters, situations, relationships. As I went through the questions regarding my main characters, I realized many times \\"Hm, I never thought about that...\\" So neither the theory nor the software are providing answers, just lots and lots of questions that you, as the author, are responsible for being able to answer. Even if those answers don't make it directly into your final draft, having those answers will definitely color your take on the way your characters interact with each other and their environment.The software itself is an obsessive-compulsive's dream, I have to say, and especially your first time using it you may find yourself playing with it endlessly (like me). But the characters in my story have nonetheless blossomed into \\"real people\\" for me in a way I have never experienced before.There is a free PDF version of the book available at the dramatica.com website, but it is an older edition. But if you want to get a sense of how the theory works before buying the book, that might be a good place to start.The Dramatica website itself is a treasure chest of additional information and in depth discussions of certain parts of the theory. There is also an excellent users' forum for both the theory and the software, where you can post your questions. Chris Huntley (one of the authors) is usually very quick to respond and offers excellent input.I strongly recommend that you don't try to use the software without reading the book first. It will make no sense to you otherwise."},{"Title":"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story","review":"First, Dramatica lives up to it's claims: it truly is a unique, new theory of story. That says volumes. I have most of the major Story Structure books out there, representative of all the major schools, and really, there's damn little that's genuinely new or unique in the field. So if you're interested in a new way of looking at story and story structure, this is probably a book worth considering.Second, the people claiming this to be something of a slog to get through are correct. The question isn't, \\"does this require effort,\\" but \\"is the effort worth it; does this new theory of story provide real insight that you can't get from other theories?\\" And to that, the answer is, \\"Yes.\\" If you're a student of story, you'll want to be familiar with Dramatica. It's worth it."},{"Title":"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story","review":"THE UP: It's comprehensive. It actually encouraged me to look at a story as a framework, a skeleton, and see how the different parts hinge on one another. For storycrafting, the Dramatica theory can literally help one see holes in plot or characterization, allowing a writer to make more sound creative decisions, if not induce more headaches, towards the creation of a full, robust story. The book even touches on how the theory applies to different genre.THE DOWN. It's comprehensive. The theory puts a label on practically everything--and there are a lot of labels. Though the theory is cleanly presented as a chart, it is still a deep chart. If you don't have the software, appreciating the Dramatica theory can be tedious, if not frustrating. I wonder when the Idiot's Guide will come out?THE GOOD IN-BETWEEN. If you want to look at storycrafting from a different perspective and don't mind a little rattling in your brain, this is a good book. It can enrich what you already know about constructing a full story. However, trying to go through the entire book AND putting it into practice can potentially threaten your writing time. It's not really a practical guide. The Dramatica website has a downloadable PDF version, so you might want to give this a go then decide if you want the hard copy.I would like to see this book have a \\"What This Means In The Real World\\" section after every chapter, wherein a summary of the key points are presented along with practical tips. Again, the Dramatica theory is eye-opening, but I guess it's meant to be absorbed by a chosen few."},{"Title":"North American immigration to Brazil: Tombstone records of the \\"Campo\\" Cemetery, Santa Barbara, Sao Paulo State, Brazil","review":"This book is very important for american descendants living in Brazil.

Don't support this kind of thing."},{"Title":"The Maxwell Leadership Bible Developing Leaders From The Word Of God","review":"Maxwell's stated purpose for a leadership Bible is that everyone is a leader, and that effective leaders must first be able to lead themselves.The first interesting note on the book is his choice of the New King James Version, rather than the more common New International Version, but the translation flows quite nicely, so it does not present a problem.In the book, Maxwell takes insights from the 21 Irrefutable Laws and the 21 Indispensable Qualities to highlight the Biblical passages. For example, he takes Biblical figures and discusses how they embodied a particular law or quality, sometimes more than one. Also worthy of note is that he uses both positive and negative examples of leadership: in Matthew chapter 2, he uses Herod to illustrate the \\"indispensable quality\\" of security, and the \\"irrefutable law\\" of empowerment. Maxwell asserts that Herod was not secure in his leadership, because he viewed Jesus as a threat, and tried to have him killed. In terms of empowerment, Maxwell offers Herod's abuse of power, as opposed to attempting to share it. A nice feature of this is that Maxwell provides chapter and verse references for each of his insights, and the profiles and notes are placed logically with the accounts to which they correlate. In short, the book amounts to a study Bible on leadership.Some other features of note:-A two page spread at the end of the Gospels explaining how Jesus embodied each of the 21 irrefutable laws-Half page \\"profiles in leadership\\" on everyone from the seventy elders in Numbers to well known names like Abraham, Peter, and John-Full and two-page elaborations on a particular law of leadership or a particular quality as embodied by a Biblical leader-Summaries at the beginning of each book which not only give the plot line of the account in the book, but also speak to the leadership components therein by listing leaders in the book, other people of influence, lessons in leadership, and leadership highlights with chapter, verse, and page references-Other insights such as \\"women who made a difference\\" in which he lists 25+ women who exhibited difference-making leadership, referenced by book, chapter, and verse, or \\"Zechariah learns motivation comes before mobilization\\"-An index of each leadership law, followed by several examples and where to find them in the Bible (main example of each in boldface type)-An index of each leadership quality, followed by several examples and where to find them in the Bible (positive and negative examples labeled and in boldface type)-An index of leadership issues, including calling, adaptability, delegation, etc.-An index of profiles in leadershipOverall, this is a well-indexed and thorough study Bible on the topic of leadership, and I recommend it highly to anyone who is interested in the integration of faith and leadership, or wants to learn more about the origins of leadership."},{"Title":"The Maxwell Leadership Bible Developing Leaders From The Word Of God","review":"Maxwell does a very good job bringing out the leadership lessons from the Bible. The Bible is full of leadership notes on almost every page. Maxwell's 21 laws and qualities are listed in the back in a concordance type format. I like the color scheme inside also. The layout makes reading easy. This is the Bible I use daily. However, I also offer a few notes of caution.This is not a &quot;Study Bible&quot;. If you are looking for a Bible with commentary notes then this one is NOT for you. It is designed for leaders. If you are not a leader personality then you will probably not like this work.There is no concordance and cross references are limited to the Old Testament quotes in the New Testament. However, it does contain alternate readings and notes from differing Greek texts. (Syriac, and Vulgate too)The verse numberings are hard to find in the text and probably should have been bolded for clarity.

Healthy leaders have nothing to prove, nothing to lose, and nothing to hide.2. Wise leaders speak the truth, whatever the cost.3. Effective leaders provide incentives to their followers.4. Successful leaders discern, then develop, then delegate.5. Great leaders feel secure enought to express emotions and be vulnerable.6. The best leaders love the world, serve the many, but train the few.7. Good leaders practice repetition until others embrace the vision.8.

His secular works are required reading, and nothing comes close in excellence. How does he introduce such qualities into a Bible, though? Wonderfully!Maxwell takes every possible aspect of leaderhip (dozens and dozens) and ties them into Biblical characters and situations. There is enough teaching and study material here to occupy one's time for years, and none is fluff.This is more of a textbook than a Bible, but I guarantee--there is nothing else like it! Unlike so many other attempts which end up balancing a secular principle on a thread of Scripture, Maxwell really searches the Scripture, and the applications he gleans are relevant!If you ever hope to teach or learn virtually every leadership quality, tenet, or principle found in the Bible--your search is over. Maxwell has found them all!Also recommended: 'With Joseph in the University of Adversity' ('The Qualities of an Effective Leader' chapter), and 'The Mizraim Prinicples', authored by Dr. Jerry L. Parks"},{"Title":"The Maxwell Leadership Bible Developing Leaders From The Word Of God","review":"In my humble opinion, The Maxwell Leadership Bible is better than any of the books, simply because Maxwell takes the core concepts from his various books and shows how they are applied in the Bible.For example, Maxwell includes:1. Excerpts from the 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership and 21 Indispensible Qualities of a Leader books.2. Over 100 biographical profiles from people in the Bible.3. A brief introduction to each book of the Bible and how leadership principles were applied.4. Short articles and &quot;Read As You Go&quot; notes as you progress through the Bible.5. Topical index of various leadership materials.The reader has to bear in mind that this not necessarily a study Bible but a Bible whose focus is leadership. With the failures the world has recently seen in the ministry, politics, and business, Maxwell's Leadership Bible is welcomed read for those who are looking for a biblical basis for how to/how not to lead.Maxwell's premise is that leaders are to serve others (just like Jesus) and not lord it over them (like worldly &quot;leadership&quot; so often does.). Quite frankly, I find much inspiration from the Scriptures to lead properly and not cut corners when the pressure is turned up.All in all, a highly recommended read for the Christian who wants to learn (and get encouragement) on how to lead from a biblical basis. The non-Christian can also benefit from the book by considering how the biblical type of leadership so often contrasts with worldly leadership. Everyone will benefit by considering how his/her leadership qualities compare with the Bible.Read and be encouraged!"},{"Title":"The Maxwell Leadership Bible Developing Leaders From The Word Of God","review":"I've heard John Maxwell speak at Promise Keepers. This was back when he was still a church pastor. Even then, he was quite a comminucator. He good deliver an excellent message and get his ideas across to anyone listening. He was and still a powerful teacher and speaker.I haven't read any of his books on leadership. So I don't know how much of his leadership Bible compares to any of them. But I read this Bible cover-tocover during my daily devotional time in 2002. Prior to reading this Bible, I never viewed the Bible as a leadership book overall.What John Maxwell does is take the Bible and views it from the vantage point of leaders and leadership. He explains the Bible books, characters, and stories and shows how leaders can use it to learn what to do and what not to do. If you're a pastor (as I am) or involved in any other type of leadership, you won't see leadership the same way again after reading and using this Bible. To every thing that's in the Bible, you'll see it in whole new light. And if you're like me, you'll see yourself differently in terms of being a Christian leader. You'll also see those that you're leading differently, too.As another reader stated, this is not a good Bible for the average layman that isn't called to leadership.

Townsend's WWII AND THE AMERICAN INDIAN is primarily aimed at academics-- Native American studies professors in particular-- but this book is a revelation to those not already familiar with the many bizarre goings-on of the American government and its Right-wing critics in the tense years before, during, and after the war. Native American draft resistance, for example, was widespread-- contrary to the image of patriotic Indian, eager to defend \\"his\\" country.But most interestingly, the hidden question being explored in this work is: \\"Is the enemy of my enemy my friend?\\" History has forgotten Joseph Bruner, Alice Lee Jemison, and \\"Chief Red Cloud,\\" Native Americans who were quite willing to ally themselves with outright Nazis (both in America and in Germany) in order to advance their own political agendas. They had an understandable grudge against the BIA, and decided to make a deal with the devil.Fascist crazies like William Dudley Pelley reciprocated, all too happy to advocate Native American Liberation. Pelley even argued that Native Americans should be \\"set free\\" from their reservations-- to be replaced by American Jews.Roosevelt appointees in the federal government such as John Collier, BIA head, were briefly terrified by such plans, and actively combatted them with propaganda and prosecutorial muscle. They were troubled, in the 30s, by the prospect of a multicultural fascist front-- Gold Shirts from Mexico, Native Americans, German-American Bund members. and pro-Japanese Afro Americans, etcetera-- seizing power. Reading Townsend's book, it becomes clear that their fears were largely justified. What would have happened if the American fascists had succeeded? How would history have changed? Such tantalizing questions fill this book.Townsend tells us that the Germans knew all about Navajo code talkers before the war, and had sent an agent to the Southwest under the guise of an anthropological researcher, to help crack the code. Such German outreach to oppressed peoples in America was a lead-up to WWII.Also, John Collier, controversial BIA head, was one of the main architects behind Japanese American internment during WWII. His policies towards Native Americans were the template for the \\"friendly\\" Japanese concentration camps, many of which were erected on reservations. Collier, as a liberal, was the sworn enemy of the aforementioned Pelley-- and yet, ironically, both of them advocated concentration camps, albeit with different occupants. Such fascinating, dark ironies abound in Townsend's study. All along the American Indians are treated as pawns or noble primitives or mere symbols by the powers that be, the whites, even though the reader begins to suspect that those powers needed the Indians more than the Indians needed them...One helluva great read."},{"Title":"World War II and the American Indian","review":"&quot;Utilizing a vast array of the government's own sources, this book captures the irony of a patriotic minority again being neglected by a myopic nation.&quot;--M.

Young boy, 10, is given a toy castle by his nanny who is leaving to go back to England. The boy, William, is very upset that Mrs. Phillips is leaving. When he discovers that the castle, or more accurately, the Silver Knight that comes with it, is enchanted, he devises a plan to keep her with him. And thus begins a very satisfying tale of fantasy and heroism.I listened to the audio version of this book - read by the author along with an entire cast. I can't say it was the best audio book I've ever listened to. As often is the case, the reading by the author, while interesting, wasn't great. And it wasn't just the author. I often kept thinking to myself that I wish I had opted to read this one instead of listening to it."},{"Title":"The Castle in the Attic","review":"REVIEWED BY: Wayne WalkerThis book was recommended to us by a friend. Ten-year-old William, whose parents both work, is losing his beloved governess, Mrs. Phillips, who is moving back to England. As a going-away present, she gives him an old, real-looking model of a castle made out of stone and wood and a finger-high lead knight to guard it. William is certain that there must be something magical about it, and sure enough, when he holds the tiny knight, it comes alive in his hand. Sir Simon tells William that a sorcerer had used magic to steal his kingdom and turn him into lead. In fact, just before he became completely leaden, he grabbed part of the sorcerer's necklace which can make things small. William uses it to make Mrs. Phillips small so he can keep her, but after he sees how sad she is, he agrees to be made small so that he can help Sir Simon defeat the sorcerer and get the other part of the necklace that can make Mrs. Phillips normal sized again. Those who do not like books with any \\"magic\\" in them will want to avoid this one, but otherwise, besides a reference or two to drinking ale, there is nothing objectionable in this book, and there are several good character traits represented, including loyalty to friends, overcoming fears, and being sorry enough for one's mistakes to do whatever is needed to correct them. Both twelve-year-old Jeremy, to whom I read it aloud before bedtime, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There is a sequel, The Battle for the Castle."},{"Title":"The Castle in the Attic","review":"I do remember that this book Castle in the Attic along with The Hatchet were my two favorite books in my 10th year probably a little later. Now I know that for all of its childish elements its actually one of your more basic fantasy stories lonely child meets exiled knight who just so happens to need his help in fighting an evil wizard. The fact that I remember it all of these years later is a testament to its staying power.Overall-I don't see any reason why it shouldn't still work today I doubt it has lost any of its punch."},{"Title":"The Castle in the Attic","review":"Man, this book was neat.

Before she leaves, she gives William a toy castle and a silver knight that one day is supposed to come alive. When Mrs. Phillips goes to her bus stop to leave, the strangest thing happened. She never set foot past William's front walkway. Where does she end up? What adventure lies in William's hands?

As part of her goodbye gift to him and a birthday gift, she gives him a castle that is very realistic but miniature. She hands him a small Silver Knight to use in the castle. William feels the knight move in his hand and thinks it is his imagination. However, it turns out that William broke the spell of an evil wizard, Alastor. The Silver Knight turns out to be a man named Sir Simon. His father was a King and Sir Simon was supposed to inherit the title after his father's death. However, Alastor got hold of the father and Sir Simon lost his inheritance. Alastor used a token to make Sir Simon turn to lead and shrinks him.William thinks of a plan to keep Mrs. Phillips with him. He uses the token to shrink Mrs. Phillips. Now, she is miserable being small in the castle. Sir Simon wants to return to his own land. William decides to go on the adventure with the Knight. In order to do this William has to have the courage to battle evil. He also has to show all the skill that he already possesses.It is truly a magical story and my kids cannot wait to read the sequel.

Imagine my excitement when I learned that the book is on audio. Please understand, the book is worth ten stars, and I really love the story. It is very well written, the characters are fleshed out and believable. BUT... the audiobook is a great disappointment. It is read by the author with a full cast. Somebody forgot to tell Mrs. Phillips that she is from England, and, therefore, has a british accent. The woman reading her part sounded like she is from Iowa. Almost from the beginning I'm listening to audio and I'm going HUH!? This is what happens when you don't pay attention to your own production.

Before she parts for England, Mrs. Phillips gives William a very special gift. She takes him up to the attic and shows him a very large, fully functional castle. He has to be brave, in order to have the castle, which has been in Mrs. Phillips family for many many years. There is only one knight that comes with the castle, the silver knight. Mrs. Phillips tells William that there is a story passed down through her family, that the silver knight is under a spell, and that one day he will come back to life.There is magic, spells and trickery within the walls of the castle. Not only will William need to be brave and stand on his own, but he will need to help end an evil curse.You will enjoy reading about the life and times of the silver knight, as you join William on an adventure, back to the times of knights and ladies.Jill Ammon Vanderwoodauthor: Through the RugThrough The Rug: Follow That Dog (Through the Rug)Stowaway: The San Francisco Adventures of Sara, the Pineapple Cat"},{"Title":"The Castle in the Attic","review":"This is a wonderful, feel-good, learn-good-morals novel for a young adult.

Ms. Winthrop has woven a tale not confined to the limits of a child's imagination, but one that tests the mature intellect. Christian parents will be pleased to discover that while magic is a recurring theme in this book, it proves to be mearly a side story to the more important and intreguing prospect of William's character development. I recomend to any parent this book for their young son. It speaks of Honor and Chivalry in the face of evil, of strength and tender souls. What this book speaks of in regard to emotional strength is something that every child, and even adult, needs to discover; That to Cry is not Cowardice, to be tender hearted is not Weakness, and that Honor and courage is the Heart of a Knight."},{"Title":"The Castle in the Attic","review":"I liked The Castle In the Attic.I liked it especially when William got separated from Sir Simon in the forest.I think that everybody should read The Castle In the Attic.

Soon he discovers that there is a token that turns things small like the Silver Knight. The other half of the token that in unison with the second half turns thing big again is in the evil Wizard's possession. The day before Mrs. Phillips is about to leave he tries the token out by using it on her. Turns out William made a big mistake. He then has to find the other half of the token that will change her back. Before he knows it, William is traveling through a dirty land filled with poverty. He has to battle a fierce dragon and a powerful wizard in order to finish his mission. When you read this book you will embark on a dangerous quest filled with magical spells, fire breathing dragons, and adventure. As you read through the pages you will help the Silver Knight and William conquer all their evil villainous foes. The story mainly takes place in the castle, attic, and poor land.

In an attempt to appease him and to show how much she cares for the boy, Mrs. Phillips gives William a beautiful stone and wood castle that has been in her family for generations, complete with silver knight! William is enchanted, but still quite upset over losing his best friend. When the knight comes to life in William's hand, complete with magic spell and curse that needs breaking, William sees a way to keep Mrs. Phillips a bit longer and save a kingdom in need.Outstanding: This is a cute children's book. I remember reading The Castle In The Attic when I was around the same age as William and desperately wishing the same thing would happen to me. William is kind of unique for the time. He's a bit needy and nerdy, but he's also a confident gymnast. The plot is a fun one, with curses, people turning to lead and dragons.Unacceptable: Sir Simon, the silver knight is kind of a weak character. He gets himself lost abruptly and never really accomplishes much. The villain suffers a bit too.Summary: An enjoyable and quick read that has held up well over the years by using the universal themes of loss, adventure and how totally awesome castles and knights are."},{"Title":"The Castle in the Attic","review":"The Castle in the Attic was a great book. It was about a boy called William. His family friend babysitter was leaving. She gave him a castle. William and his toy knight go on an adventure for his babysitter. It was an awesome book. I would recommend The Castle in the Attic to everybody."},{"Title":"The Castle in the Attic","review":"We are in the third grade at an all boys school and we just finished reading The Castle in the Attic. We highly recommend this book because it has magic, wizardry, knights, castles, dragons and time travel. We also enjoyed this book because some of the story is fantasy and some is reality. Each character does one special thing in the story. For example, William's special ability to defeat the dragon. The adventure was very exciting! We think the author's use of adjectives is great. Boys and girls would love this book! If you want to read this book by yourself, we recommend it to any student in the third grade and above. However, anyone over 6 years old might enjoy listening to this tale. This book is magical!"},{"Title":"The Castle in the Attic","review":"What I would describe as early-fantasy, a book for kids who are getting into the genre. Snappy and well-paced, the book is also dotted with sweet moments that may bring a tear to the eye.William lives in a nice suburb with his ever-busy parents (I found it sweet how he still loves and treasures his parents, despite their frequent absence) and the nanny/maid, Mrs. Phillips. William receives shattering news: Mrs. Phillips intends to return to England. As a consolation gift, she gives him a toy castle with accompanying knight, and a tiny metal charm.Then the knight comes to life. The tiny silver man, Sir Simon, soon befriends William as the young man goes to desperate lengths to keep Mrs. Phillips. But a knight can't forget his duty, and soon William becomes entangled in the clutches of Alastor, the evil wizard. But how can a physically unimpressive ten-year-old defeat a powerful magician?William is an enjoyable character, made more so by his anxiety over Mrs. Phillips and general decency toward his fellow man. I also enjoyed the comparisons using his gymnastics lessons as examples of self-control and discipline.Mrs. Phillips was a lovely character, very compassionate and caring, but firm in her intentions. Alastor was pure evil, while Sir Simon was a thoroughly likeable and decent guy, without being too perfect or anything like that. I found Calender to be a rather sorry character, and was glad of the resolution written for her.The plot is pleasantly original, though I wish less time had been spent in &quot;our&quot; world. The writing style is rather ordinary, the first half a bit slow, and the descriptions somewhat underfleshed. However, the simple yet effective plot and good characterization overcome those problems. Without a doubt, kids should check out this book, and also the even-better sequel &quot;The Battle for the Castle.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Castle in the Attic","review":"I think this is great book, and if you get the time to read it, you just might find it's one of the best books you have ever read. In the beginning it is somewhat slow, but if you keep reading, the book will get a lot better and the plot will unravel. There is a little boy who gets a toy castle and a knight from his housekeeper who is moving away. After playing with the castle and the knight the kid starts to see that not everything is normal, and that his world is about to be turned upside down! I hope you read this book for I know you'll like it."},{"Title":"The Castle in the Attic","review":"It's not overly long, and it's written in simple enough language that my 8 and 9 year old children had no trouble reading it.It's a very engaging, sweet story, which introduces the concepts of chivalry and bravery. I actually think this book is very good for boys to read - it's about knights and fighting for one's honor, and demonstrating loyalty, but it's also about being able to cry when you need to, and being able to express love for others.In this story, the little boy's nanny is moving away, because he's growing up and doesn't need her, and he has some trouble accepting this. I think it's a wonderful, simple way to address some of the issues all children face when approaching their teenage years.I definitely recommend this one to parents and children."},{"Title":"The Castle in the Attic","review":"Genre: MINIATUREDesperate to prevent his beloved English nanny from returning home, 10-year-old William devises a plan to shrink her unwillingly and keep her prisoner in the miniature medieval castle which she has entrusted to him as a farewell gift.

Will he prove worthy of courtly fellowship with Sir Simon? &quot;There are rules in the world of magic, just as there are in our world.&quot; A fascinating and highly enjoyable read, no matter your age!"},{"Title":"The Castle in the Attic","review":"I read this book out loud to my family of boys over the span of one week. They liked it very well -- even the littlest brother could follow the story, even though there are no illustrations.It's a story of adventure and hidden strength, as a beloved nanny gives William a play castle with a surprise inside -- a miniature, living knight! The nanny and the 10-year-old child become miniaturized as well, and the adventure to rescue the kingdom from an evil wizard commences.There was a long, slow build-up to the action in this story -- lots of school days, and afternoons in the attic, and gymnastics practices, and long discussion. Only the final 7 chapters detail the real adventure -- the first 10 are just warm-ups.Parent notes:*A lot of lying. A *lot* of lying. William (the child protagonist) lies almost constantly through the beginning of the book.*Absent parents rely on a nanny so they can pursue their careers. In fact, the son makes pointed remarks about how the dad never keeps his promises.*Great knightly values: Be compassionate to the needy. Neither squander wealth nor hoard it. Never lose your sense of shame. If questions are asked of you, answer them frankly but do not ask too many yourself. Be manly and of good cheer. Never kill a foe who is begging for mercy. Be ever loyal in love.*William seems totally unfamiliar with the interiors of churches. He meets Sir Simon in a chapel and acts as though he has never seen a cross or smelled incense or noticed how altar candles flicker. Being in the chapel makes William feel small and quiet, and he recognizes it as a holy place, but that's it. All the praying he does consists of supplications to his nanny, spoken aloud in times of trouble, although she is far away.*One scary scene, when William encounters the dragon, describes an illusion he sees of his nanny burning to death. Another scary scene describes the horrifying process of a person being turned to lead from the feet up.As a parent, I give this book 3.5 stars. My kids liked the adventure and the setting of the castle and the kingdom... and truly, the final 7 chapters were very fun to read out loud. From a values standpoint, this book wouldn't be my favorite choice for modeling my children's behavior.I prefer Mary Stewart's \\"A Walk in Wolf Wood\\" as a fictional castle adventure to be read and re-read."},{"Title":"The Castle in the Attic","review":"What do a young gymnist,a nanny,a magic coin,and a evil wizard have in common?

HoP. 1The Castle in the Attic is about a boy named William who, one day, finds out that his nanny, Mrs. Phillips, is going back to England. Before she left, she gave William a castle that came with one mysterious lead knight. The week she was about to leave, William found out that the knight became alive and that the knight carried a magical shrinking artifact. William was in such despair about Mrs. Phillip that he used the artifact to shrink her so she could stay with William for as long as he liked. She didn't like being as small as a toy so William also shrank himself to help change back Mrs. Phillips. He learned the story of the knight, about the evil magician Alastor, and about the magical world after being shrunk. To save Mrs. Phillip and himself, he went on a journey to defeat Alastor and get the enlarging token. He became a hero after defeating Alastor, but went back to the castle. He changed Mrs. Phillips and himself back to normal. This story had some things that I liked and disliked.I disliked the part where William only thought of his own despair. \\"And what would Mrs. Phillips think of sharing the castle with Sir Simon? William wondered for a moment. He put the thought quickly out of his mind. He would worry bout that later.\\" William barely gave a thought to what Mrs. Phillips would feel. He only thought about how good it would feel if he could make Mrs. Phillips stay forever. There was also another part I didn't like.The part where William still made a joke of changing Mrs. Phillips was another part I detested. \\"\`Although I do have this special token that makes people green form the roots of their hair right down to their toenails. Don't you think your brother would like you to come home a whole new color?'\\" It wasn't very nice of him to make a joke of changing people, especially without their permission. Although there were several parts I disliked there was also a part in the book I liked.The best part of the book was where William fought Alastor. \\"William reached out and snatched the mirror, turning it on Alastor. The look of horror on the wizard's face was unbearable, and William was almost tempted to drop the mirror and break it. Alastor sank to his knees covering his eyes with his hands. \`It's the locust,' he moaned.\\" This part was really exciting. It was very dramatic and I could picture a villainous wizard covering his eyes and getting scared by his own cruelty."},{"Title":"The Castle in the Attic","review":"This book showed how sometimes imagination can make a really interesting reality. Being fiction and all we thought it was very interesting. It was very intriguing and we didn't want to put the book down. It was full of magic fantasy and challenges for the characters to face.

He's immensely sympathetic and compelling, and though the familiar fantasyland and evil-wizard-ruling-a-faux-medieval-kingdom plotline hold few surprises for adult readers familiar with the conventions of the genre, it surprised and excited me as a kid.Re-reading it recently, I found it didn't hold up as well as some of my favorite books from when I was younger (such as Madeleine L'Engle's A Ring of Endless Light), but it holds up better than many; this is a strong book for both children and for adults. I have a hard time imagining a more perfect book for bed-time reading."},{"Title":"The Castle in the Attic","review":"There are many reasons for my liking of \\"The Castle in The Attic\\" The first reason for my liking is the story plot. The antagonist fits in supelutivly! The clothing of the charaters is another reason for my liking. The knight's plate mail, dagger, helm, and shield. Then there is Alastor's robe, a perple hue radiates from the blue robe. One last reason is the main character! I can relate to him so much it is scary in a way.The best part I would have to say was when William begins his journey in Sir Simon's world. She wrote it so well you could really picture yourself standing there in the rolling fields with the castle in the background or the rolling roads toward towns filled with knights and patrolmen. the real reason why is when he duels the black dragon of Alastor's. You could picture William's duel at the castle gates.The most vivid part was the middle part of the book. You could see in her writing thats he spent a lot of time on that part of the story. The first reason is the way she worded it, also the way you could picture it inside your head. The resolution is a little dull though. I guess that she got bored of the story and wnated to end it quickley. The worst part was describing the main setting. She left you out in the middle of nowhere besides the fact that they weren't in the United Kingdom.

I thought it was so fun, that I ordered it the next day!Great new lyrics to an old song. The preschoolers at our school loved it."},{"Title":"She'll Be Comin' 'Round the Mountain","review":"This book resembles the old western train ride at Disneyland before they transformed it into \\"Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.\\" The opening pages have the same desert canyon terrain and hues of tan, umber, gold, yellow, orange, and purple. Illustrator Ashley Wolff places mountain goats in strategic locations (e.g., on top of boulders and natural terraces), an armadillo and a chipmunk read on top of a cactus, and pigs fish off a bridge. You almost expect one of the animals to jump off the page, slowly turned its head at you, and talk in an electronic voice. This is not a criticism, however; the relaxed tone and elements of fantasy tell you not to take it too seriously.A cowboy-hatted, banjo-playing frog starts singing \\"She'll be comin' \`round the mountain when she comes,\\" and we see a red and white camper truck slowly approaching over wooden bridges and through cement tunnels. As we view the frog in the foreground, and the almost mythic John Ford-like western landscape in the background, we can also look \\"down\\" at the old town nestled at the bottom of these mountains. Illustrator Wolff\`s pictures capture a perspective as wide and long as the canyon itself.The story slowly unfolds through the frog's modified song lyrics, the activities in the old town, and the tension built through the approaching truck. We learn gradually that the animals are preparing for a big reception in the town center and cleaning up the best room in town to get ready when the mysterious \\"she\\" comes. Food is very, very important too: The skunks, foxes, and other animals are getting the salsa, rice, candy and other food ready:\\"We'll cook her favorite taco while she's here.We'll mash an avocado while she's here.We'll make an enchilada and a lovely ensalada,Then we'll all drink fruitilada while she's here.\\"In a wild scene again reminiscent of Disneyland, the critters are shown singing, dancing, and generally whooping it up on an adobe house decorated with red chilies--just as the camper truck is on the home stretch to town. Finally, we're at the climax. Everybody is singing and eating, dancing and snuggling, roasting marshmallows and even reading when the big truck rolls into late night \\"Reederville.\\" Finally, we're about to find the answer to the big question: Just who have they been waiting and preparing and celebrating for, what is that truck, and who is driving it?In a truly great surprise ending, we find out the driver is a pig, and the truck in a bookmobile named the \\"Six White Horses.\\" The animals wait in line as the brightly dressed pig hands out books, and the bookmobile is decorated with bumper stickers such as, \\"If You Can Read This, Thank a Teacher!\\" Twenty-eight colorful and rollicking pages, with an afterward that tells the origin of the song. One of 2004's best books; you'll have lots of fun reading this enchanting story aloud or to yourself."},{"Title":"She'll Be Comin' 'Round the Mountain","review":"My two year old can almost recite this book.

Natural born storyteller Paul Lepp has the Monster Stick. The Monster Stick, a remarkable fishing pole of mythical proportions, is Paul's nine-foot, surf-casting rod full of six miles of brand new, 50-pound test Stren Carp cord with 20 pound, custom made, stainless steel, slip-sliding sinkers. The Monster Stick, born of magic, baptized in the rivers of West Virginia, and able snag DC-10's or lunker-sized catfish.Meet Paul and Bil Lepp, natural born storytellers and two repeat winners of the West Virginia State Liars' Contest. There's Bil's dog, Buck, a thirty-seven inch irony, whose mother was a German Sheppard, and whose father was a prolific and extremely determined Basset hound. Buck can pull you through a knothole, and hold his own against a monster truck, but is a gun-shy hunting dog who can't track a bunny rabbit in a shoebox. Between the Monster Stick, and Buck, you get an original bunch of hilarious short stories and tall tales that you'll want to share with everyone from your poker buddies to your preacher.The West Virginia State Liars' Contest is held every year on Memorial Day weekend. The contest is only open to West Virginia residents. The \\"lies\\" should be short stories (humorous, dramatic, supernatural, etc.) with a maximum length of 3 to 5 minutes. The winner receives a golden shovel. You can imagine why. Paul Lepp won six \\"Biggest Liar\\" titles before his death in 1998, and his brother Bil Lepp has taken first place five times since he first entered in 1990, proving that lightning - or at least lying - does sometimes strike twice.Bil Lep, a former Methodist preacher, has published a collection of stories with his brother called The Monster Stick & Other Appalachian Tall Tales. Generally, the fishing stories are Paul's and the dog tales Bil's. These twenty three tales have lots to offer on women and carp, more than a little on dogs, trains and cars, a considerable amount on hunting, and more politics than shows on the surface. There's plenty to keep a thinking man laughing and awake at night.In his follow-up, Inept: Impaired: Overwhelmed -- Tall Tales from West Virginia and Beyond, Bil Lepp spins more tales of his super-dog Buck, introduces us to his best friend, Skeeter Barth, and keeps a smile on your face with stories about catfish-grabblin', summer camp, moose-trappin', and that misunderstood mishap with the FBI.

Now mostly remembered for her children's books, she had great fame for her romances and plays as well. This English-born author moved to the US as a child and became a true-life American rags-to-riches story. It is extremely interesting to learn how she was carried away by the resulting fame and fortune and what choices she made.I have always loved Frances Hodgson Burnett's books and am delighted that such a detailed biography is now available. I have read the previous accounts of her life but this book is especially well-written and contains plenty of new material. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Francis Hodgson Burnett: The Unexpected Life of the Author of The Secret Garden","review":"While during her life time (1849-1924), Frances Hodgson Burnett was best known for her many adult novels and plays, today it is for her children's books that she is remembered, especially for her masterpiece which has become a true classic and has never been out of print -- The Secret Garden. Frances Hodgson Burnett: The Unexpected Life Of The Author of \\"The Secret Garden\\" is an impressive and seminal effort in which biographer Gretchen Holbrook Gerzina (Professor of English, Bernard College, Columbia University) had the full cooperation of Burnett's descendants and relatives to help her examine and present an inherently fascinating life story of lively intelligence, contemporary sensitivity, and a wealth of new and never-before-published materials. From her modest beginnings in mid-Victorian Manchester, to her arrival in post-Civil \\"War Tennessee at the age of 15 with her widowed mother and two sisters, this outstanding biography details her become the family breadwinner at the age of 17 and the eventual publishing of 52 books and 13 plays. This is also the story of her marriages, flirtations, and a scandalous affair, the troubled motherhood of two sons (one of whom become the model for Little Lord Fauntleroy). A welcome and much appreciated contribution to literary biographies, Frances Hodgson Burnett is enthusiastically recommended reading!"},{"Title":"Francis Hodgson Burnett: The Unexpected Life of the Author of The Secret Garden","review":"Frances Hodgson BurnettI love The Secret Garden, and that's the real reason for my getting and reading this book. But I have to agree (especially as a former editor) that the editing appears, at times, to be nonexistent. There were times when I simply shook my head because I was puzzled by such things as confusing pronoun referents. Still, I would recommend it to other lovers of Burnett's work, her life is that interesting."},{"Title":"Francis Hodgson Burnett: The Unexpected Life of the Author of The Secret Garden","review":"What's good: The book is fully documented and the sources are mostly Frances herself and her trustworthy friends.What's not so good: The book is written in competent, though arid, prose. Not much enthusiasm for Frances comes through. The book gives the impression of being an academic project, undertaken because academics are required to do such projects and almost every other woman has already been done.Academic presses frequently have the authors do their own proof-reading, and this book is not well proofed. There are no glaring errors such as a spell-checker would find, but errors that would elude a spell-checker are not infrequent.Worse, there are at least two glaring factual errors:On page 286, the biographer states that \\"President Roosevelt\\" declared war in 1917, bringing America into World War I.On page 215, the biographer declares that in 1900, \\"she was now forty-five.\\" On page 13, the biographer declares that \\"Frances Eliza, the third child and first daughter, was born there too, on 24 November 1849.\\" A little arithmetic will demonstrate that in 1900, Frances cannot have been \\"forty-five.\\" She was in fact 50 or 51.Still, for a Black British academic at Columbia University, the biographer is rather free of zeal, but she does insist on mentioning every Black maid which Frances, like other Southern women of the time, employed. However, she is forced to admit Frances' unswerving devotion to social equality, which she pushed in her novels.As to the question of \\"flirtations,\\" which are used to promote this biography, there is no evidence of them. Frances was extremely careful of her reputation (she had to be, since she was famous most of her life), and always traveled with a maid and usually a female companion as well. Whether Frances slept with Stephen Townsend during the ten years when he was around so much, one can only guess. But since he blackmailed her into marrying him in 1900 by threatening to tell the world they'd had an affair, it seems likely that there must have been some truth in it. On all occasions when she felt wronged, she threw herself publicly into the fray and defended herself indignantly. She was such a person that she could not have done that without truth on her side.Frances Hodgson Burnett was a remarkable human being, and a biography of her should be read, since for the last fifty years or so, we have been assured by academics, psychologists and self-appointed pseudo-intellectuals that humans cannot possibly be what she in fact was."},{"Title":"Family Tightrope","review":"Sender made the transaction very smooth and pleasant.

Smith\\"She knew the drill. Another year of living with them, of walking quietly through the halls knowing that she was different from everybody around her, even while she was carefully, expertly pretending to be the same (p. 4).\\"Thea and Blaise are cousins, raised as closely as if they were sisters. They're also both witches, members of the secret Night World. And they are high school students, starting at their fifth high school, having been expelled from four others - mostly because of Blaise. But this time, it's Thea who will jeopardize their future when she breaks the cardinal rules of the Night World; which are 1) Never let humans know about the Night World, and 2) Never fall in love with a human.On their first day of school, Thea meets Eric, and the two are like swans - they know they are destined for each other immediately. There's only one little problem - Eric's human. Thea tries to push Eric away for his safety, but the two are soulmates and nothing she tries will keep him from her. But will she give up everything for him?I read \\"Spellbinder\\" pretty quickly, in about 90 minutes, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Normally I don't care at all for romances, but mix in some supernatural elements, good writing, and interesting characters, and I'm hooked. I really liked Smith's portrayal of Thea - you start out thinking she's the quiet type, overshadowed by her vivacious cousin, but she develops believably into someone with backbone, someone caught between a rock and a hard place who doesn't know what way to turn, but tries to do the right thing, but sometimes doing it the wrong way. I also rather relished Smith's detail to the spells and especially the components. I had the feeling \\"Wow this is cool\\" when reading. The spells also allow for a nice twist at the end.\\"Spellbinder\\" is a great installment in the Night World series, and gives an in-depth look at the witches and their origin in Smith's created world. I for one definitely want to know more about the history of the Night World, and am looking forward to reading more.4/5."},{"Title":"SPELLBINDER: NIGHTWORLD","review":"This is one of my favorites in the Night World series by LJ Smith. I have a thing for witches, and all the information about actual spells, spell ingredients, circle casting, and witch history was simply fascinating. Thea is a great character, and her relationship with her soulmate Eric is endearing, but the real standout star in this book is Blaise.Blaise seems like your typical wicked witch, but despite her disdain for humans (that's how she was raised so you can't really blame her), she's supremely loyal to her family. What she does in the end for Thea almost made me cry.What I love about LJ Smith's books is that the main themes go much deeper than just supernatural characters; her books explore and highlight the importance of relationships, love and loyalty. Spellbinder is one book I know I'll be reading over and over again for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"SPELLBINDER: NIGHTWORLD","review":"I always have a bit of trepidation approaching paranormal novels not vampire or were- based. They're often a bit inaccessible to me, especially those based on witches, loaded down with spells and difficult-to-follow lore.But as with the others of Smith's \\"Night World\\" I have read thus far, \\"Spellbinder\\" is much easier to approach than the norm, written for young inductees into the paranormal phenomenon.Good witch Thea and dubious cousin witch Blaise are alike and yet quite dissimilar -- Blaise is a virtual goddess of love, while Thea's lie more in the arts of caring for animals. The two have few disagreements in contrary to what one might expect, though they share the mantle of Blaise's ongoing penchant for trouble.Upon arrival at their new school and last chance, Thea's skills with animals are instantly tested, and resultingly she finds herself drawn to human boy Eric, a veterinarian to be (and one of the most compelling \\"Night World\\" heroes).Things would be hectic enough with Blaise's attempts to claim Eric for herself, but soon even Thea is working forbidden magics of her own, and eventually the full burden of responsibility for their actions comes to bear down on the witch-pair.While I very much (and surprisingly!) enjoyed this book, there are a few flaws. I found myself questioning a few subplots -- most notably Blaise's former pet and his appearance at the school seemed a bit embryonic and not thoroughly explained, and the book's resolutiooon, while surprising and fulfilling, still leaves one wondering if justice really has been served.All in all, fun, with good characters.7.8/10"},{"Title":"SPELLBINDER: NIGHTWORLD","review":"Well, let me just say that a lot of the reviews AND the back cover of the book are a teensy bit misleading. I mean they lead people to believe that Blaise is just bad and doing what she does out of spite which is NOT true and they also make the book sound cliche you know two dogs one bone, the horror! This book isn't like that, I mean it is good althought the male characters were a bit ah wimpy? Of course that's to be expected with two dynamic witches around. The plot could've used a teensy bit of work, but it's not like Smith didn't really know what she was talking about because it seems like she did (I have a friend who's into wicca and stuff). The two cousins are well developed characters and for the most part the connections between the characters are very well done. All in all I'd say this book is worth a read if you've got free time and nothing much else to do. Especially if you're into romance stuff, which I'm not... If I were I'd have probably given it another star."},{"Title":"SPELLBINDER: NIGHTWORLD","review":"This book was incredibly good, and hard to find as well! I finally found it cheap at half.com. But no matter what, just try to get your hands on it because if you enjoy a good story of magic, witchcraft, and heart-wrenching love, this is the Night World book for you. I especially love L.J. Smith's &quot;soulmate&quot; theory, that each person is destined to be with one person only during their lifetime in the entire world. Another great Night World book was Witchlight. I highly recommend all of L.J. Smith's books!"},{"Title":"SPELLBINDER: NIGHTWORLD","review":"This is the first book I ever read by L.J. Smith, and it is so awesome. I almost never read these teen horror novels anymore, but Smith is an author I enjoy. I have no idea how many times I read this book. Thea is such a great character. She started to seduce Eric to save him from Blaise, but ends up falling for him. It's cool to see her break one of the few rules of the Night World for her love. Well, actually she breaks them both, but never mind. If you like books with a romantic/witchy theme, read this and while you're at it, read the Secret Circle trilogy. Those are some of the best books I ever read!"},{"Title":"SPELLBINDER: NIGHTWORLD","review":"This was the first Night World book I red and it got me hooked. You just can't put it down.

But it was not as good as other Night World Books. But still worth getting."},{"Title":"SPELLBINDER: NIGHTWORLD","review":"\\"Spellbinder\\" (also published as \\"Enchantress\\") is the third book in L. J. Smith's \`Night World' series, concerning the secret world of supernatural creatures that live among normal human beings. Called the Night World, there are several rules imposed upon the witches, vampires, werewolves and shape shifters that inhabit this world, namely that they are to never tell a human being about their secret society, and never to fall in love with one of them.This is the first book in the series to deal with witches rather than vampires, and concerns the lives of two seventeen year old witch cousins who made their first appearance in \\"Secret Vampire\\": Thea and Blaise Harman. The two girls are complete opposites; Thea is fair and quiet, whilst Blaise is black-haired and someone who enjoys playing with the human world for fun - making boys fall in love with her and then discarding them. After a series of expulsions from high schools around the country (the last one having resulted in the school burning down), the cousins are brought to live with their grandmother Edgith Harman - the Crone of All the Witches, a prestigious position within the Circles of Night World witches. In other words, the cousins are on thin ice.But Blaise doesn't trouble herself with things like this - she's always played her love games and doesn't plan on stopping now. Thea however, is desperate to live a quiet, peaceful life. But then she finds her soul mate: Eric Ross, a human. Their connection is powerful, but Thea knows that should they be discovered, it could result in executions for both of them, or in war among the factions of the Night World. When Blaise finds out about Thea's feelings, she decides the only way in which to act is to separate the two of them: by using her own charms to divert Eric's attention away from Thea...The blurb would have you believe that Blaise is an out-and-out villain, and the focus of the story is on the two girls fighting over Eric's affections. This however is not so - the main conflict in the story comes from Thea's attempts to protect Eric by summoning up a benevolent spirit. However, when the spell goes wrong, Thea finds that a murderous witch-ghost is on the loose, and perfectly capable of killing. As well as this there are numerous sub-plots, including Edgith's failing health, Blaise's exploits at her new high school, a few spells and meetings with other witches, Thea's various attempts to allure/dispel Eric's affections and an introduction to Eric's family and his radical-feminist little sister.All this equals a rather slip-shod plot that slides all over the place. It's not that the story isn't interesting, but L. J. Smith doesn't seem quite sure on where it's going, or where the true conflict lies. Instead it comes across as a series of magical events and workings that don't quite have the urgency and suspense of other books in the series - especially the later ones.Furthermore, many of the plot points and characters in the book were rather familiar - Smith has been recycling her own work, most particularly \\"The Secret Circle\\" trilogy. Blaise and Thea are almost identical to Faye and Diana (and both sets were cousins!) whilst things like the vengeful spirit, the death of a school student and the forbidden love affair all have their counterpoints in this previous trilogy. As such, the story has a lack of originality (and the coupling of Thea and Eric doesn\`t come across as *that* genuine).But there are some nice touches throughout: we get another piece of the ever-growing history of the Night World (this time it's the story of Hellewise and Maya), some names of other characters that have either been in previous books or will pop up in later ones (such as Aradia, Ash, Quinn and Thierry) that make the book feel like a small part of a larger whole. Smith also makes good use of folklore and mythology, weaving little bits of \`real' legends and practices into what the characters say and do - like the Cup of Lethe or the many allusions to Aphrodite.All in all, not a bad contribution to the 'Night World' series, though by no means the best: things only get really interesting when we hit book five: \\"The Chosen\\"."},{"Title":"SPELLBINDER: NIGHTWORLD","review":"With the reappearance of two characters in Secret Vampire, L.J. Smith has launched into her first book centred around witches. I enjoyed this book and if you're an animal lover, you'll probably find a few scenes regarding them but it's not quite as good as her first two books in the series.Thea and Blaise are two cousins who have been expelled from five high schools because of Blaise's exploits. Unable to control her, Thea can only watch as Blaise toys with human boys and commands them to do her bidding.At their new school, things seem no different with Blaise setting her sights on Eric, a boy Thea is strangely attracted to. Amused by his refusal of Blaise, amusement soon turns to anxiety as Thea realises that her cousin is determined to make Eric desire her.Breaking the rule of never loving a human, Thea puts both her and Eric's life on the line as she tries to ward Blaise off.The two main characters (Blaise and Thea) are very well written and I could visualise them quite easily. They are both strong women and Blaise is not the complete ... that she seems to be. Nor is Thea the obedient, good girl she seems to be.Eric - and most human males in the series I must admit - is a bit of a weak character. When you really think about it, it's not that surprising. How can a weak human male compare to a cool, ruthless, strong vampire guy? He's not written in as much detail but you do get the general idea.There is a very good twist at the end and if you read carefully, you won't really guess it but you'll pick up small clues. Quite a bit of suspense and I liked the extra touch with the spirit."},{"Title":"SPELLBINDER: NIGHTWORLD","review":"This book is sooooooo good, i have read most of the books in the Night World series, but so far this is my fav. i love the way she describes the witchcraft and makes u feel part of the powerful magic that takes place.

It is a work of fiction and that shows strongly in the plot with devices such as the bad witch vs. good witch theme and a total disregard for human life. I include this as a warning to other Pagans who may be offended by these themes.Despite the facts above, L.J. Smith actually did her research! If you are Wiccan, you will get a kick out this book if you can ignore the innacuracies of the plot line. You'll find the Rede, mentions of herbs and their associations, a fairly accurate portrayal of the Burning Times and a few mentions of circle casting and spellwork. You'll also find a running theme of Maiden/Mother/Crone. For those Pagans or Witches who are not Wiccan (like me), you might enjoy the overall message/s of the book as well as the fairly accurate Pagan elements.Of course, the first thing that impressed me were the strong female Witch characters. The second was the actual accuracies in the book. Oh yes, and there were male Witches. Pagan fiction isn't exactly readily available, so I'll take what I can get in that department. The plotline is VERY innacurate (includes vampires, a &quot;world&quot; of Witches and a hatred of humans), so be prepared for this.Onto the entertainment value of the book. I devour books. I picked this one up for a quick &quot;fluffy&quot; read. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was really quite good. Her writing will take you into another world and if you love reading, you will likely devour this book in one sitting. The writing is fantastic. Most of the characters are well written and the book flows very well. Very entertaining and satisfying.I have to rate this book with 5 stars as a result of incredible energy rush I received after reading it.Off to ground myself, Enchantress B. RM."},{"Title":"SPELLBINDER: NIGHTWORLD","review":"I love L.J. Smith's books and this I have to say was one of the best. It was a night world book which is sometimes very far fetched but this one had a surprisingly realistic feel to it, if you understand what I mean. It was a great book. I've read it twice already. So, if you have any interest in L.J. Smith, make sure to read this book. It's one of her best, after the Secret Circle and Dark Visions triliogies."},{"Title":"SPELLBINDER: NIGHTWORLD","review":"This book like all of L.J.Smith's other books is absolutely divine! I luved it. Blaise was a perfect witch in my opinion. The only thing that disturbed me was the awful torture chamber for Halloween in the Gym. How can people actually laugh about that (I've met people who think it's funny)?"},{"Title":"SPELLBINDER: NIGHTWORLD","review":"Hey, it's not called Spellbinder here in England, but it is still the best book I have ever read! I thought that Thea was just soooooo groovesome and as for Blaise, well anyone who has read this book will probably know what I mean! I just loved the way they told you specific spells and stuff and I also thought that it was cool how Thea could get into the minds of animals. To anyone who hasn't read this book - Are you crazy or something!!!! I would say that this is definately the best Night World book because it is so different from all of the other ones.If you are interested in the Night World please e-mail me.Mary"},{"Title":"SPELLBINDER: NIGHTWORLD","review":"This book definitely rates in my top five of L. J. Smith books(of course, I haven't yet read a book by her that wasn't really good and that I wouldn't want to read again and again). I really liked how Eric Ross and Thea Harman just *had* to be together, through spells and high water.The way that Blaise and Thea were still incredibly good &quot;sisters&quot; that would never let themselves be parted by illegal spells or by bewitched boys was really nice. All in all this book was just really great, just enough romance and just enough adventure. Plus, if you're an L. J. Smith fan, like me, please e-mail me. It's always nice to find other people who enjoy her books as much as I do!! Most importantly, READ THIS BOOK!Sunny"},{"Title":"SPELLBINDER: NIGHTWORLD","review":"L.J. Smith is right about almost every witchy detail, from the Burning Times (which is waht witches do call it), to the Circles, to Hecate, the first witch. l.j. smith has to be the qoolest Young Adult writer, it would be a sin to compare her work to that predictable 'Goosebumps' crap"},{"Title":"SPELLBINDER: NIGHTWORLD","review":"I am a British fan of all the Night World series, but particularily enjoy this one as Thea is a really rounded character who doesn't really want to do wrong, but must protect Eric. It's called Enchantress here, but i think Spellbinder is a better name! Enjoy the whole series, they are a magnificent achievement, and i would reccommend them to everyone!"},{"Title":"SPELLBINDER: NIGHTWORLD","review":"This was actually the 3nd of the Night Worlds I had ever read but I have a different cover and it says Enchantress why???? This was a good book and I liked the spells and particularely Blaise's necklace that was cool.I wonder if yemonja really exists and the other spices.It is true that most of LJSmith's books are with witches and vampires and that we don't know what shapeshifters shape into but I liked the spells anyway.Email me if ya wanna chat."},{"Title":"SPELLBINDER: NIGHTWORLD","review":"While not the best Night World book, it's certainly a good read. Thea and Eric were almost too goody-goody as main characters for my taste, but they were still fun to read about. I thought Blaise was one of the most interesting characters, with so many layers it's hard to really figure her out. The author did a wonderful job creating characters you could care about."},{"Title":"SPELLBINDER: NIGHTWORLD","review":"This book was one of my favorite. I actually loved Blaise, she was such a bad girl heheI even use her name as my SN!"},{"Title":"Pennant race,","review":"Pennant Race and its companion book, The Long Season, are the best baseball books ever written. I enjoyed Ball Four, written ten years after The Long Season, but it is a pale imitation. Brosnan's style and perspective are unique; his blend of candor and cynicism unmatched; his writing subtleties are brilliant. I have read hundreds of baseball books, and these two, which I basically consider one volume, are unequaled."},{"Title":"Pennant race,","review":"Although most of the players from the 1961 Cincinnati Reds are forgotten now (exception: right fielder and National League MVP Frank Robinson), this book remains current due to the good humor and insider's view it affords the reader. Nearly 40 years old now, it shows how timeless the game of baseball is.I'm a lifelong NY Yankees fan, but this remains one of my favorite books on any subject.One note: this is one of the only baseball books that was _really_ written by the named author. Brosnan had no ghostwriter."},{"Title":"Pennant race,","review":"In his second player diary, pitcher Jim Brosnan describes his day-to-day participation as a member of the pennant-winning 1961 Cincinnati Reds. Brosnan writes with the same wit and amused irreverence he used two years earlier in his superb initial diary, THE LONG SEASON. Here we get an insider's view of star teammates like Frank Robinson (that year's MVP), Vada Pinson, Jim Maloney, manager Fred Hutchinson, etc. Readers will enjoy hearing about now-forgotten players in long-gone ballparks like Crosley Field, Shibe Park, Forbes Field, etc. We also get the tension and thrill of a pennant race. Unfortunately, the author omits spring training, and he ends the diary on the last day of the regular season, before the Reds played the Yankees in that year's World Series - thus I gave the book just four stars instead of five.Brosnan was a college-educated player who gained recognition (and notoriety) for his writing. PENNANT RACE is as readable and charming as its predecessor, and once again landed Brosnan in some hot water with baseball's establishment."},{"Title":"Pennant race,","review":"Pennant Race by Jim Brosnan is the second of his baseball diary memiors thistime gently drawing back the curtain of privacy on the 1961 Cincinnati Reds National League Championship team.In what was the last of the 154 game schedule, eight team National League season, this was a historic and gruelling pennant race for the participants who had no idea what lay in store for Major League Baseball in the seasons ahead. Although if the NLers had paid attention to what was going on in the American League in 1961 they would have had a pretty good clue.That year in the AL, like most years then, the Yankees steamrolled their way to yet another AL Championship but this time with a historic home run race between Mantle and Maris as well as prodigious hitting by many of the other junior circuit clubs. But in 1961 the Al expanded to ten teams which meantat least two pitching staffs that were just a little below big league skilllevels. Which certainly must have helped all those sluggers hit those dingers.Meanwhile, back in the old fashioned NL, the Reds defeated last years World Champion Pittsburgh Pirates for the NL pennant and a shot at the powerful Yankees in the World Series. You can read all about it in Brosnan's 1961diary except for the World Series which was not included in in Pennant Race possibly because Mr.Brosnan wanted to end the book on a triumphant note. BTW, the Yankees won four out of five games against the Reds in the 1961 World Series.Pennant Race is perhaps the most entertaining sports book that I have ever read, there are several laugh out loud sections and it is extrememly interesting to hear Brosanan's on field contemporaries' reactions to his first book, The Long Season. Pennant Race, despite the fact that the 1961 World Series is not covered, is without a doubt one of the finest, pioneering sports books of our time."},{"Title":"Pennant race,","review":"Jim Brosnan's second book is also a diary, this one on his 1961 season spent with the eventual National League champion Cincinnati Reds. Brosnan's wit, cynicism, and wry observations on the game of baseball make this an entertaining read. He enjoys interacting with his teammates (most of the time) and one conversation in particular involving Brosnan getting on a teammate for his grammar is priceless. It would have been nice had Brosnan included his spring training experience and the Reds' involvement in the World Series that year. Despite lacking those two elements, \\"Pennant Race\\" is an easy recommendation. It's not as good as \\"The Long Season\\", but it's still a very good read."},{"Title":"Pennant race,","review":"This is a very entertaining book that will appeal to all baseball and/or Cincinnati Reds fans. It's a day to day diary of events in Cincinnati's 1961 pennant winning season prepared by relief pitcher Jim Brosnan. It's easy to read, and you'll enjoy Brosnan's humor. Additionally, it gives great insight into the personalities of the star and every day players of the time."},{"Title":"Pennant race,","review":"This is a great book that will give you insight on what major league baseball was really like in the late 50's"},{"Title":"Pennant race,","review":"This is an excellent author. The story line and the narative are very good.

As the couple drive on Route 66, they must learn to trust in each other and God.This type of romance will appeal to everyone, even readers who don't normally read &quot;inspirational&quot; fiction. God and religion are a part of Teague and Wendie's lives, there is no heavy handed preaching. The Blackwells are normal people with common problems, not saints. This is the first Annie Jones book I have read, but it won't be the last."},{"Title":"Lost Romance Ranch (Route 66 Series, Book 3)","review":"Great fun, good message and just enough about Route 66 to make one nostalgic for the glory days of tacky specialty stores and tourist sites. The romance was snappy and sharp not sappy and sweet. I loved the characters and the feel good ending that tied all three of the books in the series together. This book and the others in Jones's Route 66 comedy series are perfect summer reads - great for the arm chair travaler and the beachside dreamer."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet India & Bangladesh Travel Atlas","review":"The maps are better than what most Indians have ever seen in their lives, which is exactly why travellers don't need it. If you are taking public transport around the country, you get plenty of information about how to go where from LP India or from information at train stations, bus stations and other travellers. It simply isn't worth the excess weight (in a rucksack). If on the other hand you are cycling or have your own motorized vehicle, this would be irreplacable (so be careful who you show it to)."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet India & Bangladesh Travel Atlas","review":"While working on an on-going university research project I have spent five years driving the back roads of India. This book has saved my sanity as well as my tires and axles. It is by far and away the most helpful road atlas available."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet India & Bangladesh Travel Atlas","review":"If you know where you want to go then I would agree with the above reviewer- a guidebook will tell you about nearby sites and how to get there and for that you can get by without an atlas. But for those who want to explore a particular region- how else are you going to plot an itinerary? This atlas is fully indexed by place, and also by beaches, capes & headlands, caves, forts, islands, mountians & passes, rivers, lakes, & bays, ruins and temples. And no matter how good a guidebook- only an atlas like this will assure you that you haven't missed anything of interest whereever you happen to be.Map Scale is 4cm = 50K (1.5\\" = 31 miles)For security reasons (I'm told) quality maps are not easy to find in India- and rarely for sale."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet India & Bangladesh Travel Atlas","review":"I walk and hitch through a lot of rural and urban India.

The first thing that piqued my interest was the way the author is cited \\"Wally Armbruster - Manufacturer\\"...and then his definition of a noodle: ...just like a doodle, only just the opposite....things you think about without doing anything\\" It is filled with nutritious noodles - daily thoughts that are consistently laughter-provoking.....and then the truth behind the laughter sets in.....and your day is brightened and changed. Armbruster suggest that a steady diet of noodles might even change your life. An oldie but goodie!"},{"Title":"The Rise of the Great Powers 1648 - 1815 (The Modern European State System)","review":"Despite its age, The Rise of the Great Powers remains one of the best overviews of eighteenth-century European diplomatic history. Detailed enough for students, yet simple enough for those with no prior knowledge of the period, it charts the development of the European 'balance of power' from the end of the Thirty Years' War to the beginning of the Pax Britainica. The depth of McKay and Scott's uderstanding of such a complex subject is awesome, and they combine to produce a thoroughly enjoyable and informative book."},{"Title":"Basil: A Book of Recipes (The Little Recipe Book Series)","review":"I have several titles in this series--they're great! The recipes are easy to make and clearly set out, and there is always an introductory chapter on the herb or spice covered by the book. There are several other titles in this series: coriander, ginger, garlic, chocolate, etc."},{"Title":"Knowledge, Power and International Policy Coordination (Studies in International Relations)","review":"The book discusses the role that knowledge-based experts, otherwise known as \\"epistemic communities\\", play in international policy coordination. They argue that \\"control over knowledge and information is an important dimension of power and that the diffusion of new ideas and information can lead to new patterns of behavior and prove to be an important determinant of international policy coordination.\\" The first chapter defines what epistemic communities are, how they can be distinguished from other interest groups and the role that they play in helping to identify state interests and formulate policy. In the following chapters, the concept is applied to a diverse range of policy areas to illustrate how the communities affected international coordination. Trade in services, nuclear arms control, whaling, ozone negotiations, food aid, international financial standards, and the American post-war settlement are the policy areas covered. The book is an excellent academic resource if you are interested in epistemic communities, or alternative analysis for international policy coordination, or even if you are just interested in the particular case studies presented. Each case study is a meticulous presentation of historical developments and analysis for the particular policy area. They provide a wealth of information that is extremely useful for understanding the particular policy area, even if you are not particularly interested in the concept of epistemic communities.A word of warning though, if you are not a political scientist or an international relations theorist, this book can be extremely heavy going in parts. Technical jargon abounds, particularly in the first and last chapters. As an example, \\"the contributers ... shake orthodoxy by challenging Kantian ontology, correspondence theories of truth and related positivistic claims\\"(in the preface); and \\"epistomologically, the world and our representation of it are not isomorphic.\\" Fortunately, the case studies are much more understandable and keep away from the jargon."},{"Title":"The Portable Poe: 2","review":"Of all the writers you were forced to read in High School, Poe may be the most contemporary. After all, where would today's Alternative Goth culture be without the influence of Poe.In this volume, fans of the strange genius are given a rare treat. Editor Philip Van Doren Stern has collected not only the all-time greats (e.g. &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; &quot;The Raven&quot; etc.), but also some eccentric choices like &quot;The Man of the Crowd&quot;. In addition, the book gives several non-fiction articles and literary reviews written by Poe showing that he was not without a practical side.But perhaps the most fascinating thing is a section of letters Poe wrote, to among other people, his stepfather, his wife, his mother-in-law, and various members of the literary community. These paint a colorful picture of his often desperate existence. After reading these letters, you may think Poe tragic, pathetic, pretentious or maybe even egotistical, but you wll never think of him in quite the same way you previously did.Read this book for a fresh look at one of American literature's greatest geniuses."},{"Title":"The Portable Poe: 2","review":"Unless you're a collector or completist, this volume compiles all the Poe you could possibly ask for. All the classic stories are here, and you can clearly see how Poe broke new ground and influenced all creative fiction that came after him. While most people are wary of &quot;classics&quot; that everybody talks about, but nobody seems to really like, Poe's classics will give you a true appreciation for his genius. You will truly be enthralled by such well-known tales like &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot;, &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;, &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; (in which Poe invents the detective story), and especially the immortal &quot;The Raven&quot;.The editor has included many of the surviving letters that Poe wrote to the various women he unsuccessfully tried to court, and especially to his cruel stepfather, which provide great insight into Poe's inner demons. If you ever wonder why most of Poe's stories are based on death and/or madness, these letters will show you why. The only problem with this particular book is that it is a little too exhaustive, and includes many items that are more of historical interest than they are readable. This is true of most of the entries in the Articles, Criticism, and Opinions sections of the book."},{"Title":"The Portable Poe: 2","review":"This review is intended as a review of the book, not of the work of Edgar Allan Poe. As a Poe fan, I purchased this book just for the pure fun of reading Poe on my Kindle. However, the book is so poorly organized that finding a particular tale or poem is a real pain and takes a lot of the fun out of it. While there is a table of contents, the individual works are not list there; rather there are groupings of the works so you have to know (or guess) to which group the work you may be looking for belongs. Alas, there is also no index. This is an electronic book: I should be able to toggle down a table of contents to a particular work, select it, and be taken there, but it doesn't happen that way. Not recommended for Kindle readers!"},{"Title":"The Portable Poe: 2","review":"This volume contains Poe's most important works. The books starts out with his letters, which are of historical interest and also contain some fine philosophizing. The stories, of which many are included, are grouped sensibly by genre or subject. What can I say of them? They are superb, the meat of his works, and all fascinating, whether lunatic (The Cask of Amontillado, for example) or coolly ratiocinative (the Dupin stories). Poe's mastery and manipulation of the human psyche is really extraordinary, and the quality of the prose, I need scarcely mention, is extremely high. His works are classics for a very good reason.This book concludes with essays, articles, and poems. 'The Raven', of course, is most famous, but most of the other pieces are quite interesting. In particular, Poe's ability for expressing extremely abstract concepts and chains of reasoning, in his essays, is enviable. I finished this anthology awed, with that peculiar feeling, like that of static electricity, of having touched a man of genius -- a bit mad, yes, but a genius indeed."},{"Title":"The Portable Poe: 2","review":"This volume contains the essential Poe, the stories and poems for which he is most well- known.Like all American schoolchildren I had to read Poe when I was quite young. And I remember how his tales did not provide the kind of pleasure and insight I had found in other literature. \\"The Gold Bug\\" confounded me , and \\"The Tell- Tale Heart\\" frightened me, and the truth is even in adult years I have never taken much delight in the reading of the fictions of Poe.The horror of real life has always seemed to me more than enough, and I have never particularly enjoyed the mood and tone of Poe's fictions.I must admit too that Poe always seemed to me even when reading him as a child , 'extremely weird' to use a children's word. And ' weird' not simply with the connotation of ' strange' but of 'frighteningly so'.In any case there is a Poe that I have treasured. It might not be in the whole of the poem, but in the rhythmn of 'Nevermore' there did strike a kind of fascinating note. And there are in the poetry of Poe great lines, 'the beauty that was Greece, the glory that was Rome'. And a sadness and a feeling of tragedy in some of the love- poetry.Poe is of course much else to most other readers than to me, and the lovers of mystery stories, and detectives, of fictional conundrums tending toward horror, and of strange obsessions with beauty that dies young, will find more than they ask for in this anthology."},{"Title":"The Portable Poe: 2","review":"Find another version for ebookery, or go hard copy on this one. The table of contents, like the print version, organizes Poe's work into general categories, but stops there. Absent is a listing of the stories themselves, which is available in the print version. Navigating to a particular story requires you to do a search. Penguin charges a premium for a poor publishing job here."},{"Title":"The Portable Poe: 2","review":"The Portable Poe is worth buying simply because it contains a selection of Poe's letters. This latest edition fills in the some holes left by omissions in the previous version, by including such stories as The Imp of the Perverse, The Oblong Box, The System of Tarr and Fether, and Some Words with a Mummy; these stories for me anyway make it more comprehensive. Of course for a Poe fan I am sure some beloved stories are not included, but one can read this volume and have a pretty comprehensive view of Poe. On a minor note, I personally preferred the arrangement of the previous edition in terms of putting the letters first as opposed to last. Why this is? I cannot really say. The expansion of the Observations section is nice as well. Overall if you own a previous edition, no real need to buy this newest one, if you don't own the older one, get this one."},{"Title":"The Portable Poe: 2","review":"if you want an overview of the work of poe this is the book!!! it has a comprehensive selection of his work and also criticism. a good way to get started knowing this strange, enigmatic writer. good price too."},{"Title":"The Portable Poe: 2","review":"I've read about a dozen pieces so far for a gut-gripping course I'm enjoying.

I may be in my 50s but that packed a wallop.He's as good or better than you may remember.The two detective stories I've read a pretty good but a bit long and labored. And I just started the critical articles with The Short Story (appropriately three pages long) and it was very good. He made his interesting point about as succinctly as could be done.The biographical intro is interesting because the editor (and my teacher) are convinced that he wasn't the complete, miserable wretch that his literary executor made him out to be. He appeared to have trouble with shooting himself in his perverse foot, though. And, in my opinion, he could be a bit of a drama queen in his letters but a ghastly wretch? Well, maybe he wasn't as far gone as was supposed for a long time.

This one, an introduction to insects, begins with a discussion of \\"The parts of an insect.\\" The discussion (Pages 6-7) proceeds from wing to internal anatomy to thorax to antennae, with all manner of tidbits in between. This reminds me of why I'm not dons of insects!The next subject is the distinction between \\"What is an insect?\\" and \\"These are not insects.\\" The answer to the former question begins with a simple statement that (Page 8) \\"Insects are the most successful creatures in the whole of the animal kingdom.\\" Kind of puts us mammals in our place. . . . Insects are defined as arthropods (having \\"a hard, protective exoskeleton\\") with six legs. Most, too, have wings. How many insects are there? Maybe more than 1,000,000 (million) species are already known. Not insects? Scorpions, prawns, tarantulas, centipedes, earthworms, and wood lice.Enough for introductions. What does the rest of this volume, again written for the 8-12 year old young reader, address? There is discussion of the first insects (emerging 300,000,000 years ago), an insect's senses, feeding, and metamorphosis. There is also discussion of some of the main types of insects, such as butterflies and moths, beetles, flies, wasps and their kin, and so on.The book concludes with some perspective, including contributions that insects make.All in all, a very satisfying entry into the Eyewitness Books series.

Faherty has done it again! \\"The St. Louis German Catholics\\" is another contribution to the documentary history of St. Louis. I have often heard Fr. Faherty say that he wrote this book as a sequel to \\"The Irish In St. Louis \\" (see my Amazon review) because of all the Irish who had married Germans. Being one of those Irish, I decided to give it a look. I was delighted!This book which can be appreciated in many ways. I read the surnames of friends and the histories of parishes with which I am familiar. From the pages of this book I developed an appreciation of the contributions of the St. Louis Germans to the religious, commercial and social life of St. Louis. Ever the historian, Fr. Faherty is not satisfied until he explains the developments in Germany which drove its citizens to St. Louis. A consistent explanation is that Bismarck's anti-Catholic policies were a major factor in German immigration to St. Louis.For anyone with an interest in St. Louis, German immigration to America or Church history, \\"The St. Louis German Catholics\\" is a must."},{"Title":"Twenty Years on the Cape: My Time As a Surfcaster","review":"This is one of my favorite fishing books.

The guy is in love with his &quot;beach buggy&quot;, which to everyone else translates as big trucks like 4 X 4 Ford Broncos, GM Suburbans, and the like, and certainly not the more aptly suitable dune buggy-like vehicles, given it's about fishing on the Cape. Tells of his beloved &quot;beach buggies&quot; take a significant part of his book.The author keeps complaining over and over, from beach regulations against RVs and trucks, err... &quot;beach buggies&quot; to fishing regulations, and he makes it clear very early that he's aiming at making surfcasting a profitable business.If, to you, surfcasting is a sport, if surfcasting means a unique opportunity to be closer to Nature, having the sea before you, dunes behind, over a sunset mean a lot to you, or if you're looking simply for fishing stories, or tricks of the trade, or funny or humorous tales (as it happens to almost anyone!), or if you were looking for a book which would remind of your own fishing trips, you won't find that in this book.The author relates his &quot;surfcasting&quot; experience from the '60s to the late '80s, those golden years of surfcasting, before fish stocks collapsed.I was on the Cape back then, and recalling my own surfcasting experience, I can testify that anyone who had his first 30-pounder bluefish on a 12-pound test line could tell you in vivid colours his experience to land that fish.The title and the photo on the cover lead you believe that is what you'll find in his book.What I've found is an angry man, his trucks, $$$ and that he couldn't care less about Cape Cod natural beauty, or... the joy of surfcasting."},{"Title":"The Pony Rider Boys in Alaska; or, The Gold Diggers of Taku Pass","review":"The Pony Rider Boys in Alaska... by Frank Gee Patchin, another exciting story about the boy's adventure in the Gold Country.

There have been many \\"perfect\\" teams; that is, teams that went undefeated and untied en route to a consensus National Championship. USC itself has enjoyed their fair share of these kinds of wire-to-wire perfect seasons. But the stars have never been aligned for any team quite like the 2004 Trojans. First of all, they are the sixth team to be ranked number one in the nation from the pre-season polls through the bowl games. USC is the only team to do it twice. The 1972 Trojans, considered by many to be the greatest team of all time, accomplished the feat. But SC was also ranked number one from the end of the 2003 regular season through the bowls, and carried that right through 2004 without interruption.The 2004 Trojans also boast the Heisman Trophy winner, two-time junior All-American quarterback Matt Leinart. His teammate, All-American sophomore running back Reggie Bush, was a New York finalist for the award. USC won a repeat National Championship, a feat rarely done. They are in the middle of a 22-game winning streak. They beat Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl, a game that was previewed as the greatest game in college football history. The 1944-45 Army Cadets featured a similar winning streak and two Heisman winners, Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis. There are other teams that compare, but nobody has done it quite the way Carroll's team is doing it.A few came close. The 1983 Nebraska Cornhuskers featured an undefeated regular season that included winners of the Heisman and Outland Trophies. They lost to Miami in the Orange Bowl. The 2003 Oklahoma Sooners looked to be on a similar path, but their Heisman winner, Jason White, faltered in the Big 12 championship game as well as the Orange Bowl.In light of USC's recent dominance, it is worth considering their place in history. Not just the current Trojans, but USC's football program going back to the beginning of the 20th Century. It is time to take the mantel of \\"greatest program in the history of college football\\" away from the struggling Notre Dame Fighting Irish, and lay it squarely with the deserving new champions from USC. Furthermore, USC continues to lay claim to the greatest historical athletic program in college history, as well.The two-time defending National Champions are a dynasty. If Leinart returns for his senior year in 2005, they will be better than they were this season. Leinart will be a senior, the Heisman favorite (as he was all of this year), and a three-time All-American. He will walk away from his career with more honors than any player ever; three National Championships (?), two Heismans (?), the Johnny Unitas Award, the Walter Camp Award, the Maxwell Trophy, the Davey O'Brien Award, et al. He will probably be the number one pick in the NFL draft.The 2003-04 Trojans are very possibly the greatest two-year dynasty ever. If they win a third title in 2005, that will be a first. They lose a couple of linebackers, but aside from Leinart, Bush will be a junior, running backs LenDale White and Herschel Dennis return, the whole offensive line returns, the tight ends and receivers are back, and the defense will be, for the most part, experienced. The 2005 Trojans have the potential to be the greatest single-season team ever assembled, better even than the 1972 Trojans. Soph-to-be Jeff Byers was the nation's best lineman coming out of high school and could win the Outland Trophy before graduating. Soph-to-be linebacker Keith Rivers was the top prep at his position and may garner a Butkus trophy some day. If Leinart leaves for the NFL, USC will re-tool at quarterback with one of two blue chip recruits.In 2005, John David Booty will be a red-shirt sophomore. He was the top prep quarterback in America at Louisiana's Evangel Christian High School. His competition? Mark Sanchez, the top prep quarterback in the U.S. at Mission Viejo High (the nation's number two team) in Orange County, California in 2004. USC has had the number one recruiting class in the country for three years in a row. Last year's was considered the greatest of all time. The 2005 class, which will be finalized in February, promises to be just as good. The pipeline is endless. In light of the fact that they will enter next season ranked number one, favored to win their third National Championship in a row, they are worthy of continued hype. Consider that if Troy runs the table in '05, their winning streak will probably be 35. With either Booty or Sanchez living up to the challenge, maybe with senior running back Bush winning the Heisman and starring with a cast headlined by juniors Rivers and Byers, the 2006 Trojans could challenge Oklahoma's 57-game winning streak of the 1950s. Now we are looking at four National Championships in a row, but wait, there is more. Booty could quarterback the team in 2006 and 2007. Sanchez would be a red-shirt junior and senior in 2008-09. Considering that the last two SC quarterbacks (Carson Palmer in 2002 and Leinart in '04) won the Heisman, USC could conceivably come away with four more of the trophies before the end of this decade. The scenario could be:2005: Senior quarterback Matt Leinart, USC.2006: Senior running back Reggie Bush, USC.2007: Senior USC quarterback John David Booty, USC (Oklahoma running back Adrian Petersen will be a pro by then).2009: Senior quarterback Mark Sanchez, USC.Steven Travers is the author of the Best Selling \\"Barry Bonds: Baseball's Superman\\".

There are 6 divided sections, all identical. each one starts w/a pocket to hold whatever you want (mine have neighborhood maps and brochures) and an &quot;itinerary&quot; page; then 2 pages for museums, galleries and sights; 2 pages for restaurants, bars and nightlife; 2 pages for shops, stores and markets; 5 blank journal pages; 6 pages to attach photos or other memorabelia; and one last blank journal page. All writing pages are lined, the themed pages offer blank space for writing as well as guided space for specific places you will visit, or have visited. There are lovely quotes and pictures sprinkled throughout the journal. I enjoyed attaching pictures that I printed or cut out of magazines that are relevant to my trip. The journal could be used for any combination of trips, I am using each section to represent different neighborhoods so that I can see as much as possible, in a somewhat organized manner. A friend is using hers to plan and commemorate her trip to France and Italy, and it is beautiful! This journal is a great combination of organization, utility and beauty. I love showing it to people and looking through it myself! While it's probably more of a &quot;girl&quot; journal, it is not fru-fruey or delicate. It can be used in so many different ways, I love it and will buy it for friends as well."},{"Title":"Travel Journal","review":"Each year that my husband and I visit a new place, we start a new travel journal. What drew me to this journal was that it not only had lined writing pages, but also 6 pockets, to hold brochures or other keepsake items, black sheets that could be used for photos, or most likely with us, postcards, since we seem to always come home with several, and photo mounts, which are also included. Each section has a pocket, 6 blank, lined writing pages and a page to write about restaurants, museums, shops/stores and then an opposite page to note the names and phone numbers of the places (and a place to note purchases on the shopping page). The book also has a band that holds your place and has pictures and quotes throughout, making it a beautiful book, even before you start to write about your own adventures. I think one page for itinerary would have probably been enough, and a slighly smaller book would have been perfect, but these are small things. Overall I think this will be just the ticket for the next trip.

Much recommended to those who enjoy the travel genre"},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"Ejoyable stories from the early 1980's by an author who waxes a bit nostalgic for the British Empire. Well written with dry humor. A languid pace. Never dull."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"This is a lovely book which I came across incidentally while looking for another book. Mr. Simon, must I say, is a lucky man to have travelled so much and seen so much. And we are lucky to be allowed a peek into the workings (or no workings) of the British colonies. I was born and bred in Karachi and I can attest to the many goods and bads which were left by British empire. The railways remain their biggest contribution to Pakistan, as far as I can see. And they left those high handed bureaucrats, who were supposed to be good but have turned out badly. British gave us a certain system but they also destroyed and help eliminate many of the hand made products including hand made silk linen, which was the best in the world and was produced in Bengal region. To promote their own merchandise and machinery, British banned the making of this wonderful fabric, whose 7 yards could be packed within a cigarette packet.The most unfortunate legacy of British empire in Subcontinent (Pakistan, Bengal, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Burma) is the profusion of religious madrassahas (schools of Islamic law and jurisprudence) which created multiple religious thought processes including the violent ideology of Deobandi school. They were actively supported by British over-lords and we can see the results today: From Afghanistan to Pakistan and beyond the entire region is engulfed in the religious hatred flames.Back to the book: It is wonderfully written and he gets his facts straight."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"The blurb on the cover from the New York Times Book Review says: \\"Funny, masterly, fine... Superbly written.\\" Like all the other books by Winchester which I have read, this is superbly written, but funny it is not. I'm not sure what the reviewer defines as funny, but after reading travelogues by Bill Bryson and Peter Mayle (which have their share of funny moments) this is a much more scholarly tome. Some of these outposts are in the middle of nowhere and you wonder how people live.I think the chapter I most enjoyed was Gibraltar - only because I know all about the roundabout trip British citizens have to make from getting from Spain to The Rock. (Okay - maybe that was the funny section.) My second favourite section was the Falklands (or should I say Malvinas?) -- I vaguely remember the war and it was nice to get a history lesson from this book. I'm sure my friends in the UK know more about this conflict that I do - but I don't remember a lot of news coverage here in the USA. (Granted, it's 20 years ago, but still - if it's not affecting the USA, the news kind of just skates over it quickly, if it's mentioned at all.)It's fine writing, makes you think about places that you might never otherwise heard of, but at times it's dull and reads more like a history text than a travelogue."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"I can live with the chapters that are outdated; I mean, Winchester wrote this two decades ago, the 'first published' date tells you this. I see no need for him to have to update anything. It's a travel book from the early 1980's.What did annoy me though was Winchester's constant and, one must assume, deliberate ploy of interchanging the words English/ England with British/ Britain, as if they meant the same thing.Whether Winchester liked it or not (and I'm sure he probably didn't) the Empire was British; England may well have been in control but the constant interchange often found in the same paragraph is a real kick in the teeth to the hundreds and thousands of Welsh and Scots that helped form the fledgling Empire.The book cover has the Union Flag on it. It's there for a reason."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"I thought I was buying a recently written book, and was very disappointed to see this is a 1985 book I had read years ago, with a new cover and a new introduction. For this reason, I have given it only one star.That being said, the 1985 book was a fascinating travelogue for its era. Simon Winchester visited all of the remaining territories of Great Britain, many of them obscure places such as Tristan da Cunha in the Atlantic and Boddam in the Indian Ocean, populated by people who have been more-or-less forgotten by the British government. The best chapter is on the Falklands, where the author arrived a few days before the Argentine invasion. The author's description of pre-invasion Falklands was particularly evocative, as he describes a society stuck in a 1950s time-warp where the work ethic had been lost.Winchester makes a number of cogent points about the governance of these places. He points out that the people in France's territories directly elect members to the French legislature, yet the people of Britain's territories have no representation whatsoever, even though they are generally staunch monarchists. Also, the author emphasizes how unfair it is that people in predominantly white territories have the right to move to Britain, but those in non-white territories such as St. Helena are not permitted to move to Britain. (Apparently some reforms have occurred since the book was written in 1985.)It would be fascinating if Simon Winchester retraced his 1985 itinerary and described how these places have changed in the last 20 years. That is the book that should have been written."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"The copy I have of this book was published in 1984, so much of the political and other information is very out of date. However, as a travelogue with some very astute and perhaps controversial observations it is still a very enjoyable read. Winchester is a favorite author of mine, Krakatoa and A Crack In The Edge of the World being a couple of my favorites. In Outposts however Winchester relates his personal travels to the (at the time) remaining colonial outposts of the British Empire. He also shares his thoughts on how the British government has ignored or short-changed the residents of these outposts. He does at time seem to take a long time to reach a point, and often skims over many aspects of where he visits with nary an explanation, but if you are willing to let him be the guide you will find it an enjoyable if sometimes frustrating journey."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"Darn - what are these places like today - not 30 years back?

It was a basis for a lot of Google Maps exploration and discovery."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I ordered this book. I like Winchester's writing for the most part but he has occasionally disappointed me. There are a couple of subjects he has tackled where it appears apparent that had a thought that the topic in question might sell some copy and then just cobbled together something that ultimately came across as half-hearted and mediocre (The Fracture Zone: My Return To The Balkans, comes to mind). I half-expected that this title was going to prove to be in that category but, fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised.Although somewhat out of date (Hong Kong is most definitely not a relic of the Empire any longer, for example), this pleasant little book gives the reader a good, close look at some places that might otherwise be not much more obscure names on the globe. The story of how Winchester came to visit all the places he writes about (excepting Pitcairn Islands) is very engaging and his descriptions of the places and people he encounters makes for an entertaining read. I would have liked a few more pictures, and maybe so"},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"I started by listening to the audiobook. In the intro to the audiobook, the author describes how he abridged the book by simply skipping whole chapters. He omitted Hong Kong, Bermuda, British West Indies and the Falklands. This of course, led me to the paperback to complete the missing chapters. I'm glad I read the extra chapters, but don't think I would have missed much if I hadn't. The Hong Kong chapter is the weakest, and the most irrelevant now that it has spent a decade in the PRC. The Bermuda chapter is a little better. The West Indies chapter has nuggets of interest, though would probably need some updating (such as a volcano on Montserrat). However, it quickly jumps from Island to Island so can be a little difficult to follow. The fact that he was in the Falklands as the war was breaking out makes that the most interesting of the omitted chapters in the audiobook.As for the remainder of the audiobook, it is always nice when an author reads his own books, especially when he does it well like Simon Winchester. He has 'updated' it, primarily by reminding us that these exploits did take place a few decades ago. (I also found it useful to read the updated introduction after completing the book, helping to remind myself that these are 25 year old exploits.) The book reads as part travelogue, part history. The journey gets equal weight with the destination. I found myself with a strong interest in learning more about these places that had been nothing more than dots on the map."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"Outposts is perhaps the oddest of Winchester's many books; surely it is the most melancholy. The three years of journeys that were required to complete the book--which took Winchester to dozens of far-flung destinations spattered across the globe--was apparently both exhausting and disheartening. Or, perhaps we should dispense with the word \\"apparently\\": Winchester makes his exhaustion (with the travel, with the topic) and his disappointment more than clear. His typical humor is largely absent and, when it is not, it is decidedly brittle. Indeed, in the end Winchester finds himself in a territory that is truly unfamiliar to him: that of acting as a political and cultural critic of his own country and his own times. The reader, meanwhile, realizing that Winchester completed the manuscript some 24 years ago and that the dire situations he described can only have gotten worse, feels Winchester's melancholy all the more. (In 2004, Harper brought out a new edition of the book with an updated introduction; I have not read it.) This is perhaps among the more obscure of Winchester's books; it is, in any case, one of the few whose destination is not the past. I have always had the sense that Winchester was more in his element when he was delving into history, but the present in Outposts seems a particularly unhappy destination."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"This is a review of the audio CD version of Outposts, which is an abridged version of the book, read by the author. In a word, Outposts got me hooked on Winchester's writing, and I've gone on to listen to the audio version of five of his other books, all equally facinating in their respective ways. Except for a weak piece on Pitcairn Island at the end of the audio version of Outposts, where the author seems to have run out of gas, the other pieces are well written and fascinating. I hope that (1) an unabridged audio version of the book is produced and (2) Winchester writes/records another book covering places not covered in Outposts. If you like intelligent travelogs and if you appreciate good writing, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"Simon Winchester made it his mission to visit the forgotten outposts of the British Empire. A century ago the Empire spanned the globe, hundreds of islands, dozens of countries and protectorates and the sun truly never set on the territories. But the Empire shrunk and collapsed in on itself yet straggling islands across the planet still lay claim or are claimed by the shadow of day's long gone.Sure, as other people have said, it's a dated book. But it was written in 1985 and reading it with that in mind it's a fascinating travelogue. I loved the author's attempt to \\"invade\\" Diego Garcia accompanied by the disappointing story of how residents were evicted and the U.S. put in a major (nuclear) base. The empire has done so many things in its best interest, unfortunately that doesn't always include protecting individual rights.I also learned a lot about St. Helena where exiles resided for decades (Napoleon, Mbelini - head of the Zulu Nation). I knew nothing about the beauty of the island or of the mansion where Napoleon took his walks and dictated his memoirs, staff on hand and British Guards out of sight.The Pitcairn islands are the last refuge of Britain in the Pacific not even administered nearby, but instead thousands of miles away from Australia. The resident population shrinking and forgotten. The average British citizen doesn't know much about its current empire. Maybe if you ask they'll say the Isle of Mann or the Faulklands. But these Outposts are historic and present. It's a great read. I love learning the minutia of history: the forgotten places, the discarded histories, and the neglected peoples.Dated? Maybe, but is history ever dated and does travel lose its romance.- CV Rick, March 2008"},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"Simon Winchester wrote \\"Outposts\\" in 1984, just after the Falklands War and before Hong Kong was turned back over to China.

The tour includes Diego Garcia, Gibralter, the Atlantic islands such as Ascension and St Helena, Bermuda, the Caribbean islands, the Falklands, Hong Kong, and the Pitcairn group in the Pacific.Getting to the remoter locations is a significant part of the story. Winchester has to sneak into Diego Garcia by sailboat, only to be booted out by the authorities. He arrives by commercial airliner in the Falklands just days ahead of the Argentine invasion. Getting to the remoter Atlantic islands required a hop on a periodic cargo vessel and favorable weather to actually get ashore. Pitcairn was so remote as to defeat Winchester's efforts to actually visit.For each outpost, Winchester surveys its imperial past and provides some anecdotes on its often anachronistic present as a colony or overseas dependency. Some places, such as Bermuda and the Caymans, have done well. Some less fortunate places, such as remote Pitcairn and some of the Caribbean islands, are seemingly administered out of stubborn habit. A few, such as Ascension and Diego Garcia, had been leased to the United States to carry out what were once the old Imperial responsibilities.If poverty and indifferent administration by London is a frequent finding, so is the lingering essential Britishness of many of the inhabitants of the \\"outposts.\\" Many residents enjoy their remoteness from the modern world, scratching out a living amid the particular charms of their outpost.At the end of his travels, Winchester ponders the recent handling of the Outposts and their eventual fates. His lingering reverence for Britain's Imperial days competes with his evident distaste for London's indifference for the present. His thoughtful final recommendation is that London release those outposts who wish to go their own way, while integrating and properly caring for those who wish to stay British.This book is a fascinating and enjoyable if dated travelogue that will be of interest to fans of obscure geography and to students of British history who wonder whatever became of the ruins of Empire."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"Another one of Simon Winchester's interesting travelogues. Very eloquent and entertaining. Well researched with only a few dull moments. As a result is excellent for long cross-country drives. The only negative (and hence 4 out of 5 stars) is the fact that the book is a bit dated. When Winchester took his trips to these former colonies of the crown it was back in the 1980s. As a result, obviously, much has changed."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"In 1914, the globe was spanned by the British Empire, on which the sun truly never set. As a boy, I collected stamps, and I was in awe of the number of faraway and exotic places that featured the likeness of the British monarch on their issues. It was, perhaps, these colorful bits of paper, along with the tales of Robin Hood, Richard the Lionheart, and King Arthur that engendered in me a lasting love for and fascination with Great Britain. I've visited the mother island on more than a dozen occasions; I long to be there now. Simon Winchester's OUTPOSTS took me in a different direction - outward to the last vestiges of Empire.British Indian Ocean Territory, Tristan da Cunha, Gibraltar, Ascension Island, St. Helena, Hong Kong, Bermuda, Turks and Caicos Islands, the British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, Montserrat, the Cayman Islands, the Falkland Islands, and the Pitcairn Islands. These, minus Hong Kong - OUTPOSTS was published in 1985 - are now all that are left of the once proud imperial possessions. Simon visited them over a three year period, except the inaccessible Pitcairn, and tells us about his odyssey in this sterling travel narrative.Winchester, a Brit himself, is ambiguous about the Empire. On one hand, he apparently feels that the Crown's dominions, protectorates, trustee states, mandated territories and colonies were better left to go their separate ways, if only for the sake of political correctness. On the other hand, he maintains that, of all the European colonial empires, Britain's was the one administered with the greatest degree of good intentions. And, Simon isn't above becoming sentimental, as on Tristan da Cunha, a dependency of St. Helena, during a visit by the Colonial Governor:\\"A bugle was blown, a banner was raised, a salute was made, an anthem was played - and the Colonial Governor of St. Helena was formally welcomed on to the tiniest and loneliest dependency in the remnant British Empire. I found I was watching it through a strange golden haze, which cleared if I wiped my eyes with the back of my hand: the children looked so proud, so eager to please, so keen to touch the hand from England, from the wellspring of their official existence.\\"The volume contains a rudimentary map of each colony visited, but no photographs - a deplorable deficiency in any travel essay, I think. I had to go onto the Web to satisfy my curiosity for visuals; the Tristan de Cunha, St.Helena, and Falkland Islands websites are particularly helpful in this regard.OUTPOSTS is, of course, dated; Hong Kong has long since reverted to the mandarins in Beijing. Luckily, I was able to visit the place in 1994 when it was still a jewel in the British crown. Oddly, the chapter on HK is surprisingly short considering the size and importance of the place at the time the book was written. Winchester didn't even mention one of the best E-rides in the world, the short Star Ferry trip from Kowloon to Hong Kong Island.One of the best reasons to read OUTPOSTS, if your interested in the subject, is the author's brief, chatty history of each colony. And then there's the occasional trivia. Did you know, for example, that during the Falkland Islands War a team of Argentine frogman arrived in Spain with plans to blow up Royal Navy ships anchored off Gibraltar? They were arrested by the Spanish police on a tip from British Intelligence. And, do you know the location of the only land border between Holland and France? It's not where you might think.OUTPOSTS grandly took me to places I shall likely never visit, and I'm indebted to Winchester for that."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"If you are interested in British colonies as they are today, now known as Overseas Territories or Dependencies, there is no better book than Outposts. I bought this while in Bermuda for beachreading, and blasted through it in 2 days. Winchester gives you a feel for the lives of the islanders, and just how much influence the British government has left over the way they govern and police themselves. Some of the &quot;forgotten lands&quot; he visited and discusses include St. Helena (of Napoleon fame), Tristan de Cunha (between Africa and South America), Diego Garcia (Indian Ocean), Gibraltar, Bermuda and all of the British West Indies. Humorous, insightful - just a great way to see and feel what remains of the Empire without actually going there if you can't afford it."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"Simon Winchester writes about his journeys to most of Britain's remaining overseas colonies, from Gibraltar to the Falklands to the military-dominated British Indian Ocean Territory.The early chapters (his experiences being forced to journey from Spain to Gibraltar by way of Tangier, his attempted invasion of Diego Garcia in the B.I.O.T, his journey to Tristan da Cunha) are clearly the best. As for the Falklands chapter, it is interesting because he was on the islands at the time of the Argentine invasion, and I wish he had written some more about that. He also treks to Bermuda, St. Helena, Ascension, the Caymans, the Turks and Caicos, and the B.V.I., and makes them live for us, as well as Hong Kong.Why Hong Kong? Wasn't that given back to China? Yes, in 1997, but these journeys by Mr. Winchester took place in the early 1980's. They are all rather interesting, but I would have hoped for an update in the new edition of this book (as well as a chapter on Pitcairn Island, which he had not been able to reach by the time Outposts was originally published, but subsequently reached). Instead, what we get is a new introduction, which does tell us of his exile from Tristan da Cunha (he isn't permitted to land there due to islanders' resentment over what he wrote) and brief updates on some of the other islands (such as the St. Helena islanders' successful quest for full British citizenship).Recommended, but with the 20-plus years, getting a bit dated. Could use a good rewrite and updating."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"Having visited some of the far-flung places mentioned in Outposts, I was really floored by Winchester's style and prose: he really brings these remote islands alive, and tells a very readable, factual yet humorous tale of the inhabitants of Britain's remaining colonies, their lives and the daily issues they face.Brilliantly written and extremely captivating, even those without an apparent interest in the subject would be moved by this book. I think it would at least further their curiosity in these remote patriots and their daily trials on such remote outcrops.Harry Ritchie writes on a similar line in his book The Last Pink Bits, yet his research is noticeably less than Winchester's, by far. His tone at the start even appears one of mild annoyance at having to travel the world on the subject (surely his own idea?!) to the extent that I actually wondered why he bothered. New-found UK celebrity Ben Fogle also attempts a work entitled The Teatime Islands, and although a brave attempt at starting his writing career, I think he should stick to presenting daytime television.Outposts is an extremely well-leafed book in my collection, which I keep revisiting. I cannot recommend it highly enough for those interested in travel, days of empire and island life."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"In the early years of his career as a journalist, Simon Winchester hatched the rather ambitious idea of touring the globe to visit the far-flung remains of the rapidly dwindling and little known remnants of the British Empire. Although the sun still does not set on what little remains of these imperial holdings, Winchester recognized that this was a tenuous political situation unlikely to last for too many more years. He felt that there was a moving, fascinating and important story to be told of these vastly separated, profoundly isolated and mostly forgotten specks of land that reflected on Britain's somewhat tarnished past glories and conquests.I'll admit this is a personal opinion (and you may well disagree) but I'd suggest that any fool with sufficient motivation and desire can complete the research and develop the information necessary to write a non-fiction book. But it is only a very special and exceptionally talented author who can write non-fiction in such a fashion as to turn that book into a compelling page-turner that reads like a novel and holds a reader's interest with the grip of the most exciting thrillers. Like Bill Bryson or Canada's Pierre Berton and Ken McGoogan, Simon Winchester is one of those authors with the ability to vault over that rather daunting bar.Blending history, geography, biology, geology, sociology, linguistics and anthropology into a positively delicious cocktail, Winchester tells us the stories of such little known imperial tidbits as Tristan da Cunha, St Helena, Pitcairn Island, the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Ascension and BIOT (the British Indian Ocean Territory). While he is clearly a Brit to his very toes and positively wallows in his love of British tradition and custom from cricket to high tea, he certainly doesn't shrink from chastising his own government for imperial high-handedness and political shenanigans. For example, he clearly suggests that white supremacist racism may be the underlying reason that the residents of St Helena are not accorded the right to emigrate to England as full citizens? What were the secret political deals that were made with the US military when the residents of Diego Garcia in the BIOT were summarily evicted from their homes?Having been written in the early 1980s, \\"Outposts\\" is clearly outdated but it is nevertheless immensely entertaining and informative. Simon Winchester ranks high on my list of authors that (at least for now) I'll buy without reference to anyone else's reviews. Yes, he is that good!Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"Simon Winchester is an interesting guy. Like Scott Turow, he wanted to be a writer when he was young, but was pushed into something else instead. In Turow's case he became a lawyer; Winchester became a geologist. After working for twenty years as a geologist, he took up writing and has worked at it for the last twenty or twenty-five years. He writes on various non-fiction topics, some of them rather unusual, including the writing of the Oxford English Dictionary, the explosion of Krakatoa, and the San Francisco Earthquake. The current book is a recounting of several years during the late 70s and early 80s when the author worked as a journalist, and contrived to visit all of the inhabited remnants of the British Empire, save the smallest.Winchester is a gifted writer, and he recreates his visits to each of these \\"outposts\\" with the British eccentricity and humor you'd expect from a good writer in this genre. He wouldn't be British if he didn't express some huffy disapproval at the way the British government depopulated the island of Diego Garcia and then leased it to the US Armed forces. At various points the places he describes come off as wonderfully British and yet colonial, that zany combination of efficiency and nonsensical tradition that pervades everything the British did when they were overseas.I generally enjoyed this book, and would recommend it. It is a bit dated, and some of the predictions haven't come true: for instance, the author predicts that Pitcairn Island will be depopulated by the end of the century, and of course there are still people there. The author makes recommendations as to how the islands should be administered in the future as part of Great Britain, which of course are of little interest to someone who isn't British.Given the shortcomings recounted above, this is a good book and rather fun. I enjoyed it, and would recommend it."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"This is an intriguing book of a journey to the remnants of what remains of the British Empire, about 30 years ago. Beginning seemingly out of curiosity sake, the book is a travelogue of over a 100,000 miles to the edges of the inhabited earth. Unfortunately, some of the writing is now dated, and unfortunately for the residents of these far flung minor colonies, many of the concerns about them have not been addressed.Winchester, a British writer and journalist, living in New England, undertook a journey 30 years ago to places even most Britons are unaware of: Tristan de Cunha, Ascension, Anguilla, B.I.O.T along with well known outposts like Gibraltar and the Falklands. Winchester does write with a sense of sadness about his journey's, particularly in some of the more distant locations that exist in an almost rejected state from the British government and people.His strongest writing is early, particularly his journeys to the B.I.O.T, and his favorite island, St. Helena. The chapter on Hong Kong, now nearly 15 years since that outpost was devolved to the PRC, is the weakest. Winchester was present on the Falklands in 1982 when the Argentineans overran that far away land, home to many more sheep than people.In the edition I have read, Winchester has only added a new introduction. It would be wonderful to have this work updated with how these distant lands have changed. How has the B.I.O.T changed since the Iraq & Afghanistan Wars, how has life changed for the Falklanders, a generation since the war, and how has life changed for many of the remaining colonists since they have a more full fledged citizenship.As a travelogue and history of the edges of the world, to little places with perfectly formed English villages 8,000 miles from the Queen, whose portrait hangs above so many mantles, this is a fascinating story to places most of us will never travel to. Again, it can stand to be updated."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"If you like history and travel literature, then this is the book for you.Simon Winchester travels to some of the smallest and most obscure places on the earth, and gives fresh insight other more well known places such as Hong Kong.And you will learn some really interesting stuff, like that there are some islands (well rocks in the pacific really), that are classified by the British government as Navel ships, and are named as such.You will definately want to grab an atlas after reading this."},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"well.... as usual.... winchester's style of writing is exciting and enthralling... outposts focuses on the remaining British outposts... remenants of the British Empire... the author brings us on a journey to these remote places and vividly describes geographic, cultural and a bit of history of these outposts.... it was an enjoyable and memorable read.... if you're interested in history, geography and remote islands then i believe you will find this book interesting!!!"},{"Title":"Outposts","review":"A humorous account of the author's travels circa 1983 to the remaining possessions of the British Empire, almost all of which are isolated islands.

BE VERY CAUTIOUS! I found many errors in measurments in this book, which can cost you valuable paper and time! This book can be very vague about what size your papers should be and exactly how much of it you need. If you simply rely on what the author says, you may find yourself frustrated with a project that didn't work out.Other than that, there are some nice inspirational pictures in the book, but I don't know if that justifies the purchase.

For my money and that of the Federal reserve, Joanna Scott is one of the brightest lights of contemporary American fiction. So bright you'll need sunglasses to read her stuff. Her fictional world distiles imagery, grace and language 99% of writers would kill for. The other 1% would sell their moms and aunts ( or at least lease them ) for it. The Manikin is her best yet and simply one of the best novels I've read in years and years, and I've read plenty. This a book for those who love to read, who relish the magic and the music in the language, who want to plunge into a wonderful world of mystery and narrative alchemy. The Manikin works as gothic mystery, as historical romance, as a meditation on lost innocence and life and as a soul tonic for those in need of great literature and greater fun... The prose itself is dynamite stuff that will elevate your life and brain tone faster than a pint of Ben&amp;Jerry's. Don't deny yourself the extraordinary experience of reading this book or this author. Do it just for the fun and the pleasure of indulging in such a fascinating and engrossing read. As you read the last sentence, you'll rush to get Ms.Scott's other books because, by then, you'll be addicted to one of the premier storytellers of this generation. I am."},{"Title":"The Manikin: A Novel","review":"I cannot believe that this book has won awards. I like certain passages; Ms. Scott's imagery is often good and the &quot;mood&quot; is earthy and dark. However, overall it was disappointing. I just finished it and I could hardly wait to put it down and move onto something more interesting. Ms. Scott desperately tries to make her characters more than cardboard cutouts, but she never manages to succeed. I found myself not caring about the fate of any of these people or the house they lived in (which is really the main &quot;character&quot; of the book).The author has mastery of language but the story, like the mounted animals in the book, is merely the pretty arrangement of skin with no guts inside. No life."},{"Title":"The Manikin: A Novel","review":"I was eager to read this book because it's set in a part of the world (upstate NY) where I spend a lot of time and it exactly the kind of neo-Gothic tale I usually love. She has talent, it's undeniable, but Scott is far too enchanted with her own writing to tell a decent story. Every time I found myself beginning to be captivated by the narrative or the chatacters, I'd stumble across a highly polished, self-conscious set-piece of prose that screamed &quot;HEY! Look at me...don't I write well?!&quot; After a second attempt to finish this book I am giving up on it and moving on."},{"Title":"The Manikin: A Novel","review":"This is a wonderful Victorian-style novel about a manor house, its mistress, and her domestics. Wonderful that is, until the middle of the story. The author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story.

The unknown author of this book is an absolute master and paints a veritable fresco in the readers mind ....'Norah' is a story within a story of a young girl in a convent being induced into sins of the flesh by the chaplain and the mother superior.

It is a take-off on the utopia theme and not his first one on it, the earlier one being 'The Brave New World'. His 'The Brave New World' was a brilliant trenchant satire, written on the premise that the human race has only two alternatives viz. being either insane or lunatic. 'The Brave New World' was a fantasy fable. 'Island' published in 1962, 30 years after 'Brave New World' was written by a much mellowed Huxley. Huxley's premise had changed from the earlier one. He believed that humanity had a third choice, of being sane. 'Island' is no satire, less fable like, the socio-political, economic system exposited in it is less fable like, and though might seem very difficult to realize, is not impossible if we all manage to be sane!Pala is a tiny (fable) island in the Indian Ocean, where it's small community has made the best of western and eastern worlds. The inhabitants are basically Shivaite-Buddhists. They have adopted the western technology but not to the extent that the technology becomes dehumanizing and prevents them being full human beings. They have steered clear of the three pillars of the western prosperity:- armaments, universal debt and planned obsolescence. They have of course their tradition of empathy for all the living beings, their respect for the environment, habitat and the practice of their traditional mind science. The Community believes that God is immanent, man is potentially transcendent. The island's enlightened community have attempted the enormous folly of trying to make a marriage between Hell and Heaven and succeeded at it. They have blended their tradition with western technology in a perfect synthesis. Rather, one of their prime credo is making the best of all the worlds.The book opens in a dramatic fashion. An English journalist on a secret mission to push the Oil interests of his tycoon boss is regaining consciousness an early morning on the fable island Pala. He had the previous afternoon procured a boat at the neighboring island (a separate country) and planned to sail into the Pala harbor. Unfortunately, he gets caught in a squall. Instead of sailing into the Pala harbor, he is washed ashore the wrong side of the Island with steep hills to be negotiated to reach habitation. Even as he is descending in the failing light of dusk, negotiating the slippery rain washed rocks, he espies snakes (not necessarily venomous) slithering around. Probably finding live snakes around for the first time in his life, he panics, loses hold and falls. Fortunately for him, this fall to the ground is cushioned by an obstructing tree. Still badly bruised, shaken and utterly terrified he loses consciousness.

I do agree that Huxley's &quot;Island&quot; has some faults, which may be keeping a lot of people from reading this book. But how I was happy imaging the Pala paradise on Earth! Paradise in a strict human sense, but a world so promissing and inspiring, the final thoughts of this great human being. The perfect last book and some gorgeous reading. Delightful!"},{"Title":"Island","review":"One of the best books I have read is Aldous Huxley's 'Island'. It is a take-off on the utopia theme and not his first one on it, the earlier one being 'The Brave New World'. His 'The Brave New World' was a brilliant trenchant satire, written on the premise that the human race has only two alternatives viz. being either insane or lunatic. 'The Brave New World' was a fantasy fable. 'Island' published in 1962, 30 years after 'Brave New World' was written by a much mellowed Huxley. Huxley's premise had changed from the earlier one. He believed that humanity had a third choice, of being sane. 'Island' is no satire, less fable like, the socio-political, economic system exposited in it is less fable like, and though might seem very difficult to realize, is not impossible if we all manage to be sane!Pala is a tiny (fable) island in the Indian Ocean, where it's small community has made the best of western and eastern worlds. The inhabitants are basically Shivaite-Buddhists. They have adopted the western technology but not to the extent that the technology becomes dehumanizing and prevents them being full human beings. They have steered clear of the three pillars of the western prosperity:- armaments, universal debt and planned obsolescence. They have of course their tradition of empathy for all the living beings, their respect for the environment, habitat and the practice of their traditional mind science. The Community believes that God is immanent, man is potentially transcendent. The island's enlightened community have attempted the enormous folly of trying to make a marriage between Hell and Heaven and succeeded at it. They have blended their tradition with western technology in a perfect synthesis. Rather, one of their prime credo is making the best of all the worlds.The book opens in a dramatic fashion. An English journalist on a secret mission to push the Oil interests of his tycoon boss is regaining consciousness an early morning on the fable island Pala. He had the previous afternoon procured a boat at the neighboring island (a separate country) and planned to sail into the Pala harbor. Unfortunately, he gets caught in a squall. Instead of sailing into the Pala harbor, he is washed ashore the wrong side of the Island with steep hills to be negotiated to reach habitation. Even as he is descending in the failing light of dusk, negotiating the slippery rain washed rocks, he espies snakes (not necessarily venomous) slithering around. Probably finding live snakes around for the first time in his life, he panics, loses hold and falls. Fortunately for him, this fall to the ground is cushioned by an obstructing tree. Still badly bruised, shaken and utterly terrified he loses consciousness. He regains consciousness the next morning with two Palanese urchins - a ten year old girl and a four year old boy- solicitously looking down upon him. The girl sends off the boy to get help. Meanwhile she feeds the famished journalist with bananas. The journalist is still carrying the phantom images of the slithering snakes though they are no more around. How the ten year old successfully administers therapy to the adult journalist to rid of the snakes crawling in his mind is one of the high points of the novel!One of the other high points in the novel: - the character Lakshmi, in last dying stages of terminal cancer is treated by her relatives.

As opposed to his novel, _A Brave New World_, this novel illustrates pure happiness. The people inhabiting the island of Pala, are truly happy. The novel also poses some excellent ideas and commentaries on our society today. Your ideas of religion, truth, faith, the human body, the mind... all are questioned. It's hard to put something this unique into words.

And once more, it shows how we intend to complicate, instead to simplify.It shows the way to a happier world, but before going global - it has to be personal.And I must insist - it is NOT utopia.

You may not feel the connection between yourself and Mr. Farnaby, but if you live in the western world it's there. Directly or indirectly we have all commited his crimes.Readers would do well to constantly question fictional truth versus literary metaphor. People on the Island bluntly explain so many concepts to Farnaby that many readers and reveiwers seem to miss key themes. I mean come on, Huxley couldn't just give you everything straight, he had to leave somthing for your post reading reflection.To all the haters, I say open you mind. Is taking a real look at your self really that offensive?If so, you just proved one of Huxley's points about ignorance."},{"Title":"Island","review":"First of all, like any utopian vision, this book lacks life. Though I think that psychedelics (entheogens) can help some people to get in touch with a larger reality, I dont think that this holds true for everyone. For instance, personal transformation and inner-conflicts were treated simplistically. I did think the dynamic between the peaceloving people of Pala and its internal greedy members as well as outsiders who wished to exploit the island rang true. Would like to give this book a better review, but I can't.Thomas Seay"},{"Title":"Island","review":"Island is heavy reading. It is basically a philosophical treatise and critique of society and history, coated with only the thinnest layer of novel-sugar. The philosophy is Huxley's report of mysticism and some psychology serves to back this up, as does the sociology, which also strongly criticises many traditional traits of Western and modern society and history. Pala is heralded as the utopian solution to this, though eventually is overrun by the forces of Western society.I think it is underrated because, as I've said, it is considered a novel. It must have been hard, because Huxley couldn't have just left it without this 'novel-ness', yet to give too much emphasis on entertainment would presumably have detracted from both the intention and the meaning. In this light actually, it is a finely balanced book: a platform for this great writer and thinker to express his ideas and opinions that must've been brewing for quite a while. Unfortunately some come off as rants, for example Christianity, particularly its more extreme varieties; but of course one must consider this was published about 50 years ago, and it would have been more dominant than the (increasingly) small part Christianity plays in Europe (at least in terms of the suffering it inflicts)."},{"Title":"Island","review":"A good book that touches on lots of theory that some may enjoy and others may find a bit too unrealistic. I enjoyed the the concept of the book and at times, it had me wishing Huxley owned an island like it. If your even remotely interested in this book, then read it knowing you won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Island","review":"There are plot driven novels, and there are not so plot driven novels. Island falls whole-heartedly into the latter category. Will Farnaby a reporter with ulterior motives finds himself stranded on the tropical island of Pala. The readers' learn the religio-socio-philosophical engine that drives Pala as Will does. It is a utopian society formed around sensuality, and mind enlightening drugs.This novel is a philosophical treatise in disguise. It is a worthy tract comparable (as some here have I believe) to Candide and Gullivers Travels (but on acid.) The prose is very lucid in parts, yet also a little wacky(not most literate term but nothing else is coming to mind) at times. I could picture Huxley ingesting his muse opening the doors of perception and writing furiously. In fact I admit I have not braved the new world, but have read Huxley's THE DOORS OF PERCEPTION/HEAVEN AND HELL and enjoyed that more mainly because it didn't wear the disguise of a work of fiction. This is a fine satirical commentary on the human condition and would have rated four stars from me if the ideas expressed were not recycled in some cases from DOORS OF PERCEPTION."},{"Title":"Island","review":"Being Huxley's last novel I was skeptical when I picked it up. Certainly I had no reason to be. Huxley was in top form writing Island. If you are looking for a blueprint for a harmonious life look no further. Huxley lays out a true Utopia and once again proves it could never be. Fortunately for us, he brings to light concepts for child raising and general peaceful living. One can certainly learn from this modern masterpiece. The plot is just as enjoyable as the underlying message. A secluded island, a shipwrecked spy, a changed man, and the inevitable corruption of Utopia. Huxley has spared nothing with this one. Island is a definate must read."},{"Title":"Island","review":"In this book, Huxley shares with us his view of the perfect society throught the eyes of an English cynic. In true Huxley fashion, we see a utopian world on the brink of destruction by the self-important west. It's a haunting views into Huxley's thoughts on perfecting and destructing society. It is best to read this book with an understanding of Indian religion, and the semantics involved with it, as Huxley uses a lot of Hindu and Buddhist jargon to describe his society. This is a must read for any Huxley fan."},{"Title":"Island","review":"This book is wonderful but probably in a different way than many people think. Huxley wrote this the year before he died. And in a letter his wife wrote shortly after his death she says that Huxley was appaled that people didn't take it serious. His entire lifes wisdom was summed up in island. The seemingly slow moving plotline and the somewhat underdeveloped characters are not flaws they are fully intentional. This was done so that the attention of the reader would lean more towards the palanese way of life and less towards the things going on. He has a strong point when it comes to eastern philosophy being concerned with what works, and western with what is real. And the issue of psychedelics was nicely addressed. Some parts did get a little cheesy but that's understandable because he was such an emotional man. He also recycles alot of words but this doesn't bother me because it is such a beautiful book. Island is so much better than BNW. You should read it..."},{"Title":"Island","review":"Huxley's final novel is testament to an interesting and rather brilliant man. It will forever, no matter what, lie in the shadows of Huxley's excellent \\"Brave New World\\" and will always be just another book by Huxley, read only by those seeking Huxley's clever spark once again. People such as myself.\\"Island\\" is, ultimately, a sign of Huxley as a writer. The plot is virtually nonexistent (not too unlike the amusing \\"Point Counterpoint\\" in that respect) and the writing is at times dull. But just as Huxley falls in some of the usual traps, he shines in others. The book is amazingly interesting, whether you agree with the philosophy or not. There's a clever, sneaky sort of irony to the entire book, one that is not undermined by the curious blandness of the novel as well. It's got one of the strangest views of society I've encountered in my life, a book-within-a-book that's pretty boring (similar to \\"1984\\"), and a number of scenes so curiously written that just about every reader will set the book down to scratch their head.It's the Huxley conundrum, really. On the one hand, the book is intelligent, amusing in its irony, and provides plenty of food for thought. On the other hand, it can get amazingly dull. The story actually bogs down at some point, but picks up again soon after. It's an uneven book, sporting both superb writing in its descriptions and choppy writing in the flow and the overall intrigue of the novel.Ultimately, it's interesting for its points, less so for its writing. Huxley is as clever and thought-provoking as ever, but those coming from \\"Brave New World\\" may find themselves disappointed by somewhat dull writing and a barely existent plot. Still, it provides plenty of food for thought - just see if the tradeoff is worth it."},{"Title":"Island","review":"First of all, like any utopian vision, this book lacks life.

It is a philosophy and more than anything it is a book about hope, about what we as humans can achieve with just the right viewpoint. Those who liked BNW may not find this as enjoyable though, for the overall message is possitive and less sardonic (probably why it wasn't as successful!). But if you aren't afraid to think, this book is a true pleasure to experience."},{"Title":"Island","review":"I liked it a lot. &#34;There is no fear where love exists. Rather, perfect love banishes fear, for fear involves punishment, and the person who lives in fear has not been perfected in love.&#34; 1 John 4:18"},{"Title":"Island","review":"If you judge this book solely on its literary merit, you will be disappointed. There isn't much of a plot here, and characterization lacks adequate depth. If on the other hand, you regard this novel as a way to frame a whole set of ideas, you'll be greatly rewarded. Along with Thomas Mann, Huxley is perhaps the most intelligent and well rounded man in the world of 20th century literature, and this work is a culmination of a lifetime of thought about society, science, and the relationship between them. Huxley was a man who actually cared about humankind, and in this book he tells us what it would take to create a perfect society. He seems to have taken great pains to stay clear of science fiction and wrote the most practical utopia he could conceive based on the scientific and technological achievements of his day. Forty years later, the world of Pala lies well within our realm of technological possibility. So why don't we build it? What Huxley indirectly shows is that even when we can do it, we are not willing to pay the price for it. In a world where the market is king, and freedom without responsibility is seen as a given, Pala looks as distant and quaint as the SF worlds of Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke. Even if Pala is not feasible on a nationwide or worldwide scale, this novel has important things to teach us as individuals. It convincingly shows how we are conditioned by our environment and upbringing to behave a certain way. If we change or overcome that conditioning our lives will be transformed, even as we are encroached by the cruel world around us. Island is sure to give food for thought for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Island","review":"Island, in my opinion is probably Aldous Huxley's best work, and also one of the best books I have ever read. For those of you interested in spirituality, this would probably be the book to get started on. It has a good way of telling you what peace and the &quot;Buddha Nature&quot; really does feel like. The book is about a utopian society on an island called Pala. Will Farnaby, 'suffering from the disease called Civilization', lands on the island, in the hope of getting the bid for a lucrative oil contract, but the more of the island he sees, the more he realizes that the island must be saved from civilization at all costs. To say more would be to spoil the story for those of you who have not read it. Needless to say, I liked this book a lot more than I liked Brave New World, or any of his other books. I feel that this was his most pointed attack on our way of life. It can be read and re-read a million times. The ideas contained in it are really refreshing, so refreshing and original that I'm still trying to come up with well founded criticisms. This book is well worth the price, now if only there were more authors who could write like this."},{"Title":"Island","review":"I found this book lying in a closed dusty box in the basement where all of my dad's old books are. I had heard tons about The Doors of Perception so decided to give this one a try. If I say that this book changed by whole life it would be saying too much. But if definitely makes me wonder why we, the entire human race, are rotting away to glory when a &quot;formula&quot; for better and more fulfilling way to live is out there for us to take. It's in this very book. After reading this book I doubt there would be anybody who would not question the existing, decadent values and morals that bind us all. What a perfect mixture of eastern and western wisdom! I really recommend that this book should be a part of the curriculum in schools throughout the world. Oh ya the part about the mushrooms in that temple as part of the initiation process and the accompanying Shiva Vedic chants...it really can be the most awesome out of body experience you can have. Trust me I am from India. Bottom Line: Go read it and ask everyone you know to read it too. Spread the message and who knows maybe one day we could all experience Huxley's Utopia."},{"Title":"Island","review":"This is the work of a social planner - and not the kind that coordinates seating arrangements and makes out guest lists. The culmination of several explorations in cultural engineering, Island is a how-to book describing the requisite customs, attitudes, and institutions for a society devoted to the positive development and individuation of its citizens.In this book Huxley subverts all the conventional storytelling devices to make his points. Plot and characterization really are afterthoughts here unless they assist in some way to get an idea across. All the relevant conclusions that have been carefully and thoughtfully arrived at over an entire lifetime are given airing here mostly in awkward asides. Huxley is reaching the end of his life, and there's an urgency in the prose that resembles a harangue. But if we recall the ambitious intention here - to lay out a blueprint for a society truly dedicated to individual liberty and liberation - it seems inane to complain about the lack of conventional storytelling devices.In this book we can see that Huxley has done all the heavy lifting long before the hippies came on the scene and turned drug-taking into a recreational activity - invalidating drug use for any other purpose in the minds of a majority of people. Many of these same people now seek to invalidate Huxley's crowning achievement because the writing can't be enjoyed as an escapist, recreational activity. This paradox is the result of an all-too-human tendency to manipulate facts and use them to argue against any idea that might contradict their ingrained beliefs.Of course, some will argue that their problem with Island is not that it can't be enjoyed recreationally, but that it is the leftist ravings and ramblings of a drugged-out kook. My response is that this argument is not supported by a careful consideration of the points Huxley makes. Perhaps, given more time Huxley would have polished this work into a more easily-accessible form; but that didn't keep me from appreciating it."},{"Title":"Island","review":"If you are not familiar with Huxley's other works, this book may not be the best place to start. Don't get me wrong, this book is a VERY intriguing examination of what sort of social structure would constitute a human utopia, and also of the sorts of human attitudes that tend to prevent this utopia from coming about. Taken as a work of philosophy, it is a definite winner.This book has a story, complete with characters, motivations, and plot. However, the story is quite thin, and serves largely as a hypothetical background setting for the illustration of some of Huxley's reflections on human nature. The story is not exactly gripping, and won't provide the sort of entertainment value that some may want.This book is written, in my opinion, for people who are familiar with the study of philosophy. Philosophers always tend to be a bit long-winded, and frequently make use of analogies (complete with characters and plots) to try to illustrate a lofty and perhaps complicated point. In this book, the characters (and the narrator) spend the vast majority of their time in the exact sorts of long-winded speeches one would expect from a philosopher.If you are expecting another \\"Brave New World,\\" you will be disappointed. If, however, you just want to have your imagination stimulated, and to provide yourself with food for thought, then I whole-heartedly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Island","review":"I first read this book when I was 15, and it had a profound and lasting influence on my life. Rereading it now, more than twenty years later, I still find it moving.The characters in this book are a bit too good to be true: nobody is that well-balanced, that reasonable, that much in touch with themselves. And yet, when you read this book, you can't help feeling that people could be that well-balanced, could be that reasonable, could be that much in touch with themselves and with others if only they were given the chance, if only they were given the right sort of upbringing.I can never decide whether this book is optimistic or pessimistic in its view of life. A little of both, I think. Huxley's optimism about human nature and the human spirit shines through, but it's tinged with a feeling of disappointment and concern for the future.Read it. It's not some New Age psycho-babble crap. It may not be your cup of tea, but it's definitely worth the time it takes to read it and to think about what it's saying."},{"Title":"Island","review":"It is a fitting tribute to the great thinker that his last novel was his best and it gave him a lasting legacy to honor, as I see it, his long lived hope of a better world by presenting the human condition in all of it's fine and/or hideous attributes and motivations.A good summation of the overall picture that Huxley is painting in Island, is right on the back cover of the book although to make it more accurate, I\`ve added the missing words in the bracket: \\"A mirror in which modern man can see all that is rotten [and good] in his society and himself... Should be read and reread.\\" (Saturday Review of Literature)To emphasize the various personalities, the main characters are either protracted, conniving greedy bums or thinking, sensitive intellects; the rest are on the fence and waiting to see which way the wind blows and when presented with contrasting, colliding circumstances, which emotions will pull them in which ultimate, life altering direction?I have read this book a few times now and it is always thought provoking and engaging. Huxley's prose are flowing and captivating, leaving one with a sense of longing for an undisturbed version of Huxley's Island to move to with it's beautiful, conscious inhabitants and their intriguing, life enhancing, experimental social structure lived in a harmonious, loving and literate by choice social setting.Unfortunately, they are under siege by forces beyond their control- we think, for had Huxley lived, he might have followed this book with a sequel that ultimately had the \\"Islanders\\" triumph over their greedy, evil opposites. As it stands, we're left with an apparent sense of impending doom for the island paradise- an attempt to \\"civilize\\" it with a new, materialistic society based on competition and greed. Gee, sounds like the real world!Those who love a well crafted, moving story line will appreciate Island just for the intrigue and flow of a good novel, regardless of the socio-psychological ramifications involved.A note of interest on alternative, experimental communities is that B.F. Skinner's block-buster book, \\"Walden II\\" was possibly, as many people believe, the inspiration for Huxley\`s Island and there are many parallels in their respective story lines. Dialogue in Island mentions alternative communities such as Oneida. The famous \\"Twin Oaks Community\\" was designed around Skinner's fictional Walden II utopian farm."},{"Title":"Island","review":"My wife and I have been preparing for next year's season premiere of ABC's hit series, Lost (Lost - The Complete Fourth Season), and decided to engage in one of our \\"movie marathons\\" by watching all four seasons' prior episodes over several weeks. As part of the experience, we perused the Lost Book Club offerings (on ABC's website) and noticed that Aldous Huxley's \\"Island (Perennial Classics)was included. The connection, for those die-hard Lost fans: the \\"Others\\" use the Pala Dock Ferry to travel to/from their barracks.On seeing that online listing, I was reminded that I had read the book about a decade after it was originally published (in 1962), while I was in high school. Although most of us growing up in the 1960s were more likely to have read his more famous and successfulBrave New World; his last novel, Island is also worth a read. One of the lasting memories from the novel involved the talking parrots that inhabit Huxley's idyllic island, Pala. The parrots had been trained to remind the Palanese inhabitants to pay \\"attention\\" and to concentrate on the \\"here and now.\\" Very good advice indeed.The book can be a bit tedious at times, but I certainly enjoyed re-living the transformation of the book's cynical and corrupt main character, Will Farnaby, as he gradually comes to understand and accept the more spiritual existence he finds on the island. Through his conversations with the islanders, Farnaby learns of group upbringing of children in what are known as Mutual Adoption Clubs; special religious traditions (based on a mixture of eastern religions, primarily Buddhist); the pervasive use of mind-expanding drugs, called \\"moksha medicine;\\" tantric sexual practices; and much more.Go ahead and give it a try... whether it's your first time reading, or you're diving back in after a long absence, it's definitely worth a read.

Uncontaminated by the Western world, this island would have been an amazing place. I'm writing this review as I read the final pages of this book. However much of a clich&eacute; it is, I could not put it down, even at one AM. In the library, in my hometown, this book was classified as science fiction, but truly, it's more of a spiritual quest. The main character, Will started in the beginning of the book as a cynical, pessimistic man, but transformed drastically by the end. I think that throughout the book, I made a transformation too. If fiction can change one's life, it undoubtedly has changed mine."},{"Title":"Island","review":"Having been mentioned in my copy of St. Thomas More's \\"Utopia\\", I was anxious to read \\"Island\\". I can honestly say that Aldous Huxley's work peaked with \\"Brave New World\\". I was very disappointed with \\"Ape and Essence\\". In the same way, the plot of Island has a lot of potential which it never follows through on.In reality \\"Island\\" is not a novel, but a series of characters involved in a dialogue. Huxley uses these characters to address the ills of the world as he sees them. Among the topics addressed are spirituality, wealth/economics, and human emotions such as guilt. Much of the time seems to be focused on spirituality and Huxley's chosen faith Buddhism.The thin plot shows the main character Will Farnaby washing on the shores of the ficticious island Pala. As Will returns to health, he finds himself at the center of a conflict. The future king or raja of the island plans to modernize the simple ways of people's lives in Pala. Forces have attempted to prevent this but the future raja has taken the influence of neighboring ruler Colonel Dipa. The dialogue of the book shows the competing forces and their views of the future. In reality, there is little action until the final pages with its predictable ending.If I were giving Huxley a grade for this book, I would give him an A for the concept. Unfortunately, I would give him a D for the presentation. The book is slow, making it painful to follow at times. This work is far inferior to his masterwork Brave New World.I read the book again in November 2012. I was so unimpressed with the book the first time, I actually forgot that I read it.

These books not only share the same author but also their remarkably timely critique of the modern world, of &quot;Western philosophers- even the best of them- [who]'re nothing more than good talkers...&quot; and of &quot;unverifiable dogmas and the emotions inspired by them.&quot; While the Palanese embrace the &quot;applied metaphysics&quot; of the East, they needed a written language (English), the scientific method for improved agriculture and certain surgical practices, and other more humane parts of Western civlization (Mozart). The rest, including heavy industry, missionaries, and imperialism, they happily left behind.In this day and age of globalization, cultural homogenization, overpopulation, resource depletion, environmental degradation, and general malaise over what modernity has made us, this introduction to Buddhism, Huxley's last novel written in 1962, is as relevant as ever.Tse-Sung Wu (at c m u dot e d u)PS: Interestingly, in his recent travelogue, _To the Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia, a Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy_ (1997), Robert Kaplan writes about Rishi Valley of India (v. Ch. 23) that reads as if it were lifted straight out of _Island_. Could this be Pala in real life?"},{"Title":"Island","review":"The great thing about this book is that it shows what living in a low-carbon world could be. Granted its very idealistic, but if you have been reading theoretical books on the subject, this should give you an idea of what such a place \\"could\\" look like in practice."},{"Title":"Island","review":"I purchased this book for Christmas for a friend. It arrived 2 days after I ordered it the week of Christmas! Came brand new with a clean white, paperback cover."},{"Title":"Island","review":"Although it was his last book, I wasn't that impressed. Half the characters were depressing/vulnerable and didn't have much going on. Huxley's ideas and philosophy were in place but it just didn't mesh for me. His earlier works much better."},{"Title":"Island","review":"My main issues with the novel are that it was poorly written and Huxley utterly fails here at compelling storytelling. I could not suspend my disbelief or cynicism while reading Island at all, and I was often confused about what Huxley's point truly was.Perhaps I didn't enjoy it because the characters lecture, ramble and gloat about concepts of social engineering that are as despicable as those in Brave New World (which is a beautifully written and intricately conceived novel). Perhaps because he anniliates his own utopia, by the hands of one of its founders no less. He proves that a society such as Pala's could not exist, flourish and *survive*. He shows us in the end just how weak and fragile such a socially-engineered society would be and how easily corrupted it could become.I honestly thought it was a satire of a utopian society, like Brave New World, but attacked from the other extreme. Am I the only one who felt this?Huxley succeeds at outlining a utopian society; that much is true. Whether he actually believed in the utopia is another question entirely. The writing is so overblown and didactic that I could not discern his intent."},{"Title":"Island","review":"I think maybe Neubaten (I think that's your name) did read a different book...I thought it was excellent. The description of the society is more in depth than Brave New World but I can see how many people would find this uninteresting &quot;ramble&quot;.Someone else said that Huxley destroys his society in the last chapter - that's often what good books do. BTW, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest does almost exactly the same thing. I think the destruction of Pala was a warning of what greed is capable of and that not even a land of pure love and kindness is immune to greedy people."},{"Title":"Island","review":"I have read enough to know when I'm being preached to, and Huxley is unsuccessful in masking his assertions re: the human condition in The Island. I was very disappointed, since Huxley has the ability to write well, even about esoteric subjects (see The Perennial Philosophy, for instance), but ends up just making a hash of it here. Not highly recommended."},{"Title":"Island","review":"The synopsis of this book sounded spectacular, a conspiring journalist gets stuck on a utopian island. The book starts off kind of entertaining but with a bit of rambling but you figure as you go on, it will probably subside. It doesn't. The characters keep going on and on about buddhism, sex and mushrooms. The plot barely starts and barely ends. This is a book with no journey and no destination."},{"Title":"Island","review":"A man arrives on an Island to engineer an oil deal. He begins to like the place. It is a nice place.

Pala is the island which I've dreamt of since I was a child. It is everything I've ever wanted our society to become, but sadly I don't think that day will ever come. I could definitly see narrow-minded people not enjoying this book, as heavy criticisms are placed on Western society and Christianity. Some of the dialogues in the book seem entirely unnatural, but thats really not even an issue. Huxley merely uses the longwinded dialogues to contrast Western civilization with the island of Pala.I won't even bother compare it to Brave New World simply because the two are so different. BNW describes what Huxley feared the world would become, while Island shows us what he wished it was."},{"Title":"Island","review":"First off, as many people have pointed out, 'Island' is a complete and total failure as a novel. The plot is paper thin and the 'characterization,' such as it is, is pretty horrible. But this doesn't mean this is a bad book, or not worth reading. Hermann Hesse's last (and one of his best) book, \\"The Glass Bead Game\\" (aka \\"Magister Ludi\\") suffers from the same faults, but likewise is eminently worth reading.I wouldn't say Huxley succeeds in portraying a true utopia, but then, who ever has? Nowhere in fiction, essay, or political propaganda have I seen anyone else come even remotely close - Huxley at least borders on plausibility, and indeed, desirability (something else lacking from many 'utopian' visions). Many of the negative reviews here are by radical conservatives who find the ideas of more open sexuality, psychedelic visions and a modern updating of Eastern philosophy and contemplation anathema. Well, fair enough, I guess, but look at the world THOSE people are endeavouring (some cynics might say successfully) to build. I for one would definitely have appreciated more rock climbing, first-hand experiential evidence of 'higher things,' even if through psychedelics, and more sensitive sexual experience, during my confused youth. In fact, ultimately, I found my way to all of those things through friends, readings, and my own meandering gropings through life, but I don't feel at all that these were (or are now) encouraged by the social structure in which I live, nor by my elders. Huxley imagines a world in which this situation is reversed, and though I have some problems with his vision, I find it quite charming and desirable in many ways.Some negative reviews have poitned out how quaint and 1960's-oriented and dated many of the ideas are (to those reviewers anyway); I would argue though that many of the new ideas fermenting in the 60's have really yet to come to full fruition, and far from being dated, are in need of further dissemination.The book is heavily didactic and this can get a little annoying at times, but as always Huxley is full of insights and is worth reading. From what I understand he wrestled with this book for years trying to find a good way of conveying these notions; maybe he should have just opted for non-fiction of some kind. Still, this book is far from 'obsolete' and is Huxley's utopia very much worth considering for all those of us living in a the real-life, if toned-down, version of 'Brave New World.'"},{"Title":"Island","review":"For some reason this book is no where near as popular as Brave New World. I suppose it's because Brave New World is about our culture exagerated into the future, whereas Island is about extreme changes in our world views.Island is about looking at existence and reality from a sane perspective, and by this I mean that it puts human ends above all else. Why tolerate and perpetuate instituations and modes of thought that alienate humans from themselves, their environment and each other? This book helps point out how much of our behaviour is learned, and how much of what we consider \\"natural\\", is simply human construction.I think the best way to describe it is as John Lennon's song Imagine, in book form.I think everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Island","review":"Huxley's unique blend of utopia and appocolypse. This novel is a simultaneous blend of excitement, hope and dread. It is successful as a story because of it's compelling story line, but also important as a fresh approach to ancient wisdom. Huxley is a master of dazzling imagery, and startling conclusions. This book will make you think!"},{"Title":"Island","review":"If Brave new world is the scientific forecast of future, Island is the utopia of living based on religion and spirituality.The book is so much in contrast to Brave New World, at the same time it reflects the degradation of humanity and mankind and how the inteference of foreign elements change the course of evolution for a small island. If you felt sad after reading Brave New World, this book will bring light and hope about the future we dont know."},{"Title":"Island","review":"I finished this book two days ago and I can't stop thinking about it. I'm no slack when it comes to knowledge about Eastern philosophy--I've been to Tibet and Nepal, into the monasteries, and made blessings at Buddhist Stupas. Of all modes of thinking, Buddhism probably best captures that essential element of all religions, that mystical and ever-present aspect of the universe. I've never thought it reasonable, however, to extrapolate Buddhist thinking into a functional and at least semi-modern society. In Island, Huxley creates this--an oasis of peace and spirituality in a working society that does not contradict its own Buddhist teachings. The book sharply and blatantly contrasts life on the Island to Western society and even Eastern society and their inherent problems. It's obvious Huxley is trying to send a message, that the world does not have to be the way it is, but he explains it and gives examples of it so well that his obvious message comes through as realistic and reasonable. The end is sad, and yet hopeful, emotionally ripping, and yet you feel somewhat indifferent to this end, which is exactly what the book is trying to say--that life has ups and downs and peacefulness can only be found when one lives detached from life's vicissitudes.For all the English Lit. teachers out there, I'll be fair and say that his message is thinly disguised. It's right there out front and sometimes the book is even preachy. But, you only feel that *during* the book, and only in parts. By the time you finish though, all you can really do is say &quot;Wow,&quot; and if you really want to do the book justice, just sit there...in a silence filled with awe and redefined perceptions. One more thing--tonight, I downloaded Brandenberg Concerto #4, and I have to say, I know *exactly* what Huxley is talking about. (awed silence)"},{"Title":"Island","review":"This is truely an amazing book, Aldous Huxley was a genius. Although different from BNW in that the plot is a little slow, the ideas of society and the individual expressed in this book make it one of the most influential books that I ever read. Don't read this book to be entertained, read it to be enlightened."},{"Title":"Island","review":"In Island, Huxley takes all the devices that were used to keep a population dull and in check in his earlier novel, Brave New World, and sets them to a new purpose. Drugs are now used for enlightenment (see also Huxley's works Heaven and Hell and The Doors of Perception). Behavior modification is now for autonomy, not to control. It is a shame this book does not receive more attention, or even one percent of what its mirror image receives."},{"Title":"Island","review":"Island is an excellent novel that, even after 50 years, remains relevant because the story line resonates in terms of how we humans consistently, perhaps not consciously, but most assuredly, and maybe even inevitably, undermine the foundations of utopia through our daily actions, decisions and attitudes."},{"Title":"Island","review":"\\"Attention!\\" cries the talking bird at the end of the book when tiny Pala, the island utopia its inhabitants have tried so diligently to perfect and stay apart from the world, is finally overrun via military intervention and a sellout within. The references to the birds, probably mynas or macaws in a tropical setting, screeching this admonition occurs throughout the plot and usually occurs as part of spiritual exhortations. But it was this final exhortation that woke me up at the end of the book, at the culmination of the final chapter which is one of the most beautifully written conclusions I have ever read. It was as if Huxley was saying to the reader \\"wake up!!!\\" before our own personal island, i.e. ourselves, our souls, our identities, etc. are overtaken by a ravenous and consuming outside world.This is what I take Island to really mean: as a metaphor for the person as individual. We each are islands in the vast ocean of life; we should take very good care of ourselves and intentionally preserve and enhance our freedom, morality, spirituality and our autonomy lest we be consumed and overrun, a la Pala, by an uncaring, spirituality bankrupt and pillaging world without. Some reviews have suggested Pala as Huxley's depiction of a utopia counterposed against Brave New World. That is all well and good but, in the end, the utopia of Pala doesn't make it either. I believe Huxley was too cynical and suspicious of modern life to ever suspect a utopia could long survive en masse. What he did promote, in various forms of expression, was a profound concern for individual freedom in a world populated by tyranny, totalitarian forces in varous shapes and mass market commercialism collectively sucking all the vitality and beauty out of human existence.Huxley was a great humanist and proponent of extending human freedom and potential wherever possible and combating any force arrayed against that effort. He early on experimented with drugs as a means, I believe, of expanding human experience and expression. In many respects he was the precursor to Timothy Leary and the LSD movement, the hippie generation, the New Agers, the green movement in general and other groups concerned with the human condition arrayed against tyranny, dogmatism and capitalism run amok. Island is the literary culmination of his lifelong work and is a profound, astute and deeply mystical book. Easily one of the best I have ever read.It is little noted that Huxley, prior to his serious writing career and Brave New World, once taught French to English schoolboys. One of his students was none other than Eric Blair, aka George Orwell, the future author of 1984. It is one of the great ironies of modern life that one English classroom could have housed at one time the two great geniuses of the twentieth century, in terms of political satire, whose combined dystopias portrayed a future world so nightmarish and inhumane that it jolted humankind into thought and action, providing inestible service. Did Huxley inspire Orwell in his thought at that early stage or with Brave New World later? Who knows, nonetheless Huxley was a magnificent thinker and profoundly influential figure of the twentieth century. His Island, equal to Brave New World in my opinion, fittingly crowns his eventful life prior to his death a year later.Other reviewers have more than adequately summarized the plot. For me, the talking birds say it all."},{"Title":"Island","review":"This is a \\"thought-provoking\\" book in the extreme - ten years after reading it, it still occassionally pops into my mind and elicits fresh insights. If Huxley's Brave New World were a rye whiskey, this would be a fine 12 year old scotch in comparison. The prose is that much more refined and the thoughts that much more profound."},{"Title":"Island","review":"I really didn't enjoy reading this book as much as I had hoped. The whole plot is essentially used as a device for Huxley to give his ideas about what a sustainable society might look like. Although I find Huxley to be a very good writer, this book was a little to authoritarian and condescending for me to enjoy. But, if you have ever read books that highlighted alot of problems, but never seem to give solutions, this is a good book to read. Many of the problems Huxley see's in modern society are brought forth with real answers applied to them. I have to admit that alot of his proposed solutions were very interesting and a breath of fresh air."},{"Title":"Island","review":"I recently finished this book by Aldous Huxley.It was written near the end of his life in the early 1960's, and it is filled with philosophy popular at the time or soon after - free love/sex, mind expanding drugs, Eastern philospohy, etc. etc. These points of view were brought forth within a story about a utopian island in Asia.I had looked forward to reading this book from what I had heard about it. I was somewhat disappointed. There was very little story and a lot of preaching about how bad/wrong the \\"West\\" is about everything and how sex, drugs and Buddha could save mankind. If you ask me, Buddha might save the world, but I doubt if this would happen in the preachy way of this book.No, I did not care very much for the book. The ending was not even a happy one.The one positive thing I can say is that I do think I really got the concept of \\"not-thought\\" at one point in reading this book. That has value. It is along the lines of another book recently out, THE POWER OF NOW; I think that ISLAND is specifically mentioned in it."},{"Title":"Island","review":"I was a fan of \\"Brave New World\\" as well as Huxley himself and without hesitation picked up this enlightening book. I believe this book invokes numerous topics of discussion be it politics, capitalism, individuality, spirituality, etc. I personally feel out of all those components I listed above Huxley emphasizes the concept of spirituality, particularly Buddhist philosophies. I believe Will Faranby was both a protagonist and a antagonist, but thats open to interpretation. Huxley wrote this book giving the reader an opportunity to see how spirituality shapes and impacts a persons perception of him/herself (the being) and the world. The book centered around the progression of Will Faranby's introspective of consciousness. Huxley incorporated hallucinogenics aka moksha-medicine as being totally appropriate and relevant to the characters development, thus solidifying Farnaby's introspective of himself. In essence, the moksha-medicine was an eye-opening, yet intense experience that ultimately gave the main character a deeper awareness to the world and his own personal existence (the being)."},{"Title":"Island","review":"IslandAldous Huxley354 pages13.95ISBN 0-06-008549-5HarperCollins BooksI was browsing around Borders, looking for a book to get for this personal reading assignment when Island by Aldous Huxley caught my eye. I assumed from its title and cover that it was some type of survival book about a group of people stranded on an island, struggling to make a fire and to get some food. However, I was completely wrong. Island is actually a book about Huxley's idea of perfect society. This isolated island in the story called Pala, receives only limited outside influence, making all of its unique culture possible. The story begins when Journalist Will Farnaby crashes his sailboat and washes up on the island's shore. Throughout the story Will learns all about this unique society, while Huxley articulates his view about human nature and the possibility of a utopia.When Will arrives on the island he's confused and upset, not only at himself but also at the world. However, as he sees more and more of this unique society during his stay in Pala, he discovers a lot about himself. This completely changes his outlook on life, \\"revolutionizes all his values and - to his amazement - gives him hope.\\" While the reader learns about Pala, the existence of its unique philosophy, customs and policies are being threatened. Its soon-to-be-leader Murugan plans to change Pala entirely. Like his idol Colonel Dipa, military dictator of a nearby country, Murugan has an obsession for power. He wants Pala to be an industrial, strong and powerful country. This means he aims to build up a huge army, sell Pala's oil reserves and modernize the island completely.Huxley does a great job developing characters which helps support his theme about the complexity of human nature. And while explaining how this utopian society functions, Huxley raises some interesting points that make you re-think our surprisingly twisted way of life. Though it's not difficult to read, there are a fair amount of long dull parts, so I don't recommend it to those who want an exciting story. The New York Times book Review stated that, \\"In this book, Mr. Huxley has said his final word about the possibility of the good society. Island challenges the political scientist, the psychologist, the philosopher, and the theologian.\\" I agree, in that it's a good book for people interested in this subject, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."},{"Title":"Island","review":"If I had to go to a deserted Island and could take one book with me, this would be it.

Set on a tropical island and told from the point of view of a jaded journalist secretly helping an oil company interested in concessions, it explores Buddhist religion and possible alternatives to our lifestyle. No great revelations, but then, noone has the answers. A good read for Huxley fans and people who enjoy utopian stories"},{"Title":"Island","review":"OK, let's for a moment disregard the Robinson Crusoe-like opening where the hero, a reporter named William Asquith Farnaby, is discovered by two children lying injured on a deserted beach of the mystical, forbidden island of Pala, located somewhere in Indonesia or Micronesia (perhaps a wordplay on the real island of Palau?). Let's also forget that the hero's seemingly inadvertent arrival in Pala happily coincides with his robber baron boss Joe Aldehyde's intentions that Farnaby visit Pala for reasons having to do with giving Aldehyde's companies access to the island's reputedly rich but untapped oil supply. What are we left with?In Aldous Huxley's last published novel, he returned to the notion of creating his own (micro-) world. Unlike the futuristic nightmare of BRAVE NEW WORLD, however, Huxley's Pala is a veritable nirvana. For over 120 years, Pala has largely closed itself off to the outside world and developed its own form of ideal society. Pala is characterized by free love, communal child-raising, shared manual labor, an educational system based in part on Zen Buddhist principles, adoption of technology only where the essential needs and benefits vastly outweigh the costs, and consciousness-raising through hallucinogenic drugs. A certain amount of religious mysticism has also held sway, particularly as regards the afterlife.Now, at the time of Farnaby's oddly convenient arrival, Pala's peaceful calm is threatened from within and without. From within, the prince and future ruler Murugan favors modernization, exploitation of Pala's oil resources, and crass materialism (represented by a Sears, Roebuck catalog over which he salivates like a teenager with his first copy of Penthouse); his mother favors the same policies as a means to finance her own cultish, self-promoting religious program to save the world. The external threats are most clearly embodied in Colonel Dipa, the industrialize-at-all-costs leader of the nearby island of Rendang-Lobo. Of course, Dipa is only a puppet of the true threats to Pala: big oil and other avaricious Western corporations and governments that would cannibalize Pala's utopian world in the name of profit. In this story, Farnaby is their front man.While Farnaby recuperates for a month on Pala, he is given full access to the workings of their society. He is educated in Palan ways like a child would be taught, exposed to Zen notions of not-ness, suchness, and experiencing of the here and now. Farnaby is taken to visit schools and learn about Palan health care, and over time, he is led to the point where he is guided through his first alternate reality encounter with the help of the local hallucinogenic, the so-called \\"moksha-medicine.\\" His moksha trip forces him to confront his own personal demons of divorce, infidelity, and a fear of death that he melodramatically refers to as the Essential Horror.Can Will become a new and better Will and master his demons in just 30 days on Pala? Will he see Pala in a new light and reject his old ways and the wishes of his economic marauder boss, Aldehyde? Can he convince Prince Murugan that his notions of development and modernization will destroy the very things that make his country unique? Will Farnaby somehow act to prevent the Aldehyde-backed Colonel Dipa from leading the Rendangians in an invasion of Pala that will mirror the Italians entering Ethiopia or the Chinese entering Tibet? Or will he be so drugged up on the moksha-medicine that he won't care one way or the other?Regretably, Huxley fails to achieve the sense of identification that would generate enough empathy for the reader truly to care. Palan society reads today like a quaint rendition of a hippie commune thirty years after Woodstock. At the same time, Huxley's characters are wooden, one-dimensional caricatures of what they represent, from the robber baron Aldehyde, the psychologically scarred Farnaby, and the enlightened Westerner Dr. Robert MacPhail to the fiberglass boat, Italian motor scooter-grubbing Prince Murugan, the despotic Colonel Dipa, and the inscrutably oriental Susila (now a MacPhail, naturally). By the end, I found myself recalling fondly my better high school readings: Hilton's LOST HORIZON, Goldings LORD OF THE FLIES, Swift's GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, Voltaire's CANDIDE, even Huxley's own BRAVE NEW WORLD.

Likewise, the denoument in the last two chapters returns the reader to a compelling flesh and blood moral struggling resulting in an intellectual and perhaps physical climax.While the intervening chapters on utopia are intellectually satisfying in that the reader may react with, \\"yes, yes, that's the way it should be!\\" the ideas are presented in a frustrating form in that, while a good novel keeps three-dimensional characters moving, Island makes many stops to allow two-dimensional characters to describe utiopian scenerios."},{"Title":"Island","review":"I don't know that I have a lot to say about ISLAND that other reviewers haven't said already. Your response to the novel will have a lot to do with how you feel about overt didacticism in art. Personally, I don't really mind it as long as the ideas expressed are interesting, and, as I always do in Huxley's work, I find his ideas very interesting; you, on the other hand, may (quite reasonably) say that if you want to be preached to, you'll go to church this Sunday. I probably would have responded much more readily to this novel had I read it, say, in my mid-twenties (which, ironically, was when it was given to me) - at 42, I'm afraid I'm a bit too set in my ways to embrace it as wholeheartedly.This is really a book for people who are interested in Huxley's thoughts on improving society and improving oneself who, for whatever reason, can't stomach non-fiction - for those who are free from such an aversion, I'd recommend readingBrave New World Revisited (P.S.)andThe Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell (P.S.)."},{"Title":"Island","review":"Prior to reading this I thought that maybe as Huxley got older he might have improved as a writer. Evidently he didn't. This was even worse than Brave New World. In Island he seemed keen to promote his concept of magic mushroom so-called moksha medicine, as a means of inducing \\"dazzling ecstatic insights\\", coupled with meditation to make the insights permanent. This would lead to \\"liberation from the bondage of the ego\\". Sounds nice. It's the sort of book I imagine pot-smoking male backpackers stowing in their backpacks as they traipse round countries like India and Tibet in search of enlightenment, probably to be left mostly unread, but maybe to be occasionally produced as evidence of being against \\"the system\\". In the book there are such things as the \\"splendid rumble of Sanskrit\\" and such insights as \\"Elementary ecology leads straight to elementary Buddhism\\". I suppose such reasoning might make perfect sense if the reader had smoked enough pot before coming to that line. The message of this book is to take hallucinogens regularly to enhance consciousness. There's no mention of any harm that this might cause.

Too often people want to make the world better by being a pure and holy human being, which is off course impossible. In Huxleys Utopia society is completely adjusted to the best of human nature, but it's still human nature. This is what makes the whole so realistic and valuable. The obvious question now is off course: Why don't we put his ideas into action? In answering this I must agree with another reviewer, who poses that people in Pala are too earnest, too occupied with their happiness. Maybe Huxley forgot the part of human nature we call 'laziness'. Another possibility is that we're simply too stupid a race to put such obvious guidelines to happiness beside us. When i walk down a library or book shop i'm always having difficulties finding books that describe something positive. It seems we are animals that enjoy suffering as well as complaining about it. Untill we can put this drive for self-pity and misery aside, we're not ready for Pala. I can't help but wondering if we will ever be... ."},{"Title":"Island","review":"Huxley's novel is set on the \\"forbidden\\" island of Pala, somewhere in the Indian Ocean. Some one hundred years before the novel begins, a doctor was called to Pala in an effort to cure the local King of cancer. He ended up staying permanently, and therewith influencing Pala's social evolution.As fate would have it, the good doctor was blessed with an open mind, and so the distinctly Western influences he brought to Pala were benign - in fact helpful. Between his New Age science and the King's Tantrik Buddhism, the island maintained a stunning balance between the Eastern and the Western. Everything clicked. Utopia.On the island, education is biological, spiritual, and deeply psychological. Teachers start with ecology, and gradually \\"bridge\\" to every other area of thought - even metaphysics. Although children are given all the time in the world to use their imagination, Pala's teachers \\"never give children a chance of imagining that anything exists in isolation. Make it plain from the very first that all living is relationship. Show them the relationships in the woods, in the fields, in the ponds and streams, in the village, in the village and the country around it. Rub it in.\\"Religion on Pala was pantheistic and pagan in nature. Lots of references to Buddhism, Taoism, chanting, and inner spirituality. In fact, the book itself is a sort of spiritual tour de force, wherein Huxley promulgates another beautiful version of his Mind with a capital M theory.Industrialization of the island never really occurred as such. Instead, Palanesians embrace selective industrialization (no motor scooters, no Sears and Roebuck) and import certain technologies to meet daily needs - like massive refrigeration units to keep crops from rotting between seasons, and a small degree of electricity to support scientific research and whatnot.Pala's sociological structure is strange strange Huxleyan strange. A mixture of social parenting, fertility control, and religious ceremonies involving \\"moksha-medicine\\" - \\"the reality revealer, the truth-and-beauty pill\\" - \\"four hundred milligrams of revelation\\" - the best way to keep the islanders from biting into the \\"Tree of Consumer Goods.\\" (Why chase the Western god of innovation when you can chase the dragon?)As one of the natives, Dr. Robert, points out, \\"We don't give ourselves coronaries by guzzling six times as much saturated fat as we need. We don't hypnotize ourselves into believing that two television sets will make us twice as happy as one television set. And finally we don't spend a quarter of the gross national product preparing for World War III or even World War's baby brother, Local War MMMCCCXXXIII.\\" Instead the conduct more research on maksha, hone educational techniques, and make lots and lots war oldest enemy, love.Like any good utopia, a number of critical issues must be addressed head-on. The reality issue is one. On this note, Huxley scores a perfect ten. The book is very realistic; so much so, in point of fact, that he drags the reader to the bottomless depths of \\"Pure and Applied Pointlessness\\" and the \\"Essential Horror\\" (the omnipresence of death, the precarious of all existence) before building and bridging into Pala's social philosophy of \\"Pure and Applied Mahayana\\" Buddhism and \\"Pure and Applied Science\\" - a religious and practical science of optimism and wellbeing.It is only after diving and climbing out of these incredible depths solitude and despair that one learns to see again. \\"Liberate your selves from everything you know and look with complete innocence at this infinitely improbable thing before you. Look at it as though you'd never seen anything of the kind before, as though it had no name and belonged to no recognizable class. Look at it alertly but passively, receptively, without labeling or judging or comparing. And when you look it, inhale its mystery, breathe in the spirit of sense, the smell of the wisdom of the Other Shore.\\"Nor does Huxley reconfigure human nature with a literary sleight of hand, making everyone good little boys and girls. Every society has the possibility of creating a Hitler, a Tito or a Stalin, and so does Pala. But it doesn't. The Palanesians employ therapy \\"on all fronts at once\\" with an eye toward prevention over treatment. With detection, prevention, and four hundred milligrams of revelation, all problems are curable. Not the mention the love - which this island has in spades.All told, Huxley has given us a wonder utopia and, perhaps more importantly, a thoroughgoing critique of Western Civilization. A must read for anybody who wants to discover their inner \\"suchness\\" and reach the Other Shore, where all is illuminated. \\"Sunsets and death; death and therefore kisses; kisses and consequently birth and then death for yet another generation of sunset watchers.\\""},{"Title":"Island","review":"this book describes aldous huxley's vision for how human beings could live if we would acknowledge that we are neither perfect or fatally flawed ... just a group of animals living on a planet together. if we dealt with that, we could then use our big brains to minimize the suffering of life.the ending of this book is, though, a bit of a travesty. what huxley spends hundreds of pages building gets knocked away in just a chapter. another writer i know of, jean houston, says that she asked huxley about the ending of island and he said he lost the last bit of the manuscript and had to very quickly re-do it.happens to the best of us i guess. you will like this book, though, if your friends accuse you of being an idealist. funny how 'idealist' is the word used to describe people like huxley, who look around them and despair because of their purely pragmatic knowledge that what we are doing now (as a society and a world) is not working."},{"Title":"Island","review":"One of the best books I have read is Aldous Huxley's 'Island'. It is a take-off on the utopia theme and not his first one on it, the earlier one being 'The Brave New World'. His 'The Brave New World' was a brilliant trenchant satire, written on the premise that the human race has only two alternatives viz. being either insane or lunatic. 'The Brave New World' was a fantasy fable. 'Island' published in 1962, 30 years after 'Brave New World' was written by a much mellowed Huxley. Huxley's premise had changed from the earlier one. He believed that humanity had a third choice, of being sane. 'Island' is no satire, less fable like, the socio-political, economic system exposited in it is less fable like, and though might seem very difficult to realize, is not impossible if we all manage to be sane!Pala is a tiny (fable) island in the Indian Ocean, where it's small community has made the best of western and eastern worlds. The inhabitants are basically Shivaite-Buddhists. They have adopted the western technology but not to the extent that the technology becomes dehumanizing and prevents them being full human beings. They have steered clear of the three pillars of the western prosperity:- armaments, universal debt and planned obsolescence. They have of course their tradition of empathy for all the living beings, their respect for the environment, habitat and the practice of their traditional mind science. The Community believes that God is immanent, man is potentially transcendent. The island's enlightened community have attempted the enormous folly of trying to make a marriage between Hell and Heaven and succeeded at it. They have blended their tradition with western technology in a perfect synthesis. Rather, one of their prime credo is making the best of all the worlds.The book opens in a dramatic fashion. An English journalist on a secret mission to push the Oil interests of his tycoon boss is regaining consciousness an early morning on the fable island Pala. He had the previous afternoon procured a boat at the neighboring island (a separate country) and planned to sail into the Pala harbor. Unfortunately, he gets caught in a squall. Instead of sailing into the Pala harbor, he is washed ashore the wrong side of the Island with steep hills to be negotiated to reach habitation. Even as he is descending in the failing light of dusk, negotiating the slippery rain washed rocks, he espies snakes (not necessarily venomous) slithering around. Probably finding live snakes around for the first time in his life, he panics, loses hold and falls. Fortunately for him, this fall to the ground is cushioned by an obstructing tree. Still badly bruised, shaken and utterly terrified he loses consciousness. He regains consciousness the next morning with two Palanese urchins - a ten year old girl and a four year old boy- solicitously looking down upon him. The girl sends off the boy to get help. Meanwhile she feeds the famished journalist with bananas. The journalist is still carrying the phantom images of the slithering snakes though they are no more around. How the ten year old successfully administers therapy to the adult journalist to rid of the snakes crawling in his mind is one of the high points of the novel!One of the other high points in the novel: - the character Lakshmi, in last dying stages of terminal cancer is treated by her relatives. Death is treated as any other incident in life. It is as if Lakshmi's relatives are seeing her off for a long journey she is undertaking. She is helped in every way to live to the very fullest even as she is dying. Huxley had been deeply influenced by the book 'The Tibetan Book of the Dead' so popular in the west during 1920s & 1930s. This particular episode seems to have been inspired by 'The Tibetan Book of the Dead'.Huxley concludes the book on somewhat tragic but realistic note."},{"Title":"Island","review":"I have to admit that I didn't find this novel as transformative as some readers did, but I'm quite glad to have read it. Truthfully, it's not much of a story, but it sure will give you food for thought and I expect Huxley's ideas will stick with me for a long, long time.The protagonist of Island is British journalist Will Farnaby. Will isn't an entirely likeable character as the novel opens--as is so often the case in these tales of redemption. In an attempt to escape his troubles, or possibly to escape himself, Will takes a day off from a Southeast Asian business trip to go sailing. A sudden storm sweeps in, and in the novel's opening pages Will realizes he's shipwrecked and injured. Luckily, Will has washed up on the exotic and little-visited island of Pala. This island-nation is a modern (or the 1960s version of it) Utopia.Will is discovered by some children who promptly go for help. It arrives in the form of Dr. Robert MacPhail, one of the island's most respected citizens. Dr. Robert patches Will up, and he and other islanders indulge Will's curiosity about their home. Over the course of just a few days, they introduce Will to every aspect of their most extraordinary society. From family life, medicine, education, and rites of passage, Will learns about Palanese life from birth to death.He meets many islanders, including the future Raja who is about to come of age, and his mother, the Rani. These two members of the ruling class have some very different ideas about how things should be on Pala. And their agenda may just tie in with a secret agenda of Will's own... It is this loose storyline that the plot consists of, but it's actually a very minor part of the novel--just a thread that runs through a lot of philosophy and sociology. Personally, I had a very limited interest in and tolerance for a lot of Eastern religious (mostly Buddhist) philosophy. But I really loved the sociological ideas Huxley put forth in his Utopia. Really, really interesting stuff! For another reader, it might be the reverse. One way or another, I really have to believe the novel would be of interest to any thinking person."},{"Title":"Island","review":"I kept reading this book because on some level I was just waiting for something to happen. There were a couple of conflicts that could come to head somehow and make the book interesting in the \\"I'm reading a fictional narrative sort of way\\". However, none of these became more than hints until the very last two pages of the book. When this happens it seems like some predetermined anticlimax that you have been waiting for all along. The book fails as a narrative which is a problem when the publishers want to sell it as fiction.The problem is that it is not a work of fiction but is more a work of philosophy as story. I kept thinking ofCandideorGulliver's Travels (Oxford World's Classics). The problem is that Voltaire and Swift's works were at the bottom much more interestingly told. Island is the vehicle for Huxley to lay out his real utopia devised after a lifetime of intellectual work. The protagonist and the reader are guided around the island to learn about the pro-Buddhist, pro-hallucinatory drug, pro-sex, and anti(capitalist, communist, consumption, western education, nuclear family, etc) philosophy.This journey, as the protagonist learns and starts to internalize the teachings of the island, comes to an end based on the forces that represent the bad in the world. Poor Huxley's utopia even though isolated from the world cannot survive as the very nature of the philosophy is non-violent and acquiescent. It contains the seeds of its own destruction. I cannot help but think how much Huxley hated modernity and hoped for and sought a world beyond this one in the form of religion and drugs. For him, the struggle was not about the control of the means of production, but whether the means of production should exist. I just think he should thank his stars that he did not live to see the Brave New World in the flower as we can see it."},{"Title":"Island","review":"I wanted to like this book more than I actually did. \\"Brave New World\\" is one of my favorite dystopias, so I was excited to see how Huxley tackled a utopia, and to see how his thoughts on society matured between his writing of \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"Island\\"-- his last novel. I felt the result was slightly disappointing.While all dystopias and utopias are comments on society, and almost all utopia/dystopia authors have an agenda which they would like the reader to come to after reading the work, most do so in a more subtle manner. There is nothing subtle in \\"Island\\" which is my biggest problem with it. While I agree with many of the ideas shown in the story, I felt that Huxley didn't present them, but preached them. The book left no room for the reader to form their own opinion on issues in modern society, instead they were told, repeatedly. This preaching seemed both at odds with the ideas Huxley was pushing, and weakened the rest of the story by sacrifing things such as well rounded characters. The reader only gets flat, static, characters who can all be catagorized as either the pro-Western culture characters,who are all portrayed as naive, ridiculus, or greedy, and the anti-Western culture characters, who are all portrayed as smart and sexy ideals.These elements made it so that while I agreed with many of Huxley's ideas, the heavy handed style weakened the force of both the message and the book as a whole."},{"Title":"Island","review":"...Huxley was a man of depth. I would recommend this book to spiritual seekers and open-minded intellectuals who would like to consider the ways in which our social structure could be improved.**** WARNING -- implied spoilers ****At times it became overbearing, as though it was a caricature of itself. Even tiresome, as we got the point hammered and hammered into our minds. A more pertinent book for the 60s and 70s, when most of these ideas were new. Although perhaps more applicable today, since we've forgotten much of what we learned from the 60s.An island is a good choice for the location, since it's geographically isolated. One problem, alluded to by Huxley, is that although the adults choose this lifestyle willingly, it is possible that many of the children who are born into it simply reject it and move on.Parents will appreciate the child-raising part --those with an open minds understand that sometimes the relationship between parent and child is oppressive and it is good to get away those times. My wife and I trade off being with the children when they get really frustrating. It would be useful to have other parents around to help alleviate the pressure.The sexual thing is more difficult. Logically and biologically, open relationships between consenting partners in a series of loving, respectful romantic encounters should only strengthen society by allowing us to expand our ability to have compassion and empathy for others. However, it may be true that we are not at that threshold of evolution just yet, such that we can put aside our possessiveness and jealousy (which is borne of insecurity).The turnabout of Will Farnaby was ultimately predictable. Although for awhile I thought he'd sell out the island and it would all go to hell, as the story progressed I realized he would be converted (who wouldn't, with bliss-drugs and barely clad nubile girls rockclimbing and a serene, scientific, laid-back atmosphere) and the Palanese would take the oil exploiters into stride like they did everything else. The lesson of the book came near the end when Susila referred to this possibility, and dismissed it with the statement \\"..try to make the best of it, I suppose. Even in the worst society an individual retains a little freedom. One perceives in private, one remembers and imagines in private, one loves in private, and one dies in private -- even under Colonel Dipa [aka local dictator].\\"One thing that affected me was the Palanese reinterpretation of the Oedipus play. When they started I thought, oh brother, gimme a break. I can't believe Huxley would promote the revision of great literature. But when they explained it, I changed my mind. These are the archetypal messages we create our lives around. Altering them such that the protagonists have insights and grow would necessarily change the nature of Tragedy, but at what cost? That our lives are not defined by hopelessness? There is much to consider here.To answer another reviewer, he chose Mahayana Buddhism because it was a religion that 1) Huxley identified with, and 2) could be considered native to the region of Pala (his choices were probably only that and Hinduism, animism, or Islam)."},{"Title":"Island","review":"I wouldn't want to live on Huxley's Utopian Pala. I wouldn't be able to watch children starving to death on my 5 t.v. sets while thinking about how I am going to increase my income so that I can watch 10 t.v. sets at the same time. Life on Pala is much too earnest. Too much serious pursuit of health and happiness. I would need to let off steam in the same way that the Puritans had a respite from their quest for total goodness by frying a few witches. Total happiness is, like total goodness, too demanding. No wonder the residents of Pala don't seem perturbed that an evil dictator might take over their paradise one day. They are secretly as fed up with the pursuit of happiness as any normal person would be. That's why they choose not to use their superior psycho-spiritual skills to dreamweave the continued existence of their life-style.Virtually every ingredient of Pala's utopian system exists, or has existed at some time in humanity's history. If you end up calling this book a spoof it's because your lifestyle, values, or values have been brought into question by Huxley's probing book, and you can't find a reasonable reply. Huxley is angry at the rottenness of society, angry that nobody REALLY wants a less rotten society, and angry that people cannot see that a less rotten society is NOT a utopian dream - that there IS a way to a better world.New Agers should get out of their sweat lodges, put away their crystals and read this book. Then they would really know \\"What's What and What It Might be Reasonable to Do about What's What.\\" Or at least have a better idea what New Age is really about, and how it developed. Actually everyone would benefit from reading this book. It should be compulsory reading in all schools. It helps removes the blinkers of rigid thoughts and beliefs. Although it is much more fun to watch WWF, sick movies, state-sanctioned murder by lethal injection, and bombs being dropped on foreign countries than to think or dream about, or try to create Utopia.But Utopian Pala is also bit like Life itself? Both were created by the union of opposites. In Pala's case it was a union of science and mysticism. In both Life and Pala people prefer not to think that existence as they know it might, or will, end one day. And if it must end - what comes next? More of the same? Some things continue while other's don't - like the soul might continue while the body doesn't? Or is the ending total, final, absolute? Nothing continues?This book raises more questions than it answers - questions that will always demand attention. That's why I liked it so much."},{"Title":"Island","review":"This book was not even as good as 'Brave New World'. I opened it up hoping for that same almost humorous satire of a Utopian society. bad move...The storyline of this novel, with the ambiguity of the main character's past, falls flat in the first few chapters. I cannot really remember any portion of this book that really jumped out and grabbed me. The book was not bad, but it was not very good, either. Read this one if you are a Huxley fan or would like a small window of insight into one writer's view of a perfect society."},{"Title":"Island","review":"In any Utopian novel, the author must deliver an almost perfect fusion of plot and theory that simultaneously captivates and inspires the reader. Huxley is not quite able to deliver here. In short: in comparison to Brave New World, which is a masterly critique of the way things are headed (I strongly recommend supplementing with BNW Revisited), this vision of what things might be pales.This book is built as a dialogue between the West (Farnaby) and various elements of a better society (characters of Pala). Many of the conversations are outstanding and revealing. Huxley obviously had a great intuitive feel for humans and their trajectory when operating in a Western, consumer driven system. There are many great insights that you will literally not find in any other work. I think most books of Huxley are worth reading for these revelations alone. This is not to say that he is an infallible sage type. For example, he recommends hormonally modifying youngsters if they are too \\"muscle bound\\" or \\"inferior\\". Then we wouldn't have such a risk of psychopathic dictators... Not sure he truly appreciated man's lust for greed and his boundless capacity for self-delusion.However, as Huxley alludes to himself,he is not the great poet that can thrill us with harmonious language and thrilling plot. While the middle sections move well, the beginning and conclusion are hard to follow with any passionate interest. Sir Thomas Moore's \\"Utopia\\" was far more engaging because of the great humor and satirical elements employed. Huxley must surely be lacking in a sense of humor, a deficit which is sorely missed when such a grave topic is handled.In conclusion, this book is a must read. I only wish Huxley stuck with more of a non-fiction approach, as his contemporary Bertrand Russell wrote in because he is a direct writer and incredibly logical. These strengths make his fictional writing unnecessarily tedious and preachy, which was a common criticism among his readership of the time."},{"Title":"Island","review":"Whether or not you agree with Aldous Huxley's views of society and politics, this is a great story and riveting read.

His satirical and humorous protagonist, Farnaby, was hilarious. His snide comments and thoughts made me laugh out loud at times. I felt Huxley's writing style was much clearer and more accessible than A Brave New World and as a result I liked Island much better. Island reflects a great deal of cynicism about America and the world. Huxley attacks, among other things (1) consumerism; (2) the cold war ideology of both the capitalistic west and the socialist east; (3) religious suppression of the right of others to develop and practice their own sexual and other \\"private\\" mores and the use of the state to further this suppression; (4) violence and militarism clothed in religion, progress (technological and moral), and so called freedom; (5) political and social corruption of corporatism and the power of corporations and those that control them to use their resources for political power.The key point I feel Huxley makes is that capitalistic or corporate power in the west is able to use it vast resources to obtain what it desires. Corporate power uses money, religion, and the greed of the State to pursue its ends. Had the leaders of Pala given into greed then the Island would not have suffered its eventual fate at the hands of an outside force--but would have suffered an erosion of its \\"utopian\\" nature and everyone except the greedy would have lost in the end anyway. But either way it is clear that the corporate interests will take what it desires and use the tools of religious fervor and state power to further their own ends. Its key resource, however, is still MONEY---and in pursuit of what?----more MONEY. The happiness of everyday citizens is sacrificed at the altar of corporate greed.Island was published in 1962 and really reflects Huxley's views, I suspect, of the latter half of the 1950's. Interestingly, the 1950's are marked by (1) the true rise of consumerism and corporate exploitation of American demand for goods; (2) entrenchment of the Cold War and suppression of individual rights and free thought based on ideological extremism (McCarthy, Hoover, John Foster Dulles, Castro, and Stalin are all towering figures of the 1950s); (3) the emerging battle and public expression of a new set of sexual mores which met a backlash by conservative/religious segments of society; (4) The emergence of cold war capitalism fueled both by American defense corporations and the attempt of the Soviet Union to catch up with the west in terms of industrialization and military might (Eisenhower, during his Presidency, warned of the might of the military industrial complex). Some argue the entire cold war was generated by the greed of American defense industries (this is far-fetched in my opinion).The scary thing about all this--the same set of circumstances can be said to have exit today, despite the end of the cold war. Certainly, the power of corporations to dominate the political agenda and decision making process is still intact. Whether this limits or threatens individual liberties and democracy is another question. Certainly it did in the 1950's in America. It is amazing to me the correlation between the 1950's and the 1980's at the height of the cold war in American History. (For more information on the 1950's in this country I would recommend a perusal of David Halberstam's The 1950's). Huxley's book is as timely and poignant today as it was in 1962. The right or ability of an individual and a society to choose how it is going to live and progress is as impeded today as it was in the early 1960's---and by the same forces.Some rogue comments:1. I found the discussion of \\"maithuna\\" or the \\"yoga of love\\" to be quite humorous. I especially liked Farnaby's snide thought \\"What shall be do to be saved? The answer is in four letters\\". Is there really such a thing as \\"maithuna\\"?2. The use of mind altering drugs for experiencing a different slice of reality was provocative. Huxley wrote a book called \\"The Doors of Perception\\" which I have not read. I found these elements of the book to be interesting and really wanted more explication on the subject.3. The commentary on population control was also quite timely then and now. This exchange I found quite clear and commonsensical:Farnaby: \\"You seem to have solved your economic problems [on the Island] pretty successfully\\".Dr. Robert: \\"Solving them wasn't difficult. To begin with, we never allowed ourselves to produce more children than we could feed, clothe, house, and educate into something like full humanity\\".4. One of the scary pitfalls of the book is the Island's use of psychological drugs to control and shape the personality of its children so they don't grow up to be problems. Huxley, I felt, placed too much trust in science and medicine in this instance. This seemed to me like something not out of a peaceful utopian society but \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" (see p. 154-155 of the Perennial Library paperback edition for the reference-about 2/3rds into chapter 9).5. I know little about Buddhism and Yoga so those parts of the books I did not get as much out of, although I found them of interest. I wonder why he chose forms of these religions as those most applicable to his utopia as opposed to atheism or some form of spiritualistic religion other than Buddhism?One last comment: The ending was perfect in its cynicism. (...)"},{"Title":"Island","review":"In recent years I became more and more interested in culture and cultural differences. In order to understand the latter you first of all have to know your own very well and at least one other. In my opinion Huxley managed to help me with both quite a bit. He provided me a foreign culture explained it, described it to the fullest. True it is fiction but this has the advantage of being complete while in reality it might take you a lifetime to get to know a culture as a whole.Huxley then makes us watch this culture clash with ours. At that point I realized that the absolute right or wrong does not exists nor does the only true way. I had to put my knowledge and my beliefs into perspective and question everything. I realized that different cultural backgrounds (in sense of a base of knowledge) not only lead to different actions but, even more important, also to different interpretations of what people say and how they react and do things. When I say Huxley made those two cultures clash I do not think of the British journalist interacting with the Palanese. The true clash in my opinion is the young prince of Pala. He is torn between cultures and tries to mix both not knowing that he is about to destroy paradise. You can watch that happen in a lot of countries. People are trying to import parts of foreign &quot;evident culture&quot; which is not compatible to their own &quot;deep culture&quot;.By reading this book I &quot;experienced&quot; cross cultural interaction - It changed my view on cultures and their interaction as much as living abroad did."},{"Title":"Island","review":"Whew, am I glad to be finished with this book. It was very heavy reading, and boring as well. I'm glad I did read it, just so I know what it's all about, since it is a well-known classic by a famous author. But I'm so glad to be done, it was a real slog to get through.It is the antithesis of *Brave New World*, a Utopian vision rather than a Dystopian one. The thing is, it is only very thinly disguised as a novel. Except for the main character, there's not a lot of character development, and practically no plot at all. Nothing happens except at the very beginning and very end (and even then, not much.)What it really is, is a discussion of Huxley's theory of what it would take to create Utopia. If this is something you are passionately interested in, and you are reading it as such rather than as a novel, you would perhaps appreciate it. The story mainly consists of the main character going around touring an island country while different residents explain all the elements that make their society so ideal. It is a series of highly abstract, esoteric discussions mainly of philosophy and spirituality, told in \\"appropriate\\" weighty language (i.e., the heaviness of the language is apparently intended to convey the seriousness of the subject. In case we don't get that.)I didn't buy Huxley's vision, either. Many of the foundations he proposes for the building of a Utopia are either realistically impossible, almost childishly naive and pie-in-the-sky, or both. For example, magic mushrooms whose effects are only vaguely described (to me it appeared that all they did was get people stoned to the point of hallucination) but were essential to impart transcendence and make a person \\"fully human.\\" And being able to identify and cure young children who would otherwise grow up to be violent, sociopathic, self-destructive, etc. And getting everyone over the age of 15 to practice Tantric sex, and only Tantric sex. (Can you imagine a 15-year-old boy being able to do that, or even wanting to try?) True, these impossibilities are supposedly excused by being under the umbrella of fiction, but the actual result is that the book doesn't really succeed as either fiction OR nonfiction.I was also put off by Huxley's unadulterated and open contempt for anyone who was overweight. And by his (perhaps unconscious) apparent pedophilia. I wish I'd kept a tally of how many times he ecstatically described the breasts of pubescent girls (naturally, they were always bare in his utopia.) I'm betting such descriptions would number in the double digits.The one thing I did like about this book was that when he wasn't being portentously weighty, Huxley's descriptions are gorgeous and lyrical. For example, I loved the care-crows (scarecrows) and the Japanese Hornpipe dance.If you've never read Aldous Huxley before, I recommend giving this a skip and reading *Brave New World* instead. That one is quite interesting. It's hard to believe the two books were written by the same person.(286 pages)I did get some good quotes from *Island*:\\"Both of us victims of the same twentieth-century plague. Not the Black Death this time; the Grey Life.\\"\\"I have a theory that, whenever little boys and girls are systematically flagellated, the victims grow up to think of God as 'Wholly Other' -- isn't that the fashionable *argot* in your part of the world? Wherever, on the contrary, children are brought up without being subjected to physical violence, God is immanent. A people's theology reflects the state of its children's bottoms.\\"\\". . . she was slowly, and with a great deal of pain, put to death in solitude. In solitude . . . For of course nobody can help, nobody can ever be present. People may stand by while you're suffering and dying; but they're standing by in another world. In *your* world you're absolutely alone. Alone in your suffering and your dying, just as you're alone in love, alone even in the most completely shared pleasure.\\""},{"Title":"Island","review":"If you liked A Brave New World, or, even if you didn't, this book is a must read.

It starts with a journalist who finds himself upon an island, where was shipwrecked. The inhabitants of the island Pala, known as Palanese, accept him into their culture for a short while.

On the island Pala there is large quantities of oil, which makes it an object of desire to the Raja. The journalist's boss also is interested in the island, and is connected to the Raja as well.This book had a plot, but where it was intended to go, I don't know. This is not Aldous Huxley's best work, because his entire novel is made up of dialogue, but very little action. There are several concepts and ideas that are discussed thoroughly by the inhabitants of the island, but Island seemed more like a guidebook to Pala than an actual novel.Once again, as is usual in Huxley's case, the evils of the world beat out the Eden-esque of Pala. The journalist allows the Raja and her people to take over the entire island and its oil, which in turn destroys the serenity and simplicity the Palanese spent more than a century to create. The book touches on fascinating theories on how communities like the ones in Pala lived in, but everything seems either too cultish, and most often, unrealistic."},{"Title":"Island","review":"This book was not terrible, but compared to Brave New World, it was Boring New World. I took it on vacation with me (to an island) and I ended up being disappointed because I had nothing else to read. But I did finish the book, and as a few other reviewers have commented, it seemed to be low on plot... and to not really get off the ground. I think that Huxley was a genius, and a wonderful writer, and so it pains me to say this about this particular book. I just think he was trying to say too much here... too much selective philosophy rammed into a novel. What do I mean by selective? Well, for one thing, it leaves no room for the possibility of a God who is separate from his creation. Theism is mocked here. A more well-rounded novel about philosophy would be Jostein Gaarder's \\"Sophie's World\\".Huxley's Island is this isolated Pala, a magisterial queendom, founded on the principles of Mahayana Buddhism and western/scientific atheism. Dr. Robert, who is the grandson of one of the two founders of Pala, says, \\"The Palanese were Buddhists. They knew how misery is related to mind. You cling, you crave, you assert yourself - and you live in a homemade hell. You become detached - and you live in peace.\\" (ch.viii). The residents of Pala have developed a society based upon disciplined detachment, admirable enough in many ways. A peaceful compassionate world where even the wild mynah birds are trained to say \\"have compassion, have compassion.\\" This detachment is achieved through many methods, including hypnotism, transcendental meditation, animal magnetism, and of course, the ingestion of hallucinogenic mushrooms (called \\"moksha-medicine\\"). Living in the \\"here and now\\" is of paramount importance, in fact, it could be said that this is the worldview of Pala. \\"Matter is evil\\" is a big idea too.Will Farnaby (an outsider) is deliberately shipwrecked on this tropical would-be utopia and seeks to influence the Queen or \\"Rani\\" regarding the lucrative oil rights to Pala. But Mr. Farnaby becomes integrated into the life of the island, and is experientially impressed to the point of second-guessing some of his own motives and ambitions. What seemed to be opportunity now looks like exploitation. But it may be too late for anyone (including Huxley) to do anything, one way or the other, about the inexorable conclusion.At any rate, the ending seemed sort of weak. Somewhere I remember reading that Huxley was pressured to finish the book quicker than he would have liked. If so, that is unfortunate. Have you ever watched one of those movies where at the end the screen goes black, and you're expecting a bit more but the credits start rolling by, and you turn to whoever is next to you and say \\"What?\\" Well, that's how I felt, out in the paddle-boat when I finished this book.Everyone knows that Huxley was tremendously interested in the hallucinogenic experience. I agree with him that hallucinogens can grant a momentary heightened awareness, maybe even make someone feel that they are thereby tapping in to some kind of mystical Oneness. Whoop-de-do! But the benefit of such experience will always break down when applied to society. The benefits, if any, will always be individual, and individually experienced. Let's face it, for utopia to be sustainable at all, a certain amount of society has to be brutally sober. For instance, there's nothing \\"utopic\\" or peaceful about taking off in a jet when the pilot is up front burping mushrooms and \\"tuning in to his Oneness\\".Pala doesn't work for me, because it's too simplistic. I'm rounding off 2.5 stars upwards, out of respect for the author in general."},{"Title":"Island","review":"Disappointing. Very. Nothing happens. Huxley pontificates. Spare me. Can see why he's only known for one book. Skip this one."},{"Title":"Island","review":"Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this book is the apparently wholehearted acceptance that its dated and dangerous ideas seem to have found, at least as evidenced by a cursory reading of the reviews. What in the world gives Huxley the right to revise civilization? The fact that he is well-read? His adoption of discredited oriental philosophies?It cannot be argued that Western Civilization is without room for much improvement; however, abandonment of family, use of \\"mind-expanding\\" drugs, renunciation of religion, modification of accepted societal behavior, repudiation of long-standing definitions of acceptable sexual conduct, etc. These have all been tried to some extent and have universally failed. Huxley merely puts a fine gloss on the 20th Century's disdain of tried and true principles.Strong families supported by public morality and high expectations with respect to ethical behavior are the means whereby society will advance. History has proven this to be the case. It is no accident that English has become the language of the world--despite its many flaws, the rule of law and its protections of freedom and private property have given us the world we now, apparently, seek to destroy.Huxley and his ilk would have us believe that our civilization is so inherently superior to all others that we are free to ignore the lessons of history. However, it is more likely than not that humanity's basic nature remains the same today as hundreds of years ago. For example, regardless of your religious persuasions and beliefs, one must acknowledge that the Jewish culture has proven remarkably adaptive and has a longevity that is the envy of any cultural group--they have kept their people together through thousands of years of history by following some simple rules that Mr. Huxley would throw out the window.Despite the superficial attractiveness of Huxley's easy philosophy, hard work and obedience to laws will paradoxically produce far more freedom than a slothful abandonment to what feels good."},{"Title":"Island","review":"Please let me begin by agreeing with most reviewers that Aldous Huxley was a brilliant man, one of the most forward-thinking men in modern history and (on the whole) a wonderfully gifted writer. That being said, this book is absolutely, unequivocably horrible. It is 354 pages of plotless, repetitive socio-preach. Mr. Huxley's \\"A Brave New World\\" is, in my opinion, one of the best novels ever written. \\"Island\\" does not rise to that same level, though, and I would not wish it upon anyone."},{"Title":"Island","review":"The nice cover art with the hodgepodged bird from the online item preview did not match what actually appeared in the mail, but I'll disregard that in lieu of the fact that it was promptly delivered and in better shape than the seller had advertised. I'd recommend this seller."},{"Title":"Island","review":"It is difficult to believe Huxley was almost seventy and a highly regarded novelist when he wrote this piece of adolescent rubbish. It is also difficult to believe that so many reviewers think his ideas here are new and interesting. Well, I suppose they weren't so clich&eacute;d when he wrote them, but they certainly look very tired now.The first couple of chapters are actually very good, as we are gradually introduced to the protagonist, Will Farnaby, finding himself shipwrecked on an island and encountering its inhabitants. His confusion and his obsessive thoughts about his failed relationships are very well portrayed. Unfortunately, after this the book degenerates into a very boring talk-fest, with a minimal plot that surfaces from time to time before coming to a fairly predictable end.Island is, so we are told, Huxley's idea of utopia, but from a modern perspective, it looks more like a very idealistic view of a hippie commune: free love, child-sharing and family planning via sexual yoga, all under the benevolent influence of consciousness-expanding drugs. It's difficult to believe he really believed it could work, but the whole thing is explored without a hint of sarcasm, and Will is so convinced by it all that he undergoes a total conversion experience.The last chapter is well-written, apart from the flat ending, but Huxley had lost me long before then.I disapprove of a writer using his novel as an excuse for preaching. I do believe that novels should have themes, and the more serious the theme the better, and I know that it is sometimes difficult to locate the precise line between thematic concerns and preaching - but this book is clearly way over the line."},{"Title":"Island","review":"I didn't think that it was very interesting. Personally I really liked Brave New World and exspected alot more then I got out of this book. It was just a bunch of boring discussions that didn't really go anywhere in the first place. A person can usually tell if a book will be interesting if he wants to finish when he gets to the half way point (i use that method for all the books I read and every book that was ever good got good at least half way through). Reading this book only kept me from reading another book more worth while. I saw people saying that this book changed their lives. Ha! I can't imagine how."},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"To me the main value of this book was its advice about dealing with the perfectionism of a gifted child. Gifted-parenting books frequently bring up the problem of perfectionism, but I have not found much useful advice for dealing with it. Dr. Klein offers some practical suggestions and the insight that former gifted children may have their own perfectionist tendencies to reckon with."},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"Very helpful opinion in this book. I have found myself in similar situation in this book. Great resource for parenting."},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"This is an excellent resource for parents of gifted children. Klein provides some great examples of the errors parents too often make when dealing with gifted children such as over emphasizing the child's one area of intelligence, and she provides examples so that parents can avoid these mistakes.She has an excellent section on the traps or myths society has about what giftedness means, especially within the educational system and how to address or avoid these.She provides an excellent chapter on how to talk to your gifted child so that the conversation is open, honest, and real. Finally, she emphasizes the need for balance and variety for gifted children and how to achieve that.I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"This book is for anyone who has ever wondered if a child under their care might be gifted, and what to do about it. It's full of affective approaches to a wide range of puzzling, exhausting, and endearing behaviors, and important considerations for educational options. The author has a friendly writing style and is a great source of comfort, confirmation, and inspiration; I will be referring to this book often in the upcoming years."},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"As a mom of a child who is about to be 4 and is reading at a first grade level, I found this book fascinating and comforting. I really enjoyed how the author really makes you consider your own background in education and encourages you and your spouse or partner to get on the same page. It also has explained some of my son's behavior. I do have two negatives, though. The first is that it doesn't offer an appendix listing contact resources for gifted parents, like parent support groups and such that can be found around the country. That would be extremely helpful. Also, the author mandates parents really have to expose gifted children to a lot of experiences to maximize their potential. This could include travel, museum visits, and even extra classes. This all adds up to a lot of money that may not be available to all parents of gifted children. A parent in that situation may be discouraged by reading this book, especially since the case studies seem to all involve more wealthy parents. However, I do plan to rely on this book as a resource as my child grows older."},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"This book is terrific and hit the nail on the head when it came to my child."},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"I have been searching for a book such as this. This book had me alternately laughing and almost crying because every single page had something that I could relate to. I loved the use of real life family case history to illustrate what works and what is disastrous. Many practical solutions were offered to effect order back into your home. This book helped me tremendously to understand both what my son is going through and why I feel the way I do when communicating with him. Great wonderful resource, I've been telling other parents of gifted children that I know to run to the bookstore and get this."},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"I am an Aunt to a gifted child and this book has really helped me \\"get\\" my niece and her world. Thank you, Dr. Klein!"},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"Raising Gifted Kids has helped me to understand my children better and we are a happier, more cooperative family. This book is my reference guide; it provides clear guidance that is easily comprehendible and implement able. I found it so helpful that I gave my boy's teacher a copy; I recommend it to everybody who has an influence on a child."},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"Raising Gifted Kids starts off well, describing the support it will offer us later. Sounds good. But the book goes off track quickly.Klein talks about test scores, describing scores, standard deviations, and descriptions from various tests and test versions, apparently as old as 1970's versions, interchangeably. But they're not interchangeable, and mixing them up this way will confuse parents who don't have another source of testing information, and don't understand the differences between old and modern test versions, and between one modern test and another.Klein then offers a number of vignettes, which vary from predictable to extreme. These are not supportive because no matter what, the parents are the bad guys. After the introduction talking about all the help and support Raising Gifted Kids will offer us, this chapter tells us how awful we are, and all our good intentions are wrong. Pick a specific gifted school for your child? Wrong. Send your gifted child to public school? Wrong. Live in an isolated rural area and homeschool your gifted child? Very wrong. And lots more. Throughout the vignettes, the psychologist knows the single right answer for each child after only an assessment.The rest of the book seems more positive, but has it's confusing moments. All gifted kids are not alike educationally or emotionally, and the sweeping generalizations are too grand. More mistaken impressions left behind, especially among parents who are reading for support.Parents are, for the most part, doing a good job raising their gifted children. Those who aren't, aren't going to read a book about what we need to know - they already know they're doing a perfect job. Good parents need understanding and support. That's why we're buying a book called Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive.Like our kids, we parents of the gifted don't need someone to tell us how bad we are, how all our choices are wrong. We need someone to point out what we're doing right, and what we can do better. That's the kind of support we need. That's what Raising Gifted Kids should have given us."},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"Although I was able to find some good information in this book, overall I found it frustrating.The author makes sweeping generalizations like, \\"All gifted kids are ____\\" or \\"All private schools are _____.\\" I was left with the feeling that she thinks she, personally, is the only person qualified to make decisions about gifted kids. There was just no faith that parents know what is best for their kids or that schools genuinely want to help.Her chapters on school selection did not reflect my experience at all. (My kids both attend a terrrific public \\"Gifted Center\\" school, and we have found the people there responsive, warm, and very very good at what they do.)Some of the advice is painfully obvious. Don't, for example, say to your child, \\"Your weird questions are going to send me to an early grave.\\" (I bet you already knew not to do that.) There were also some problems with the writing and some typos or oversights that gave the book an amateurish feel.Having said all that, I must admit that there were times when a paragraph seemed to be talking about my child or my experience, and a few things were astute enough that I read them aloud to my husband. Thus the second star.But overall, the author, while clearly very bright, came across as bossy and inflexible with very clear prejudices. Why, for example, did she feel the need to point out what high-powered careers and high-status backgrounds all the parents came from? Does she believe gifted kids are only born into wealthy families? It almost felt like name-dropping.Bottom line? I'm very glad I didn't have to buy the copy I read. I've definitely read other, better books on this topic.Pick a different book."},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"There is much to like about \\"Raising Gifted Kids\\". The author offers some very helpful advice for those of us facing the challenge of raising an intellectually gifted child. I particularly appreciate her focus on being a \\"good enough\\" parent rather than trying to be a \\"perfect\\" one.The biggest issue I had with Dr. Klein is her elitist tone. She is an educational consultant who obviously has a well-heeled client&egrave;le. The impression she gives in her book is that all gifted kids come from affluent families, which is not the case. She describes each of the parents profiled in the book as \\"So-and-so, a successful/prominent/stellar/up-and-coming/etc. investment banker/attorney/surgeon/executive/etc.\\" The parents' occupations are not relevant to the point she's trying to make, so why even mention them? She also has a tendency to mention luxury items in passing as if they're a normal part of everyday life. Perhaps everyone in Dr. Klein's social circle has a housekeeper and a gardener and takes travel \\"adventures\\" and enrolls their kids in multiple enrichment classes. But I personally found her elitist tone very off-putting."},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"The author surprisingly is not a know-it-all but rather an astute observer of \\"high-potential\\" or \\"gifted\\" children. If you are a gifted adult you may find yourself wishing you had this kind of astute parenting! This book will enable many mothers and fathers (and grandparents) to help give the children in their care rich and rewarding lives. Your kids don't have to be geniuses for them to benefit from the author's experience."},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"It was a decent book, but not a lot of new information for me. For the most part, it simply confirmed some basics I have long believed in - not living out your dreams through your children, encouraging exploration without forcing achievement, the need to provide for additional means of learning, etc. A lot of time spent on selecting schools for gifted kids, which really doesn't apply in small towns like we live in. Some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods. A lot of \\"real life\\" examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approach.Probably the most novel idea that came across was that it's better to be a \\"good enough\\" parent than a perfect one. By Klein's opinion, if you manage to be the perfect parent, you set a standard so high that your child will have anxieties trying to live up to your example. Not sure I'm 100% with that, but it is an interesting take on parenting."},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"The author uses her expertise in the area of child devlopment and her vast experience working with gifted children and their families to present a reader friendly guide to parenting gifted children. This book is an excellent resource for parents, teachers, school psychologists and principals."},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"I gave this book one star because the author, in the beginning of the book, gives me useful information about the signs of having a gifted child. That is one of the reasons I bought the book and some of the information was useful.Now, on to the rest... Upon reading this material, I found it to be a self pat on the back from the author on her impressive portfolio of wealthy clients. I found plenty of information if I were an extremely rich person living in a community where the schools for the gifted were plentiful. All of her clients were fabulously well to do and their children were profoundedly gifted. So what about the rest of us? My husband is gainfully employed and I am a student. We have a modest income and our son is gifted. We found little practical advice for ordinary working parents. If you gross less than $200,000 a year, I would try another book."},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"\\"Raising Gifted Kids\\" was the first book I read that described gifted children, and it did have some interesting insights that got my mind thinking, but I find that overall, I finished the book feeling full of anxiety about what to do with my child. Subsequent books I have read, have given me a fuller picture of the issue and have shed light on the shortcomings of this book. I have a hard time recommending it.This book is filled with anecdotes about gifted children. The stories more or less fall into two patterns. In the \\"warning\\" stories the pattern is \\"Child A was gifted. His parents pushed him too hard. He became a perfectionist, and killed himself as a teenager.\\" Or \\"Child A was gifted. His parents never challenged him enough. He became frustrated with the difficulties of higher education, so wound up becoming an elementary school teacher (as if that meant his life was a failure)\\".The \\"success\\" stories are generally along the lines of \\"Child 'A' was gifted. Her parents hired a psychological advisor, so that they knew the right thing to do. The child became a doctor, and they all lived happily ever after.\\" Since the author is one of these psychologist experts, the general emphasis on finding professional help comes across as very self serving. The author's subtle, though persistent implications that some career paths are not worthy of \\"gifted\\" children comes across as elitist and narrow minded.I have since read a few other gifted children books, and I have learned that there are more or less two camps when it comes to gifted children. There are some who believe that giftedness is an indication that a child has a genetic gift that \\"should\\" lead that child to grow into a super-achieving adult. This is the type of gifted child model this book talks about. The author puts a lot of emphasis on the idea that if your gifted child doesn't grow up to be an exceptional world changing adult, that somehow the parents have not done a proper job raising the child.The second camp, and the one that the very helpful book \\"Being Smart About Gifted Children\\" covers well, is that it is often healthier for the child if parents and educators approach giftedness as a temporary state and spend time addressing any current difficulties that a child's giftedness might bring about. For example, if a child is suddenly finding 2nd grade math to be boring, figure out how to make it exciting. To be avoided, though, is to burden a child with a label, just because they happen to be really good at math at a young age. Often it is the case that giftedness does NOT result in a super-achieving adult, and that is perfectly normal."},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"I found this book annoying. It probably has some good points, and even some helpful points, but I was annoyed with the tone of voice of the author. Give parents some credit, for heaven's sake! I read a group of 10 books about teaching gifted children, and there are so many better choices that I would not recommend this one."},{"Title":"Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive","review":"I found this book extremely helpful in identifying ways to help my gifted twins, one of whom is a traditional learner and the other is not. The book has great insight and information, plus plenty of real-world examples of how parents deal with issues unique to gifted children. One puzzling thing, though, was the notion that there's an anti-gifted bias and that parents of gifted children are somehow seen by educators as meddlers or pushy parents. The author also seems to have the idea that public schools don't know how to deal with gifted children. That hasn't been my experience so far (our public school has an excellent GT & HGT program) and don't expect it to be as my children get older."},{"Title":"El Kybalion","review":"It's the most approximately true I was looking for."},{"Title":"El Kybalion","review":"Borred, Borred and very borred!! to much bla bla!

(He has also written spy novels, but I haven't read any of those.) He writes highly literate cozies that have clever solutions. He's not the best at characterization -- I sometimes mix up characters because they haven't been flushed out properly and some characters resemble each other -- but his plots move along nicely and the endings are satisfying, often with a twist and leaving me guessing until the end. In the four or five I've read, there's also been a slight romance, which is always nice.This novel takes place in a village where a terrible \\"accident\\" occurs, which touches off an investigation into house burglaries and secret identities. I liked the lead character, Liz, and the small touches of witty humor are quite nice.I enjoyed this mystery and recommend to anyone interested in traditional British cozies."},{"Title":"ASEAN's Diplomatic and Security Culture: Origins, Development and Prospects","review":"Haacke's book, a construtivist view on ASEAN's development, is well-detailed and extensively researched.

Ann Sheramy, a very decent, well-meaning Southern belle, and Corrie May Upjohn, an intelligent young woman from the wrong side of the tracks, are thrown into war in Louisiana. Ann does not mean harm to anyone, however her entire way of life forces Corrie May to never be able to rise from her position in life. The author explains how the war changes this. Slavery forces those who think they are &quot;free&quot; to never be able to rise above the poverty level due to the fact that no one wants to pay for labor when the job can be done for free by a slave. Just like in Roman times, this means there is a large class of people with no work and no hope of anything better. They are expendable people. This means that instead of fighting for their own rights, these &quot;expendables&quot; fought for the rights of the plantation owners, and fought to keep themselves in a type of &quot;bondage&quot;.

This book made me see the true hardships of the poor during the time of the civil war. This is a book I will never forget."},{"Title":"The Handsome road","review":"This book takes the story of the Larne, Sheramy and UpJohn families through the civil war and it's aftermath. The author provides a very realistic portrayal of the upper class Larnes and Sheramys and the poor UpJohns, the latter having to struggle for work as the upper class had the slave labor to do most of the work for \\"free\\". Also, the turnaround of the cultures in the aftermath of the civil war, the Larnes and Sheramys having to struggle to survive and keep their plantations while Corrie May was able to catch a coattail of a carpet bagger and his money.I have to say that \\"A Reader\\" in September 2002 summed this book up better than I could. Well worth the time to find this out of print book, I was able to get a copy from my local library. Please note, that the comment by \\"A Reader\\" in 1999 who called it smutty must be thinking about another book. This was as chaste as a book could be, and would be a good choice for a younger reader."},{"Title":"The Handsome road","review":"Gwen Bristow is an amazing author.

This book is so much fun. Pure smut. Delightful."},{"Title":"The Organic Codes: An Introduction to Semantic Biology","review":"Nowadays everyone has heard of the genetic code (in the singular). There is a certain amount of confusion in many people's minds, encouraged by the journalistic use of the phrase \\"genetic code\\" to mean what a biologist would call the genome, i.e. the complete DNA sequence for an individual. Nonetheless, there are plenty of good sources, ranging from the highly technical to the popular, to clarify the matter for those who want to be set straight.Marcello Barbieri is talking about something different, that is not only little known to the general public, but is also far less well known among biologists than it deserves to be. For him \\"codes\\" is plural, and he means more than just the familiar set of rules that say, for example, that when the triplet AAA occurs in an appropriate context in the DNA of a cell the aminoacid lysine needs to occur in the sequence of the corresponding protein. For Barbieri this is just one of numerous organic codes. Some of the others are also \\"genetic\\", in the sense that they involve reading more from DNA sequences than just aminoacid sequences, but others are not, as they involve information coded into structures such as sugars and histones that are not nucleic acids.All this should have considerable interest for the biologist even if we just stop there, but Barbieri goes on to build a theory of evolutionary complexity on the existence of multiple codes. Each time a new code appears during evolution it allows a large jump in the complexity of the organisms that possess it, but it does not replace earlier codes, which continue to be used, and it does not cause the simpler organisms to disappear. Thus modern organisms constitute a sort of pyramid in which the simplest organisms, the bacteria, use the ordinary genetic code and nothing else. The simplest eukaryotes add to the complexity by using splicing codes as well -- still in the genetic material, but now allowing fragments to be combined in different ways, and thus interpreted in different ways. The most recent of his codes to appear in evolution is language, which distinguishes our own species from all the others."},{"Title":"The Organic Codes: An Introduction to Semantic Biology","review":"This book has a germ of an idea, but overall the author's exposition is confused and unconvincing. The big idea is that life is a set of organic codes and that codes imply meaning, hence the &quot;semantics&quot; in the title. Barbieri attemps to show that codes are necessary mappings between domains that e.g. allow information stored in the genome to be translated into the organism through development. A key point is that the genome contains insufficient information to fully describe the organism. From this, the author posits codes for other processes, e.g. exon splicing and signal transduction, although he offers no evidence and just suggests biologists haven't looked for them. He also tries to use his ideas to &quot;explain&quot; evolution, especially the Cambrium explosion of phyla.I found his ideas unconvincing. His ideas rest on his model of how complexity needs to be generated, based on algorithms to reconstruct CAT scan images. He uses a new term &quot;convergent increase in complexity&quot; to mean &quot;reconstructing a structure from incomplete information&quot;, which is based on these CAT scan image algorithms. However, a wealth of literature on cellular automata (finite state machines) shows that complexity can be generated by simple rules. Furthermore, repeatable, complex structures can be observed by these processes. If one needs convincing about this, just look at the biomorph images in Dawkins' &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot; for taste of how simple rules can create complex, &quot;body plans&quot;. L-systems are another example.But despite his claims, Barbieri does not really offer falsifiable hypotheses and for this reason alone, it is difficult to understand how anyone can build on this work as a model of biology.Rather than thinking of codes as means to map information spaces, other workers have followed more fruitful approaches, e.g. how codes are used in information theory as a model to understand the biology. What is apparent from computational science, e.g. Holland's work on tagging systems, and wet biology, is that life needs to have systems that co-ordinate. Co-ordination becomes increasingly difficult as organisms increase in complexity and size. Biology seems to indicate that many approaches to communication used in industry have their surrogates in living systems.Barbieri comes over as a little petulant that his ideas have not be taken up by biologists. A quick search on the web showed that only people involved in a &quot;discipline&quot; called biosemiotics had looked at his work, and these texts reinforced the sense that incomprehensibity was used to mask lack of content. I hope I have given some reasons why this might be so.In conclusion, although I found this book in a biology section, it might have been better placed with the humanities."},{"Title":"The Organic Codes: An Introduction to Semantic Biology","review":"The book contains 280 pages of text, 25 pages of refenreces, 7 pages of INDEX, and many figures and cartoon to explain the concept of author's hypothesis. Barbieri was a development biologist at MRC in Cambridge, NIH, and Max Planck.This is a typical anti-Darwinism semi-pseudoscience book. I picked up the book because the book cover had a Chomsky's accolade. It's not as obvious and outrageous as Intelligent Desing-sort of book, but the author cites his own book to explain his main points. Many biological facts in the book are real and correct, but there is no scientific logical structure to support the author's \\"semantic\\" theory. I was struck by the fact that this book was published from Cambridge University Press."},{"Title":"The Lost Village of Central Park (Mysteries in Time)","review":"This is a wonderful story and fascinating piece of history for children as well as adults. As with so much in history, the more that is uncovered, the more it tells of the way things are today and why. As with many of the colorful stories from the annuls of New York, The Lost Village of Central Park illustrates a very important chapter in the history of the city as well as the nation. Educational as well as entertaining. The fact that such a place existed more than 100 years ago proves that which makes us the same far outweighs that which makes us different. As former grade schoolteacher, I think this book should be on the shelves of every school and public library."},{"Title":"The Lost Village of Central Park (Mysteries in Time)","review":"I had though the art of captivating storytelling in the realm of children's historical fiction was long gone. The last and one of the best was Ben and Me. Not to mention the fact that intelligent prose directed toward but not insulting children has disappeared with the likes of greats like E.B. White, Judy Blume &amp; Madeline L'Engle... until now that is. Meticulous research has allowed Hope Killcoyne to create a captivating historical backdrop that most New Yorkers weren't even aware of including myself. Even as the story unfolded I couldn't help feel a sense of sorrow knowing the timely end to what was probably a fascinating culture within the tapestry of NY. Nevertheless, Killcoyne takes what might have just been an interesting footnote in NY lore and weaves a modern folk tale of ingenious promise and heart. Characters well developed for any novel not to mention one for young adults, add depth and almost tangible realism to a time and era long forgotten and sometimes better off forgotten. Hope Killcoyne places her characters in a small pocket of the American landscape dwarfed by slavery and the dawn of Civil War allowing us to glimpse what might have been and what should be in a world too often blurred with self-interest and prejudice. Although some readers might be wary of the melodrama of a culturally diverse Utopia Killcoyne has pictured, there is nothing contrived about the story and intent behind this book. A highly recommended book for any young or old reader... from any walk of life."},{"Title":"The Lost Village of Central Park (Mysteries in Time)","review":"I heard of this book through a personal connection, and I'm so glad I went to the trouble of finding it!

Creating compelling and believable characters, Ms. Killcoyne provides today's pre-teens with an invaluable and unique perspective on an important era in American social development, one which was cut curiously short by the idiosyncratic yet poetically inevitable advancement of New York City, through the creation of Central Park. The Park stands today, a monument to New York civic achievement; what is lost is Seneca Village, perhaps an even more meaningful yet necessarily ephemeral reflection of all that is possible, yet also lost, in the American dream."},{"Title":"The Lost Village of Central Park (Mysteries in Time)","review":"Having lived in New York my entire life, I was surprised to find out about Seneca Village. I was never taught about the time, place, and events that surrounded the demise of that area of the city.

I like that each of the sections covers one, and only one, topic at a time. This really allowed me to make a course that works for the summer (when time is severely limited).The book is very straight-forward in its explanations. However, the exposition is very limited. That means the reader will have to work out a lot of the details.As a teacher, the book works for me. I can furnish, in class, all of the details that are lacking - that's what they pay me for.For self study, I would not recommend this book because of the lacking details. I would have to go with the great book by Tenenbaum and Pollard for those that want to self study this subject.All in all, I really like the book's structure - each section has exactly one point to make, and then exercises to test the one topic in that section. Also, every other chapter has a collection of &quot;miscellaneous problems&quot; that I pull from for the tests. The miscellaneous problems are great, because I can tell my students that those are the problems I am going to use on their tests (a subset at least). That gets the students to work all of those problems (great motivation).I would give this book 5 stars if an instructor came with the book.

These are not serious impediments.1. The authors should consider creating an additional appendix in the back of the book listing answers to the exercises.2. The techniques for solving equations should be presented in a different order. Some topics are presented too early in the book. For example, the technique of solving ODEs by Laplace Transform should appear later in the book. The purpose of using Laplace Transforms to solve ODEs is clear after a student has had a course in Complex Variable. Therefore, it can be postponed if an instructor runs short of time. A suggestion for future editions is separation of variables, exact equations, second order linear equation, higher order linear equations, systems of linear ODEs, series solutions, numerical methods, Laplace transforms, and PDE's.3.

Suffice it to say that Tre' (as his friends knew him) was a privateer, a scoundrel, a lover of poetry, a freedom-fighter and a loyal friend of the most prolific literary talents of the romantic period. &quot;Records of Shelley, Byron and the Author&quot; is an account, not of Trelawny's extraordinary life &amp; adventures, but of the two men that helped make that life so extraordinary. In his own words, he tells of the secret lives of Byron and the Shelley's, their romp through sunny Italy and the tragic death of Percy in the coast of Spezzia. The tale continues as Tre' follows Byron to the bloody civil war in Greece, where Byron too dies. To his credit, though, it is never &quot;Trelawny's tale&quot;, but &quot;Byron and Shelley's tale&quot; as told by Trelawny. This deep, insightful book shows the poets as only a close friend could. Yet throughout, one can not help but love Trelawny himself: the man who supported the impoverished Mary Shelley to her dying day... the man who bought a slave for $10,000 only to set him free... the man who reached into the embers of Shelley's pyre, withdrawing his heart. If you love the poetry of Byron and Shelley &amp; have even a passing interest in the men behind the legends, then Trelawny's memoirs are a must-read."},{"Title":"Records of Shelley, Byron, and the author","review":"The lives and deaths of Shelley and Byron ought to interest the world--not just the readers of English--for their poetry covered every topic: the rise and fall of empires, nation-building and nation-breaking, and the vanity of the men who would lead them in victory or defeat. And Edward John Trelawny shows us each poet as a human being. The production of fine writing should not be a mystery; beautiful language comes most eloquently from a troubled heart and a mind committed to seeking knowledge. Trelawny reminds us that Byron's and Shelley's lives were focused on connecting to people through their work; Tre begins each chapter with lines from the work of Byron or Shelley.The Introduction to this edition of Trelawny's book is written by Anne Barton, a professor at Trinity College, Cambridge University, from which Byron himself graduated about 200 years ago. I disagree with her that Tre's writing is \\"focused for the most part upon himself\\" as though he were self-centered, though Barton does say he had \\"hidden depths\\" (xx). Based on the form and structure and content of Records of Shelley, Byron, and the Author (and Tre's subsequent life), it seems that Trelawny was aware of the nuances of human character and was more than adequate to the task of knowing complex people. The details he provides in key places are so specific that they could not have been lies or fabrications; Byron's claim that Trelawny could not tell the truth was simply evidence of Byron's pleasure in teasing banter. \\"Byron's idle talk during the exhumation of [Edward Elliker] William's remains,\\" Trelawny writes, \\"did not proceed from want of feeling, but from his anxiety to conceal what he felt from others\\" (146). Byron also concealed his feelings at the cremation of Shelley's remains. It's clear throughout the book that Tre is a sharp observer--of himself and others. And Tre was sensitive to what Mary Godwin Shelley and Williams' wife, Jane, felt about the drowning of their husbands in the Bay of Spezia. Mary Shelley wrote to Tre that she experienced a \\"blank moral death\\" (176). Tre shows that the breakup of the Pisan Circle--because of Shelley's drowning--was clearly a personal tragedy with far-reaching consequences.This is a book for all seasons--but better appreciated while strolling on a beach in some far-flung corner of a poetic universe."},{"Title":"Lincoln reconsidered;: Essays on the Civil War era","review":"Lincoln Reconsidered is a collection of provactive essays that probe the multiple depths of Abraham Lincoln--life and mythology. He paints Lincoln's portrait onto the background of the sectional conflict that led to the Civil War. Originally published about 1961, Donald's stories remain fresh and relevant. In fact the reader will encounter the thesis and outline for his recent prize-winning biography of Lincoln. I first encoutered LR in 1962 when I taught Advanced Placement American History and assigned portions of the book to my students. They loved it; you will. Donald is a superlative historian and stylist. Listen to these chapter headings: Getting Right With Lincoln, Reconsideration of Abolitionists, Herndon and Mrs. Lincoln, Folklore Lincoln, An Excess of Democracy. Readers of Donald's Lincoln will want to have this as a companion reference piece. It's rare for an historian's essays to experience such a rich and extended publishing history. Here's a quote from my faded copy of LR, a touch of wisdom for our parlous times: &quot;...Lincoln knew that there were limits rational human activity, and that there was no virtue in irritably seeking to perform the impossible. As President, he could only do his best to handle problems as they arose and have a patient trusdt that popular support for his solutions would be forthcoming. But the ultimate decision was beyond his, or any man's, control. 'Now at the end of three years struggle,' he said, 'the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man, devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.'&quot; Page after page runs like this, and virtually every theme connected to the Civil War gets enough discussion to stimulate and edify."},{"Title":"Lincoln reconsidered;: Essays on the Civil War era","review":"Lincoln Reconsidered is a series of essays written by Donald prior to the publication of his award-winning biography Lincoln. First published in 1956 and now in its third edition, the essays have worn well, providing great insight into Lincoln the man as opposed to Lincoln the myth, much in the vein of Richard N. Current's The Lincoln Nobody Knows. Had Donald accomplished nothing else this would be a valuable addition to everyone's Lincoln reference library. But the value of Donald's insights goes beyond those of Lincoln and his era. As a former Advanced Placement United States Government and Politics teacher, there is much in this slim volume that is instructive for our contemporary divided America, essays relevant and useful in today's classrooms. And insights which serve as a warning, particularly his comment that, \\"At only one time have rigid ideologists dominated our national government--the Sumners of the North, the Jefferson Davises of the South--and the result was near disaster.\\" (p. 13) Let us pray in 2013 that history does not repeat itself. In more or less chronological order Donald examines: Getting Right With Lincoln, The Folklore Lincoln, Toward a Reconsideration of Abolitionists, An Excess of Democracy: The American Civil War and the Social Process, Education Defective: Lincoln's Preparation for Greatness, Herndon and Mary Lincoln, Refighting the Civil War, The Radicals and Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln and the American Pragmatic Tradition, A Whig in the White House, Reverence for the Laws: Abraham Lincoln and the Founding Fathers, and A. Lincoln, Politician. In each essay Donald challenges conventional wisdom and asks the reader to reconsider what he or she may have thought to be established fact. He also frequently confronts historiography that he considers to be biased, narrow minded, or serving an agenda. It's okay to \\"get right\\" with Lincoln in the sense of looking to Lincoln for guidance in challenging times; it's not okay to do so by removing him from the proper context of his times or to pretend that he could do no wrong. Those readers who own a copy of any of Donald's other books will certainly want this as a companion volume."},{"Title":"Lincoln reconsidered;: Essays on the Civil War era","review":"According to the author's Preface, the publisher originally wanted to title this work \\"Chips from a Historian's Workbench.\\" While awkward, that title was certainly perceptive. This book takes research that perhaps never found a place in other papers or books about Lincoln and uses it to show us a different way to see him and the events leading to the Civil War.This book contains numerous interesting bits of information about Lincoln although the one piece I found most interesting was the fact that Lincoln was a land surveyor for a time. Many writers focus on Lincoln's limited education but a surveyor must have a good understanding of mathematics and by most accounts, Lincoln was very competent. This brings to issue the long standing belief that Lincoln had little formal education but,according to the author, Lincoln's formal education was consistant with that received by young people at that time.There are some sections of this book where Lincoln's name fails to appear and the reader might have cause to wonder if he is reading the wrong book. Fortunately, these little detours are not only interesting but help us see Lincoln and the Civil War period from a new perspective.I found this short book (about 200 pages) to be interesting and engaging. It was written by an author who understands how to communicate and keep the reader's interest. I would recommend it to anyone having an interest in Lincoln or the Civil War."},{"Title":"Lincoln reconsidered;: Essays on the Civil War era","review":"Famous Lincoln scholar David Herbert Donald first wrote this collection essays as he was preparing his monumental biography of Abraham Lincoln, decades ago. The collection, periodically updated and reprinted, hold up pretty well as an antidote to Lincoln the myth, offering instead Lincoln the man of flesh and blood.Many of the myths with which Donald does battle are still prevalent, and his thoughtful essays provide insight and context on a remarkable man, raised on the American frontier and largely self-made, who became a successful lawyer, politician, and wartime president. Donald discusses Lincoln's background, education, his Whig politican background, and the adroit way in which he managed his administration during the Civil War. Among the touchy issues are Lincoln's handling of the Emancipation Proclomation and his selective curbing of civil war during the rebellion. Donald acknowledges many contradictions, but offers some pathways to understanding a complex man whose life has been distorted by both historians and more recent politicians; highly recommended to students of Lincoln and of the Civil War."},{"Title":"Lincoln reconsidered;: Essays on the Civil War era","review":"For the mpost part any book by David Donald is worth the time and effort to read.

This takes a bit of time and expands on it very nicely. It starts out with a nice introdution about Lincoln and his times, the people he knew and worked with, then goes onto the politics and war. It had some anecdotes that you never see anywhere else. It turns out that Linoln was not a rabid emancipationist, but a pratical president who did things as needed to be done. I wondered before why he only freed the slaves in the states in rebellion: it was because he did not want to alienate the slaveholders in Kentucky and Maryland. I am still mystified as to the reason for the war of northern aggression: slavery does not seem to be the all inclusive answer that mythology makes it out to be, and this book shows some altenative reasons, but does not take a stand, after it is only a collection of essays."},{"Title":"The New York Times Weekend Challenge: Formidable but Fun Crosswords","review":"These puzzles are absolutely hilarious!

Ken Renshaw resurrects the ideas of Mesmer, suggestibility; Freud, that sometimes fears are disguised wishes; Alfred Adler and family influences; the archetypes of Carl Jung; even Eric Berne's concept of \\"scripts\\" all are stuffed into a vast system of \\"memes.\\" These memes are vaguely defined as just about any idea that prompts you to behave in one way or another. There is no discussion of drives or reinforcement, and very little on habits or another psychological concept, \\"magical thinking.\\"However, this is not all bad. In fact, it may be good. What Renshaw has done is simplify how to understand why you do dumb stuff and how to stop doing dumb stuff. His thinking is similar to Harold Greenwald's direct decision psychotherapy approach first presented in the 1960's suggesting that people should decide what payoffs they want and do whatever it is that accomplishes that. Gestalt, rational-emotive, even NLP fans will be attracted to his approach.He says two things very well. First, that if you believe something to be true, you will live in such a way that it becomes true. Second, that you can change this pattern. For this reviewer, he spends too much time on the former and too little on the latter.I found one concept to be especially useful. Years ago, a rival of Alka Seltzer showed an ad on television where two tablets were plopped into a glass of water and began to fizz, releasing all that medicine. Almost immediately, a hand reached in and pulled them out, showing that there was nothing special in what was happening with the tablets and bubbles. The message was; there was no magic in those dissolving tablets-you can safely switch to another product. Renshaw's message is equally clear; that there is no magic in your current memes. They are just the \\"spell\\" you're currently operating from and that you can change it when you want.To include all he does under the definition of a meme is not a true meaning of the concept nor faithful for how complex we humans are. At the same time, if you're looking for a simple way to understand why you do what you do, this is a good place to start. He gives you tools to take a clear look at who you are and what you want to be and left me with the clear impression that although we are buffeted by the memes of others, we are responsible for what we become and have the opportunity to take control over it.Although overly simplified for my taste, Renshaw does a good job of making sense of life and offering practical ways of improving it. His enthusiasm for the topic is clear. I think sitting down for a cup of coffee with him for an hour or so would be enlightening. Second best is to read his book, which I recommend doing."},{"Title":"Everyday Magic: The Power of Memes","review":"This book is a very informative, yet easy read about the realities of life and how patterns are repeated sometimes even unknowingly until honestly addressed and changed. That is where the power of this book lies in giving insight, tools, all with a touch of humor to make positive changes of direction in our lives. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Everyday Magic: The Power of Memes","review":"The author takes the concept of \\"memes\\" into everyday life for the reader. This book is also very personal on the author's life history. As an introduction to our individually selected attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, it is very easy reading and the examples help our self understanding."},{"Title":"Brilliant Bead Rings (Crafts)","review":"I tried not to buy this book for a long time. It seemed like I could figure it out myself, and I have a lot of craft books already. There is something so wonderful, however, about having crystal clear instructions and all the right supplies right in front of you. With this book, there's nothing to &quot;figure out&quot; (unless you want to vary the patterns). You can just relax and make some adorable jewelry. These are quick to make and look quite nice. This is another Klutz book that I'll take to the craft class I run with teens. My complaints about the book: the bead wheel doesn't work well--beads get stuck and shoved into other compartments or fall out the sides. The bead colors are mixed together in color families, which is a real pain when you're trying to get all one color. There is variety in colors, but not in beads. A flower bead or two (like the one in one of the book's pictures) would have been nice. Still, the patterns are pretty, quick, and do-able. The variety of representative designs (butterfly, flower) and pretty patterns (chain)is good. It's a fine little book."},{"Title":"Brilliant Bead Rings (Crafts)","review":"this great book provides materials for doing all the rings.the instructions are clear and easy to follow and there are great designs of rings too , like a beautiful butterfly on the ring , a vine... this book is affordable and those who are interested in this, you can start on this book! It's gonna be fun!"},{"Title":"Brilliant Bead Rings (Crafts)","review":"...BR>This is an awesome book made by real people ... and by an awesome company! My cousin has this book and I have done three of the rings already. They are easy to do and the directions are well explained and not too complex.The rings include: simple ring (you should learn to do this first), twisted ring, chain, vine, butterfly, starburst, and daisy chain. This book has plenty of beads so you can do your favorite rings over and over!The only complaint I have is there's this stupid bead wheel (you've seen it on the front picture) and the colors get mixed up if you take it on a car trip, or when you're flipping through different colors.Otherwise, this is a great book and I highly reccomend it for someone who is interested in making bead rings!"},{"Title":"Brilliant Bead Rings (Crafts)","review":"I must say, this is another awesome klutz book. The instructions are clear and well illustrated and easy to follow. The rings are nice, and range from very simple to quite complex. And of course, you can always make bracelets and neclaces as well, just use more wire.The whole idea behind these books is just so well executed. The seem a little expensive, but they come with everything you need to get started, so really, they aren't. And it saves you that part where you buy the book and then run around spending all sorts of money to make sure that you have everything you need. Or worse, never making anything from the book because you can't be bothered to go out and get what you need. This book, or any of the other klutz books, make excellent gifts for the young or young-at-heart, just for this reason.One word of warning with this one. I dropped it, and the bead container top popped off. It could have been nasty, this book comes with a lot of beads, and they're tiny! Luckily, only a few were spilled, and I transferred the beads to something a little more secure.Buy this one and enjoy it. I also recommend hair wraps and hemp bracelets from the same series."},{"Title":"Brilliant Bead Rings (Crafts)","review":"My dds gave these as gifts to their friends recently, and EVERYONE loved them!

Klutz really does have the best ones around. These rings are easy, the book gives you everything you need (but scissors) and there are several cute patterns. I'm sure campers will love these projects. The only complaints I have are with the included supplies-- the bead wheel is cumbersome to use, and the colors mix easily. Also, there isn't much variety in beads-- but you can easily supplement with whatever you have on hand."},{"Title":"Brilliant Bead Rings (Crafts)","review":"My 9 year old son kept begging me for beading supplies to make me jewelry - not wanting to invest in a whole bunch of stuff that would end up on pipe cleaners and sewing thread bracelets, all over my house (and in the trash), and maybe eventually in the wasteland of a passing interest, I got him the Klutz book so he could learn to make real wearable jewelry, and have all the materials he needed in one place, without alot of potential waste. I figured if he developed a lasting interest, we could go on from there.He spent hours pouring over the book and very quickly was able to make every ring with no supervision from me! There are several projects, each with an increasing level of difficulty, but with simple enough directions and good photographs so that he could work independently and end up with a very satisfying and pretty product. There were some moments of frustration and trial and error, but that was the point - this was a good exercise in patience and perseverance, great practice for fine motor skills, and a vehicle for developing design and color sense. There are more than enough beads and wire for several variations of each ring and no need for any extra tools.Thanks to Klutz, all the important women in my son's life have lovely little woven beaded rings. It would have been nice if there'd been some boys pictured in the book making the jewelry too, but he wasn't put off, and he even made himself a ring that because of his color choice looks like an exploding firework rather than a dainty flower. And as I suspected, this was a passing fancy, but one that he could develop further if he ever wanted to pursue it - and now he knows what supplies he will need and has the book for direction and a reference."},{"Title":"Women Creating Lives: Identities, Resilience, And Resistance","review":"this book is one of the most wonderful, amazing and inspiring ones i've ever read. it changed my life. it inspired my own research, i suggest it for all."},{"Title":"Emotional Honesty & Self-Acceptance","review":"&quot;I have worked for 10 years with public school students who have Emotional Behavior Disorders (EBD), at the elementary, middle and high school levels. I wish I had read &quot;Emotional Honesty &amp; Self-Acceptance&quot; when I was in graduate school as it is tremendously useful in working for EBD students. I am generally disappointed with affective materials available to use with these students, as exercises and activities are often superficial, and kids know it. The concept of emotional honesty is simple to understand and rings true. It is truly a helpful tool when communicated appropriately, which Ron Brill does quite effectively in his book. The information is here to use or not use according to the readiness of the individual facing emotional stumbling blocks. This book can also help support and maintain the emotional health of teachers as well. It has certainly been personally very helpful to me. Many of my students told me up front that they were desperate to find something that could actually make some difference in the misery they face every day. The anger and depression present in most students seems so overwhelming and crippling, no wonder teachers and counselors are also unprepared for the emotional distress that pervades our schools. Many families are also overwhelmed to the point they also need emotional health education adocated in this book. It is simply one of the most important books I have ever read. The author presents so much potentially threatening material in a non-threatening way that it is easy to accept. This is a simple but powerful repair tool for complex emotional/behavioral problems we all face today.&quot;"},{"Title":"Emotional Honesty & Self-Acceptance","review":"In his book Emotional Honesty, Ron Brill contributes to our basic understanding of human emotions. This readable book will be of enormous value to classroom teachers, parents, and others who live or work with children/adolescents because the author carefully explains the distinctions between &quot;healthy&quot;--and the more common &quot;unhealthy&quot;--manner in which we deal with our own feelings as well as the feelings of others around us. In light of our nation's current inability and/or unwillingness to meet the emotional needs, issues, and problems of millions of our children, I believe that this book provides an excellent basis for individual and group study and reflection."},{"Title":"Emotional Honesty & Self-Acceptance","review":"Ronald Brill's Emotional Honesty &amp; Self Acceptance is an excellent resource for everyone, especially those working with children. The strategies in this book helped me turn \\"wounds into wings\\" with hurt high-risk teens in a community school. I have witnessed angry, self destructive, depressed and suicidal teens turn around and express their internally trapped hurt and sad feelings in a safe place, the classroom."},{"Title":"Emotional Honesty & Self-Acceptance","review":"As Ron Brill writes about the principles of emotional honesty, he is able to shed light on the mysterious world of emotions. He examines the pretenses and hidden defenses that children and adults employ as emotionally dishonest ways to deal with (or avoid dealing with) hurt feelings. He offers specific strategies to help people become emotionally honest by accepting, listening to, and taking responsibility for painful feelings. Teachers can play a critical role in this emotional education process, providing students with the skills that will enable them to handle their everyday wounds immediately, openly, and honestly before they build up and erupt into violence or self-destructive acts.As mentor to elementary school children and as grandmother of two teenagers and four preteens, I found this book fascinating and very helpful. I better understand the painful and wounding feelings that young people struggle with. I believe this will enable me to be a more sensitive, active listener as I encourage young people to share and explore their feelings. This book is an excellent resource for teachers and parents. Ron Brill paves the way for a critical new discipline of emotional education as he opens the door to honest communication."},{"Title":"Learn to Play Golf in a Weekend","review":"I took up golf at 60, never swung a club in my life, and this was the first book I stumbled opon.

(Okay, my putting still stinks, but still...)The book covers everything the beginning addict, er, golfer needs. From gear to rules, grip to stance, problem corrections, and even some advanced techniques. I'm not a visual person, but the photos are so clear and so simple, that even I can \\"get it.\\" The author doesn't overwhelm you like some other experts do. It's just the basics.

Don't even think of buying a book from a \\"name\\" until you've mastered this one - seriously, it's that good.This book taught me to play golf.

Well this is a TV book about...TV's. Not TV shows or TV actors, but that glorious box from which we derive so much entertainment. Specifically this is about TV of the 50's and 60's and one of those retro, pop-culture books that Collector's Press does so well. Through this collection of vintage advertising and lively bits of trivia, we see the development of television throughout TV's golden age.We'll see as TV's develop from tiny 10\\" screens in mammoth, radio-type cabinets, to 21\\" color TVs in the 1960's. Along the way you'll revisit long forgotten brands such as Spartan, Capehart Farnsworth, Arvin, Air King, and Crosley. You'll chuckle at what passed for a portable TV with the large, box-like models from Philco and G.E. The ads tell the story of TVs advancement as they tout new antennas designed to give better reception in those pre-cable days and Westinghouse's new models for 1954 which were supposed to cut down on glare if watching in a dark room.In those days, the TV was as much a part of the d&eacute;cor as any other piece of furniture and manufacturers gave customers a wide selection of different wood cabinets to choose from like cherry and maple. Some even housed radios making the first entertainment centers. TVs came in a rainbow of colors in the 50's and 60's too, especially the portables coming in bright reds, light blues, and yellows. Tacky? You bet...a lot more fun than today's cookie-cutter models.And don't forget color pictures! TV Wonderland presents the very first color TVs such as the RCA Victor Color which started at a whopping $495.00, quite a sum back in the 1950's. The book is also sprinkled with interesting bits of trivia. As a testament to the popularity of westerns in the early days, during the 1958-1959 TV season seven of the top ten shows were westerns.This is a marvelous little book. Well written with hundreds of classic advertising that will make you yearn for the days of your black & white Zenith!"},{"Title":"Life with father","review":"The shipper had great curstomer service and there was no delay in me recieving their product.

A great look into life in the 1890's and a close and colorful family."},{"Title":"Life with father","review":"I enjoyed the humor and also the gentle manner in which the author writes about his father. Father actually sounds like he's a domineering, arrogant man but the author sees him as being a typical man of that era & writes about him with love, laughter, & as if he's kind of a hero in the home."},{"Title":"Life with father","review":"This was an enjoyable lighthearted read, but I don't think it will be anything that sticks with me. The events related are amusing in some respects, but each chapter is almost a stand alone story which I did not like (but maybe that is how all memoirs are, this is the first one I have read). You are simply given the facts of each incidence as it occurred and it is left at that. There is no reflection back in future chapters, or watching to see how the current event you are reading about plays out in the future. It reminded me of sitting around the table with my family and listening to many funny remembrances of some long gone beloved grandfather. I did enjoy the characters and it was an entertaining book, but I think it serves best as a cleansing of the palate between two more serious books."},{"Title":"Life with father","review":"I don't understand how Clarence Day, a good author, wrote this wretched book.

L & C had the good sense to soften the father's character and make him more palatable. In the play you will find humor, but not in the memoir."},{"Title":"Life with father","review":"I just got this book and I am having a wonderful time reading the anecdotes of life in Victorian New York with an eccentric father. The humor is gentle and quiet, if you want outlandsih jokes the this is not the book for you.Of course, some of the customs and actions of the characters may seem odd by modern standards but we must remember that everything changes with time and in 150 years, people may look back at our culture and wonder if we were crazy.Still, in spite of its age, the humor of the book has held up remarkably well. Perhaps we all know a &quot;father&quot; type, an eccentric and bossy person who is somehow endearing nonetheless.So, don't obsess over the un-politically correct attitudes of the time covered, just enjoy the quiet humor and learn about a time gone by."},{"Title":"Life with father","review":"I loved this book as a preteen and I loved it, and the sequel &quot;Life with Mother&quot; too. Mr. Day paints an accurate picture of life in the early 1900's for a middle class family. Yes, his father is rude and a bit obnoxious, but watching him is very funny. He loved his wife and family and while he blustered and yelled, they loved him. I enjoyed this book and thought it was great."},{"Title":"Life with father","review":"These are very amusing sketches of family life in New York in the 1880s and 90s. Clarence Day Seniuor is a larger-than-life character, autocratic, excitable, with strong likes and dislikes. I was a bit startled to read a previous review that spoke of his 'emotional abuse' of his children. There is no abuse , emotional or otherwise, in this book. Mr Day clearly adored his family. Another reviewer says that Day Snr 'disrespected his wife'. Again, I see no evidence of disrespect in this book, Mr Day obviously loves his slightly eccentric wife to distraction, and in their frequent clashes of temperament she almost always succeeds in getting the better of him. The chapter where she departs on a lengthy trip to Egypt, leaving him pining for her, is particularly touching. This is a charming book, much more amusing than the pleasant but rather bland film that was based on it."},{"Title":"Life with father","review":"Life with Father is a collection of anecdotes by Clarence Day, Jr., mostly having to do with his childhood and primarily involving his father. The primary reason Life with Father is so fascinating is because Clarence Day, Sr. is larger than life. The man is domineering, meticulous, and tyrannical, yet is also, in his own way, loving and good natured. His interactions with his wife are particularly entertaining.Many incidents reported here occur in the 1880s and 1890s, and this book provides great insights into nineteenth-century American life. The chapter on how the family first came to own a telephone particularly shows how very far America has come.Day's writing style is typically matter-of-fact, excepting a few occasions, particularly when he writes about himself. This style serves to highlight his family's absurdities, which is where much of the humor comes from.Worth mentioning here is the marvelous 1947 film starring William Powell, which is based on the play, which is in turn based on Life with Father and several other of Day's books. Neither the book nor the movie draw a large audience in the twenty-first century, but a number of people do come to the book after seeing the film, and filtering the book through the lens of the movie's cast does help accentuate its humor.Life with Father is an excellent and humorous book, perhaps best read in small doses so as not to dilute the effect. It is also a very interesting window into nineteenth century America.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Life with father","review":"&quot;Life With Father&quot; by Clarence Day is such a charming memoir!

Some reviewers have complained about the father's behavior, and certainly in 2004 no husband/father could behave as he did. However, for the period in which the story takes place (the 1870s/80s), the father is pretty typical and clearly loved his family a lot. The chapters about the author having violin lessons and sharing mail with his father are particularly good. For people who understand that customs and society itself were different in earlier times, this book will be a delight."},{"Title":"Life with father","review":"I was captivated by the hubbub that seemed to erupt often in the Day household. Traveling back to a time long past and being told of society's customs was a treat. Witnessing Mr. Day's frequent outbursts was entertaining as well. And what of Clarence's two-week stay in Chicago for the World's Fair, which cost him only $48? Imagine that today! Mrs. Day had such a singular way of handling Mr. Day; I found it hard not to admire her fiesty spirit. Mr. Day was domineering by today's standards, but Clarence even remarks that it was clear his father loved the family dearly."},{"Title":"Life with father","review":"Having long been a fan of the 1947 movie of the same name, reading this book was long, long overdue for me. While reading along I couldn't help but imagine the cherished William Powell and Irene Dunne having at each other. It does make me wonder how the story would have struck me without the pretext of the movie to look back on with such strong visuals.The Clarence Sr. of the movie is tempestuous and cantankerous of nature but fundamentally one is left with a positive impression. The viewer never really doubts that he is a good man at heart but one cannot avoid the conclusion that he would be a royal pain to live with. Perhaps in part this is Powell shining through in the role but no matter how many times Father storms about the house at the end of it all you do still rather like him.Father of the book is just as blustery and just as much of a tempest in a teacup but it costs one quite a bit more effort to like him. The author himself (Clarence Jr) goes to small and periodic effort to endear the reader to his father but the attempts ring rather hollow like a man whose protagonist is watching over his shoulder as he writes. There seems just an edge of boyhood resentment that is very carefully scraped off in the movie's portrayal of Father.It is also of note that while the cinematic version is relatively connected and sequential the book takes no such formalities. It seems to jump rather randomly from episode to episode and one is left asking periodically in what decade the particular tidbit is taking place. As such it makes for a very light read but one that requires the reader to throw away any notion of cause and effect.The thread that I came away with most solidly from this bit of literature was less about the book and more about the movie which came after. Powell's Clarence is eerily like the Clarence of the text almost as if the role was made for him specifically. The romantic and nostalgic side of me wants to believe that this is because movies in the 40s were a craft and that viewers would notice and object strongly if their beloved characters of fiction are tinkered with even in the slightest. The fact that the plot itself, if you call a disconnected episodic assortment of remembrances a plot, was only remotely similar seems of little import. In these not-entirely-to-be-believed halcyon days of yore it was character that was important to the viewing public. Today all we want is more and bloodier gun battles between larger and more foul-mouthed devotees of thuggery.If I allow myself to wax realistic for a moment I admit that doubtless my palate has been so repeatedly whitewashed by the movie version of Clarence that I'm not longer intellectually capable of seeing a Clarence Day Sr without seeing William Powell. Psychology of repetition and ordinality aside, Day's 1920 novel is high on my recommended reading list."},{"Title":"Life with father","review":"Life with Father is a collection of anecdotes by Clarence Day, Jr., mostly having to do with his childhood and primarily involving his father.

I had this same book for over 20 years sitting around after my mom had been on a medically induced diet and used it for about a week but then it just got beat up and tossed from box to box. When it came time to actually want to use the book my daughter and I were going to just rip the used pages out of mine and make her an identical one by copying the pages until I thought MAYBE I could find it on the web. I have never purchased a used book online before and was a little nervous but I will definitely consider buying more items from 4Madhatters books. I ordered the book in the middle of the night on Sunday and even with a holiday this week I have already received it and like I said it is in perfect condition. I will definitely USE this book this time around and hopefully be able to learn something from it and lose some weight in the process :)"},{"Title":"Life 101 : Everything We Wish We Had Learned About Life in School -- But Didn't (The Life 101 Series)","review":"Every once in a while we need comfort and wisdom.

I got it about 15 years ago when it first came out. It's a book that talks about personal growth, and about improving yourself mentally and spiritually. It teaches you to overcome obstacles, gives you inner peace of mind, and tries to instill a positive attitude for living life. It's all over the map - it talks about all sorts of stuff in a fun way without being too \\"serious\\" about itself. There are tons of uplifting and insightful quotes throughout the book, and the chapters are highly educational, inspirational, and eye openers. They are written in a non-lecture way with relative short easy to read chapters.Highly recommended if you are the type that desires constant self improvement, are willing to try new things, and want to have a positive outlook on life. It's also quite a philosophical and spiritual book (without advocating any particular religion). The world would be better off if people followed the book's advice. The book is non-judgmental so use the parts that help you, and you don't have to use the parts that don't.I just \\"found\\" the book again, and I am re-reading some of the chapters. Great stuff. I am reminded of how good it was.You can see if you like the book by checking out the free online version.

You'll wish someone had given it to you when you graduated from high school.If you have kids going off to college, give them this book to read on the way. They will thank you. Buy and read everything you can find by Peter McWilliams!I also highly recommend his book \\"Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do - The Absurdity of Consensual Crimes in Our Free Country\\" (you can read it online but you'll want your own copy). I lend these books to friends and never get them back and have to buy additional copies. You might as well buy five or six copies while you're ordering.McWilliams died in 2000 while out on bail fighting an arrest in California for using marijuana for medical purposes. He was required by the judge to turn in urine samples to make sure he wasn't still using it while on bail. The judge also told his attorney he could not tell the jury that McWilliams had AIDS and had used the marijuana to ease vomiting (he died choking on his own vomit).Read ALL his books, share them, give them as gifts.

Interesting take on many ideas. I especially liked the comparison with viewing life as water. Water doesn't 'hold on' or 'cling to' people or things. Instead it flows. You can't hold water in your hand. It keeps moving on, doing it's work. I think of this line often as I sit on the beach or on a pier over my favorite lake.

It is a useful guide how to go through life with less distress. He does it in a witty, amusing and easy to understand way. I think everyone should read his books.

It's the same tripe as 101 other books of the genre. Although, it might be useful to the right person. I'd happily recommend it as a gift for a teenager, or anyone who doesn't usually read books. The book reads a lot like the \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul\\" series, with quirky quotes and anecdotes, but very little substance. On the bright side, after reading Chomsky or Neitzche, McWilliams is a comic relief."},{"Title":"Life 101 : Everything We Wish We Had Learned About Life in School -- But Didn't (The Life 101 Series)","review":"Three things about this book that stand out -1. At first glance, it may seem like very deep philosophy but the authors use a writing style that makes it difficult to accept this as serious philosophy. The authors have a unique writing style where it feels like they are someone you know well that are telling you this stuff at a dinner table. Maybe, they are trying to get their points across by writing this way since the average person avoids heavy philosophy books.2. You can open the book anywhere and start reading without losing the gist of what the authors are saying. The hundreds of topics are written in an independent way that makes it easy to read any one of them without missing anything that the authors are trying to communicate. There are plenty of proverbs, quotations and deep philosophical insights in each topic (each topic is not more than 2-3 pages long).3. The most striking thing about the book is the way in which the authors address each and every topic. They talk about things that most of us have been taught not to discuss in public. Some of their statements sound like cliches but somehow the authors manage to keep the words in each topic interconnected and not seem out of place.A lot of people have the attitude that they are better than this book. By writing in a simplistic way, it is possible that the authors are responsible for creating that impression in the reader's mind (this is simple and irrelevant stuff, no need to write a book about it). But this is one of the best books out there on Life. I would definitely recommend that you own a copy of this book and read it cover to cover whenever you have a few minutes to kill. It is very easy reading but fulfilling at the same time. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Life 101 : Everything We Wish We Had Learned About Life in School -- But Didn't (The Life 101 Series)","review":"I found this book in 1991.

True, some just don't &quot;get it&quot; but that is a valid and useful experience also. Some of these students have contacted me later with a whole new outlook. It just takes time.

His dealings with omniscient human problems are easy to grasp and can be assimilated in ones own experience. If anything, you'll experience a work of true compassion laced with invaluable lessons learnt by hard earned experience. McWilliams is an authentic teacher who disseminates what he truly believes. No hypocrisy here. His sharing of his life experience reveals a strong belief in important values such as sharing, loving oneself and meditation. Money is also discussed and treated as it should be - philosophically and honestly. Obviously, beneath the veneer of this well written, work- of- art -self- help book, lies the portrayel of a true lover of humanity."},{"Title":"Life 101 : Everything We Wish We Had Learned About Life in School -- But Didn't (The Life 101 Series)","review":"I was 13 when my brother handed it to me... wait- i think i was 13! anyways...

The book is written in the style of a manual so that you can dip into it at any point with no need to refer to material that came before.The basic thesis of the book is if you want to enjoy life you have to place one hand on the tiller and steer yourself towards the people, places and things that you like. A way to chart your course is taken from Alan Lakein's \\"How to get control of time and your life\\", which is an excellent book. Strategies for dealing with misteps are also covered.The author tries overtly to avoid religion, but a slight Christian undertone runs through the book, probably unintentionally because of the author's and those he quotes cutltural background."},{"Title":"Life 101 : Everything We Wish We Had Learned About Life in School -- But Didn't (The Life 101 Series)","review":"I use to ponder on the meaning of life all the time. But no matter how much or how hard I thought about that, I couldn't come up with an answer. Everything I did seem meaningless, and I was so empty inside I thought about killing myself many times. Finally during my Jr. year in high school I hit serious-depression. I swear, it was the most painful thing anyone can ever experience. That was the time when I found this book in the library, and for the first time I started to look at life the way a humenbeing should. However, climbing out of depression was &quot;VERY VERY VERY PAINFUL&quot;. Even now I get emotional just from thinking about the past. Iam so afraid, that one day I might visit depression again. At that time I forgotten how to talk, react or feel other people. Because my self-esteem escaped my body. Only thing left in that shell was my heart-which I found out later to be the essence of everything. It was the loneliest and darkest hours of my life. Then I found god, and he lead me to this book. Without this book I could of died. God and this book guided me through those tough times. And I hope it will continue to guide me in the future. And yes! I know the meaning of life now!

But that is not exactly right. These books are offering solutions, if only to give the reader the confidence to live and to seek creative, positive solutions to some of the more serious problems posed to them in their real lives. The are meant to be inspirational and practical rather than some dried up clinical study with answers if you can follow these steps...actually that's the inside joke about this... This book is typical McWilliams. One page has his \\"don't no body bring me no bad news\\" examples, his easy to follow directions and text. The opposing page has a pithy quote from some hi-falootin classical philosopher or (more likely) a tv character we grew up with like Mary Richards or Fred Sanford--in fact in the age of Dr. Phil, I wonder if the McWilliams estate would be so inclined to upgrade this book for a younger generation.

It may even fill the #1 slot. Whatever issues you are dealing with and whatever approach you take to looking at life, this book covers it in a way that does not offend nor patronize. It is not only sensible and inspiring at the same time(a rare find), the authors have a sense of humor that shows through at precisely the right moments. Although it has around 400 pages in the paperback version, it is very easy to get through, plus every other page contains a quote, not full text, so do not let length deter you. It deals with everything from the parts that body, mind and emotion play in your life, both separately and together, to \\"emergency\\" situations such as depression, addictions, being overweight and fear, to many major concepts of physical and mental health and happiness. It is not a book you must read from beginning to end, although it certainly would be worth your time. It IS a book that requires you to think and use if it is to help you. My suggestion would be to read it all the way through and then go back to the parts that applied to you and use the exercises.Although it is a self help book, it does not have that feel, which makes it alot more approachable to those who do not go for the Jungian, Freudian or other abstract schools of thought that often dominate the genre."},{"Title":"Life 101 : Everything We Wish We Had Learned About Life in School -- But Didn't (The Life 101 Series)","review":"I got nothing out of this book.

A Bible? I'm always wary of \\"Complete Guides\\" and \\"Bibles\\", as they inevitably fall short of such lofty glory and nod toward Euro-centrism, as does this book (with honorable mention to Indian spice markets).This illustrated 'bible' has great placement and design, though I expected more comprehensive spice and herb sections, after all the book is 512 pages! For example, this isn't the type of book I'd consult to grow herbs and spices, yet there's a fair amount of info on planning an herb garden (in and out of doors). Pruning this section to make room for more herbs and spices would have been preferable. And with as much attention provide to organizing an herb garden, very little attention was given to the vegetable section, the smallest of all foods, with only 4 [salad] recipes in the tiny section are void of wheat (tortillas), grains (couscous,etc) or roots. Unfortunately, of those same 4 dishes meat was added to at least two of them.Suffice it to say, the food recipes are heaviest on meat and breads, including the soups and starters section. So at the very least, the book encourages health-conscious cooks to explore creative substitutions.The spiced drinks section is great, albeit requiring alcohol, coffee or sugar in most recipes. The spice mixtures, pastes and chutney/preserves are interesting and worth a try.So I've given the book 4 stars, because it's not marketed as a Health and Wellness book, which, it definitely isn't. I do enjoy the writing style, along with the many different recipes and spice profiles. Arguably, my favorite novelty of the book is their recipe for scenting one's hairbrush!"},{"Title":"The Pocket Book of Ogden Nash","review":"Often unheard of poet, Ogden Nash, serves as a reminder that poetry itself does not need to be mushy, polite or romantic. Or for that matter psychological, philisophical or religious. Nash's poetry, written from the early 20's to the late 50's is remark on the social niceties. A critique of the love-hate relationship of men and women. A funny peek into the lives of animals. And silly stories for the sake of being silly. The uniqueness in Nash's work is not the poetry itself, but his play with words. Its clear he does not take language seriously at all which allows him to mix and maneuver words to create new ones that will create a genuine laugh. Such as: &quot;Well I have learned that life is something about which you can't conclude anything except that it is full of vicissitudes. And when you expect logic you only come across eccentricitudes.&quot; The other aspect of Nash's writing is his outlaw verse where, although things rhyme, the rythm is thown askew.&quot;I know that a year has rolled around once moreWhen I find myself thumbing a crisp new cigarette lighter just like the coven of other cigarette lighters strewn on a shelf in the garage along with the broken tire chains and the license plates for 1934.&quot;Nash's work was surely ahead of its time and I am dleighted to have come across such remarkable work. I highly reccomend this, not just to poetry lovers, but also to those that appreciate language and humor."},{"Title":"The Pocket Book of Ogden Nash","review":"I don't really enjoy reading poetry, and I don't suggest reading volumes of poetry at a time.

We see a seagull trying to break open a clam shell by dropping it on Harry's head. He gets caught in a storm and is stranded on an island with a lot of rocks, a scraggly tree, and an egg. As the egg hatches Harry figures it must be a bizzard, but comes to the realization that it's actually a dragon, a dragon that is continually eyeing Harry going \\"Mmmmmmmmmmm\\". The ending is a delightful twist and a valuable lesson is learned--there are fates far worse than death.Don't pass this book up. A good number of titles out there can have the reader laughing on the first page but, can't deliver.

It is really a book about people - the choices they make and/or the fate bestowed upon them - and journeys - both physical and spiritual.This novel is thought provoking, entertaining, and enlightening.I recommend buying at least two copies - this is the type of book that you will want to share with people you know."},{"Title":"Marshall Hollenzer is Driving","review":"This author is as aware of conflict and drama as he is of the magic of the rhythm in a sentence, and that makes for some beautiful reading.Egerton's characters and his story are equally strong and thoughtful, and his unique sense of humour makes for a terrific navigator. The emotions of each character ring true, and each situation seems natural to identify with, no matter how bizarre or dreamlike.This novel is a shiny pebble you want to keep in your pocket, its wisdom executed with style and skill.

It's a quick read that lingers with the reader, to make you think about your beliefs, and what you would do for those beliefs.To each individual, the book could be about God, or the meaning of life, or simply how you fit into the world.

While weaving three sets of seemingly unrelated characters into one neat package, Eggerton takes the reader on an emotional ride of spiritual discovery. His characters are likeable, and the type that we, as readers, come to care about and share in their ups and downs. Altogether, a great read."},{"Title":"Saint Martin de Porres","review":"Tells about Martin's life as a Dominican, the story of the missing silver coin, of Martin's mysterious travels and of the rats and mice at the Dominican Monastery.

As a young student he was fascinated by SOCRATES and the German romantic thinkers and writers. This is one of the 4 most important works of him. Some Kierkegaard lovers even call it his magnus opum. In fact this rather early work (1841) is a dissertation which in particular addresses Socratic irony (and the German romantics). The irony was to him a protest against bourgeoisie and a strong weapon against the speculative philosophy from Ren&eacute; DESCARTES (1596-1650) - Kierkegaard was the first person to demask the lie of Descartes, i.e. his 'cogito ergo sum', \\"I think therefore I am\\" - up until Wilhelm Friedrich HEGEL (1770-1831). In short: against the \\"MODERNS\\" as he named them, even before Nietzsche!THE CONCEPT OF IRONY got quite scant reviews when it was published. This GENIAL WORK of the godfather of existentialism is divided in two parts. The first deals with Socratic irony (as exhibited by Plato, Aristophanes, Xenophon). The main considerings here are about Plato's Socrates as he appears in \\"The Symposium, The Protagoras, The Phaedo, The Apology and The Republic\\". He ever goes on focussing deeper on SOCRATES's RECOUNT OF THE ORACLE OF DELPHI, that said he was the wisest man amongst all, which the Greek wizard understood as he was the wisest because of HIS AWARENESS OF HIS IGNORANCE (while the others were not). Hegel on the contrary didn't see any irony in this: he just took this insight of Socrates at face value.THE SECOND PART deals with German romantism, which Kierkegaard qualified as \\"PATHETIC NEGATIVISM\\", mainly because of the excavation, the depreciation of the \\"consciousness of values\\". As to him IRONY CAN ONLY SAVE MAN AS SELF-CONTROLLED, RESTRAINED IRONY. This opinion still is VERY ACTUAL these days, especially where the themes of CONTINGENCY and IRONY are back AND in front of the agenda of POSTMODERN PHILOSOPHY.FINALLY, S&ouml;ren KIERKEGAARD is appreciated, valued again as he should: he still belongs to the 20, if not 10, most important philosophers ever. Very true, right and correct is it that some years ago he was given the eloquent nickname of \\"THE SOCRATES OF COPENHAGEN\\". THIS WORK OF HIM IS OF COURSE A MUST FOR PHILOSOPHERS, PHILOLOGISTS, SCIENTISTS AND ... for those who want to know more about the phenomenon of irony. AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE IN THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY, VERY WARMLY AND STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.NOTE: This work was originally (thus correctly) named: \\"The Concept of Irony with CONTINUAL References to Socrates\\" and was written in Danish, instead of Latin."},{"Title":"Theft of the Nation: The structure and operations of organized crime in America","review":"Theft of the Nation is a scholarly work. Does a very good job of describing the structure, hierarchy, operations of Organized Crime in America. However, the book was written over thirty years ago.

However, I purchased Caribes via the internet purely because I had been recommended the author and did not realize until I received it that it was the second of a series. Today I was looking for the third in the series - Azabache as I simply have to find out what happens to Cienfuegos next! Caribes is the first spanish book I have read cover to cover and I can't wait to get hold of the next . Great characterization. Vasquez - Figueroa certainly has a vivid imagination which constantly surprises you while instilling a sense of history about the conquest of the New World. Please, please please can Amazon get in ALL of the books in this series as well as Tuareg and Yaiza which I have also been highly recommended (untranslated)"},{"Title":"Cienfuegos (Exitos) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Cienfuegos is yet again another fantastic book from this Canarian author.I taught myself Spanish translating a book by Alberto Vazquez Figueroa - Iguana, and as yet haven't managed to put one of his books down. The Yaiza trilogy was completely unmissable (especially as I was in the Canary Islands when I read them), Sicaro, Tierra Virgen, Ebano, Marfil, and as for Tuareg.......WOW!This author has also invented a fully functioning system for purifying salt water into drinking water and deserves recognition beyond the soil of Spain for his achievements, plus support to finance the solution to one of the most acute problems on this planet - drought and the human misery and suffering it causes.As far as I know Plaza and Janes have not translated all of his books into English and I wish they would. Then his work could reach a much larger audience, all of whom would surely benefit from his breathtaking writing, astute observations of the world and its people, the emotional roller coaster he is able to create with his words, and his experience from his time travelling as a journalist.I am translating Tuareg for some friends as they are desperate to read it.I know that one book - Ebano - was turned into a film with Michael Caine (Ashanti) but all these books deserve a far wider readership than they currently have.My opinion: if you find a book or anything written by this man, read it. I learnt his language so that I could read his work and have never regretted a moment of it.Gracias, Alberto. Y m&aacute;s libros, por favor!"},{"Title":"Cienfuegos (Exitos) (Spanish Edition)","review":"I was given the whole Cienfuegos series (six books in total) as a Xmas present and I didn't stop until I read all of them. The plot is full of action and attractive characters and you learn a lot of History as you enjoy it. Vazquez Figueroa takes you on board the Santa Maria to discover the New World and feeds you with lots of true information about those first and critical years of conquest and colonization. I have not read other books by this author, but I am sure I will in the future. One thing I don't like, though, is the poor literary quality of the text (in the Spanish version). Sometimes you wonder how some of the more obvious mistakes went past all editing controls. Other than that, a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Cienfuegos (Exitos) (Spanish Edition)","review":"The book CARIBES is the second in a series of six books by Alberto Vasquez-Figueroa. The first book being, CIENFUEGOS I, which was an exceptional book that I couldn't put down once I began reading it. The tradition follows with CARIBES, although not as exciting as the first book, this book continues to entertain and makes you laugh, as well as giving you factual knowledge about the discovery of the &quot;new world.&quot; Highly recommended.

I found the entire premise to be nothing short of silly (how many mothers would give up their children based on their supposed involvement in an accidental fire?) The plot was laughable and the main character pathetic. Sorry I wasted my time on this one."},{"Title":"After the Fire (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Belva Plain is one of those authors who I still insist uon reading. But now, after finishing After the Fire, I may very well pass on reading her books in the future. Known for her blockbuster hit Evergreen and the continuation of this family saga, some years ago Plain ventured into more contemporary subjects. I for one sure wish she hadn't especially after reading this book and Homecoming and Fortune's Hand among other titles. Concentrating on today's issues liek spousal abuse, black mail, family issues, adultery and child abuse, I still long to read a book like Evergreen or even her more recent Legacy of Secrets which was her last good book.The theme of After the Fire is once again rich girl marries poor doctor man and while their lives should be picture perfect, they're not. And in one moment the husband is in a position not only to divorce hsi wife but also sue her for custody of their children. The remainder of the book is predictable but all the whiel I wondered why the woman didn't pursue his allegations.I'm sorry I can't recommend this book, even as a beach read and am still longing for another great read from Belva."},{"Title":"After the Fire (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I had never even heard of Belva Plain when I saw this novel for sale at our library, but I thought the synopsis was intriguing and boy was I right.Where to begin? The characters were wonderful--full of real life emotion and actions and often complex. The writing was also well done--admittedly the story started off a bit slow for me, but that is because the real drama of the story was yet to come. Once things really got dicey, it was tough to put this book down (though sadly I had to a few times with everything going on for the holiday weekend). In some ways, the story is part mystery, though mainly it is about a woman, Hyacinth, who is coping with a nasty divorce, limited time with her own children, and an inability to really trust people and sometimes even be around them. She lives in daily fear that her ex-husband will expose a secret that she can hardly believe even happened. Eventually another man comes into her life, but as much as she loves him, her inability to trust him and disclose what has happened in her past ultimately comes between them. Of course, there is her ex-husband's partner, Arnie, who we know is in love with her throughout the entire story, though she doesn't feel that she can reciprocate those feelings. Do you see how the story quickly becomes complicated and heart-wrenching at times? Oh, and as for that ex-husband, Gerald... boy do you love to hate him, or at least I did. A more condescending, unreasonable, unfaithful jerk you'll be hard-pressed to find, though he tries so hard to cover it all up with his \\"charm.\\"When the truth about that tragic secret was finally revealed, I have to admit I was pretty surprised. I suppose I ought to have seen it coming, but I think that in many ways I am as naive as our protagonist, Hyacinth. Plain really did a brilliant job weaving an incredible story that at times seems almost unbelievable, though in reality stranger things have happened. It is rewarding to see Hyacinth's life start to turn around, though her road is certainly bumpy as she tries to move on from what has happened to her."},{"Title":"After the Fire (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read. It is too slow. The author tends to drag on each situation. I think the plot is good it was just not well written at all.

It was an ok read. Probably about as good as what her other books were, but I was in high school/college when I was reading them and tastes change.The premise was pretty interesting, but after a while Hyacinth, who is hiding a secret I won't spoil- starts to get on your nerves. Towards the end you're ready to yell at the novel to just get on with it!! I think the other thing that gave me mixed feelings with this book was that I really just didn't understand Hyacinth as a mother...I won't bore you with it, but I just didn't \\"buy\\" her as a loving mother.If you like Plain you might enjoy this book...other than that I really can't recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"After the Fire (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I assume that this work is indicative of other titles by the author. Never dull, it is remarkably wholesome in spite of &quot;sordid&quot; subject matter. If it's a G-rated romance/soap opera novel you're after, this is a good choice. Not racy enough to be a LIFETIME movie, it will at least be good company on that cross-country airline ride!"},{"Title":"After the Fire (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I could hardly put &quot;After the Fire&quot; aside once I began reading it! I feel each emotion which Hyancinth feels - love, joy, anger, hurt, sadness, pain, shame, pride - as her life develops. How sad that this wonderfully talented woman is manipulated by almost everyone she encounters as well as by a horrible secret that is all consuming. This intelligent, attractive, talented woman is naieve, but also trusting. She is entrenched in negative situations and the grief process so many times, I wonder if she can become an emotionally stable, successful and proud person. As I learn to know and love Hyancinth, I know that she not only can but will endure all that comes her way and, most of all, that she is a survivor."},{"Title":"After the Fire (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This is the story of the marriage of Hyacinth and Gerald.

Hyacinth's needs are those of any wide-eyed young girl who has lived in the shadow of a beautiful mother. She needs only the true love that she doesn't believe she truly deserves.The reader enters Hyacinth's world, feels her trust in the man she loves, and lives her heartbreak as the marriage slowly dissolves, taking her children with it in an ugly divorce based on blackmail. We follow Hyacinth as she finds the courage to make her way alone, while grieving for her children and for the comfort and warmth of the home she had made with them.

I was getting angry at her for keeping in this horrible secret and most of all, witholding it from Will. That, to me, was too much. But, in the end, the truth prevailed.

Eventually she finds her true niche in life through a man who loves her, but her secret past keeps her from marrying him. This is a good page-turner and one in which you do care about the main character."},{"Title":"After the Fire (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"After the Fire, by Belva Plain, is a very good book because it holds your interest and makes you want to keep reading. The plot begins a little slowly as it describes the meeting, dating, and subsequent marriage of Gerald and Hyacinth. The pace picks up, however, once Gerald becomes a successful doctor and their marriage begins to fall apart.When Hyacinth's jealously places her in Gerald's office building the night it burns down, deceit, divorce, and blackmail quickly follow. The twists and turns of Hyacinth's life after her divorce and loss of custody of her children make this book a real page-turner.Belva Plain does an excellent job of describing her characters and making the reader feel their pain. As Hyacinth mopes around the house after Gerald and the kids move to Florida, you want to cry right along with her. When she finally pulls herself together, goes to school, and becomes a successful fashion designer, you want to cheer for her. On the other hand, you want to despise Gerald for being so cruel and keeping the children away from their mother. The reader's heart also aches for the children who are caught in the middle and cannot be told the truth about what is keeping their mother from them.

The character of Hyacinth is totally unbelievable. How can a person live in this world and be so utterly ignorant of what real life is? The further I got into the story, the more incredulous and indignant I became. She allowed her husband to victimize her. Yes, he was despicable but she took it all. If this woman loved her children and wanted them with her as much as she claimed, she would have at least pursued some kind of second opinion, confidential consultation, something! And what about any true and lasting remorse expressed for the accidental death? She only expresses fear of spending time in jail. The woman exists in a complete cocoon.

The story line is a standard and I found nothing redeeming or unique in any of the characters. I didn't feel any empathy for Hyacinth's situation since it seemed totally unrealistic that she would have relinquished her children without resorting to every possible alternative.

However, when cracks appeared (or were the cracks there all along?), there was no stopping the swift breakdown of the marriage and the bitterness that came with it.

Pressured by Gerald, but unable to divulge the secret behind his blackmail to anyone, only when the mystery surrounding the fateful night was solved would Hyacinth be able to get on with her life.The plot was gripping. However, the impressive part was the way the emotional aspects in the book was handled. The sweetness of being in love, the tension between mother and daughter, the bitterness of a marriage breakdown, the pressure and burden of keeping a terrible secret, and the pain of losing loved ones were well-explored.

This was new to me in format because only the first story I had read written by an adult captive and a male.Most of the books seem to be about young children or perhaps a young woman. The treatment and thoughts of an adult male were interesting. I kept wondering if I could have gone thru the ordeal. A quick read and makes you appreciate today! If you like history you will enjoy this true story."},{"Title":"Three Years Among the Comanches: The Narrative of Nelson Lee, the Texas Ranger","review":"I have read the book and most of the negative comments as well.As an author and a person that have lived among the Indians,I am familiar with a lot of what Lee has declared. Indian culture, no matter the tribes, has a great deal of weired beleifs, witchcraft included. They like smoking the weed and getting high.I suggest you buy the story, I assure it walks with truth."},{"Title":"Three Years Among the Comanches: The Narrative of Nelson Lee, the Texas Ranger","review":"Interesting anecdotes of a white man living among the indians, the hardships and struggles, but it's obviously a biased tale. Quite a stretch for the reader to believe that a man- Texas Ranger no less- would be unable to \\"escape\\" before 3 years. Personally I don't believe it. Anyway, while one reviewer highlights a particular commanche torture to an infant, it's best to keep everything in perspective and acknowledge the extreme brutality whites displayed against all tribes in the western hemisphere- for example, Sand Creek, Wounded Knee. That said, if you like stories similar to this, try Nat Love's autobiography."},{"Title":"The Bruce Lee Story","review":"The Bruce Lee story is really good! Linda Lee's book about her husband, the legendary Bruce Lee is a great biographical story! Linda Lee shares her private moments and her thoughts about the man she loved so much! Bruce Lee is the Chinese-American who would eventually become the greatest Martial Artist of all time! The photos from Linda Lee's personal collection are great! Bruce Lee is at his best when pictured on the set of his movies, like the Big Boss, Fist of Fury, Way of the Dragon, Game of Death, and Enter the Dragon! I do recommend this book because Linda lee is the only person who knew Bruce lee better than anyone because she was his wife! their is no information on the death of Brandon Lee because this book was published in 1989.

BL & his JKD are open minded, only truth development we can join this world."},{"Title":"The Bruce Lee Story","review":"I have read this book twice, what a great book! Anyone intersted in the masters life should definitly get this book. It is written by Mrs. Lee, the only person in the world who knew him best. There are great photos, and great detail about their lives together. I have been a fan for over 10 years, and this one is one of the best biographys I've ever read about the greatest martial artist, and philosipher who ever lived."},{"Title":"The Bruce Lee Story","review":"Bruce Lee was an \\"original\\" no doubt..He was an innovative martial artist who created an eclectic style of Gung Fu called Jeet Kune Do, an assimilation of many fighting styles...Bruce didn't believe in systems..he always believed that if you could use something to achieve a result use it! Bruce had many followers and \\"famous\\" students..such as Steve McQueen, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Chuck Norris, Joe Lewis, Mike Stone, James Coburn and many others...Bruce would be the first to admit that he was first and foremost a martial artist...He used the movies to bring his \\"art\\" to the masses and what an impact he made! His films today are quintessential examples of what a martial arts film should be! This book by his wife Linda Lee is a beautifully written biography that offers worlds of insight into who Bruce Lee was as a person..Linda writes lovingly of their relationship and brings a history of Bruce from a baby to his death at the too young age of 32 to you..Bruce lived his life to the fullest and was not only a great martial artist but a very profound philosopher as well...This is a wonderful book and highly recommended, not only to fans of Bruce but to anyone seeking inspiration in their lives...."},{"Title":"The Bruce Lee Story","review":"This was a gift for my son-in-law who is a huge Bruce Lee fan as well as a martial arts student and he couldn't put this book down."},{"Title":"The Bruce Lee Story","review":"I was surprised at how poor a quality the actual book was. It's large, but the paper that it was printed on just made me think how cheap it was.The content of the book was alright. It's a nice short read, but there are parts that are kind of slow."},{"Title":"The Bruce Lee Story","review":"This work really is very one-sided. It is an easy read but does not touch on any of the controversy and true facts surrounding the life and mysterious death of the man himself."},{"Title":"The Bruce Lee Story","review":"Like many Bruce Lee fans, I was dubious when picking up this book, suspecting it would be too sentimental and one-sided, glossing over the \\"true facts.\\" However, don't be misled-- this book is GREAT. Easily among the two or three best Bruce Lee biographies, if not the best. Very well written, well organized, great rare photos. Linda does a fantastic job of giving us an idea of who Bruce Lee was, from the singular perspective of the person who truly knew him best. Sure, it glosses over the more controversial topics that have surfaced over the years (e.g., alleged drug use, personality problems, the circumstances surrounding his death). But you'll come away with a profound respect for the integrated depth of Bruce's genius, his commitment to his family, and his profound sense of integrity and character. And you'll notice that the qualities Linda chooses to highlight are in fact the ones that come out in his art as well as his screen persona. For example, here's a man who, feeling the weight of racial prejudice against himself, was nonetheless willing to physically fight a fellow Chinese for the right to teach Kung Fu to whites! That story is well-known, but the way Linda captures it illustrates Bruce's commitment to principles and his global perspective. Linda does a great job of balancing Bruce Lee as a profound philosopher as well as a uniquely gifted physical specimen. She makes you understand that it was more than simply his physical gifts that made him who he was. Perhaps Karate master Ed Parker said it best: Bruce was \\"one in two billion.\\" In Linda's book, you'll be amazed at how disciplined, far-seeing, and erudite Bruce Lee was-- at such a young age. He was simply WAY ahead of his time. One could easily say that, through the medium of film, Bruce Lee singlehandedly effected a paradigm shift in the world's perception of martial arts, Asian males, eastern philosophy, and action films. This book is a very illuminating and satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Bruce Lee Story","review":"As a UK housewife with young children I have virtually no martial arts knowledge and read the book out of curiosity. I found a truly real book about an amazing marriage and an amazing couple. I think Linda Lee is as extraodinary as her husband. I am left feeling inspired about my own life and shall pass on little nuggets of knowledge to my own kids. This book is for people interested in fellow human beings and not just martial arts followers. It is testimony in itself that nearly 30 years after his death Bruce Lee has inspired an ordinary British woman."},{"Title":"The Bruce Lee Story","review":"An OK book, as far as propaganda biographies go. But if you want to read one genuinely great book about Bruce Lee, make it THE TAO OF BRUCE LEE by Davis Miller, which I recommend over any other biography of Lee. Davis Miller's book is beautiful, funny, sad, a pageturner, and it's the only book to sort through all the hokum and myths to give us something real-world and true."},{"Title":"The Bruce Lee Story","review":"A must for any martial artist who professes to be a Bruce Lee enthusiast.This book was also used for the script of &quot;Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story&quot;, buttrust me when I tell you that that movie barely touches on the true story. Mrs. Lee'sinterpretation of her husband should dispell all myths of the legendary martial artist/philosopher/action star.Here, Bruce Lee is shown as the man he truly is. Don't rely on hearsay; find out about the real Bruce Leeand his thoughts in this book."},{"Title":"The Bruce Lee Story","review":"Bruce Lee. Some things the average reader will not know about this man: Bruce Lee only made four movies in his lifetime. Bruce Lee was an intellectual. Bruce Lee revolutionized the martial arts. Bruce Lee brought the martial arts to the masses.This book is written by Bruce Lee's wife. It is a short and loving memory to an extraordianry man who is still famous. Why exactly is a mystery. Perhaps it is the outstanding artistry Bruce Lee brought to the martial arts.Bruce Lee had been a child actor in Hong Kong before coming to the United States and studying at the University of Washington. Ironically, he was a philosophy major. However, Lee transformed himself into a tremendous human specimen through his physical discipline, and a intellectual regarding his sport. He introduced &quot;the way of the moving fist,&quot; which was a new methodology in the training of martial arts. He also dared to tech the subject to non-Asians, a idea which was tremendously disturbing to many and resulted in a fistfight with a young challenger in Lee's studio in Oakland, California.Linda Lee comes across as a traveler who feels luck in being able to travel (for a brief while) on the road with Bruce Lee. He was convinced to move to Hollywood, where he began training stars like James Coburn, and later Kareem Abdul Jabbar. Unfortunnately, Bruce Lee had to fight racism and stereotypes. At home, his wife's family rejected him because of his Asian heritage. Hollywood rejected him because he didn't want to play the 'chop-suey' roles Hollywood routinely put forth in portraying Asians in film and television. However, a searing performance in the late 1960's on a detective show cemented his star quality,and he made some appearences on &quot;the Green Hornet.&quot;Finally, he made some pictures in the Hollywood system such as &quot;Enter the Dragon.&quot;Unfortunately, his most interesting and allusionary work, &quot;The Game of Death,&quot; which was supposed to be a representation of his philophy of his art was never completed. I believe an assembled film was cobbeld together after his death, but the film was never finished. Interestingly, Kareem Abdul Jabbar played the ultimate obstacle in the movie.Linda Lee's book has many interesting pictures, and I think gives an interesting look at Bruce Lee's life and impact that will have even the most casual reader satisfied.If you are looking for lurid details, conspiracies and the like this book is not for you. Understandably, Ms. Lee does not cover the topic of Bruce Lee's supposed drug use and the unusual circumstances of his death, but what would you expect, this is a loving portrait by a woman who obviously loved Bruce Lee very much. Cheers for her!Interestingly, several weeks ago, I watched a Turkish film in which a charecter kept repeating the line, &quot; I will chop them up like Bruce Lee.&quot; In a Turkish film for crying out loud.Obviously, Bruce Lee ahd a great impact on the world for his incredible talent which was taken from us before Bruce Lee could intepret it for the rest of us. In this way, he reminds me of Jimi Hendrix; Bruce Lee was a shooting star across the heavens.This is a good book, and I believe you will like it as well."},{"Title":"The Bruce Lee Story","review":"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. I also developed another level of respect for the man. This book develops a clear picture of how confident Bruce was in his abilities as a martial artist and an actor. It also illustrates how much courage and confidence it took to brake away from tradition and take martial arts to another level. Linda Lee does not address some of the controversies of Bruce's life, but what do you expect.I learned more about the man behind the legend from this book than I have from any other source. I highly recommend The Bruce Lee Story for any and all Bruce Lee fans.Ted Weimann, author of Warrior Speed."},{"Title":"The Bruce Lee Story","review":"I wish this book could have been longer and more in-depth, but I still enjoyed it immensely, primarily for the countless pictures from the Lee family albums. Fans who are hungry for sordid details about Lee's mysterious death may be disappointed, as this was not meant to be a controversial or sensationalistic book. It's simply Linda Lee's tribute to her late husband, a man who was extraordinarily gifted in disciplines of both the body and mind. That, in and of itself, makes this a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Bruce Lee Story","review":"I have read this book twice, what a great book! Anyone intersted in the masters life should definitly get this book. It is written by his ex-wife, the only person in the world who knew him best. There are great photos, and great detail about their lives together. I have been a fan for over 15 years, and this one is one of the best biographies I've ever read about the greatest martial artist, and philosipher who ever lived. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Bruce Lee Story","review":"Not factual? How can someone say that! It was written by Linda Lee, Bruce's wife! How can it not be factual? I personally found this book very good. It is an easy read, and it is very informative. This book changed my perception of Bruce. Where I once saw a wonderful martial artist, which I still saw, I now see someone who was of profound mind and good heart. His intentions were great, his mind and philosophies greater, and his legacy shall live on forever. If you are a Bruce Lee fan, three words for you: READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Bruce Lee Story","review":"First, this is a good book, but it's not objective -- not surprising in that it's not only written by his wife Linda Lee, but by \\"ghost writer\\" and her second husband, Tom Bleecker, who went on to write a couple of \\"tell-all\\" books after divorcing Linda in 1990. I'm sure this book was presented with best intentions and, with the exception of some repetition, it read well and was chock-full of family photos.It's a good first book on a larger-than-life character like Bruce Lee. It sure blows away anything remotely \\"biographical\\" that the big screen has presented and most definitely pulls the covers off the fictional Hollywood movie \\"Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story.\\"It's a very fast read and succinctly distills Lee's deep philosophical views on the martial arts, in particular, his own jeet kune do. It's a nice insider's view of the incredible and and all-too-short life of Lee, who mysteriously died at 32.I've been a fan of Bruce Lee since the mid-'70s and for my money the best book on him is \\"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit,\\" by Bruce Thomas. It doesn't only look at Lee through rose-tinted glasses and addresses many of the myths about him as well.I wouldn't waste my money on anything else by Bleecker, who asserts that Lee used anabolic steroids and diuretics (though looking at how shredded Lee was in \\"Enter the Dragon,\\" it's not an impossible proposition). He also doesn't discount that a highly potent hashish, not the one pill of Equagesic that was found in his body (along with cannabis), was what killed him and that concrete, not Lee, resides in his Seattle grave.When one looks at the intent of the these books, it's not hard to decide on buying this book as well as \\"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit\\" and avoiding Bleecker's.No man is perfect, but it's pointless to chase crass myths, which because of Linda Lee, this book doesn't do."},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Baby","review":"I read Sweet Dream Baby a few weeks ago, during a period of much stress & strife, and I loved it because I could get totally lost in it and in Travis' wonderful voice (also the great use of popular songs). I quickly ordered Sterling Watson's earlier book from Amazon, but was sorry to find no sequel that would allow me to see if and how Travis and the rest of his seemingly normal (at first), bizarre, sad family navigate the rest of their lives. Fun to read, beautifully written, thought-provoking, disturbing."},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Baby","review":"Sterling Watson's fifth novel, \\"Sweet Dream Baby,\\" has the feel of a well built, well loved home at a time when most novels with bestseller potential are empty houses. Tom Waits sang that a house without love ain't nothing but a house where somebody lives. The characters of Watson's novel don't simply live in its pages; they bring those pages to life. Watson possesses a gigantic heart, and his characters are lucky to have him, lucky to be so loved.His twelve-year-old Travis Hollister comes of age in Widow Rock, a backwoods Florida Panhandle town. It's the 1950s, and wherever teenagers hang out, rock n' rollers like the Killer, Jerry Lee Lewis, shake nerves and rattle brains. The town elders just don't get it, and Travis nestles himself under the young wing of his Aunt Delia, a sixteen-year-old ing&eacute;nue setting the cornerstones for a Southern Gothic love-quadrangle--pentangle if you count the undying paternal love of the Sheriff of Widow Rock, Travis's Grandpa Hollister.Grandpa Hollister is a character along the inscrutable and rigid lines of Thomas Sutpen in \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" by William Faulkner. And Watson's portrait of small-town life on the far side of the Hiawassee River has the sultry air of Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, depicted in \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" and elsewhere. The folks of Widow Rock are no less polite than their Mississippi counterparts; neither are they any less likeable for their peculiarities. Watson is a Southern writer tipping his hat to Sheriff Bill, but he is also an American writer who has channeled the spirit of a young nation in all its postwar, hip-twisting bravado and its infatuation with love in the midst of the baby boom.I was born in 1976, and \\"Sweet Dream Baby\\" made me nostalgic for the youth of my parents, the parking and cruising, drinking malts in juke joints, eating burgers and fries in the backseat of a souped-up street rod. Watson shows us these things again and for the first time through adolescent eyes. His novel is no less adult for the narrator's immaturity. The opposite is true; Travis's age makes for mature audiences because Travis grows up all too fast, comes of age to find himself lost in the kind of love that breaks spirits and psyches along with hearts. \\"Sweet Dream Baby\\" is more racy than sweet--the romance tale of a twelve-year-old boy and a sixteen-year-old girl, complete with a surprise ending as beautiful as it is tragic--an engrossing read bound to interrupt your daily life, leaving your errands undone and your work set aside. When your loved ones want to know what you've been doing and where you've been, tell them not to worry. Tell them you were in caring hands."},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Baby","review":"This story is replete with seemingly simple descriptions that reflect the observations of any 12-year-old boy: women who touch their golden crucifixes when a preacher talks of loose women, small lizards that do push-ups in the back yard--but gradually, as the story creeps up on you, the images get darker, like Delia dancing alone to Sweet Dream Baby while on-lookers weep and the ghostly imagery of raging rain running like blood through the house's gutter, \\"pumping hard as it fights the storm.\\"Reading some other reviews of this great book, it seems like a sequel is in the works. If that's true, bring it on!"},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Baby","review":"Sweet Dream Baby is an amazing novel, and its power grows as time passes. I read the novel when it first came out, and it's still with me. The music, the sight of a swimming hole, even a dusty road can make Travis and Delia appear for me again. What I wanted to know when I put the book down was, does Travis have a chance at a decent life? And what was up with Delia? More and more, I want to find out, because I can't let these characters go. I hope there will be a sequel."},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Baby","review":"Sterling Watson is an author everone needs to get to know.The only problem I had with this book, was that it ended. I want to know what becomes of these so compelling characters. We can only hope that the world can get its hands on a sequel, and soon! The writing is gorgeous. Sweet Dream Baby is an entirely believable (yet ultimately very dark) voyage into the mind of a young boy who slides from youthful, sweetness and innocense down into the murk of an adult world that is too much for him to handle. Travis will just break your heart and you'll thank Sterling Watson for making it happen."},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Baby","review":"Sultry summer nights, passion, music, and a bit of mayhem... Sterling Watson's SWEET DREAM BABY is an unforgettable novel by a wonderful writer more people should know about. (What I want to know is, where is the sequel?)"},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Baby","review":"Sweet Dream Baby is a fantastic book about a young boy trying to understand the puzzles and traumas of his life. I found myself unable to put the book down, and when I had to be pulled away from it, I kept thinking about the characters until I could go back to it again. The voice is incredible: the simple, innocent perspective of a twelve-year old boy in the 1950s. I'd follow him down any road he chose to walk, story-wise."},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Baby","review":"Sweet Dream Baby by Sterling WatsonOn a sultry summer river, two young people explore small town life in the backwater of Florida . This tapestry of a story mesmerized me with its rich characters and tangled landscapes, its troubled families and brooding mysteries.

The narrative voice engages the reader as the child, Travis, captivates us with his moving insight and poignant and powerful observations.All the while there is the delicious development of tension ... apprehension ... melancholy, but finally determined hope for Travis and Delia.In short, I like the many others writing reviews here, can't wait for the much anticipated sequel to the fascinating story found within \\"Sweet Dream Baby.\\""},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Baby","review":"I loved this book - very captivating and I found the characters very beleivable. The plot was tense, and the psychology of the book was dead on. It was gritty and real, and VERY hard to put down. I hope it comes on to Kindle soon!"},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Baby","review":"I gave this book a 3 only because it held me from start to finish, but few of the main characters were believable from beginning to end so I couldn't give it a 4 or 5. Things went from just plain \\"bad\\" to \\"evil\\" way to fast and the actions of Travis towards the end of the book were just too far out of character from how he was portrayed in the beginning. I couldn't buy a 12 year old doing what he did. I certainly did not put this book down and think \\"good read\\". More like \\"well - that was disturbing\\". Still - the author kept me hooked until 1am, so he gets a 3 for keeping me up way past my bedtime!"},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Baby","review":"I won't spend time saying what has already been said so well by others. The reviews speak very well for this book and so they should. This book had me from page one and never let up. The only problem I had with this story was the age of Travis. I thought he was a little young for his character. I still give this book five stars and will read it again in the future. I also reccomend LAURA by Larry Watson and THE LAST PICTURE SHOW by Larry McMurtry"},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Baby","review":"I just finished reading \\"Sweet Dream Baby\\" and, although I agree by and large with most of the reviews I've read, I had to ask this question: Didn't anyone else who read this book find \\"Aunt Delia\\" a bit weird? Granted, she is only 16, and 16 is a tumultuous age when good judgement may not be topmost, but I was not all that sympathetic to her character. She seems intelligent, but continuously seeks to put herself in bad situations. She was treated very shabbily by a past love yet has not learned from this at all. She trusts her 12 year old nephew with her deepest secrets yet lies to him at the most compelling moment--leading him to come to her \\"defense\\" and set up the whole tragic downhill slide at the end. She has to know that what she is allowing her nephew to do cannot be right. Even so, I found the story compelling enough until the ridiculous final scene involving Kenny. What seemed innocent and somewhat justifiable to that point suddenly crossed the line into evil--cold blooded and cruel. With his grandfather (Mr. Honesty and Manners) and aunt as his guides to adult life, no wonder Travis ends up where he does. What does his future hold? With a moral groundworks like he has been given, I wouldn't be too hopeful."},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Baby","review":"I got this book from the library yesterday and read it cover to cover in 24 hours. It is a wonderful coming-of-age book dealing with loss of innocence, and brings back all the physical and emotional feelings that come with puberty. Family dysfunction is dealt with in typical '60's style -- no over-analyzing or self-pity was allowed then!"},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Baby","review":"Watson has created in Travis a remarkable,e vil character -- but one you care for and want to find out what is happening in his mind. This novel deserves to be read."},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Baby","review":"It is important to set the record straight about a work of art. So far, reviewers have praised this novel with contradictory analyses. This is not surprising in a world of readers who can't read more than the words, for the vast majority of readers feel a sympathy with and automatically believe a First-Person Narrator, when in actuality, used to its fullest, it tells a story that (s)he thinks is one thing and the perceptive reader sees is an entirely differenct story. One reviewer said it has a surprise ending; another, a predictably melodramatic conclusion.I shall forgo rebutting other comments such as the secondary characters being stock, that the setting is the familiar stew of small town intrigue and Southern Gothic, and that it breaks no new ground, for these are more of the shallow readings endemic to our state of letters these days.What is important about this book is that it reveals the nature of the story-teller-narrator who unwittingly tells a story that is much more than he thinks it is.Some people will wonder why present tense is used. The answer is relatively simple: It avoids the problems of Why is this person telling me the reader this story now? and Who am I supposed to be? and How can a First-Person Narrator remember all of the action proper and especially every word that every person spoke? Present tense is the natural tense if we are to be privy to a story as it and the mind that tells it evolve.The story and its resolution are set up on the first page, and anyone who goes back and rereads it after finishing the book and who notices during the reading that the child uses almost no subordinate clauses, will see what a well-wrought work of craft and vision SWEET DREAM BABY is. My only compaint is that the title appears to have been changed by the publisher. Mr. Watson surely knows better than to let an editor mess with the spine of a story. And I don't believe for a second that Mr. Watson doesn't know what his story is about. A much more apt title would have been THINGS LOST, for that indicates the controlling image and contains the essence of what the story is truly about."},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Baby","review":"I was told about this writer by a friend of his. I was expecting a lot from his book, but I found it to be very disturbing. Aunt Delia was a sick character and I didn't feel this was a &quot;coming of age&quot; story, but a twisted one. The writing was from Travis' point of view, but still seemed a bit simplistic. I haven't read any other novels by this author, but I hope this is not his usual subject matter. I wouldn't recommend this book to my friends. I finished this book with the same feeling I had when I saw the movie &quot;Deliverance&quot;."},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Baby","review":"SWEET DREAM BABY isn't grand fiction, but it's an engrossing story with a vivid sense of time and place. The author has pulled off the difficult trick of showing the world through a child's eyes and yet supplying the reader with adult perceptions. Parts of the plot are predictable, but at the conclusion predictibility flies out the window. The novel may be set in the '50s, but this is not a Leave-it-to-Beaver ending.Anyone with firsthand experience of the fifties may have to stretch their suspension of disbelief regarding certain sexual behaviors by the protagonist's aunt in relation to her nephew, but the author has traded a bit of unlikeliness for a gimmick that elevates this novel from the usual coming of age story."},{"Title":"A Tally of Types","review":"This book provides a great insight into the history and design of type, and quite a bit of the commentary is useful even today. Morison is well known, of course, for the Times New Roman face - and there is a section in the book on that face. But his commentary on the designing of faces like Plantin and Bembo is much more interesting, if you ask me. Also, if you are at all a fan of Eric Gill, you will like the section on Perpetua and Felicity. Anyone interested in the history of type should have this book, that much is certain."},{"Title":"A Tally of Types","review":"Typography may be unique among arts in its historical ties to commerce. Type foundries create and sell fonts as a matter of business. Trades like printing and advertising have historically publicized type by using it, and driven the creation of new fonts. Typography is also distinctive in that, for such small field, it has so many large personalities.Stanley Morison is one of those personalities, and one of the people who made 20th century typography what it was. He had a unique insight into the type trade of the first half of that century, as well as a wealth of history about several other centuries of type design and designers.The most strinking feature of this book is the way each chapter about some important typeface is set in that face. Seeing and reading a whole page of body text, set and spaced in the usual way, is fundamentally different from seeing menu of &quot;quick brown foxes&quot; or pages of nonsense words. Reading the type is different from looking at letterforms, so this gives real information that specimen books can never provide. (As a personal matter, I realized just how much I dislike the italics with slope angles different in the capitals than in the lower case.)Don't pick this up as a text on typography; beginners won't get much they can use. If you already appreciate that subtle art, if you want to learn more about its history and practice, this is a very enjoyable way to learn."},{"Title":"Moonraker or the Female Pirate and Her Friends","review":"F Tennyson Jesse is among the avant-garde, early 20th-century women writers who challenged the status quo of female stasis and restricted lives. Moonraker, a short novel, or novella, differs from her other, fascinating, novels such as A Pin To See The Peepshow (based on a real murder case) and The Lacquer Lady, set in early 20th-century Burma, elaborating the real story of a woman's experience crossing the delicate threshold between English ex-pat lives and the inner world of Burmese women. Moonraker is experimental and ambitious, stepping outside the expected, using themes of cross-dressing and images of piracy to subvert regular female roles. She includes a rare account of black revolution (Toussaint d'Ouverture's revolt in Jamaica) and her interest in unusual images and character present a refreshingly different perspective on feminine realisation. I enjoyed this novella immensely, and despite some dated prose, it offers startling and enlightened feminism couched in a provocative and sensual plot which would be challenging even in the 21st century."},{"Title":"How to Own Your Home Years Sooner - without making extra interest payments","review":"The previous Amazon post giving a 1-star rating is an aberration and clearly misguided. The particular argument in the book that the poster points out as faulty has to do with showing how a mortgage isn't really the tax shelter most people think it is. The problem in simplifying the concept for the average busy person is that more sophisticated readers (but clearly not experts) can misconstrue the intent as being deceptive. I won't say much more about the poster other than that they're partly right if they're complaining about simple comparisons being potentially misleading, but are 100% wrong in their understanding of why it was important for the author to keep things short and simple (H.Gill apparently has a Masters in Education and I suspect knows his audience quite well).I read the same section, and immediately realized that the argument could be taken further on my own without the author's assistance. The author makes it clear he felt he needed to address a common and simple argument one might hear from a layman about mortgage interest rates and taxes. He then delivered a simplified answer in a similar context, and moved on to the actual education that you paid for and that he expands on expertly. After reading the book (really a large pamphlet, which in actuality is a GOOD thing) you'll realize that you have some work to do. However, after designing and adapting your own financial model to your particular situation, I can't imagine that you would need anything more than a good spreadsheet, and some discipline to keep it updated. The concepts (I count three major ones) are near brilliant in their out of the box thinking and synthesis."},{"Title":"How to Own Your Home Years Sooner - without making extra interest payments","review":"Mr. Gill has taken a very expensive aspect of many of our current finances and shown a very effective (yet extremely easy) way to reduce undesirable debt greatly increasing our speed to financial freedom. Well done Harj Gill!"},{"Title":"How to Own Your Home Years Sooner - without making extra interest payments","review":"These kind of books drag out their point like a movie with a thin plot. The point can be summed up in a paragraph or two. Take a home equity line credit (HELOC) in the amount of your paycheck and make a one time payment to your mortgage. Thereafter, charge all of your living expenses to the HELOC, and pay it off with your paycheck. I checked, and the interest rate on HELOCs is about 10%. So, you are saving interest on a one tme extra payment in the amount of your paycheck, and then paying 10% on the average balance in your HELOC. Even if there is no interest if you pay the balance off by the next due date, your interest savings is the one shot extra payment to your mortgage. Certainly not enough to cut the term of your mortgage by years. OH, while your at it, take all your spare cash and throw it at your mortgage. Lose your job or have unexpected expenses? Hey, just charge it to that high interest rate HELOC. Makes no sense to me. If I am missing something, I am open to being convinced ... someone please send me a spreadsheet with some hard numbers, not pages of pie in the sky stores! I prefer to invest my spare cash in investment grade bonds of several companies maturing in 6 months or so, and just keep rolling over the investments. E-trade has an excellent platform for doing this. I think I have a good idea if a company will survive and keep paying their bonds in the next 6 months."},{"Title":"How to Own Your Home Years Sooner - without making extra interest payments","review":"If you are a homeowner or thinking of becoming a homeowner, you simply must read this book.

It gave me a realization of how little I know or pay attention to of the the mechanics of finance as it is and new ways. A truth is that no one will act in your best interests, if that is so, investing in knowledge like this little red book as it mentions gives dreams a new dimension. With a few one liners and wonderful quotes I now know more of the choices I do have in creating financial freedom. Why don't they teach this at schools ??"},{"Title":"How to Own Your Home Years Sooner - without making extra interest payments","review":"I read the book and I still don't see the concept of getting a HELOC. According to the book using the example given you take out a $10,000 HELOC, you then take $5,000 and make a lump sum payment toward the principle of your mortgage along with your normal monthly payments. You then have to payback that $5,000 you just used from the HELOC till your back at $10,000 then you do it all over again. Reducing the principle reduces your mortgage quicker and you pay less interest over the life of the mortgage. Meanwhile, how ever long it takes you to payback the $5,000 to your HELOC your getting charged interest while paying back the $5,000.Lets say for example you have a savings account with $10,000. You then take $5,000 and make a lump sum payment toward the principle of your mortgage along with your normal monthly payments. You then start putting money back into your savings account meanwhile your getting interest on the savings in your account. When your back to $10,000 in your savings account you do it all over again. Again, reducing the principle reduces your mortgage quicker and you pay less interest over the life of the mortgage.Now can someone explain it to me. What's the difference? Whether you do a HELOC or a savings account the outcome is the same. You have to be disciplined in saving your money and making lump sum payments toward your mortgage principle. The only difference I see is if you don't pay back the HELOC you can lose your home."},{"Title":"How to Own Your Home Years Sooner - without making extra interest payments","review":"Very educational on how mortgage interest is calculated, however, there's no need to go through the gyrations of using HELOC's, etc. Set a budget and a fixed additional amount to pay toward your principle every month and you're good to go."},{"Title":"How to Own Your Home Years Sooner - without making extra interest payments","review":"This is the best book I have ever read about mortgages and how money work with them.

Why? Because the financial institutions will lose money, while the consumer gains. Don't let this happen to you. Because of these critical financial concepts, contained in Mr. Gill's book and on his website: MortgageFreeUSA.com, my son will attend a private music school in 2005. Every American home owner owes it to herself/himself to read this book! Good luck to you!"},{"Title":"How to Own Your Home Years Sooner - without making extra interest payments","review":"Sometimes I think there is no hope for America! All this back and forth over a single, simple math concept is annoying because it speaks to the fact that too many of us are too lazy to figure things out for ourselves.First, you need to know how a mortgage is structured; specifically, you need to understand that when you make a mortgage payment, you first pay interest on the outstanding balance and whatever amount is left over is applied against the principle. What that means in English is that the sooner it is in the term of your mortgage, the more interest you pay.Any amount of principle you pay in advance will lower the total amount of interest you will pay over the life of the loan and shorten the term of the loan, as well. The amount to prepay being bandied about here is $10,000 and if you were to pay that amount in year one of your mortgage (30yr/6%), you would avoid appx $40,000 in interest charges and shorten the term of your loan by almost seven years!Do the math, knuckleheads!I cannot in good faith, however, recommend the system detailed in this book for most people simply because the level of self-discipline, bookkeeping, and, yes, math required by it is too high for most of us. And, for most of us, taking on additional debt in the form of a HELOC is too risky and unnecessary, besides, to accomplish the goal of paying off your mortgage sooner rather than later.If you want to have mortgage debt for as little time as possible, simply buy only as much house as you can afford using a 15 year mortgage. However, that must be too simple for most people. And people usually fail to follow that advice because they want to buy more house than they can actually afford; in other words, they lack the self-discipline to learn or apply basic personal financial management techniques and strategies much less the skills that will be required to pull off the strategy in this book![...]"},{"Title":"How to Own Your Home Years Sooner - without making extra interest payments","review":"I learned about this in January 2007. I started using the concepts and the software in February 2008. I've paid all my revolving credit off and have started reducing the principal on my primary mortgage. I'm so grateful for what this has done for me that I've started holding free, no catch, no strings, no solicitation seminars to teach people the concept. This concept does two things: 1. helps you come to terms with your household cash flow 2. takes that knowledge and teaches you how to pay off all your debts (credit cards, loans and mortgage). The concept is based on math. It will cost you nearly nothing to try, you'll get immediate results, and if you don't like it you can stop and you will have lost nothing - not even the cost of the book or software because if you try the system just once - you will have saved so much in interest it will have more than paid for all costs!

For instance, the author argues that owning a home is more expensive than not owning. This is true if you compare a person living under a tree versus one owning a home. He argues that the person owning a home has a negative cash flow of 8k per year all due to the interest he pays on mortage. But the details he left out (just to make his useless point) is, the person who owns a home has a home to live for a few hundred more bucks a month, whereas the person who doesn't own a home has to pay may be 10-15k per year for rent. That wipes out the savings that the author is claiming. Not only that, that money is down the drain since it goes to the landlord, whereas the owner of the home builds equity.My recommendation is to stay away from this nonsensical book, else you will be screwed if you follow his advice."},{"Title":"How to Own Your Home Years Sooner - without making extra interest payments","review":"This book was a simple and quick read so feel free to make your own conclusions, but I can't agree with all the other evaluators. This book provides nothing more than an avenue to sell a product. Like the author states the concept is not rocket science, but to separate truth from reality in this book is rocket science. It would take some explaining to clarify the point of the book. An example of a non-truth can be found in the first few pages. The author sets up 2 individuals and claims they are equal. Then he states that one has no mortgage and one does. Then uses the numbers to show how having no mortgage is better. The problem is if the two were equal then the one without the mortgage would have to have an equivalent amount in cash or investments. If that amount made the same as the interest on the mortgage then the one with the mortgage would would have come out ahead and would be equal if they had to pay taxes on the invested gain in the future. The assumption is poor. Decisions like this should be based on your financial outlook, risk tolerance, and future goals. Not a program that isn't really a program at all."},{"Title":"How to Own Your Home Years Sooner - without making extra interest payments","review":"I also saw Harj at Millionaire School in 2006 and he was great.One of the previous reviewers called the book deceptive and even pointed out an example from the book:\\"The author sets up 2 individuals and claims they are equal. Then he states that one has no mortgage and one does.\\"He must not have read the book very carefully.\\"Then uses the numbers to show how having no mortgage is better.\\"What the book actually used that example for was to show that the tax deduction for mortgage interest paid alone is not worth maintaining a large balance on your mortgage. The tax deduction will help ease the pain, but it will never make up for the money you spent paying interest. A house is definately a great investment but why pay more more money in interest than you have to?This is a revolutionary book. In fact, it's already revolutionized the Australian banking industry.I've implemented this system already. I opened a new HELOC account (no application fee or closing costs required).

Heck, my mom, with just a bit of cash from selling the family home, could profit from this book even though she doesn't now have a mortgage!What I really liked about &quot;Own Your Home Years Sooner!&quot; was the simple, step-by-step explanations of what could have been complicated financial hoo-hah to some of us, myself included. Usually I pass this type of stuff to my 'former banker' husband. But even I could understand how Harj's system works and was even able to talk to others about it in a coherent fashion.If you are considering any of those bi-weekly or weekly payment plans and the like, you MUST read this. The author gives a great rundown on these programs and how they work (or don't work).I read the first edition and talked with the author too and know he has even more helpful chapters planned for us. Be sure to see his website for the latest updates.It's a quick easy read, but you'll be referring back to it as the potential of it begins to sink in. You really can own your own home sooner.As I do not yet have a mortgage (we are looking for a home and mortgage right now), there was not a lot of specific advice for first time home buyers. Talking with the author, he really wrote the book for people with mortgages, but with the 80-100% LTV loans now available in the US, he may have to add yet another chapter to this book for us on the purchasing side.Even without the specific advice, I was able to talk rather intelligently with a mortgage company owner using the lingo I learned in the book and that itself was worth the cost of the book! Now we also know what to look for in a mortgage as we shop. Get it, read it, apply it. It's simple really.P.S.

It is terribly repetitive. The basic premise is that one can use a HELOC instead of a Checking Account so that your money doesn't sit around idle while mortgage interest is accruing. This may have some merit, but it is not clear how much of the savings is due to putting all of your disposable income towards your mortgage. The big trade off is a loss of liquidity. I have been aware of this strategy for a while, and I hoped that this book would help to prove its effectivness, and explain exactly how to do it. It falls short.

Harv Eker and Secrets of the Millionaire Mind). I bought his book immediately, knowing it would be the best $25 I'd ever spent on wealth creation. If we continue at the pace of the last four months, the remaining 28 years on our dream home in Sedona will be reduced to 5 years and 3 months.How does this create wealth? Which would you rather have? Tax-deductible interest payments or high-yield, tax-liable interest earnings? Duh! Our $240,000 interest savings will be invested in wealth-creation opportunities, such as more properties.In case you're wondering, No, this isn't about paying twice a month or making an extra payment each year.

It helps you keep more of your money while still paying off what you borrowed, only faster.For a conventional mortage, most of the payments in the first few years go primarily to paying the interest on the loan, with very little going to the principal. With most people moving to a new one (trading up) every 5-7 years, they wind up paying LOTS of interest with very little to show for it. The banks get VERY rich this way.With this book, you can learn how to move out of that pool of quicksand and stand on solid financial ground.

Before you naysayers boo me on this please read on. I have run the numbers doing a simple extra payment plan equal to paying off the HELOC that this book recommends you use. First of all you need to know the theory. The theory is simple. YOu get a HELOC (you need to have equity in the property you are attempting to eliminate/accelerate.) If your home was purchased prior to the drop in real estate values then the 10%, 15% or 20% you put down has vanished so you don't have a way to get a HELOC because the HELOC requires that you have equity in your home. YOu also have to qualify for the HELOC with a financial institution. This would require you to have extra income to be able to pay for your HELOC payments along with your usual mortgage payments. An example you would be you taking out a $15,000 HELOC. In the first month of your mortgage you take out $10,000 from your HELOC and you throw that at your mortgage along with your first month's mortgage payment. This reduces your mortgage by the total of the $10K plus your monthly payment. You now have reduced your mortgage balance by quite a bit and thereby eliminated a lot of interest you would have to pay. Next you spend the next 6 months replacing that money by making 6 payments of $1666.66(actually a bit more depending on your interest rate) per month thereby taking your HELOC balance owed back to zero. You then throw another $10,000 again from your HELOC along with that month's payment at your mortgage again and you do it all over and over until your mortgage is gone. Depending on the size of your mortgage your mortgage will be gone in well under half the 30 years that you were scheduled to pay (360 months.) Remember that you still have to make your usual monthly payments every month. Now if you just happen to have even more extra money then you can throw that money at your mortgage too and that will save you a pile of interest and thereby pay off your mortgage even sooner. The reason you don't use all of the $15,000 HELOC is because you want to be sure you have the $5000 available in case of an emergency. Chances are pretty good that between your mortgage and your HELOC that nobody will issue you anymore credit so that $5000 is there to take care of any unforeseen event. Now on to why this BOOK's THEORY is NOT necessarily all that great. If you were to simply pay the $1666.66 extra every month rather than doing the HELOC method you would only take 2 months longer than doing it with the HELOC. The interest rate is nor the amount of the mortgage makes a difference. The only difference is in the amount you will save since the extra two months will be 2 times the monthly payment more that you've paid plus a little interest. Now if you have a large mortgage then your payments are big and that times 2 equals substantial money. If your mortgage is small (like $200K or $300K) then it's really not even worth the hassle to set up the HELOC. THE DANGER OF THE HELOC is something that people without discipline should not undertake and that is the availability to more money (more debt.) If you can't resist the temptation to spend then stay away from a HELOC period because if you can't pay the bank will take away your home. YOU DON'T EVER WANT TO LOSE YOUR HOME !!!! TRUST ME, BEEN THERE DONE THAT ! Last but not least....IT IS incredible how much you will save on a 30 year mortgage. Always remember that if you pay for the full 30 years you will pay nearly three times the amount of your mortgage over that 30 years. So if your mortgage is $200K then you will have paid about $600K at the end of 30 years. Saving over half that amount is much better. If you pay $275,000 then it only cost you $75,000 for the ability to make payments. Much better than paying nearly $400K for the priviledge of making payments. Who can't use an extra $325,000 ????? The bigger the mortgage the bigger the savings !"},{"Title":"How to Own Your Home Years Sooner - without making extra interest payments","review":"When I read Mr. Gill's book, for the first time ever, I realized it was possible to own my home before I'm old and grey! The book also opened my eyes to the advantages (think peace of mind) of having a strong equity base rather than being leveraged to the hilt and constantly panicked about my debt load. The book is clear, inspiring and a quick read. Above all it is informative. I feel I can now tackle my home loan and pay it off on my terms rather than the bank's. Boy does that feel empowering! I'm telling all my friends about this!"},{"Title":"How to Own Your Home Years Sooner - without making extra interest payments","review":"I am a retired high school math teacher and my wife taught elementary school. After we retired we moved and were not looking forward to paying a mortgage for 30 years. We are so happy we decided to read and try the system described in this book. The amazing thing is not that we will have our mortgage paid off in just 5 years, although thats pretty great, the best part is we are doing it without any change to our life style. We still take the same vacations and get out to play golf like we did before we read \\"Own Your Home Years Sooner.\\" If you have heard, if it is too good to be true it isn't, then you have probably heard, every rule has an exception. This is the exception to the rule. Please don't listen to the nay sayers on the web. It really does work...our home will be paid off in the fall of 2014.Okay here comes the math teacher in me. You do need to have a 20% equity position in your house. For example, if your house is worth $100,000 you should owe $80,000 or less...if it's worth $200,000 you should owe $160,000 or less. If you have a 20% equity in your home you qualify for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) which is necessary for this program. Let me stop right here and say that if you are the type of person who can not be disciplined about their spending habits this program is not for you. Please stop reading and forget you ever heard about it. Here's why. We qualified for a $75,000 HELOC. That money is for the program and not to be spent on \\"stuff\\". If you can do that then get the book. If you can't please walk away now.Our son and his wife are language arts teachers. They do not qualify for a HELOC because they don't have 20% equity in their home. When they were visiting we sat down and crunched their numbers and found out they could pay their home off in 7 1/2 years. We found out that the program would work for them but they can't start it until they can qualify for a HELOC. I went to the website referred to in the book and found another program that this author has written. It's a debt elimination program that is for people who do not qualify for a HELOC...yet. I purchased the program for the two of them which they will be starting soon. Since they haven't started the program yet I don't feel I can comment on it.

You know you won't remember it once you finish it, and you're pretty sure you aren't meant to delve too deeply into it, but while you're in it, you have fun.Such is Stuck with You, by Trish Jensen. This is a seriously silly book, but it doesn't pretend to be anything else. You are intended to read it, enjoy it, and then pass it on to the next reader. If you enjoy the love scenes, all the better.Paige Hart and Ross Bennett are stuck in hospital quarantine together, victims of a courthouse bombing. Both lawyers, they were on opposite sides of a case, and Paige despises Ross' specialization of divorce law. They are quarantined because of possible exposure to Horny Monk Disease.I am not kidding you.No doubt you are shocked to find out that sparks fly in the hospital, beginning with Ross' choice of apparel. \\"She'd had to suppress a squawk of irritation when she'd seen that his choice of clothing consisted mainly of running shorts and T-shirts. Plain old flip-flops on his feet completed his look. He could have done her the favor of covering up his legs. She didn't need the distraction of his leg muscles flexing with every move he made. And when he needed to bend over, he could at least be polite enough not to do it with his back turned toward her. A position that displayed the contours of his butt in mouth-watering detail.\\"So, yeah. You will not be taxed mentally when you read this one.But it's fun. Along with Paige and Ross' quarantine, we meet their doctor, Rachel, and Paige's brother, Nick, who have a Romantic History. (Yes, if you look closely, you've got a Ross and a Rachel. A shout out to Friends, perhaps?) Even though you know full well how this will end, there are some humorous moments. At one point, Ross and Nick commiserate over their lady friends' inability to commit.Stuck with You isn't going to stretch your thinking or challenge you.

Wish I could remember what possessed me to download this. It's your basic romance novel formula with an attempt at a comic twist provided by the large collection of southern relatives. The characters did not amuse me, and the premise that brought the leading couple together was just preposterous. I suppose it's not any more far-fetched than soap opera plots on TV, though. This wasn't the worst book I have ever read, it just didn't evoke any kind of reaction in me other than BLEH. Frankly, I was most interested in the back story involving the main character's brother and the woman he hadn't seen since college, although even that was a bit of a stretch in the way it played out. The back-and-forth between the two principal characters was tedious and even the sex scenes were ho-hum.

Even though she studied tax law, her family doesn't care, they ask her to help them with everything from divorce to shoplifting.Ross Bennett is a decent guy, too. He doesn't have a big family, but he does a lot of charity work in the community, and he's a very good attorney who never takes sleazebags for clients.When these two meet, they are working for opposite clients in a divorce case, and they argue a lot, in funny ways. Then one day they're around when an explosion goes off at the courthouse, they're sent to the hospital in an ambulance infected with a &quot;love bug,&quot; and end up locked up together for weeks! Talk about a sexy, funny idea!I thought Paige and Ross were both very likeable people, and the way they fought was funny. I liked the way they had such a sexy relationship, and how all Paige's relatives butted in.

Some original sports lessons fail to enlighten these randy barristers, and when they get out, and Ross's divorce business starts going down the tubes, things get even more confusing. Are they, by chance, spreading TCV to the troubled couples of Atlanta? If so, is what the are beginning to feel for each other a viral illusion?This is a funny, madcap book.

The idea behind the comedy--that the hero and heroine are quarantined together--is really cute, and very sexy.I think the very best part of the book is the beginning, when the hero and heroine are sniping at each other in funny ways, while we the readers know how very much they are attracted to each other.

There was nothing really original to it. Although I think it's pretty hard to write a completely original romance. The two characters, Paige and Ross, were okay, but nothing special. In addition to the forced closeness they are thrust into with their contagious disease, there is also the classic misjudgement. Paige hates all divorce attorneys, which Ross is. And there are multiple instances of her being rude to him, and judging him based on stereotypes of his profession. After the first time she was wrong it was pretty obvious where Jensen was going with Ross's character.I actually wish more time had been spent developing the relationship between Paige's brother Nick and their doctor, Rachel. I really felt like their relationship would have been more interesting, especially when a situation with Nick develops near the end. But Jensen does absolutely no development into it on Nick's side and because of that it comes off as just an attempt to maneuver Ross and Paige back together again.Overall, it was an okay read. I just wish there had been more depth to it."},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"This book is very sexy! But as exciting as that is in a romance, I really liked even more that what attracts the hero to the heroine, and vice versa, isn't just how good looking they are (though they are both, of course, gorgeous), but that they are sharp, witty, fast-talkers, both of them. I also like that they are also both really decent, caring, generous people.Above all that, what I really loved is that Trish Jensen is a fantastically funny writer! This book really moves along at a great clip. I couldn't put it down. I kept picking it up on my breaks at work and read it straight through until late last night.

The Very Rare Tibetan Concupiscence Virus, known as TCV was transmitted when the courthouse they were battling in practically blew up from a bomb and they were exposed to the virus when the ambulance coming to the rescue just happened to be carrying the weird virus on its way....well, you get the idea, lol...Anyway, fun soon ensues when they are quarentined together in a hospital room for 2 weeks and the virus begins to show its symptoms...all raging hormones... symptomatic to the disease that isn't harmful, unless you consider what two people that hate one another with a passion can manage to do with these unbearable conditions.Trapped with nowhere to go and not much to do except ignore one another or at least try and get along...Paige is forced to admit she is attracted to the 'Snake Lawyer' as he is known.But as time wears on, she knows it HAS to be the virus. She hated his guts when she arrived here, now she...well...she has this little crush so to speak, on him and its getting worse by the day.Ross on the other hand is coming to appreciate this time to get to know his enemy better. He never realized how pretty she was or how witty she was...or how stubborn and petty she could be. God he wanted out! This virus is wreaking havok on his mind and his body! Talk about permanent...nevermind.But as time goes on, they start to wonder if its really the virus taking its nasty hold, or something far greater altogether...the love bug perhaps?Funny with lots of hilarious dialog.

She feels he is low down snake while he deems her to be shrew. Anyone, especially the two lawyers preferring not to be certified as nuts, would ever suggest that below the surface of disdain Paige and Ross are attracted to one another.However, a disaster strikes when a blast shakes the courthouse. Overtaxed emergency crews rush victims to nearby Atlanta vicinity hospitals, but Paige and Ross were delivered by individuals carrying a special vial for CDC. The duo may have been exposed to Tibetan Concupiscence Virus. Better known as Horny Monk Disease, Ross and Paige are quarantined together in the already overcrowded facility, but begin to find the other oh so alluring. However, both wonder if they suffer from external or internal chemistry as they threaten to combust.STUCK WITH YOU is a delightful romantic romp that refuses to apologize for its humorous look as to whether the lead couple suffers from TLC or TCV. The secondary characters provide even more amusement as Trish Jensen takes a 1930s screwball romantic comedy and turns it into a modern day madcap adventure. The Atlanta area will never look the same for those readers familiar with the steps of the Fulton County Courthouse.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"I loved this story!

Now while normally I would try to say his is about love and there is nothing more magical. But here is is really about the power of belief. And, if that doesn't relate to the paranormal I don't know what does. Having something like a disease on which you can base behaviors is the basis for a lot of \\"magic.\\" And, a lot of medicine. The mind is the most powerful source of magic.It's interesting that a person who is a lawyer could be so prejudiced against an other kind of lawyer based on assumptions such as all divorce lawyers are snakes. And, that the snake in question has the patience to help her come around.The plot is surprisingly complex for a lighthearted romp through the hospital bed sheets. The voice is snarky but not obnoxious. The characters fall out of type. The writing is good, with a few typos, but the sex is well written. I liked the many small details Jensen uses to make the characters and situations human or somewhat believable, like using sports as metaphors for sex, and watching to Three Stooges between visits from members of Paige's family.This is a a fun and unusual story and I would even buy it if I hadn't downloaded the promo.A solid recommend!"},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"Paige Hart is a tax attorney who hates divorce lawyers.

Of course, from the beginning of the book you can feel that intense attraction they have for each other; and thereby, attracting the reader that much more.As both are walking out of the courthouse still badgering each other, an explosion erupts that flings Paige into Ross. And before you know it, they are in the hospital quarantined together in the same room. Come to find out, both were transported to the hospital in an ambulance that was carrying bio-hazardous virus material. Now both of them are stuck together for 14 days under confinement until their virus, known as the \\"love bug\\", can be monitored and remedied.After days together, their attraction begins to heat up and intensify that much more. During this time, the flirtatious, good-humored harassing, as well as getting-to-know each other, begins to unite them together even more. In fact, all either one can think about is the sexual desires they have for one another, and their fantasies are very vivid. The electrifying current that streams between the two is so forceful that eventually neither one will be able to control themselves. But there is a reasonable explanation for the dreaded erogenous feelings they find so uncontrollable towards each other, which they both believe is the side effects of the \\"love bug\\" virus. So they go along with it and eventually release each other's nagging needs and throw themselves into each other's arms with some heavy-duty passionate kissing and some of the most erogenous touching.But when they are finally cleared and released from the hospital, the anxiety they both feel is justified by the aftereffects of the virus. Until two days after their release, they both realize how miserable they really are without each other. And so the reader will have to read on to find out the outcome of Ross and Paige's developing connection and those once compelling, passionate feelings they possessed. And the journey will take you through what they must endure before both realize the truth.With an adorable premise and two of the most fun-loving characters, this story makes for one sizzling light-hearted, extremely enjoyable read...being locked up with the most hated, and yet, the most attractively hot male attorney makes for one intensely satisfying journey.

Cute story!"},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"What happens when the Snake meets the Shrew? An explosion for starters. This is an extremely cute story perfect for a lazy day afternoon or a beach read. Paige Hart and Ross Bennett have intense sexual tension between each other from the beginning which only gets stronger due to a combination of being quarantined together and the possibility of contracting the Tibetan Concupiscence Virus.This book contains many clich&eacute;s and it's characters conform to stereotypes but that doesn't detract from the story. I admit at times I did get a little frustrated with all the legal terms and lawyer speak that Paige and Ross inserted into conversation whilst they were flirting but I still enjoyed their banter. Paige was a little too shrill and I could picture her stomping her foot when things didn't go her way. As for Mr Bennett? He was a little too perfect in my eyes. Too handsome, too caring, too everything. I just wanted him to have some flaws. Him being as perfect as he was started to get on my nerves. He needed something to be less than perfect so that he would appeal to me a little more. However, as a match for Paige, I really liked them together.This book also contained a love story between Paige's brother, Nick, and her doctor, Rachel. I enjoy reading about characters who have a complicated history together and these two definitely had that. I would have liked to have seen a little more of the two of them. For me they were the more interesting relationship and they had a lot more to sort out together however they were given a lot less face time with the audience. I felt like their story was wrapped up a little too quickly and a little too neatly all things considered.This book was first published ten years ago and with it's re-release you can tell that some things have been updated - like Nick's use of an iPad. There were other things that I felt should have been changed too (like Nick calling the restaurant from Rachel's home phone instead of a cell/mobile phone). The TV shows that were referenced in the story were all rather old but I found myself liking that. I knew the exact episode of Friends they were watching!Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and learning new sports euphemisms.

The book is mainly about Paige and Ross however we do get a little of the relationship between Paige's brother Nick Hart and his former scorn love Rachel Turner. Paige and Ross are both successful lawyers who are on opposite sides of a case involving Paige's cousins messy divorce. Paige has even nicknamed Ross the Snake, because she dislikes him so much. As luck would have it the pair is in a bombing and rushed to the emergency room in a ambulance that happened to have a exotic virus the duo might have contracted while on the way.They wake up in the hospital quarantined in beds next to each other for the next fourteen days to see if they have Tibetan Concupiscence Virus. The virus makes people lust after one another, Ross and Paige are no exception to this either they are both instantly feeling the attractions to one another. However Dr. Rachel Turner informs both of them that it's to early to be feeling symptoms. Over the next fourteen days the pair makes a contract to avoid any kind of lustful behavior that could cause them to do the unspeakable.Nick is dead set on fixing what happened back in college with the woman he loved, but she's resistant thinking all those years ago he had left her after she helped him pass his biology test. After Nick's persisting she agree's to a date and learns that he didn't ditch her after the test that he'd returned home to help his sister out and when he returned to school and she was gone he was heartbroken.This is a cute story a little heavy on the lusty parts for my taste but the romance of it was cute. I like that we get both sides of the story not just her side. Plus I love the little relationship of Nick and Rachel, everyone needs a little romance in there lives. This book at first was a little hard to get into because of the action right away but the more I got to know the characters the more I wanted to know what happens. It's a good story with a cute ending. This book is filled with humor, that keeps you smiling through most of the book. I think the characters are well written and you get a good idea who they are. Even though her story was short I loved Rachel over Paige because she was just so sweet."},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"i loved this book! its undoubtedly a must read!! i need a sequel! im going to be forcing the library fo get this! it definitely deserves these 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"Leave it to Trish Jensen to figure out a way to trap her hero and heroine in a hospital room together, under quarantine, where they have no choice but to work together, live together, and fall in love.

It is not long into this book when you fall for these characters. Ross has a sense of humor no woman could deny was her undoing and Paige is just adorable and while brilliant in life not so much in love (the sports analogies are so cute). These characters jump off the page and make you smile and laugh. (And the Scrabble scene is not to be missed!) * The secondary story of Rachel and Nick should have been a book all on its own.* Pick up this book if you didn't in 2001 and enjoy it!Paige and Ross are both lawyers. And while he is a divorce lawyer Paige is usually in tax law, that is until a family member asks Paige to help with her divorce (or any other law a family member needs handled). So now Paige and Ross are on opposites sides of the table. At least until the explosion at the court house.

It was a different twist on throwing two very mismatched people together for a long period of time, but it had a lot of holes in it.

A lot of sexual flirting, language and sex scenes thrown in too.Paige is a tax-lawyer and is handling her cousin's divorce. Ross is the divorce lawyer who is handling the other side. As they are leaving the court and arguing a bomb goes off. Throwing Paige into Ross knocking her out. They are taken by ambulance that gets in a wreck where they are infected or at high risk to a dease that causes lust. They are quarantine in thea same room together.Paige and Ross are thinking they must be infected because they are having lots of sexual thoughts about each other.Paige has a big extended family who all come to her with their legal troubles of anykind. Even though she is just a tax lawyer.Paige's big brother in collage had a one night stand with her now Dr. who he did not reconized at the hospital.Its all over the top and hard to believe any of it and get lost in the story. But if you want to just be entertained by romantic comedy it works.I was given this ebook to read in exchange for honest review from Netgalley.01/01/2012 PUB Bell Bridge Books"},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"Two lawyers are representing opposing sides in a divorce case. The thing that has the bickering couple to a stand still are two things, custody of the dog and later on some conditions on the house. Page isn't even a divorce lawyer as her specialty is tax law, but Jasmine is her cousin so she's taken on the case for her. Ross is a divorce lawyer who has some conditions on the cases which he takes, he refuses to represent anyone who is a cheater or has been cheated on. I think this would make it harder to find clients, but it does make him a little charming. They are in fact arguing over the case outside the courthouse when an explosion rocks the place. They then later end up waking up in the hospital room which is curiously on a very dark hall for a hospital, not to mention that they are sharing a room and neither has injuries that should have necessarily caused for hospitalization.When finally a doctor shows up in the hospital room, it turns out the ambulance that picked them up may have contanimated them with TVS, some exotic disease that among other things can make you horny. There is no way to know whether they contracted the virus so in the meantime they are to be quarantined together for the next two weeks. They set up a few ground rules and try to get along all the while fight the attraction that's blossoming between them. It's not that many days into the quarantine that they give in to their attraction to each other with lots and lots of foreplay. But when the quarantine comes to an end was it really genuine or were the doctors wrong when they say they never contracted the virus after all.There is also a bit of a side story of Nick who years ago slept with Rachel once and didn't contact her the next day. And then shortly after she didn't return to school. I'm glad the back story was revealed because it both made him look less bad and also the reason she didn't return to school ended up having nothing to do with him. Do he and Rachel get a second chance and do Ross and Page see each other after the quarantine or do they brush it off as nothing, either they really had the virus or an attraction as a result of being alone together for so long in such close quarters. This was a really cute romance and I'll consider the author again in the future."},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"I love books that make me laugh, and a friend told me about this book. I paid full price, and I feel somewhat had. Ms. Jensen has a gift for humor, but the plotting involved in this book is horrible.

Their closed proximity forces them to deepen their understanding. Paige's large and comically larcenous extended family as well as a side romance between the doctor and Paige's brother provides first-rate entertainment while we are stuck with the oddball couple in their tension-filled and delightfully emotional romance. Trish Jensen delivers dimensional chracterization through punchy dialogues that are fresh, witty and funny."},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"Other reviewers have focused on the implausibility of the plot. True, it is about a couple exposed to an aphrodisiac-type virus. It's clearly mentioned in the product description. However, I found it to be quite entertaining. The dialogue is at times very funny, and the sexual tension is palpable. When they begin playing baseball...well, things get really interesting! I also liked Paige's crazy family, which includes a kleptomaniac aunt. The characters are likable and behave appropriately, considering their backgrounds. It's not always an easy road to love for these two, but it sure is a lot of fun!"},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

Paige's family are a unique clan, and both Ross and Paige are likable characters. There was plenty to like about this book. Of course, if you're not into romances, then this probably isn't your cup of tea. I gave Stuck With You four stars rather than three because the author held me captive to the end.

They were taken to the hospital in an ambulance and on their way they could have possibly been exposed to the \\"love bug\\" virus so they had to be quarantined.

But because of this \\"love bug virus\\" they are becoming attracted to each other and they think it is due to the virus but come to find out they never were infected and they find out that they were just really attracted to each other.This book is absolutely hilarious.

As the only lawyer in the clan, she can't say no when her cousin needs her help in a messy, no-holds-barred divorce.

Never aspired to it, in fact it wasn't even in the top ten of jobs on her, \\"If you could do/be anything, what would it be?\\" list.But after seven years in corporate America, she recognized climbing that particular ladder wasn't what she wanted, either. So while she figured out what truly felt right, she decided to go back to school for her MBA. After one semester of THAT, she recognized it would still be the same ladder, just made of better wood, a better view from her office, and yet still a desk job.So she made a leap to another, really rickety ladder, taking English and creative writing classes just to clear her head and make her brain work in a completely new way. When she tackled the final for her creative writing class, the first chapter of a novel, a crazed writer was born.She loves this ladder, although she realized rather quickly that it never really becomes less rickety, and along the way there are many rungs that crack or break, making climbing a wonderfully scary, uncertain but never boring proposition.Yet sitting here in her office -- admittedly with a beautiful view of mountains and wildlife rather than high-rises -- a horrible thought occurs to her. It's a desk job."},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"Giving this one 4.5 stars. What a great read! I enjoyed this book so much. It was silly, quirky, funny and cute. A great book that I could just get lost in. It didn't require tons of thought, it's a simple light-hearted story that had me giggling almost non-stop. I also loved Ms. Jensen's voice so much. I need to get my hands on her backlist pronto!The characters were endearing, believable, and easy to relate to. Paige and Ross were great together, but I have to admit the way Paige treated him at the end kind of made me want to slap her. It didn't last long though! All was forgiven. There's also the bonus of the side characters Rachel and Nick's reunited lovers romance that I--normally--wouldn't care for, but was balanced with the main plot perfectly. So in essence I got two great romances! Win!Overall, I'm thrilled with this book. The pacing is great, the writing is excellent, I couldn't ask for much more. I loved the snappy one-liners, and the general humor of the story, especially the hospital scenes! This was a feel-good read from start to finish, and even with a windchill putting temps into the negative digits outside, I was warm and happy inside with this book!"},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"Please check out readingtsinoy in blogspot.com for more reviewsThe Shrew and The Shark.Lawyer Paige Hart hates no one more than Ross Bennett, the divorce lawyer against whom she is battling in court. Unfortunately a bombing sends them both to the hospital where they are forced to share a room as they are believed to have caught the new virus called Tibetan Concupiscence Virus, more commonly known as the Horny Monk disease. In quarantine both find their attraction for each other growing. The question is, is it the virus or is it true love?Paige is the ideal lawyer who fights tooth and nail for her client, especially if her client is a relative.... which it always is. A tiger in court, she is otherwise nave out of it. Having been burned in college by a former boyfriend (who turned out to be a Married boyfriend), she has never been with anyone seriously since, believing that men in general can not be trusted, especially Divorce lawyers like Ross. But forced together in quarantine, she couldn't be more surprised to find that Ross is the complete opposite of the pompous jerk she always thought him to be. Instead she finds him irresistible in his gentleness, thoughtfulness, kindness and philanthropy. she blames the horny monk disease for her slow change of heart and eventually gives in to her very strong physical attraction to Ross.These two characters sizzle in their hate, lust and love for each other. Added bonus is the sarcasm full of humor and bite. From the very first page you know they would end up in bed, many times over at that. Apart from these two there's also the supporting characters that gave the book its extra ooommph, specifically Paige's brother Nick and their (Ross' and Paige's) doctor Rachel. Theirs is about unrequited love, missed opportunity, delayed closure and hopeful continuation. A thrilling extra story within the main story.Overall a fun book I would recommend to adult readers."},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"I enjoyed this book, it is a crazy story but it is fun!Paige Hart is a lawyer who works practically ad honorem for her big and crazy family.

I am a big fan of Jennifer Crusie and her natural style which relies on fresh, clever dialogue around a simple plot and well-drawn characters. This book instead relies heavily on a ludicrous \\"love bug\\" plot to throw the couple together and makes too much of her loud and nutty family in an attempt to make up for stale writing. I was more interested in the backstory of her brother and doctor than in the two poorly defined main characters. Cutthroat guy lawyer who won't represent cheaters because he's been burned and she is the Shrew gal lawyer who doesn't trust or give an inch because she's desperately protecting her soft heart, yawn, er, I mean awwww, how sweet. The dialogue was juvenile and boring, \\"His hands raced over her like a blind man learning braille.\\" The steamy bits were cliche; anyone who doesn't see the end coming is really not paying attention. I let the reviews sway me when I probably could have avoided the disappointment if I had gotten the sample; I would highly recommend that before purchase."},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"This story isn't only about Paige and Ross, it also happens to be about Paige's brother Nick and an old college fling Rachel, which so happens to be the doctor taking care of Paige and Ross at the hospital.If things couldn't get ever weirder just from that sentence alone, hang tight because there is more.Paige and Ross are also opposing counsel for a divorce case and they loathe each other......well maybe.This was actually a really cute story filled with lots and I do mean LOTS of sexual tension and innuendos.More so, if I am being honest, than I thought there would be. There are also some rather steamy scenes between Paige and Ross both in and out of their stay in the hospital so beware. I kind of wish I would have known that coming into this story.Underneath all that sexual tension though truly is a well written love story that will keep you wanting more and has a very cute ending for both couples, which I really enjoyed. I am so glad we weren't left wondering what happened between all of them. I am glad that we got to see an ending of sorts (or maybe beginning would be the more appropriate word) for each couple.This is definitely more adults and not for those that shy away from some heated scenes between the couples (nothing too graphic but still very much not YA)."},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"This was the first book I read on my Kindle, my daughter had put it on for me to try.I enjoyed the book, lots of twist, but enjoyable.

I love Trish Jensen's romantic and humorous approach with the two couples in this book. She has such a great sense of humor and creates very lovable characters (oh and the men are HOT!) that it brings you that much more into the story.Paige is a tax attorney that loves her family. All infinite amount of them. She loves them so much she's taken it upon herself to give them her services in other fields of law. It's not a pleasant situation in any case for her. But she does it because she loves and respects them. One day she is in court helping a cousin with a divorce. She's walking through the courts speaking with the opposing attorney and is suddenly knocked out by debris from an explosion. She wakes up to find herself in quarantine with no one other than her least favorite divorce lawyer on the planet Ross the shark.Ross is shocked to see the bare bottom of Paige through her hospital gown as she is trying to make her way to the bathroom of their shared hospital room. He cannot help but to look. He always did find her attractive. Just unapproachable. He cannot believe the opinion she has of him without knowing him, but keeps his lips zipped to avoid any more conflict than necessary. That is until he finds it's quite fun to be outspoken with her and get her cheeks a flame with embarrassment.Nick Is Paige's brother and a well known architect. He gets notified about the courthouse explosion and immediately heads to find his little sister. He finds her in quarantine with a male room mate and a very beautiful doctor attending to them.Rachael is the attending physician to Paige and Ross. She is unaware of the fact that Paige's brother is.. Paige's brother, until he shows up to visit Paige. Rachael recognizes him instantly and cannot believe that he does not recognize her. She's livid! They attended college together many years ago and have a past. She is far from ready to confront him on why he's never contacted her and just disappeared. She also is not going to volunteer information.. Like who she is.Both pairs try to repair the relationships they have once had or desire to have. It's mainly the males that have their work cut out for them. I love the spunk both females have and the fact they are both fearless (with the males). It's a fun, romantic and satisfying experience as all unfolds and the truth comes out for all."},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"Well the story was definitely not what I had expected.

The dialogue was witty and clever. I really enjoyed the progression of the romance. It probably could have been tied up a little sooner. The last 10th of the book kind of drags out the story with storyline that should have been introduced sooner or ended before it was introduced. I do wish more of Nick and Rachel's storyline had been included, just because I enjoyed their banter and potential. I recommend to any modern romance fan."},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"If you are looking for a humorous, contemporary romantic novel 'Stuck With You' is the book for you. The characters are well developed; even the secondary ones are very humorous. It had me laughing out loud in parts. Although the plot is a little over the top, it is great fun and very easy to read; perfect for unwinding after a hard day."},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"My Review:If you like fun contemporary romances, then this is a book that you will probably enjoy. This is the story of two lawyers that are on opposite sides of a divorce. As they leave the courthouse, arguing, they are caught up in a bomb blast. Then on their way to the hospital, they are caught up in a bizarre ambulance accident where they are exposed to a virus. A virus that forces them to be quarantined for two weeks. A virus which manifests itself through sexual arousal. Because of the large blast that occurred at the courthouse, all the hospitals are full of injured and these two lawyers are quarantined together because of space issues. Can you see how fun this is already?The basic story line of this book is HIGHLY unlikely and more than a little unbelievable, but you all know, I read for entertainment. If you can ignore that issue, you will completely enjoy this book because it really is fun. The sexual tension is through the roof for these two people who honestly don't even like each other...at first. Their injuries from the initial blast are minor so you have a story where two people that are sexually drawn to each other are trapped in one little room 24 hours a day for 2 weeks. The scrabble game had me laughing completely out loud...that and their daily questionnaire about their symptoms with their doctor. Seriously funny! They get to know each other really well, but even with that, there are some surprises for them once they get out.Both of these characters were completely like-able. They have their reasons for what they do. They just can't see that yet. I loved Paige's huge family of characters and Ross' envy of them. The additional sub-romance between their doctor and Paige's brother Nick was brilliant. I absolutely LOVED their story and thought that it added so much depth to the story.Honestly, this is just a book that was fabulous and fun. If you are looking for a read for a mental escape, this is the perfect read. It was highly entertaining and I loved it!"},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"I kept waiting for something to happen besides these two morons lusting after each other for chapter after chapter. Blechhh!!! Yawn. Done."},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"I found myself grinning from ear-to-ear while reading this book.Although I firmly believe that this story is highly unlikely to happen, I still braced myself for the unexpected. And boy, was I blown away!There is sexual tension alright, and like magnets, extreme opposites Paige & Ross are actually attracted to each other as they emit sensuality to the highest level. The fact that these two lawyers practically hate each one's guts then end up on a home run makes me feel giddy and delighted at the same time. They wont admit that they are sexually drawn during and after being trapped in a quarantined room for 2 weeks. So not cool. But after they got a clean bill of health, they still found themselves longing to see one another.Stuck With You promises a story that would make you smile, think and chuckle at the same time. The intimacy between the two main characters, including the doctor and architect, was palpable and mind-blowing. I love how the author Trish Jensen developed Ross's character, making him one delectable sought-after guy with a heart.I recommend this quick read for those who may have second thoughts about their special someone and are afraid to commit. Go on, enjoy life and enjoy being in love. You know you want to. ^.^P. S.I definitely love their scrabble game because they kept on forming words that are sexually stimulating to the senses."},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"Thirty-two-year-old, happily single Paige Hart of Macon, Georgia, is the only lawyer in her huge extended family, including six brothers, two sisters, a retired Army-master-sergeant father, housewife mother, and &quot;way too many aunts, uncles and cousins.&quot; In the eight years since she passed the bar exam, Paige's colorful relatives have foisted endless legal problems on her--almost none of which have anything to do with her actual training as a tax attorney. The latest example is the extremely messy divorce of her cousin Jasmine, whose wealthy, soon-to-be-ex husband is represented by Ross &quot;the Snake&quot; Bennett.As far as Paige is concerned, all divorce attorneys are snakes. And it doesn't sway her opinion a bit that Ross is an extremely smart and handsome snake. But when the sexy, opposing counselor flashes a come-hither grin and matches Paige zinger for well-placed zinger, she succumbs to grudging admiration--and an unsettling rush of exhilaration.Ross has tried hard to ignore the gorgeous looks of honey-blond, cat-eyed Paige since their first meeting, when she strode into his office like an avenging angel and blasted him with her lightning tongue. He can't afford to be distracted in this case. Paige is one sharp cookie, and some of the strongest legal competition he's ever faced.Page and Ross gleefully haggle and brangle, until the morning mobster Boom Boom Carbone sets off an explosion at the courthouse. Though Paige is flung on top of Ross, knocking them both down, their injuries are so minor, they might have gone home with a Band-Aid and an aspirin, if not for the accident--the ambulance transporting them to the ER bangs into a car, and vials slated for the Center for Disease Control splatter their contents in the patient compartment.Paige is horrified when she's forced into two-week quarantine in the same room with The Snake. Even worse than that is the reason for it: they've been exposed to the highly contagious Tibetan Concupiscence Virus (AKA Horny Monk's Disease). Its chief feature is heightened sexual arousal, and she's already feeling an upsurge of symptoms!Ross has never in his life wanted a woman as much as he wants Paige, and he's positive it's not because he's sick. He's never felt better in his life! But if Paige wants to believe they're infected with a love bug, who is he to argue? He can't think of a better plan on earth than ministering to each other in their hour of need.When he kisses her senseless and entices her with promises of slow, sweet lovemaking, Paige is sorely afraid that the fever burning in her can never be put out by anyone but Ross. It is only a matter of time before she finds him impossible to resist, and all hell breaks loose as they seek heaven in each other's arms.This is one of the best comic romances of the year! Jensen's wild tale takes off running from the first page, and never lets up. The dialogue is snappy, the subcharacters wacky, and the sexual chemistry between the hero and heroine as combustible as the mob-boss bomb that hurls them together.Don't miss the fun!"},{"Title":"Stuck with You (Time of Your Life)","review":"&quot;Stuck With You&quot; was o.k.

They both have very likable personalities and the dialogue is snappy and fun to read. There is another romance going on at the same time between Paige's brother, Nick and Rachel, who is Ross' and Paige's doctor, who renew a broken relationship from their pasts. All the characters, both major and minor ones, are three-dimensional and interesting and the imagery was vivid and made me really see and feel the events in the book.

From the beginning we have interesting characters in a situation if not exactly plausible then almost believable. The situation of the forced isolation was comedic with the potential to for a lot of development of the main characters. Instead the author used some of this time to develop an sub-story among secondary characters.

The section on MIDI and a personal computers lists atari and commodore as possible good choices - get the picture!If you are looking for charts of Control codes etc, - they are in here, but you can find those anywhere.

The book does recognize that it is really when the MIDI-instruments are connected to a computer that MIDI takes on its real power, but only 10% of the book talks about MIDI and computers. The chapter on computer tells you about the choice between PC, MAC, Atrari and Commodore, and explains in length what a CD-rom is, and why we need it (not all programs fit on a floppy disk...) Sequencer program are mentioned, but barely so.The book does a fair job in explaining the MIDI standard and how it works, but it does not help me at all when I want to get started in connecting the components to my PC. I do think this was an excellent book in 1987, but digital music has moved on a long way since then."},{"Title":"The MIDI Companion: The Ins, Outs and Throughs","review":"As a practicing musician for 45 years, and after reading quite a few books on the subject of MIDI, this book is another typical MIDI book. It tells of how and why it was developed. It's always good to know the roots of everything one studies but this does not help one understand how to make your keyboard tell your guitar effects processor to change to patch #3, your vocal effects processor to switch to patch #49 and use a command to raise the reverb level to a certain point at a precise millisecond, or maybe message,(talk), to another keyboard in the MIDI chain and tell it to do whatever you want, all at the same instant. MIDI is truly a beast worth utilizing, and works quite well, for some. But I wouldn't trust it with my life. All of these MIDI books give the history and theory of MIDI. Every MIDI object has its own method of giving a midi command or recieving one. This and every other book I've read on the subject of MIDI is just as this one.

Severely beaten by her father when she tried to refuse, Deirdre was desperate to escape, and did not fight her attraction to his best friend Jonas, who convinced her to run from the altar into his arms and a hasty marriage at Gretna Green.Seven years later, a widowed Deirdre, despising the false values of the ton and valuing her quiet life at the Scottish cottage she and Jonas had shared during their marriage, finds it necessary to return to the London to sponsor her beloved sister-in-law on the Marriage Mart. When she and Lucas meet again after that disastrous wedding-that-never-was, sparks fly between them and rumors abound that Lucas is a blackguard who broke her heart and is determined to get revenge. The truth, however, is that Deirdre discovers that he is not the blackguard she believed him to be. In fact, he is a fine, worthy man who wanted--and surprisingly still wants--only to love her the rest of her life. Does she have the courage to forsake the quiet life in the Scottish countryside for marriage to a man she thought she despised for seven years? Will Lucas make the same mistake of letting her go without a fight?Although I started this book late in the evening and planned only to read a chapter or so, I found myself completely engrossed and could not stop until I had finished it. I will definitely look for more books by this author."},{"Title":"His Grace Endures (Regency Romance)","review":"The widowed Deirdre Macvail has absolutely no desire to leave her lovely Scottish cottage and journey to London for the Season. Certain that the ton remembers her scandalous departure from Society, she is reluctant to face their censure -- and even more reluctant to face the man who precipitated it. Unfortunately, Deirdre promised to bring out her young sister-in-law, so to London they must go. With a stop enroute to attend a party in Edinburgh.Lucas Gower, the Duke of Conovar is a Corinthian, a war hero, and the most eligible catch on the Marriage Mart. He's also a man whose heart was broken seven years earlier. Deciding that he needs an heir, Lucas determines to look over the marriageable misses and choose a wife.Deirdre's and Conovar's first encounter is memorable. Deirdre describes it: &quot;In all the times she had imagined the meeting, in all the frightening scenarios, she could never have predicted it happening in Scotland. Nor could she have prophesied the dilemma in which she would find herself. For she could not quite decide which was worse: facing the man whom she had jilted quite literally at the altar seven years earlier, or facing the man who had killed her husband. Not that it mattered, really. Both were standing in front of her, in the single, impeccable form of the Duke of Conovar.&quot;After several chance meetings, Lucas realizes that, far from hating Deirdre, he still loves her. Deirdre realizes that Lucas isn't the cold, heartless, arrogant man she knew -- or thought she knew -- seven years earlier. Well, he's still arrogant, but he's neither cold or heartless.Are there really second chances? Will hope and love triumph over all the hurt, the misunderstandings, and the misconceptions of the past?Emma Jensen's very readable style makes the Regency era come alive for modern misses, the interplay between her characters sparks and sizzles, and her dialogue sparkles.You'll find marvelous characters, acerbic wit, a chuckle or six, a mystery to solve, a! nd a moving story of enduring hope and love. What more can a reader want?"},{"Title":"His Grace Endures (Regency Romance)","review":"I'd never read any of Emma Jensen's books before this one, and I'll now be searching out more. This is a wonderful book; Ms Jensen demonstrates some great skills of storytelling, characterisation and emotion in this tale of a widow who has to confront and deal with the man she jilted seven years earlier and who she believes to have been ultimately responsible for her husband's death. And yet she discovers that the Duke of Conovar is nothing like she imagined. And very soon, because of the cruel gossip which starts to spread about him, she becomes his staunchest defender rather than his enemy.There are some heartwrenching scenes in this book, as well as some dialogue which had me glued to the page. It's impossible not to be touched by Conovar's sincerity or Deirdre's anguish as each finds out that they were mistaken about each other and about other characters whose actions impinged on their lives and destroyed their relationship seven years earlier.I thoroughly recommend this book, and I'm completely bemused by Susan Johnson's review, below. Ignore it, go with the other positive reviews on this page. This book deserved any and every award it won!"},{"Title":"His Grace Endures (Regency Romance)","review":"Without quite realizing it, I appear to have been picking up several RITA winners among traditional Regencies. One such book was Butler's The Rakes' Retreat. Another was this one (Jensen won another RITA for A Grand Design, before moving on to historicals).This is a book hard to describe easily. It had an irresistible first chapter (from the publisher's website but a deeply buried section) where the widowed heroine Deirdre is coaxing and cajoling her spoiled young sister-in-law to get ready for the ball. When she arrives, she has to continue worry about Olivia who has expressed her determination to marry only an earl (or at least an earl). Deirdre is not comfortable with society, and we find out why in the last paragraph of the first chapter - she has jilted a highly eligible suitor at the altar and eloped to marry her late husband. And you can guess what is about to happen - the rejected suitor arrives at the ball in Edinburgh. He is a duke, no less, the man whom Deirdre jilted and humiliated so publicly, and the man who was responsible for her husband's death.As the book progresses, some of our preconceptions from the first chapter are demolished in rapid succession. Deirdre misses her late husband, but she is *not* \\"Deirdre of the Sorrows\\" as she has been labelled by the ton. She was not a heartless jilt. She ran away from a marriage into which she had all but been sold by her social-climbing parents. Her fiance was not a duke then, but a second son of a duke. And the man she was to marry was the heir to a baron. Deirdre has a strong sense of her own self-worth, and she ran away from the church in part because she was not asked whether she wanted the marriage, and in part because the groom gave no sign of loving her.So, the Duke is a heartless peer out to marry the prettiest face around, or is he? That is the idea society now has about him, thanks to rumors spread by a mysterious person or persons. Conover (the duke) believes that either Deirdre or her sister-in-law must be responsible but cannot blame them entirely. He failed to convince Deirdre of his real love for her then, and he fails to do so now. In fact, revelations about his actions past and present have a way of coming back to haunt him. Not to mention that a nasty spat he and Deirdre have in public backfires on him more than on her. So much for Deirdre's belief that the ton would take the Duke's side. Even his friend's mother Lady Hythe publicly chastises him - more than once.All this explains the title \\"His Grace Endures\\" (one of the harder to find Jensen titles). For the rest of the book, Conover must confront the effect of his past actions or inactions, and he must also unmask the person who is slandering him. But there are no black villains here. Conover's enemy, for want of a better word, has his reasons.The book was wonderful, with meditative dialogue by Conover and others, with surprise built upon surprise. There was Galahad, the incontinent monkey and the stiff Earl of Hythe and his prudish mother (who will appear to greater effect in another Jensen book BEST LAID SCHEMES). There is also a reference to the heroine of WHAT CHLOE WANTS.However, the book was ever so slightly lacking in passion. While I could understand Conover's regrets over the past (and his constant thoughts of Deirdre helped here), I did not get the sense that Deirdre was in love with him, although I realized that she was not indifferent to him of course. What was the hardest was identifying when and how Deirdre had fallen for Conover. Did she love him even as she was eloping - and listening for his voice at every stop? Did she love him only when another elopement was prevented? The answer did not strike me.The second problem was the ending. It seemed too abrupt, and not in keeping with either Conovar's or Deirdre's characters. This was a minor problem but one that spoiled the book slightly for me along with the other issue I mentioned.Rating 4.2Recommended: Highly"},{"Title":"His Grace Endures (Regency Romance)","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. Since it was the 1998 RITA award as best regency, and beat &quot;Lord Heartless&quot; for that win, I was expecting a terrific novel. Instead, the book drags and the characters act in such an unrealistic ways. As far as the Duke goes, our hero, he has no family or friends. The heroine, and I use that term lightly, plays at being a spinster and dressing as a drab. For some reason, delights in hiding her beauty. In the ballroom scene, she behaves in such a manner that loses me entirely - as well as any interest that she should end up with the Duke in the end. He deserved better! The dukes only friend betrays him. He is a miserable man who society now scornes when he did nothing wrong in the first place! He should have packed his bags and came to america. I usually like Emma Jensen's books. There was nothing romantic about the book.

He receives a letter from the elderly lady in which she hints at a possible attempt on her life. When Poirot realizes the letter had been written two months before he receives it, his little grey cells are alerted. He takes a trip to Market Basing only to find the writer of the letter, Miss Arundell, is dead. Since he considers her still his client, he is determined to prove her death was not accidental, but a deliberate murder. The cold trail of clues leads to a beautiful society lady, a handsome scientist, a faithful servant, and a pair of specialists in the occult. Will Poirot be able to unmask the killer before another death occurs? A dog's bouncing ball, a strange spiritual manifestation, and a mirror reflection of a brooch are all pivotal to solving this mystery.This book is notable in that it will be the last of the Poirot books to be narrated by Captain Hastings until \\"Curtain\\" ends the series decades later. His narrative style, always pleasing, is especially well-done in this one. Also notable in this story is the importance of a cute wire-haired terrier named Bob who will form a special bond with Captain Hastings.If greed, deception, and jealousy are your cup of cocoa, you'll love matching wits with Hercule Poirot as he tries to stop a brilliant and baffling killer who is about to strike again."},{"Title":"Dumb witness","review":"In this book Agatha Christie refers to the murderers in Death in the Clouds, the Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Mysterious Affair at Style and the Mystery of the Blue Train, so make sure you have read all of these before you read this one, our your fun will be spoilt!Dumb Witness is one my top ten favourite Agatha Christie novels. Dame Christie has expressed the character of Hastings better here than in any of the other seven novels in which he appears. It is also one of the most amusing.One thing I enjoy about this book is that we are given a fair crack at the whip - everything that Poirot sees we see, there are no last minute envelopes arriving (which often irritates me). His explanation is convincing.Go ahead and read it! But don't forget to read the books mentioned above first."},{"Title":"Dumb witness","review":"At first the title intrigued me, but as i got down to reading the book, I found that the title had nothing much to do with the story. But nevertheless, i enjoyed the book. It's about the murder of an old lady, and the suspects are the relatives after her money. So what's the title have to do with the book? Simple. Only one witness was there to this murder...and the witness is dumb. yep... we're talikng about her pet dog here. The irony to the story is that inspite of having a witness, Poirot has to unravel the mystery, with hardly any clues. But poirot being poirot solves the mystery....making another good book to read. Most of christie's books are a bit similar, but not exactly same, making it possible to read most of her books without getting bored. While this sounds like one of those typical books, it's really not. Read it...then you'll see."},{"Title":"Dumb witness","review":"The story itself is fairly routine (and bears more than a couple of similarities to \\"Murder on the Links\\", one of Christie's earliest works). However, the reader is advised to avoid the Berkley editions at all cost; they are sloppily edited and are full of mistakes that anyone with even a basic knowledge of Agatha Christie (or, for that matter, the English language) wouldn't make. The St. Martin's Press editions are much better."},{"Title":"Dumb witness","review":"If you are a dog lover, you will especially enjoy this novel, which features the canine \\"Bob\\" (the dumb witness?). I guessed certain aspects of the mystery but not the murderer. Having said that, I've only ever guessed whodunit in one of Christie's novels so far, that being \\"A Murder is Announced.\\" \\"Dumb Witness\\" is really quite humorous, with Hastings playing the admiring Watson and Hercule Poirot at his most colorful. If you are a Christie fan, \\"Dumb Witness\\" will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Dumb witness","review":"First published in 1937, Ms. Christie's \\"Dumb Witness\\", once again, shows why she is the best of the best in murder mysteries. The book was dedicated to her deceased dog, Peter, and takes pains to have a dog, Bob, be part of the web of intrigue in this Poirot story. It is another crisp, tightly written whodunit that kept me absorbed until the very end. Granted, Ms. Christie has stumbled once in a blue moon such as the Hercule Poirot book entitled \\"The Big Four,\\" but \\"Dumb Witness' does not fall into this category. Also, I found some of the 1930s' vernacular to be either interesting or unintentionally funny if it were applied in today's society. Though I was able to figure out the solution about two-thirds of the way through Hercule Poirot's 15th murder mystery, it was still a very enjoyable read. Ms. Christie is one of my go-to authors when I need a surefire winner."},{"Title":"Dumb witness","review":"One of the delights of buying a Berkely/Penguin edition of an Agatha Christie novel are the covers. Clues in the case are provided. This is true of \\"Dumb Witness\\" a fine Christie tale from 1937.The Plot: Miss Emily Arundell is an old maid. Her family of unscrupulous moneygrubbers and forgers gathers at her quaint home during the Easter Weekend. Miss Arundell has a fall down the stairs; this is said to be because her pet terrier Bob has left his play ball on the steps causing the old lady to trip. This is later proved to be false since Bob had been out of the house until 5 AM. A few weeks later Miss Arundel dies. Was it natural causes or murder most foul? Hercule Poirot is called in to investigate the case. Among the suspects are:Minnie Lawson-Miss Arundell's female companion who is given the bulk of the wealthy estate in the old lady's second will.Charles Arundell-The ne'er do well nephew of Miss Emily who has stolen money and forged a check in the name of Miss Emily. He has been heard commenting to the lady, \\"I will bump you off.\\"Theresa Arundell-The party loving beautiful niece of Emily ArundellDr. Rex Donaldson-The country doctor who is engaged to Theresa. Money is needed to get him to move to an office in London.Bella Tanios-a plain niece of Emily Arundell who has moved abroad with her Greek husband. She has two children' struggles to meet ends meet and is disenchanted with her mate.Dr. Tanios-Jacob Tanios is the husband of Bella.Dr. Grainger-Miss Arundell's faithful family doctor.Ellen-A maid at the Little Green House home where Miss Arundell has lived for many years.The Tripp sisters-believers in seances they report on an unusual occurrence when Miss Arundell attended one of their events. She was seen with a halo around her head on the night she became ill.The novel is narrated by Arthur Hastings the police associate of Poirot who accompanies him on the investigation of the murder.This is a well written case. Poirot uses logic to solve a terrible murder by analyzing a brooch with the letters\\"T.A.\\"on it. Who wore it? Was the person who did so the murderer? Join the fun and help Poirot solve the case!"},{"Title":"Dumb witness","review":"Almost smack-dab in the middle of the chronological order of the Poirot books is \\"Dumb Witness,\\" a murder-mystery with a difference. That is, for a long time the reader is not quite sure if a murder has even taken place. Emily Arundell's death does not come as a surprise: she was elderly and sickly, and just a few weeks before her death she suffered from a nasty fall down the stairs. It was blamed on a ball left on the landing by her fox terrier, but Emily was suspicious enough to write a letter to Hercule Poirot, asking for his assistance.Strangely, the letter did not reach Poirot until two months later, by which point Emily is already dead. Curious as to why the letter was delayed for so long a time, Poirot goes to investigate matters with the long-suffering Captain Hastings in tow. Things at Littlegreen House seem straightforward enough: Emily's death was deemed natural, the lateness of the letter has a rational explanation, and her last will and testament is all in order. But surprisingly, she decided to disinherit her nephews and nieces in favour of her companion, and Poirot is interested to find that her family is going to contest the will. Hastings is a reluctant tag-a-long, who cannot fathom what Poirot finds so suspicious about the whole affair.But of course, the combined efforts of Poirot's instincts and his little grey cells can sniff out a mystery where there appears to be none. Suspecting foul play, Poirot assumes several different personas in order to investigate the Arundell family and the Littlegreen household: methods that Hastings finds quite un-sportsmanlike, but which add a degree of humor to the proceedings as Poirot shamelessly eavesdrops, deceives and manipulates his way to the information he seeks.Once again it is Hastings, the Watson to Poirot's Sherlock, who provides the first-person account of the proceedings (noteworthy is the fact that this is the second to last book narrated by Hastings), kept hopelessly in the dark as Poirot carries on with his theories and hint-droppings right up until the wrap-up. As always there is an intriguing range of characters woven throughout the plot, from the chilly beauty queen to the rakish never-do-well, the frightened doctor's wife to the dowdy housekeeper and a pair of spiritualists, each with their own secrets.The dumb witness of the title obviously refers to the dog, though sadly he does not play as large a part in the mystery or its solution as one might hope; in fact, it's safe to say that this is not one of Poirot's finest mysteries. Still, even an average Christie is better than no Christie at all, and \\"Dumb Witness\\" makes a good read for a cold winter's night."},{"Title":"Dumb witness","review":"Neither Poirot Loses A Client nor Dumb Witness was actually a good title for the book. Poirot could not lose a client he never had, nor was there a witness, dumb or otherwise.Nonetheless, it was an interesting story - Poirot received a letter more than a month after the writer died, written just days before the demise. The writer had not mentioned the problem except her having suspicions after the incident of the dog's ball, and need utmost discretion to protect the family name.Upon arrival at the Littlegreen House in Market Basing, Poirot and Hastings learned that the late Ms Arundell changed her will right before her passing and left everything (except gifts to servants) to her none-too-brilliant companion Ms Lawson, denying her only relatives, 2 nieces and 1 nephew, even a single penny.Here, we saw Hastings mortified by Poirot's employment of deceptions in gathering information from various people in Market Basing. A familiar reader would find that odd, wouldn't a long-time companion of Poirot be familiar with his un-Englishness approach to problem solving?The characters involved were interesting, but not very colourful. One dowdy niece married a charming Greek doctor, practically a scandal in the insular society. Another led a fast life in London, then inexplicably got engaged to a pedantic country doctor who seemed more interested in his research than her. The nephew was generally acknowledged as an incorrigible rascal, charming, but not to be trusted. Last but not least, the suddenly wealthy Ms Lawson who had an unhealthy interest in spiritualism.The sharp-eyed Poirot immediately deduced the truth of the incident of the dog's ball which prompted Ms Arundell to write the letter. He felt he had enough justification to continue his investigation despite all signs to Ms Arundell dying not to foul play. This was a well-done tale, true to Poirot's formula - study the murder, and you would find the murderer.There is also an interesting part in the book looking through the eyes of a dog."},{"Title":"Dumb witness","review":"A classic wealthy-relative-murdered-for-her-money plot, witty dialogue between Poirot and Hastings, and a gripping denouement make DUMB WITNESS one of the most quintessential of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot detective novels, along with THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES and AFTER THE FUNERAL. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dumb witness","review":"SPOILERS TO THE MAX. DON'T READ THIS IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM.This seems to be universally seen as a good Christie mystery but not one of her best. Charles Osborne says as much in his introduction to the Kindle edition. So let's give it the four stars Christie's genius deserves and then talk about Christie in general.I read this book first when I was ten years old, and I remember the trouble I had and how the book seemed to swell, collapse and start leaking pages, as if it were just as upset as I was. When you're ten years old and have the leisure time to read Christie mysteries, you don't really understand people killing one another over an inheritance.But even now that I'm older, I'm a little troubled by people who kill one another over an inheritance THEY DON'T GET! Darn! I killed her but she had changed her will! Oh, well. I guess I'll just have to kill someone else. I can commit the perfect murder any time I want to (if it weren't for that darned Poirot, no one would even suspect there WAS a murder) but I'm always so careless about checking how the will reads.Okay. Let that go. When I was ten, I foolishly thought the point of the books really was to figure out who committed the murder. If you read on that basis, you will be bored out of your mind and still not figure out who did it. Or even if you do figure out who did it, that will be because you read one page closely, and God help you if you read the other 200 pages that closely, because clue-hunting isn't worth that much effort and the other 200 pages have no important clues in them at all.No. You read a Christie mystery in order to get character sketches of middle-class Englishmen who live on inherited wealth, mixed in with a few \\"paid companions\\" and similar lowlifes. In this book we have an abused spouse, painted as thoroughly as anyone could wish, who turns out ... NOT TO BE ABUSED! In other words, Christie has her cake and eats it too, in the meantime preaching (softly) a rather ugly sermon: if you complain about being abused, maybe it's because you're a murderer. It's certainly not because you're abused; I just put that in to fool the reader.Meanwhile there's the fill-in around the murder story: guys who steal money out of drawers, or blow all their income going to foreign night clubs, and who are there just to make their scenes interesting. If they weren't crooked, we couldn't suspect them, but since they aren't the ones who did it here (in the next book one of them will be the one who did it), we just have to get max fun out of how crooked and suspectable they are. Christie even says one of them has no moral sense, but is totally charming -- and everyone in the book agrees and likes the guy even though they all know he's a thief who has been in police custody! Meanwhile foreigners are sinister and untrustworthy by definition even though they AREN'T thieves.You see how important it is to be English?And this stew, or brew, of suspects and fake spousal abuse, is told at such an immense distance, and in such a mild way, that you have to work yourself up to care what is happening. Hastings, the Watson of the story, doesn't even believe there has been a murder till the book is three quarters over. The rest of the characters, WHETHER THEY HAVE MURDERED ANYONE OR NOT, spend all their time sitting around wishing the inheritance had gone another way. It ain't exactly Jane Austen: Jane Austen would have made fun of the characters' greed and self-obsession, but Agatha Christie can't make fun of the only thing that keeps her plot going at all: the readers' sympathy with the characters' greed.Like the vast majority of Christie mysteries, this is elegant, cleverly plotted and slow-moving, with a clumsy elegance based on everybody being well-off to begin with, and greedy on top of that. I'm glad I've read most of Christie. As far as I can see, that shows I have more reading discipline than an expert on Shakespeare needs."},{"Title":"Dumb witness","review":"I've read a few of Agatha Christie's book and I thought that this book was only OK.

This book is an all-over good read."},{"Title":"Dumb witness","review":"\\"Dumb Witness\\" is a slower moving, more relaxing type of mystery--no intense drama or tension but just a well-written tragedy."},{"Title":"Dumb witness","review":"I am a Poirot fan, so I enjoyed this mystery as I expected. The little dog in the story is precious and adds a new element to the plot. I don't remember an animal being featured this way in another Christie book.

Which makes me like it more!"},{"Title":"Dumb witness","review":"Typical Agatha Christie novel. \\"Typical\\" here meaning classic. This book is definitely a page-turner, with many great characters as well as great clues and a great setting. Highly recommended. Mysteries don't get much better than this."},{"Title":"Dumb witness","review":"Beware...this is no adventurous, running-by-the-seat-of-your-pants mystery. It travels slowly and with caution, yet is nontheless sinister, with all the undertones of greed, evil and black thoughts one book could have.Poirot receives a cryptic letter from a deceased old woman, who obviously suspected her death to be close at hand--and anything but natural. It is only the stubborn Poirot who believes it to really be a murder, while everyone else looks at a very natural death as just that. The tension builds as there are no lack of suspects and WILLING murderers--the question is, who would actually go through with it and at the same time had the ability to make the murder appear natural to every single person--doctor and all?Because there are so few characters, the ending is not such a shock since at least for me, since I had suspected the murderer anyway. However, it is interesting to listen as Poirot explains how/why the murder was committed. I was actual! ! ly surprised during some of his explanation of the impossible--or seemingly impossible.I would recommend this book. It held a rather gentle grasp of me, forcing me to read the whole thing in a day. The other good aspect of this mystery was a few obvious clues laid down in the path. These were extremely valuable clues, and whether Agatha intended them to be so obvious or not they were none the less there. Most anyone should pick these clues up. And if you are lucky, and have a good grasp of poisonous substances, you might just solve the entire thing."},{"Title":"Dumb witness","review":"The 'silent witness' in this case is Miss Emily, not Bob; he couldn't speak in court. Agatha Christie dedicated this book to her most faithful friend and dearest companion. This book was also titled \\"Poirot Loses a Client\\", misleading since Emily did not personally talk to Poirot.The death of Miss Emily Arundell was not a surprise, she had been in delicate health. Chapter 1 tells of the events in the preceding weeks. Emily's nieces and nephew came for a visit. One asked for a loan, but Emily refused. Do old people know what it is to live? These young ones have run through their inheritance. [Why do those who squander money think they know better than those who save money? Is it just a psychological problem?] Charles shows his personality at the bureau drawer (Chapter 2). The children of the wealthy are unhappy in their work. What if they inherited a large sum of money? [Does an elderly relative with money attract relations like chum attracts sharks?] At night Emily stumbled and fell down the staircase (Chapter 3). How could this happen? A few days later Emily wrote a letter to Hercule Poirot (Chapter 4). Emily asked Poirot for his counsel on her condition. But it didn't go out until 2 months after Emily's death (Chapter 5)!Poirot and Hastings visit and learn of Emily's will: her companion Miss Lawson inherited the house and the fortune. Nothing for her relatives! Posing as a buyer, Poirot pumps the servant to learn all about Miss Emily's last years and the people who visited her (Chapter 8). Poirot learns something about the stairs where Emily fell (Chapter 9). [Note the cover stories used by Poirot to gather information.] The interview with Miss Peabody provides background information on the Arundell family (Chapter 10). Poirot believes nothing unless it can be corroborated (Chapter 12). Poirot interviews Theresa and Charles (Chapters 13, 14). In Chapter 15 Poirot speaks with Miss Lawson. Poirot interviews Bella and her husband Dr. Tanios (Chapters 16, 17). Then Poirot reviews the statements (Chapter 18).Poirot visits the lawyer (Chapter 19), then revisits the Littlegreen House. Poirot learns something from the gardener (Chapter 20). In spite of the medical opinion Poirot is sure Emily was murdered (Chapter 22). There is a crisis in Chapter 23. [Did you catch the clue in Chapter 24?] Can a person die of a genuine disease that was artificially induced (Chapter 25)? The pace and drama speed up in Chapter 26. A telephone call brings surprising bad news (Chapter 28). All the people involved in the case were assembled at Littlegreen House (Chapter 29). Poirot goes over the events and eliminates the suspects until the guilty is named. People who always want what they can't get are miserable.The idea of receiving a message from the dead was used in John Le Carre's first novels."},{"Title":"Dumb witness","review":"The Dumb Witness of the title is a dog named Bob. A dog who loves his mistress and possibly is the only witness to her murder. If it was a murder ...

While there is nothing intrinsically wrong with this, many &quot;down&quot; books can be uplifting and even illuminating. Think &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot; or &quot;Enemies: A Love Story,&quot; and see what I mean. Though well written, &quot;Felcia's Journey&quot; tells an all too familiar story of two lost characters who come together by chance, and the resulting conseqences. Trevor's style is internal and introspective, and has an almost Joycean time perspective, as we learn things about Felicia's and Mr, Hilditch's pasts right in the midst of the present time situations. This device and Trevor's language is skillfully informative, telling us not only about the cultural ethos of working class Ireland, but the loneliness and isolation leading to the emergence of a psychologically aberrant personality. And to a point the reader can sympathize with both characters. But Trevor also maintains a distance, which may please some, but left too much unanswered. For instance-- how does Felica escape? And just why is it she, of all the girls, who has such a profound effect on Hilditch? And why should it drive him to take his life, and how does he do it? Lastly, will Felicia spend book eternity endlessly jouneying? What is the point? Perhaps I am too outcome conscious, but there was more I wanted to know than was given. &quot;Felicia's Journey&quot; will soon be released as a film. I shall be curious to see how this threadbare text is expanded and dramatized for the screen. Trevor's novel is skillful and stylized, yet manages to miss the mark."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"Psychopathic predator preys on naive, desperate, young woman searching for the boyfriend who deserted her and her unborn child. At first I thought that was pretty much going to be the gist of Felicia's Journey, with perhaps some literary embellishments thrown in to dress it up. After a couple of chapters I began to be drawn in by the way the author was steadily revealing more and more about the two main characters by sharing with us their thoughts and memories. About halfway through I realized I was hooked and that this book was much subtler and deeper than I had first thought. It becomes a steadily more intense study of obsession, delusion, and self-deception, not only of predator but also prey. One aspect of the novel that added interest for me was its depiction of the manners and culture of the English and Irish. In her native Ireland Felicia receives no help or sympathy from anyone,including her family. In England she is constantly subjected to rudeness, contempt or indifference at the hands of salesclerks, policemen and other functionaries whose job it should be to render assistance. The entire environment seems to be alien and hostile. Practically the only kindness shown to Felicia is by street people and the predator, Mr. Hilditch, who despite his sinister intentions, actually shows a certain amount of genuine concern for Felicia's predicament. Though I found the developing story fascinating in its continuing revelation of deeper facets of character, I was prepared for it to end either in a very negative, unsatisfying way, or a positive, unbelievable way. I will only say that I thought the ending was somewhat surprising and unconventional, but some may still find it unsatisfying. More than just a suspense story, this seemed to me also a meditation on the different manifestations or expressions of humanity; the extremes of good and evil, and the mixtures in between; the shattering surprises that may come with self-revelation; and how an awful and austere state of grace can come as a result of loss and suffering. I would have rated it five stars except it seemed to me that in a few places there was a very subtle lack of credibility. But I liked the style of writing, and certainly recommend the book, although it reveals a phase of life not too pleasant to contemplate."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"William Trevor's FELICIA's JOURNEY is a short novel that delivers a great deal. The title character, Felicia, is a teenager from Ireland to whom life has not been kind. When we first meet her she's been laid off from a job in a canning factory, and is keeping house for her not particularly caring widowed father, two older brother and her ancient great grandmother. We learn Felicia has always been considered gawky and has not had much male attention leaving her prime to be seduced by Johnny, a young man from her home town who has immigrated to England but is home on a brief visit to his bitter mother. Not surprisingly Johnny leaves town and Felicia discovers herself pregnant. Desperate but still believing Johnny cares for her Felicia steals money from her great grandmother for fare and other necessities and takes a ferry to England to search for her seducer. It soon becomes obvious to the reader and eventually to Felicia that Johnny has lied to her on several levels. Felicia soon is befriended by the other major character in the novel, Mr. Hilditch, and the suspense/thriller aspect of the novel begins. Horrible as some of the things Mr. Hilditch has done are he is not a character we are without sympathy for especially after we discover some horrors in his own past. Some may say Felicia is somewhat of a blank but we know so much about her family circumstances and training in Ireland that we can pretty much guess what she is thinking and feeling without being explicitly told. This is a dark but expertly crafted read with an unexpected but still unhappy end for the heroine."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"This is an intriguing book of psychological suspense for which its author was the recipient of the 1994 Whitbread Award. Written by a master storyteller, it tells the story of two people whose lives interconnect, only to have repercussions for both in the most unexpected ways.Felicia is a seventeen year old motherless and naive Irish girl, who has become intimate with an Irish boy named Johnny. Of course, the expected ensues, and after Johnny has left Ireland and returned to England where he ostensibly works, Felicia is left holding the bag. Her disapproving father suspects Johnny of actually being in the British Army and, thus, a traitor to his own. He also has a few choice words for his daughter, now that she is in the family way, and none of it is flattering. So, Felicia leaves her rural village and her family and goes off in search of Johnny, having nothing more than the vaguest of ideas where he might be.She crosses the Irish Sea and arrives in the English Midlands in the industrial city of Birmingham, as she believes Johnny to be working in a lawn mower factory there. In her search for Johnny, she runs into the portly catering manager for one of the local factories. His name is Joseph Ambrose Hilditch, and he is outwardly a jovial and agreeable man, well-liked by his co-workers and meticulous about his culinary repasts. He lives in solitary splendor in the large house in which he grew up. The house is cluttered with collectibles but well- kept, although decorated in the style of a bygone era. Mr. Hilditch is, indeed, a collector, but his collection is initially far beyond Felicia's imaginings. In fact, Mr. Hilditch has a darker side to him, which is not immediately discernible by the unwary.When Felicia first meets Mr. Hilditch, it is to ask for information, but something about her catches Mr. Hilditch's fancy, and he finds himself keeping Felicia in his crosshairs. When Felicia seemingly unexpectedly runs into Mr. Hilditch again, he directs her to lodgings, and so it begins. As Mr. Hilditch insinuates himself ever so slowly into her life, weaving a fantasy about his own life that is sure to put her mind at ease about him. Felicia begins finding herself ensnared by this ostensibly kind and ever so helpful, avuncular man, and she initially fails to see the darkness that lies at the core of his being.The author begins the book with Felicia's journey to England in search of her lover. Using flashbacks throughout the story, the author fills in Felicia's background and describes the events that have brought her to the point of making this journey. When Mr. Hilditch is introduced to the reader, the author begins to take the reader into the recesses of his mind, allowing the reader to see what Felicia initially fails to see, the duplicity and cunning that is masked by his overt geniality. Like a spider to the fly, Mr. Hilditch begins laying his trap, and so Felicia's journey thrusts her into the belly of the beast.With his carefully cadenced prose, the author explores the darker corners of the human psyche, and in the mind of Mr. Hilditch, it is dark, indeed. As his carefully constructed psychological house of cards begins to fall, there are unspeakable revelations as to what lies at the heart of Mr. Hilditch's predilection, and it is not pretty. The author, in taking the reader into the recesses of the mind of each of the two protagonists, tries to explain how it is that each of these two flawed human beings were able initially to achieve a connection with another, only to find ostensible betrayal. What is decidedly different is the way that they each cope with that betrayal.There is no happily-ever-after ending to this story, which culminates with a conclusion that is quite bleak, robbing the reader of some satisfaction. Fans of Ruth Rendell, however, will very much appreciate the psychological cat and mouse game that is played throughout and will enjoy the author's foray into this genre. As always, the author pens a novel that provides much food for thought on many levels, and the use of the word journey in the title of the book has a much broader meaning within the context of the story. In reading this book, fans will enjoy the elegant, spare prose that they have come to expect from this enormously talented author."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"The frightening thing about this exquisite mystery by William Trevor isn't anything found in a typical detective or police mystery; there is no theft, no murder, no crime, at least not at first. The truly horrifying thing in the mystery is the unknown, for we don't know what is going to happen next. We wonder if a murder is to occur, or if we are about to discover some gut-wrenching fact about the main male character, Mr. Hilditch. The book makes you feel as if something is coming around every corner; so much reading time is spent waiting, anxiously, anticipating the next move. The two characters make quite a pair, one searching desperately for her lover, and essentially her family, and the other, searching for something to replace the family he no longer has. The truly strange thing about Mr. Hilditch is his normalcy. He seems a very nice, hard working, grandfather figure, until we learn of his crimes. Pity seems to be given to Felicia, even though I think she is undeserving of it. It was unintelligent of her to leave home alone, go to another country, and then associate with a strange man she knew nothing about. Although we are probably supposed to feel for this unsuspecting, sweet, innocent girl, I almost felt more sympathy for Mr. Hilditch and for the nightmare of a life he is living. All in all, an interesting mystery that kept me guessing at every turn, but certainly not one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"William Trevor is a master storyteller -- he gives the reader just enough information to know where the story is (probably) going, but not so much that he holds the reader's hand throughout. FELICIA'S JOURNEY is filmic, Hitchcockian: Trevor gives direction to the characters, who take unexpected paths to unexpected ends. The darker sides of Felicia and Mr. Hilditch elude us. Trevor gives us only brief glimpses of them, like figures disappearing around corners when the lights of a car give them away.Mr. Hilditch is one of the most memorable characters I've encountered of late. Like Count Fosco in Wilkie Collins' THE WOMAN IN WHITE, Hilditch appears to be a benign giant, overweight and always eating pastries, a charming man. Inside, however, he's dark. His past haunts him and compels him to act out unspeakable evils so unspeakable that Trevor leaves it up to us to figure out what exactly he has done. Therein lies the suspense: what are this man's crimes, what is the runaway Felicia up against, where are the bodies, if any? We watch, helpless, as Felicia slowly enters Hilditch's trap, wondering how she could possibly escape.The suspense builds steadily throughout, especially as we learn more and more about Mr. Hilditch, as we begin to feel sorry for this tortured soul. FELICIA'S JOURNEY is a little slow, perhaps, but a worthwhile read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"I must admit that I read this book after having seen Atom Egoyan's stunning film version -- and I had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by it.Fortunately, Trevor's work also sticks in the mind. It is an elegant dance between a self-satisfied gourmand who has a taste for young women whose lives are disordered, luring them into his web ever so slowly and cutting off their lives. Felicia is different from the others in one important respect: She has caught they eye of the benign but determined Miss Calligary, a Jamaican street preacher who strives to &quot;gather in&quot; disturbed souls.Many critics have criticized the character of Felicia for being insufficiently realized. She is like Lena Grove from Faulkner's LIGHT IN AUGUST: Without being a developed character in her own right, her pregnant wanderings and confusion set the evil or craven minds of the people around her in motion. Fortunately, it is Felicia who quite unawares sends Miss Calligary and her &quot;Gatherers&quot; after the startled Hilditch.A book well worth reading from an author whose work I would like to explore in greater detail."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"This is an extremely well written thriller that left me in a slight daze by the time I was finished. A great aspect of this book is that the ending is totally unpredictable."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"William Trevor's Felicia's Journey is a novella about two characters, Felicia who is rather vague and incoherent as she searches for the father of her unborn child. She meets Mr. Hilditch who is a mild-mannered, conventional serial killer who befriends lost girls and then murders and disposes of their bodies (this is not explicit -- possibly because Mr. Hilditch seems so inept it's hard to believe he actually could kill someone and dispose of their body without immediately being caught). While extremely well written and accurate, neither of these characters nor their situation are interesting enough to make this a really compelling book. Far more interesting a novel could have been made of Mr. Hilditch's relationship with his mother who turns to him as a lover (when he is presumably an adolescent) and she is no longer attractive enough to find anyone else. An exploration of a relationship like that would have been truly captivating. And Mr. Hilditch wouldn't have needed to murder anyone."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"Clean, spare, perfect prose and flawless psychological portraits. Trevor is one of the great literary writers: he's not showing off like some of the other Brit writers. He has far more negative capability than say Ian McEwan, and is far less ego-driven than say Julian Barnes--and he manages to have driving plot *and* depth of character, an unusual combo in a literary writer, which makes this much more taut than (say) William Maxwell.

Felicia (the main character) in particular was a naive and simple character that lacked any depth at all.One of the reasons that I didn't like the book was simply the authors style. As one reviewer put it, &quot;Trevor's style is internal and introspective, and has an almost Joycean time perspective&quot;.Well, that is a clever way to put it. Trevor delves into the main characters pasts while trying to keep you interested in the present storyline. This sounds like a great literary feat. However, it is not a style that I care for.It was supposed to be a true page turner, and a psychological thriller. That is why I picked the book up in the first place. I have read many books that keep me glued to the next page, and books that I cannot read alone in the house. But this book is not one of them.If you are looking for a true thriller about a psychotic, try Mary Higgins Clarks, &quot;Loves Music Loves to Dance&quot;... that is a thriller that will keep you reading.

Her meeting of one Mr. Hilditch, the head caterer at one of town?s several factories, brings the poor girl?s already troubled life to a harrowing peril of both the physical and moral sorts.Trevor?s somnambular style glides us through a fallen dreamscape studded with flashbacks in a manner that almost exempts him of the empathetic anguish inflicted upon the reader. Almost. Indeed, Trevor?s national allegory is so grief ridden, so utterly bleak that it is difficult to appreciate the merits of this work. Felicia is so painfully nave that it becomes difficult to sympathize with her even as she is dragged through exhaustive turmoil. The audience?s hope in redemption is dashed like waves against the very shore upon which Felicia lands. So used to such incessant emotional torment is the reader that the climax fails to impress. Trevor leaves us unnecessarily jaded, allowing one final glimmer of hope only to have it washed away in the tide. As such, this reader finds it necessary to give Mr. Trevor a generous four thumbs up (out of a possible ten)."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"The kindest description of this book would be that it is well-written and quite pointless. The plot is paper thin and all the characters (with the possible exception of Mr Hilditch) are either two dimensional or borrowed from other, more superior, works. The much-touted plot twist, when it finally arrives, lacks any irony and seems contrived. William Trevor is best known as a short story writer and this book is essentially a short story padded into a novel. As a well-written, mildly diverting, piece of light entertainment it would have been acceptable, as a prize-winning piece of high literary pretensions, it is not. Dickens, Poe, even Highsmith have succeeded much better in what Trevor seeks to achieve."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"I found the basic idea of the book to be excellent and very true to life, however, I cannot say the same for the characters, Felicia in particular. Beyond her frustration, we are never privy to any of her emotions. What did she think of her plight? Why did she never worry that Johnny, her lover, might reject her? I feel that the author made a mistake by never writing in Felicia's viewpoint during her scenes with Mr. Hilditch. We certainly know many of his feeling and thoughts concerning Felicia, but never, never any of her thoughts about her sinister friend. ...The character of Mr. Hilditch is very well developed, unfortunately more so than the main character. I felt that too much of the book (one quarter) was devoted to Mr. Hilditch's downward spiral.

We know from the beginning that she is on a fruitless task - she has been used, abused and discarded. On her search, she is 'befriended' by a creepy man who portends trouble and worse for Felicia. The book is peopled by religious fanatics, homeless eccentridw who come alive during the night and it is always surprising to recognize the naivity and innocence of Felicia. Despite the horrors and depravity that the book allude to, Trevor never gets into the bloody details that an author such as Stephen King savors. The same monstrosities are here but they are alluded to and left to our imagination, our ability to call forth our own personal monsters and give them literary life."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"With elements of Faulkner's Light in August, young Irish Felicia sets out on a journey to find the father of the baby growing inside her. With the same determination as Faulkner's young woman, she seems convinced the father loves her and did not mean to leave without giving her his address. She soon falls into the clutches of Hilditch, whose dark past is eventually revealed. Rich with imagery of flowers and food, the novel shows Hilditch to be a character who wants to consume everything he can to try to fill the void of his empty life. The novel turns out to be more than a twisted detective type novel as it reveals itself to be an allegory for the relations between the patriarchal, dominating England and the poorer, more desperate Ireland. Felicia's own great grandmother becomes a symbol of Irish pride as she, like the legend of her husband who was a revolutionary, seems to outlive everyone else. Furthermore, it is an interesting and often truthful story about a single pregnant woman making a journey to England for the possibility of an abortion or a way to make money since abortions are illegal in Ireland and jobs are scarce. Written only two years after the X case, where a fourteen year old Irish girl involved the world in her need for an abortion, this novel has more than one major relevancy to today's politics."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"In Felicia's Journey, William Trevor explores an unconventional relationship betwen a young pregnant Irish girl seeking her boyfriend and an established but lonesome man with peculiar and suspect behaviors. To Felicia, Mr. Hilditch becomes a caring fatherly figure who despite the uneasiness that he sometimes produces helps her throughout her search. To Mr. Hilditch, Felicia is a vehicle by which he can relate to an outside world that he has failed at on his own, and only by misdirecting her, can he keep her close enough to buffer his own insecurities. Though Felicia and Mr. Hilditch operate with extremely different motivations, Trevor examines their respective viewpoints based on the despair that fuels both of their troubles. He oscillates between both point of views, uncovering the different sides of fear in Felicia and Mr. Hilditch's relationship. At times, the jumping back and forth can be jarring and distracting, but often it reveals chilling insight into their behavior and creates an unrelenting suspense throughout the story. Trevor has invented a collision between two people from different walks of life, and it is curious that even though their meeting is accidental it may become the determining factor in each of their lives."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"Brilliant Book. This is not about some creepy serial killer or the Bad jack the ripper versus poor girls book. The book has two central characters, both of them with some glaring weaknesses.

But as the book progresses, her character gets better and better with the end leaving you gasping. At the other end, Hilditch's character is very nicely sketched too.

William Trevor is one I most of all have admired for his short stories and essays, but with Felicia\`s Journey he has written a novel with such energy, tension and a well-crafted plot, that it must surely be regarded as one of the absolutely best books of the 1990s. Every time I look back on Felicia\`s Journey I happen to think of Charles Dickens at his best. This book belongs in every literature lovers bookshelf, next to Trevor\`s collected short stories."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"There are only two real characters in this drama, narrated in Trevor's usual spare, sparse style that puts you into the heart of things. There's Felicia, a somewhat plain teenage girl from a depressed industrial town in the Irish Republic. She's the product of a convent school, but only on suffrance because her father tends the convent's gardens. She's inexperienced and naive and when Johnny Lysaght comes along and turns her head, her subsequent pregnancy is no surprise. And there's Mr. Hilditch, a fifty-something catering manager at a factory in the English Midlands, who lives by himself and fancies young girls, though he's very careful &quot;not to shop near home,&quot; as he thinks of it. Felicia runs away from home in search of the absent Johnny, but she finds it's not easy even to survive, much less to locate an errant Irishman, in England. She's a bit suspicious of Hilditch when he tries to help her out, but he arranges things to reduce her options, and Felicia is suddenly in very great danger indeed. Trevor does a terrific job getting inside the head of a pleasant, mild-mannered psychopath, allowing the reader to gradually understand what makes him tick.

One can't help but be impressed by William Trevor's delicate handling of his characters, and his superb build-up of suspense. Weaving them together, and constantly holding back information, he depicts a depth portrait of humanity that is at once devastating and real. He questions whether evil people are intrinsically that way, or whether they are shaped by consequence, and emotion. William Trevor is a master in his prose, and the brilliance of the tension never ceases to revolve around the novel."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"William Trevor's true genius lies within the short story, however, in Felicia's Journey he proves the versatility of his skills. Barely eighteen, the young Irish girl named Felicia discovers she is pregnant after a summer romance with Johnny, a young man from England. Johnny returns to England not knowing of Felicia's condition, and he fails to leave her a way to contact him when he goes. To Johnny the romance with Felicia was a fling, but to Felicia it was real love. Shunned by her family and distraught over how to handle the pregnancy, Felicia takes off to England alone in search of Johnny hoping that he will help her. Lost, frightened, and without money in England, Felicia is befriended by Mr. Hilditch, an overweight man in his fifties who offers to help her. The naive Felicia makes an unknowingly grave mistake by trusting Mr. Hilditch. Although he seems gentle and genuinely concerned, Mr. Hilditch is really a man suffering from psychosis who sees Felicia in a disturbing light.The events that unfold as the &quot;friendship&quot; develops are chilling. Trevor, a master at displaying human behavior, does a fine job at taking the reader into the delusional mind of Mr. Hilditch. Felicia's vulnerabilities and blinded trust will make you want to shake some sense into her. The story provides plenty of twists and a surprising end. Once again, Trevor's rhythmic prose will move you, but this time in a dark and shocking manner."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"Book looks great everything that was promised and arrived in great time too.

To Felicia, Mr. Hilditch becomes a caring fatherly figure who despite the uneasiness that he sometimes produces helps her throughout her search. To Mr. Hilditch, Felicia is a vehicle by which he can relate to an outside world that he has failed at on his own, and only by misdirecting her, can he keep her close enough to buffer his own insecurities. Though Felicia and Mr. Hilditch operate with extremely different motivations, Trevor examines their respective viewpoints based on the despair that fuels both of their troubles. He oscillates between both point of views, uncovering the different sides of fear in Felicia and Mr. Hilditch's relationship. At times, the jumping back and forth can be jarring and distracting, but often it reveals chilling insight into their behavior and creates an unrelenting suspense throughout the story. Trevor has invented a collision between two people from different walks of life, and it is curious that even though their meeting is accidental it may become the determining factor in each of their lives."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"This novel investigates the mystery of the forgotten ones of our modern society, those that wander the streets, seemingly lost. We encounter them in our cities daily and criticize their lack of ability to fit into society. Yet, as William Trevor explores in his novel Felicia's Journey, it is society that is unable to fit into or around these people's lives. In this way, the novel, usually described as Hitchcockian, is also reminiscent of Kafka. Trevor, like Kafka, puts society under a microscope and studies how its inability for flexibility creates outcasts of individuals who previously had a seemingly \`normal' life. This story follows the journey of two characters, whose paths intersect, Felicia and Mr. Hilditch. When Felicia finds herself pregnant, she sets out on a journey that takes her from her home in Ireland to a town in England looking for the father of her baby. She soon encounters Mr. Hilditch, who the reader senses has a mystery of his own which must be uncovered as the plot advances. While he is seemingly a regular caring older man who holds a successful job and maintains an appearance of normality in his life, the crossing of paths of these two characters soon uncovers his hidden life. With the oppositional circumstances of the two characters-Felicia is homeless and friendless in England, and Mr. Hilditch has always lived in the same town and home in which he was raised-Trevor investigates and juxtaposes the circumstances within society that lead to the loss of direction, and even the disheartening loss of soul. Trevor writes a truly thought-provoking novel that illustrates the delicacy of the journey of life."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"I saw the movie first, and although I found it excrutiatingly slow, I thought the concept was intriguing. When I found the book at a library sale I thought I'd give it a go. The book was even slower than the movie, and both were lacking any umph at the ending to make up for the laboriously snail like pace. If Trevor's writing wasn't so crisp and clear, I would give this book 2 stars.It isn't as though nothing happens at all, there's conflict, resolution, and plot development, but everything that does occur is unwoven so carefully it's hard to care. I couldn't get in touch with Felicia or Mr. Hilditch (I've spelled his name wrong), both character's felt continually held at an arms length from the page. By the end of the book I was rushing through the final pages, not because I was riveted, but because I wanted to hurry up and finish. The climax is made anti-climatic by tedious pacing. The movie took a lot of liberty in embellishing and ignoring certain details, but neither director nor writer spiced the story up enough.Have someone relay the details to you instead, it will probably be creepier. If you're looking for a slow burner suspense novel that satisfies, read A Judgement in Stone by Ruth Rendell."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"I'll start by admitting that I think William Trevor has few if any equals among contemporary writers -- especially considering his works as a whole. He also appears to just keep getting better and better, and 'Felicia's journey' is a great example of that growth.Trevor's writing is simply luminous -- I can think of no better word to decribe it. His characters all come alive in ways that are extremely rare in modern fiction -- as the reader gets deeper and deeper into the novel, the characters are almost grown before our eyes. We know them before we realize it -- but only at the pace that Trevor controls. His powers of decription are so well-honed and subtle that reading his work is almost like seeing things with our own eyes.In 'Felicia's journey', without having any of the characters' emotions or thoughts rammed down our throats, we are intimately aware of their feelings. We can without question feel the uncertainty and trepidation with which Felicia lives her life -- more one step at a time than one day at a time. Her initial reluctance to allow Mr. Hillditch to help her is incredibly real to us. As for Hillditch himself, the evil contained in his character is revealed like peeling the layers of an onion (and I'm not giving anything more away here than the book jacket...no spoilers).The novel is much more satisfying than the film made of it by Canadian director Atom Egoyan. There are aspects of the story here that the film leaves unexplored, and a richness here that is probably untranslatable to the screen, except in the hands of a master director.If you enjoy tasting the work of an author who is a master at his craft, William Trevor is your cup of tea -- and his short stories are, if possible, even more amazing than his novels. This book is a modern masterpiece, without pretentions or avant-garde experimentaion -- it's simply incredible writing."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"This is one of those books you don't want to put down, once you realize there may be more going on than you, at first, thought. Both Mr Hilditch and Felicia are pathetic characters, demanding sympathy, but which one survives their encounter may come as a surprise I won't reveal here. Very, very much like Ruth Rendell's psychological thrillers when she writes as Barbara Vine, so there are more books of the kind, like 'Gallowglass' (my favourite), and 'A Dark-Adapted Eye'. If you liked 'Felicia's Journey', you'll find many more excellent thrillers; just look up Ms Rendell or her close friend, Ms Vine."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"William Trevor's Felicia's Journey is beautiful and compelling; It has all the page-turning suspense one finds in a &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; or Stephen King-type thriller about a weird psycho, but it is written as beautifully as any literary novel. There is humor and compassion in Trevor's vision of the lonely perp, and and almost Faulkner-like combination of exasperating simple-mindedness and emotional cunning in the victim. To come to an understanding of the human condition is a matter of survival in this novel for Felicia; and a weapon in the hands of Hilditch."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"Trevor does an execptional job of captivating the reader and telling the story from the two main characters (Felicia and Hilditch). One cannot help but feel sad after reading this novel. All involved appear to be victims at various times and on various levels. Felicia, the victim of death (her mothers) and a jilted lover and Hilditch. Hilditch a victim of his mother and his need for &quot;friendship&quot;.Trevor will keep you reading and feeling throughout the book. Do not expect to feel good after reading this novel. A great book for a book group discussion."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"In this superb book, Trevor does what he has done in some of his other novels, especially &quot;Other People's Worlds.&quot; Trevor takes the basic elements of what could easily have been a simple thriller, a piece of genre fiction, and elevates it to something much more adult. He should be on the short list for the Nobel Prize."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"I found this book to be a bit difficult to read because of the author's habit of jumping from past to present with no warning at all.

My only recommendation is to read it slowly to keep from getting confused!"},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"Felicia's journey is an excellent novel. The background to both characters is well developed. Mr. Hilditch in particular becomes more sinister due to his overwhelmingly ordinary appearance. The intimations of his unusual childhood merely suggest that he may be more disturbed than his manner presumes. Mr. Hilditch's interactions with strangers in the presence of Felicia provide the most chilling insight into the purpose of his friendship with her. It is for this reason alone that the film fails so miserably. No reference is made at all to these brief conversations. As for Felicia herself, it must be said that her character is a little limp. There are few convent girls left in Ireland who show such naivety. However she does grow more likeable, but not enough to demonstrate why she should affect Mr. Hilditch so much."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"When I discovered what the story was going to be, I wanted to stop reading--I do not like to be in worlds I do not like. However, I could not stop reading. The language, the way Trevor mixes images like a shuffling deck of cards. The two page description of the abortion was brilliant.I felt I knew Felicia and thus was so disappointed at her ending. The shred of hope put out with the description of her father and his change of heart made me hope for Felicia. Couldn't a shred of hope have been woven into Felicia's coda so that you just knew she would pull out in the time ahead; the Prodigal Daughter would finally go home.I was really disappointed by the summary dismissal of Felicia and began to think it was more the story of Hilditch as his story was resolved whereas Felicia was simply left in a depressing, downward slide."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"The premise is certainly interesting--a pregnant and penniless teenager running away from home to seek out her lover is befriended by a mentally disturbed and dangerous man. And an interesting story is just what Mr. Trevor gave us. But too much of it.This book would have benefited from editing and a cleaner ending. Also, while the character of the villanous Mr. Hilditch was wonderfully developed, Felicia, who we should have cared about the most, was little more than a wisp of a character.This is an entertaining story, but do not expect too much."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"&quot; Felicia's Journey&quot; is a departure for the Irish author in that the plot is driven by suspense more than character.Felicia's character is pretty much unformed. A small town motherless Irish girl, just out of school and newly unemployed, she's trapped in a round of housekeeping and caring for her hundred-year-old great-grandmother. The old lady is famous as the widow of a hero, killed in the &quot;Troubles&quot; a month after their wedding.An ordinary girl, with no particular talents or ambitions, Felicia's keenest awareness is of her lack of prospects. Not that she plans to do anything about it. But then a young man, older than herself and back on a visit from his job in England, flatters her with his ardent attentions. And leaves her pregnant, having &quot;forgotten&quot; to give her his address in the muddle of leavetaking.After several months without a word (but he doesn't have her address either), Felicia takes her great-grandmother's savings and runs off to England, looking for the factory where he told her he worked.The first night, she wakes, and thinks of returning. &quot;If she goes back now she'll wake up again in that bedroom. There'll be another dawn breaking on the same despair, the weariness of getting up when the bell chimes six, another day beginning. The cramped stairs will again be cleaned on Tuesdays, the old woman's sheets cleaned at the weekend. If she goes back now her father's eyes will still accuse, her brothers will threaten revenge. There will be Connie Jo's regret that she married into a family anticipating a shameful birth. There will be interested glances, or hard looks, on the street....Only being together, only their love, can bring redemption: she knows that perfectly.&quot;Mr. Hilditch, a fat catering manager, is among those she asks for directions. He discerns her predicament immediately and is attracted to her friendless, anonymous condition. Surreptitiously he follows her, awaiting his chance to befriend her and add her to his &quot;Memory Lane.&quot;The narrative moves between them. Hilditch plots, remembers happy times with previous girls he &quot;helped,&quot; and finds Felicia's Johnny with ease, keeping the information to himself. He steals Felicia's money to hasten the day she will be utterly dependent upon his largesse.Felicia, innocent but wary, angers Hilditch by escaping him. She falls in with a religious cult but, when it's time to move on, discovers the disappearance of her money. Trevor underscores the terror of homelessness with subtle portraits of the people she meets, their offhand kindness a contrast to the circus of grubbiness, insanity and drug addiction. Sights and sounds loom larger than life. Hilditch becomes a reasonable alternative.Felicia is not a heroic character. Hilditch, pathetic, self-satisfied and crafty, with flashes of viciousness, is the more interesting. His greatest pleasure is sitting with Felicia in one fast-food restaurant after another, eating and imagining the other patrons noticing them, taking him for her lover. The tension builds, however, with a truly repellant scene at an abortion clinic and Felicia's subsequent disintegration.As always, Trevor's prose is both subtle and sharp, with a distinct eye for detail. And the tone is both compassionate and pathological; tension heightens as the characters' shared world grows smaller and darker.If there's any criticism it's the stereotypical psychological root of Hilditch's obsession, a monstrous mother added, it seems, as an afterthought. Nevertheless, a fine, dark novel from a thoughtful, eloquent writer."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"A nowadays story about the chance that separates the living from the dead : a girl (Felicia) becomes homeless, a man (Mr Hilditch) kills himself, religion fails, through the hands of well intentioned people, to be the support and the healing force that people (Felicia, Mr Hilditch) badly need.A book about an immense solitude : on one hand the blind belief in love, or the naivety of a young inexperienced girl, brings her to leave her uncaring family, where she feels out of place, in order to search her short time lover, of whose child she's pregnant. On the other hand Mr Hilditch, his empty regular and \\"not-disturbing-the-neighbours\\" life, desperately seeking comfort and company, but constantly failing to reach out of the ice box of his incapacity to care.Nonetheless, a book that doesn't in the least judge. It doesn't either aim at explaining how things happen.

William Trevor is one I most of all have admired for his short stories and essays, but with Felicia\`s Journey he has written a novel with such energy, tension and a well-crafted plot, that it must surely be regarded as one of the absolutely best books of the 1990s. Every time I look back on Felicia\`s Journey I happen to think of Charles Dickens at his best. This book belongs in every literature lovers bookshelf, next to Trevor\`s collected short stories."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"While I will readily admit that Trevor has incredible command of the English language, what is even more displayed in Felicia's Journey is the lack of a sympathetic character. The title character-a young, pregnant runaway searching for her baby's father-should have been one with whom you could sympathize. Instead, Trevor's love affair with language never quite manages to include his characters, leading to an unsatisfying reading experience. Couple the lack of emotion with a depressing ending, and you have a book best suited to gathering dust."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"The most disturbing novels about murderers are the ones where the reader inhabits the killer's mind and comes to know and, in a sense, understand him. Such is the case with \`Felicia's Journey', a novel that treads a very fine line between sympathy and disgust for both main characters, Felicia, a young girl looking for the father of her unborn child and Mr. Hilditch, a refined and courteous catering manager, who sets about to befriend her. Her initial innocence and snivelling about her condition, though understandable, is grating, while the friendly and gentle Mr. Hilditch, although we (and Felicia) should know better, is the more interesting and thoughtful character. What's at once troubling and fascinating about the novel is this general lack of sympathy for Felicia and the feeling that Hilditch just \`can't be that bad.' I'm sure Trevor has constructed the narrative this way in order to unsettle the reader, and it works. I can't divulge one of the most intriguing aspects of the novel, other than to say, growing self-awareness is not always a good thing. I'm reminded of Hannibal Lecter, another likable bad boy. However, Lecter is great fantasy while Mr. Hilditch is the much more realistic and believable character. You know he's living just around the corner. This novel is beautifully written and unusual in every sense. I can guarantee the next novel you pick up will read like lead. Best to wait a while, and let Mr. Hilditch swirl around in your head like a fine wine gone vinegar."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"Here he is again, that commander of luminous prose William Trevor.

She leaves the home where she cooks, cleans and tends to an elderly grandmother to find the boy she loves, Johnny. Knowing only that he works in a lawn mower factory somewhere in the English Midlands, she embarks on her fateful journey.Unable to locate the factory, let alone Johnny, she is befriended by Mr. Hilditch, a portly catering manager with a penchant for pop tunes from the 50s, a portrait gallery of strangers decorating his walls, and a black past. Mr. Hilditch follows her, assures her dependence upon him by stealing her money, and eventually takes her into his home.Trevor's brilliant narrative skills are showcased as he weaves the story with flashbacks, revelations of his characters' thoughts, and displays of their dreams. As always, he is articulate and compassionate, bringing his shuddery thriller to the zenith of a conclusion."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"This is an intriguing book of psychological suspense for which its author was the recipient of the 1994 Whitbread Award. Written by a master storyteller, it tells the story of two people whose lives interconnect, only to have repercussions for both in the most unexpected ways.Felicia is a seventeen year old motherless and naive Irish girl, who has become intimate with an Irish boy named Johnny. Of course, the expected ensues, and after Johnny has left Ireland and returned to England where he ostensibly works, Felicia is left holding the bag. Her disapproving father suspects Johnny of actually being in the British Army and, thus, a traitor to his own. He also has a few choice words for his daughter, now that she is in the family way, and none of it is flattering. So, Felicia leaves her rural village and her family and goes off in search of Johnny, having nothing more than the vaguest of ideas where he might be.She crosses the Irish Sea and arrives in the English Midlands in the industrial city of Birmingham, as she believes Johnny to be working in a lawn mower factory there. In her search for Johnny, she runs into the portly catering manager for one of the local factories. His name is Joseph Ambrose Hilditch, and he is outwardly a jovial and agreeable man, well-liked by his co-workers and meticulous about his culinary repasts. He lives in solitary splendor in the large house in which he grew up. The house is cluttered with collectibles but well- kept, although decorated in the style of a bygone era. Mr. Hilditch is, indeed, a collector, but his collection is initially far beyond Felicia's imaginings. In fact, Mr. Hilditch has a darker side to him, which is not immediately discernible by the unwary.When Felicia first meets Mr. Hilditch, it is to ask for information, but something about her catches Mr. Hilditch's fancy, and he finds himself keeping Felicia in his crosshairs. When Felicia seemingly unexpectedly runs into Mr. Hilditch again, he directs her to lodgings, and so it begins. As Mr. Hilditch insinuates himself ever so slowly into her life, weaving a fantasy about his own life that is sure to put her mind at ease about him. Felicia begins finding herself ensnared by this ostensibly kind and ever so helpful, avuncular man, and she initially fails to see the darkness that lies at the core of his being.The author begins the book with Felicia's journey to England in search of her lover. Using flashbacks throughout the story, the author fills in Felicia's background and describes the events that have brought her to the point of making this journey. When Mr. Hilditch is introduced to the reader, the author begins to take the reader into the recesses of his mind, allowing the reader to see what Felicia initially fails to see, the duplicity and cunning that is masked by his overt geniality. Like a spider to the fly, Mr. Hilditch begins laying his trap, and so Felicia's journey thrusts her into the belly of the beast.With his carefully cadenced prose, the author explores the darker corners of the human psyche, and in the mind of Mr. Hilditch, it is dark, indeed. As his carefully constructed psychological house of cards begins to fall, there are unspeakable revelations as to what lies at the heart of Mr. Hilditch's predilection, and it is not pretty. The author, in taking the reader into the recesses of the mind of each of the two protagonists, tries to explain how it is that each of these two flawed human beings were able initially to achieve a connection with another, only to find ostensible betrayal. What is decidedly different is the way that they each cope with that betrayal.There is no happily-ever-after ending to this story, which culminates with a conclusion that is quite bleak, robbing the reader of some satisfaction. Fans of Ruth Rendell, however, will very much appreciate the psychological cat and mouse game that is played throughout and will enjoy the author's foray into this genre. As always, the author pens a novel that provides much food for thought on many levels, and the use of the word journey in the title of the book has a much broader meaning within the context of the story. In reading this book, fans will enjoy the elegant, spare prose that they have come to expect from this enormously talented author."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"William Trevor's precise, descriptive prose brings to mind other current authors (Pete Dexter, Tom Wolfe) who enable readers to visualize, as if viewing a film, the details of a scene--from beads of sweat trickling down a character's cheek to the colors in the oil paintings decorating a wall. Treveor uses this admirable technique to great employ in this enigmatic story of the relationship between a predator, a seemingly kindly bachelor, and his prey, a frightened pregnant Irish teen come to England to look for the father. The issue of free will as the Creator envisions it is examined here: the predator, Mr. Hilditch, in his manipulative fashion, carves out a destiny for Felicia (and, unwittingly, himdself) that suggests a control one might ascribe to a Deity. The ending is cryptic and odd; one can take the events and their aftermath in any number of ways and Trevor is of no help in steering one in the proper direction. Perhaps that's a good thing--the ending is far more haunting than the rest of the novel.(The unabridged audiobook I listened to was read by Simon Prebble, not Dermot Crowley. Prebble's interpretation, as well as his vocal characterization, is flawless.)"},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"This book starts with a lot of promise and the writing is excellent--for the first few chapters. However, the character of Felicia undergoes very little development, something I find to be Mr. Trevor's biggest writing mistake. Much more depth could (and should) have been added to the story had we been privy to Felicia's inner thoughts. As it is, she is very flat and one-dimensional with no deep emotions and seems to exist only to further characterize the fascinating Mr. Hilditch.Mr. Hilditch is a very well formed character indeed, almost comical and likable, and does have many thoughts and emotions. This made the book a story about Mr. Hilditch, with Felicia just passing through, really serving no purpose other than to become Mr. Hilditch's current obsession.Based on the title, I would assume the author wanted this to be a story about Felicia. If that is the case, then Mr. Trevor should have had the climax of Felicia's story closer to the end of the book. Instead, the last of the book gives us no clear glimpses of Felicia. As for Felicia's fate, I would have preferred a more solid ending. Symbolism is well and good, but only when used in a symbolic book. When used simply to confuse and surprise, I find it rather annoying. Had the book been titled &quot;Mr. Hilditch&quot; perhaps I would have enjoyed it more and rated it higher."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"I'll start by admitting that I think William Trevor has few if any equals among contemporary writers -- especially considering his works as a whole.

I was intrigued by the back-cover synopsis, and was encouraged to buy it by my husband, who had read Trevor before and admired his work. Fans of suspense/mystery/crime novels who like their writing smart and literary will really enjoy this book. In a mere 212 pages, Trevor weaves a chilling psychodrama between two intriguing main characters: a pregnant young Irish woman searching the British midlands for her missing boyfriend and a middle-aged Englishman whose appetite for food is only matched by his unhealthy obsession with young runaway women. Trevor's economic descriptions of the scenery already manage to convey the severe depression of these British industrial towns -- a contrast to Felicia's more pastoral, Irish Catholic upbringing -- but not much. If I do have one complaint about the book, it's title is Felicia's Journey, but in the end it focuses more on the male character, Mr. Hilditch, and leaves Felicia's character less defined than I wanted her to be. But this is a small issue. William Trevor is a very fine writer, and this book is such a great introduction to his work, they're even making it into a movie."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"Irish immigration is a topic that has been dealt with to great lengths in contemporary fiction, but by presenting the subject within the detective genre Trevor manages to treat the idea of alienation from a fresh angle. The character of Felicia is on one level a modern extension of the traditional female symbol of Ireland. The story of Ireland in the twentieth century is one of leaving, and Felicia's quest for acceptance, for love away from Ireland is indicative of this history. Yet the character of Mr. Hilditch cannot be simply accepted as representative of Britain with respect to Ireland. Mr. Hilditch is a study in the idea of the facade. His house, his lifestyle, and even the way that he structures his thoughts are not what they originally seem. Similarly, Felicia's own vision of what she expected to happen in England was remarkably different from reality.Trevor's narrative style is divided between the perspectives of Felicia and Mr. Hilditch. I study Irish history, and specifically Irish nationalism, so while reading this novel I was constantly looking for hidden political messages or references to traditional Irish iconography or depictions of the Anglo-Irish dynamic. I found the task daunting, largely because a reduction of the novel to a 'dependent Ireland - dominant Britain' outline seemed deceptively simple, which is yet another reason why I noted that Trevor's novel looks at the situation from a fresh angle. Ultimately, I think that this novel works best simply as a compelling, well-written mystery novel. To attempt to read too much politics into the narrative is to undermine the elegance of Felicia's innocence or desperation of Mr. Hilditch's pathetic attempts to recreate something that never existed in the first place. This novel should be taken at face value, and as such it functions as a hypnotic and often disturbing mystery."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"This book is brilliantly written. And it focuses on the character it's meant to focus on... regardless of the title. What it did for me, (which so few books do) is let me do the work. It let me play psychologist and investigator. It let me analyze the characters. It let me decide who was pitiable, and why, and who was sinister, and why. It let me see the conception, so to speak, of a &quot;lost&quot; soul. Ever wonder.. truly wonder... how the depraved got that way? Or those that reject society and end up rooting through bins for sustenance? What events led to it? It also struck me that how and what one ate, in the book, signified almost how they viewed life and people, whether they were a rejector or a hoarder. Mr. Hilditch, a hoarder, with a house full of objects from his past and other people's pasts, also a hoarder of young girl's souls, kept a stocked cupboard, and ate with great gusto. And Felicia, all her belongings fitting in a couple bags, eats hardly at all, (sp.) and ends up rooting through rubbish bins after &quot;rejecting&quot; her unborn child and basically the whole of society."},{"Title":"Professional collection catalog","review":"What Alfred Hitchcock did for the disturbed individual incinema, William Trevor does in literature. Although thesubject of the book is basically lurid and troubling, it becomes a springboard for a work of true beauty and com passion in the hands of one of the true masters of the English language.

Basque sheepherders and others found ethnic communion and support in Basque boarding houses and hotels that were usually run by women. These Basque men who stayed in America often brought over their families, or married women from the old country who then migrated. Many Basque women migrated on their own. As new generations of native Basque Americans were born, women often became the principle carriers and preservers of cultural traditions, as well as primary agents of Americanization, as they sought and encouraged their children to seek the educational and material benefits of the United States. Jacqueline Thursby interviewed Basque American women across the West, observed and participated in cultural activities and events, and did supplemental research in the Basque country of Spain and France in preparation for this seminal overview of the culture of Basque American woemn. Thursby admirably clarifies the role of women in the transformation of Basques into Basque Americans. _Mother's Table, Father's Chair_ will be of immense interest to students of ethnography, basque culture, women's studies, and Western American studies."},{"Title":"Mother S Table Father S Chair","review":"Prior to reading this book, I did not realize that Basques have been such an important ethnic group in America's West. Thursby's book provides a fine overview of Basque settlement in the United States, and she uses this historical context to provide understanding of important forms of folklore in present day Basque cultural expressions. The major portion of the book is an overview of genres and forms of folk culture from areas with large populations of Basques. She provides special attention to the importance of women's contributions to the preservation and adaptation of this ethnic group's folklore, and she concludes her study with a thought-provoking and well presented analysis of the group's traditional culture. Many of her insights are useful for comparing and contrasting Basque traditional culture with the folklore of other ethnic groups in other regions, and Thursby's writing style is accessible and interesting."},{"Title":"The National Review Treasury of Classic Children's Literature","review":"Compiled and edited by William F.

The many-roomed manors surrounded by lush gardens and populated with liveried footmen. From Pemberly to Chatsworth, from Manderly to Blenheim, the English country house has captivated American audiences as we wander from room to room in the ones now owned by the National Trust imagining what it must have been like to live in one of these palaces.Many books have been written on the English country house, but most are fawning photographic journeys into the picturesque, or architectural studies. This is by far the best comprehensive social history of the country house: warts and all. This book chronicles the rise of the estate, when the Empire was at its peak, London at its dirtiest and the cost of wiring and heating all those rooms was not an issue, to the years when these elegant status symbols became ridiculous white elephants that literally couldn't be given away... to their reemergance as cultural and historical artifacts and status symbols all at once.This book is well-researched and well-written, and offers a comprehensive view of all types of country houses: from the huge palaces to the little cottages that sprouted up in the Victorian period for the middle classes to enjoy. It even delves into the building rush of the 1980's, when the country home again became popular as the rich grew richer.If you are at all interested in English history, the history of the wealthy, or the history or architecture then this book is for you. It offers a nice history of the National Trust and other organizations that own and open these houses to the public. If you are a tourist who enjoys traveling to country houses this is also definately worth a read."},{"Title":"Music with the Brain in Mind","review":"Jensen continues to survey and summarise research studies on the impact of music and applies his gift in making them accessible to educators.

Murphy."},{"Title":"Alias Billy the Kid: The Man Behind the Legend (Western Legacy Series)","review":"From having him grow up a Manhattan gangster to including false photos the author shows an astonishing lack of historical research, especially for a man who has supposedly \\"spent more than thirty-five years studying the life and times of Billy the Kid.\\" Included is just about every myth ever made up about the Kid with a few new ones thrown in. His sources? Most of these stories don't list any which is funny considering how many professionals have written biographies on him without reporting these. The sources he does list seem pretty disreputable too. He blatantly dismisses the accounts of the people who knew him. There is one page where he lists five accounts of Billy as a boy told by people who knew him and dismisses them all as biased. Not one subject agrees with him except, apparently, the ones who were never interviewed and can't refute him.His evidence that Billy stayed in New York City until he was fourteen and even committed a crime there is based entirely on the ill-kept census records of the time. There were thousands of McCarty's throughout the country and proving one of them to be the Kid is by now impossible. (Astonishingly enough he uses that same argument to prove that it couldn't possibly be the right McCarty family listed in Indianapolis as is the accepted history) He even has to change his and his mother's name to make it better fit his theory having her die before the record has her show up in Silver City.Based upon this flimsy evidence he makes up a complete back-story. He even has him travel all the way back to New York from New Mexico simply so that he can tie him in with a murder there before rushing back to New Mexico again. Again it requires major stretching of the dates and a name change to attribute this to the Kid. If Billy had ever gone by the name of Michael, been 3-4 years older, worked as a tinsmith at any point, and never left New York City then this might seem a more plausible theory. All the newspaper article says is that Michael McCarty aged 20 killed a friend with a knife. No further proof that it is the same person as Billy is listed nor even exists. As he himself states, McCarty is not exactly an uncommon name.This whole book, while fascinating, seems more a work of fiction than of fact. I'd recommend it as that if it weren't so boring and confusingly written. No doubt to hide the lack of any real substance.

He's taken the scenario above and turned it into a kind of cross between A Man in Full and Death Wish. When billionaire industrialist Charlie Becker's beloved granddaughter Natasha dies of a drug overdose, he sets out to wreak his terrible revenge on the entire drug apparatus responsible for her death. By the end of the novel, he's, you guessed it, on board his yacht in the Amazon on pursuing a Peruvian cocaine kingpin.There are many funny lines and the action is thrilling enough, though it does go on longer than it needs to.

The leather is nice but a bit stiff. The spine, however, is sewn and very flexable--a major plus for a long-lasting Bible.I like the fairly handy size very much. Bibles are gennerally made way too big. The paper is very quality and the font selection and paragraph-style page layout is very nice as well.Reguarding the translation itself: I'm particularly pleased with the traslating of the Old Testament and Apocrypha, well done and very readable. I'm not at all offended with the gender-inclusive rendering with certain passages, as footnotes mark each diversion from the originals. When I began reading the Bible, I started with an original Living paraphrase because the KJV was just too much for me. I soon learned that the translation was so terribly compromised for readability, I was missing out on a lot of important meaning. The NRSV is a fantastic balance between readability and accuracy, if you ask me. Thinking of giving a Bible to new believer or someone just starting to study it? Give them an NRSV!If you're considering this particular printing for your main Bible, I'd suggest shopping around first. But overall, I'm satisfied."},{"Title":"The New Revised Standard Version Bible with Apocrypha","review":"It's hard to find superlatives enough to describe this edition. Everything about it is both useful and beautiful.A pocket Bible with the Apocrypha is rare enough to begin with, but--in addition to the usual Catholic Deuterocanonicals and Protestant Apocrypha--this little book manages to include everything in the Greek and Slavonic canons. It will fatten your pocket a little, but it's worth the extra bulk to have the extra books, especially if you're interested in the history of Christian thought.The binding makes pocket Bibles from American publishers look crude. The type, even in the footnotes, is remarkably legible. There are just enough helps in the back to be useful without bulking up the book unnecessarily.The Anglicized Edition is not substantially different from the American edition of the NRSV. If you're a pastor, lector, or writer who needs to use the NRSV in the exact form that's approved for the liturgy in your church, you might not want to rely on this edition. I don't think most other readers will notice the difference."},{"Title":"The New Revised Standard Version Bible with Apocrypha","review":"I am very picky about the typography in my Bibles--and for its small size this beautiful little Bible is very easy to read.

The binding is a dark olive leatherflex with gold lettering.The type is small, but still easy to read.

The number of collectors of Boston & Sandwich Glass could probably all be fit on the tip of a needle. I'm one of those \\"odd\\" collectors so bear with me because if you are reading this... you are probably one too.This book is an almost painfully detailed history of the region as well as the factory itself. My copy of this book was printed in 1966 and I think it may be the most RECENT of the handful of related books. The ultra-serious collector of Sandwich Glass worships the name of Ruth Webb-Lee and probably owns a copy of her books:Sandwich Glass: The History of The Boston & Sandwich Glass Company.Current Values of Antique Glass.American Glass Cup Plates.Early American Pressed Glass.Ruth Webb Lees Sandwich Glass Handbook.In a nut shell, the book is a very detailed history that is definately NOT a casual read. It's very fact filled and reads almost like an investigative report or a documentary on paper. I don't say any of that to denigrate the book. It is and will likely forever remain the only book of its type. One wonderful thing about this and the other 4 books I mentioned above is the fact that despite being out of print for more than half a century, they can still be found and purchased very inexpensively.

And so true!!"},{"Title":"At The Feet Of The Master","review":"First, it is very questionable to publish this worthless title in the Name of J. Krishnamurti, for it has never been proven that the young J. K. actually is its author, even J.K. himself doesn't seem to have *remembered* having ever written such a thing (although not excluding the possibility for that). Second, even the young adult J.K. would - to put it mildly - have disapproved of many of the teachings the book transports, most notably of the Guru-Disciple dogma: Sentences as e.g. \\"[...]for the pupil is one with his Master, and he needs only to put back his thought into the Master's thought, to see at once whether it agrees. If it does not, it is wrong, and he changes it instantly, for the Master's thought is perfect, because He knows all.\\" would have seemed a bad joke to the mature J.K. and represent just about the opposite of J.K.'s core teachings. If you want to read a boring little text that is in most parts utterly anti-Krishnamurti, read this book and get a good laugh. If you seek to understand what J.K.'s philosophy is about, put it back into the shelf and read anything else you can get first. For is not worth the paper on which it is printed."},{"Title":"At The Feet Of The Master","review":"Actually it is one of the best book of the world . Krishnamurti was not the actual writer of this book .it was written by Anny ,his so called mother. Must read."},{"Title":"At The Feet Of The Master","review":"The book is worthwhile for all to read, regardless of religious denomination or spiritual leaning.To my understanding it was not so much written by Krishnamurti as it was transcribed from a memory. He 'wrote' it in the afterglow of an instructional meeting with a master. He received these very concise instructions for Right Living from the master while on a higher plane of consciousness. Pure consciousness. His body was in a sleep state and his consciousness left the body.Regarding whether it is a fake or not, or who really wrote it is, in the end, immaterial--it doesn't really matter. It is an exceptional spiritual text no matter who wrote it.What K later became is not who he was at this stage (13 yo)He was a pupil LEARNING about these things. He was not yet a teacher himself. That would not fully occur until 1926, after his brother Nitya died. In the shadow of that suffering he became the teacher.CW Leadbeater corrected some of his english as K was not yet fluent, hence the arguments over who wrote it.I guess in all honesty you could say his master wrote it or composed this teaching. Again, K just transcribed it.Some people have issues with how this book lays out very step by step instructions, which in later life K rejected as being too rigid and concrete. A good piece of advice would be to start reading his late works, such asMeeting Life: Writings and Talks on Finding Your Path Without Retreating from Society, then move backward in time to his earliest works (such as At the feet..) and then go further back into Theosophy.btw Annie Besant was Theosophy's best writer. Check out herThe Ancient Wisdom. It will blow your mind. CW Leadbeater [[ASIN:B00117VNES Man: Whence, How and Whither A Record of Clairvoyant Investigation]] is also a very good writer.(Many titles from these two (Besant and Leadbeater) are free or low cost as Kindle Books.

All seekers will appreciate what this book has to offer them on the path to greater insight and wisdom."},{"Title":"At The Feet Of The Master","review":"This book is full of naive falsities that do not in any way reflect anything other than Theosophical nonsense regurgitated by a young boy. This book is full of concepts, ideas, and tradition--precisely what PREVENTS intelligence from functioning.If you can read this book with freedom of mind you will see the truth in the falseness and not be burdened by it. But if your mind is conditioned in any way, these words will do only harm. In here you will find a concise method--repeat: conditioning, program, path--toward being a religious follower, or disciple. But discipleship will never lead you to truth. On the contrary, you cannot approach truth by any way or method, or through any leader or master. It may appear that various sayings in here have application in daily life, irrespective of religion, but that is precisely because the entire field of daily living is constructed out of ways, methods, leaders, and followers.If you are looking for words of Krishnamurti that will point you to the door in yourself, start with his last books (like The Future Is Now) and work your way backwards."},{"Title":"At The Feet Of The Master","review":"Very few books are able to even approach the truth.

It is a great read for anyone searching for greater spirituality in their life. It is not really a book of any particular religion or Denomination. It is just a bit of guidance from a great master. Krishnamurti does not try to convert anyone. He merely nudges people to seek aims greater than themselves. I find it a quick read that can also be read over again numerous times.

It contains the essence of the spiritual path in brief. Millions of words have been written about the inner path to enlightenment, but they all seem superfluous compared to the living and vital spiritual principles contained in this short book. Krishnamurti emphasizes putting spiritual principles into action and explains that utmost sincerity with oneself is absolutely necessary. He explains the Four Qualifications for the spiritual path: Discrimination, Desirelessness, Good Conduct and Love. He explains the operation and influence of the astral (emotional) and mental bodies and how to transcend these influences. If you read nothing else about the spiritual path, read this!"},{"Title":"At The Feet Of The Master","review":"This little book was written by Alcyone (Krishnamurti) when he was a boy in physical years, but very old in the inner sense of knowledge, wisdom and love. The book demonstrates that true discipleship is not a &quot;physical trait&quot; and that it pertains to the soul, or the inner wealth of the person. The words are distilled from &quot;impressions&quot; received by the boy from his spiritual Teacher or Master, and the purity of understanding is what shines through, as there is no worldly sophistication required of true understanding. As such, the book may be equally useful for adults, children or young teenagers who are struggling with illusive complexities of the world, yet may already be &quot;disciples&quot; in the inner sense. There is simplicity of language. There is no pretence. Only wisdom touched with love in a balanced, natural, enlightened way."},{"Title":"At The Feet Of The Master","review":"Krishnamurti himself asked people not to pay attention to his immature teachings (prior to about 1933).

It's a wonderful substitute, and an easy to digest history lesson.The relationship of the medieval Mongolian nation to China and the western European nations is fascinating, and thanks to \\"Storm from the East\\" it is easily understood.

This book will NOT help you learn to make books. It also has a lot of terms that it never defines, and if you're not an experienced book maker, you won't know what they mean.On the other hand, I would give a rating of FIVE stars for the art and inspiration. the pictures and journals are absolutely gorgeous. They're too small, though, and you want to see everything closer.But, since this book is called &quot;making journals by hand&quot;... it is NOT helpful for that, and so I give it three stars."},{"Title":"Making Journals by Hand: 20 Creative Projects for Keeping Your Thoughts","review":"Making Journals By Hand is an excellent introduction to artistic techniques that can enhance an artistic journal, not to mention directions for actually making the journals in which you might use these techniques. This is a very unique book because so few how-to books give information about ways to make your journal more artful. The techniques described lend themselves well to edgier, more artistic journaling, rather than cookie-cutter scrapbooking. I was especially excited to see explanations of emulsion lifts and image transfers. As a fan of the journals of Dan Eldon and Sabrina Ward Harrison, I felt that I could make journal entries more in keeping with those styles by using the ideas in this book. Plus there are many inspirational photos of artfully done journals by artists such as Teesha and Tracey Moore. All in all, this book was a great find and I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Making Journals by Hand: 20 Creative Projects for Keeping Your Thoughts","review":"The title of this book is slightly misleading...I think it's more about creating the visual aspect of a journal's pages than binding a journal by hand. That's not to say that there aren't any instructions at all for creating your own from scratch, just that the projects presented are on the simple side and not what someone looking for a bookbinding manual would necessarily be looking for.Now, if you are looking for a book that will inspire you to keep a true visual journal, then you can do no better than to purchase this book! The photographs are beautiful and the amount of creativity contained in these pages is awesome.There are many instructions included for designing the pages of your journal that would put this type of record-keeping in the league of scrapbooking. If you want to make a memorable legacy for yourself and generations to come, then you will want to put the ideas in &quot;Making Journals By Hand&quot; to use."},{"Title":"Making Journals by Hand: 20 Creative Projects for Keeping Your Thoughts","review":"Most books that I rave about, I expect people to request at the public library. And, in most cases, that's fine.However, now &amp; then someone puts together a book that I refer to often for inspiration, affirmation, and the pure artistic energy it provides; &quot;Making Journals by Hand&quot; is one of the latter. (Other books on that short list including SARK's earliest books, and Natalie Goldberg's &quot;Living Color&quot;.)&quot;Making Journals by Hand&quot; has superb, simple, and detailed directions for even the most complex and professional journals. However, what charms me are the ideas that involve simple techniques and found materials... the kinds of things that are kicking around my house anyway. (You know, that box of stuff in the closet that's being saved because, &quot;someday this might be useful,&quot; ....? *LOL*)Sure, make certain your public library owns this book. But then, get your own copy. You'll want it on your bookshelf, and--more often--open, at your elbow, while you work on the many glorious and original projects in the book!"},{"Title":"Making Journals by Hand: 20 Creative Projects for Keeping Your Thoughts","review":"I have spent hundreds of dollars of my hard earned money on Amazon.com's art books this year. This is easily the best book out of all the books I have bought. The layout is excellent, the photographic quality is wonderful, and the choices of the pieces is well thought-out. Beginners can get many ideas from this book, and all of us more advanced Somerst Studio Magazine types will find lots of inspiration. A lot of books can be checked out of the local library, but this is one you'll definitely want to own!"},{"Title":"Making Journals by Hand: 20 Creative Projects for Keeping Your Thoughts","review":"I am so impressed by this book. The photos are absolutely gorgeous and show a sophistication not often seen in how-to books. They convey a journaling 'mood' and draw you in to explore every detail. The works showcased are thoughtful, inspiring, and truly beautiful.The how-to sections are straight forward and user friendly. In response to those who found this area lacking I ask; Why make a simple process complicated? It never occured to me that this book should be about bookbinding, yet there are many resources offered for those whose journalling takes them in that direction. How many times have I been given a beautiful blank book and felt intimidated by its empty pages? It always seemed so boring to give a rundown of my day, but to do a yoga or garden journal? This has inspired me to begin a journal about my experiences in learning the Japanese language. For beginners this book shows journalling as doable and for the more experienced it is a source of reinvigorating inspiration.This book is filled with so many ideas and suggestions to get you going and it's clear that the author truly loves this art/written form. I think people will be inspired by looking at the artists' works and will feel encouraged to do their own when they turn to the instructional section and see how easy it is. This is a most treasured book to me and I highly, highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Making Journals by Hand: 20 Creative Projects for Keeping Your Thoughts","review":"Hand-Made Journals, it would be perfect! I agree with other reviewers who see this more as an inspiration for those who keep visual journals, than a guide to actually making books to use as journals. That said, this is a stunningly beautiful and inspiring book. A wide variety of styles and media are shown in the photographed journals. It left me longing to pick up and read the journals that were included."},{"Title":"Making Journals by Hand: 20 Creative Projects for Keeping Your Thoughts","review":"I agree with the reviewers who commented that this book is not about making journals by hand. (Especially the scant instructions on restructuring a hardbound book and the triptych.)My real reason for writing this review is to STRONGLY CAUTION all readers about the two solvent techniques and the rather blas&eacute; hazard warnings. Blender pens are extremely toxic and have been taken off the market. Xylene is a very hazardous product, as are the solvents listed, including natural solvents such as peppermint. (I had to go to the hospital because of the affects of inhaled wintergreen oil, even though I was working outside on a windy day. Don't do it!) Many of these solvents leave a scent or residue on the pages long after you've finished your project.The book is quick to &quot;read&quot; since it has very little information. Worse, the photographs are annoyingly without depth of field leaving foreground and background of images out of focus.That said, and the reason I gave it a 2 rating, the journals the artists are keeping are very inspirational and artful. (They rate a 5) Jason Thompson should be commended for sharing these works with other artists -- but not for his descriptions or techniques!"},{"Title":"Making Journals by Hand: 20 Creative Projects for Keeping Your Thoughts","review":"A journal is more than what is between the covers. You can express yourself just as much with the exterior of your journal as you do inside your journal.I didn't just love this book, I adored it! It is filled with ideas, images and inspirations. A journal is one of the most personal items a person can have. After reading this book it seems like a natural progression to make it even more personal by making it a piece of art. This leads me to my next comment. This book is not just for people who journal. It would be a great selection for anyone who loves paper arts such as scrapbooking, collage, or book making. If you love the magazine Somerset Studios you'll love this book!"},{"Title":"Making Journals by Hand: 20 Creative Projects for Keeping Your Thoughts","review":"I am very excited to be included in this inspirational book. I constantly pour over the pages- the artwork and ideas are overwhelming. My brain is on overload. I have already incorporated many of the examples and brilliantly creative ideas into my own work. It is by far my favorite book and a journey I often take, completely losing myself and all track of time. If you are interested in this process, I also suggest viewing copies of the published journals of Dan Eldon, Peter Beard, Sabrina Ward Harrison, Frida Kahlo,and William Burroughs. My life is a series of visual journals. My emphasis being on expression and not product. I also seek that out in the world and that is why this collection of others' visual journals is so amazing: all these artists and story tellers revealing an inner, hidden, secret life that society rarely gets a glimpse of. This is the real story."},{"Title":"Making Journals by Hand: 20 Creative Projects for Keeping Your Thoughts","review":"I've had this book for a couple of months now and find it an excellent source of inspiration. I have other books that I love on bookbinding and those (like Cover to Cover) will be more helpful to people looking for information on how to bind books. This book is more about the possibilities of journal keeping and creative ways to record your thoughts, travels, etc. This is more a book about &quot;content&quot; than on how to make the book itself. The illustrations are wonderful! I think this book makes a perfect companion to your bookbinding instruction books."},{"Title":"Making Journals by Hand: 20 Creative Projects for Keeping Your Thoughts","review":"While the journals in here were really beautiful, it doesn't look like the author put a lot of effort into explaining them. It only took me about an hour to read this book and, even with a few creative ideas(mostly from the pictures), the general content was sparse. Some of the shaded sections on the side looked like space filler (for example, one on &quot;themes&quot; describes a travel journal's purpose as &quot;chronicling your travels&quot;...no way!). It bothers me when writers use pretty pictures to try and pull off the appearance of a quality book. Flip through this book in the library to get some good ideas, but don't expect thoughtful written advice."},{"Title":"Making Journals by Hand: 20 Creative Projects for Keeping Your Thoughts","review":"While this book has a wonderful visual collection of stunningly beautiful books and journals, it offers virtually no guidance on how to &quot;make&quot; them. The advice on putting together a complicated book with non-linear pages is limited to 3 steps, with no list of supplies and vague instructions. Poorly edited, there are many grammatical mistakes or typos. Buy this book for inspiration, but not for instruction."},{"Title":"Making Journals by Hand: 20 Creative Projects for Keeping Your Thoughts","review":"I enjoyed what there was in this book, but the generous use of white space and extended discussion on how to make your own books left little room for the subjects of most interest to me, namely the appearance of artists' journals and suggestions for making visual enhancements to a a journal.The ideas there are very fine, indeed, but for the price and number of pages I simply expected more ideas. I'd recommend checking this book out of the library rather than actually purchasing it. I don't think it will grow on one as a reference."},{"Title":"Making Journals by Hand: 20 Creative Projects for Keeping Your Thoughts","review":"This luscious book peeks into the art journals of many talented artists, giving step-by-step instructions on basic techniques for compiling and binding journals that mix image and word. Because the contributors are all highly talented artists, this book should have been more intimidating to my non-artist self than it was. Instead, it is encouraging and freeing, and the author provides short helpful tips on the process of writing a journal along with illustration and decoration. I read the book in two addictive sittings and am looking forward to spending more time with it, and with the books and websites listed in the bibliography, even if I never try any of the techniques. Thank you, Jason, for a generous, empowering, and visually stunning book."},{"Title":"Making Journals by Hand: 20 Creative Projects for Keeping Your Thoughts","review":"This book is so inspiring!

The techniques were all new to me. The one that I am going to try first is the wax resist. I am a little worried about the other techniques that use solvents - I don't know where to buy them, and I don't want anything unnatural that is going to hurt my body. Overall, this is a lovely book. One department that does need a little bit of expansion is making the journal itself. However, I already have a blank journal that I bought from a bookstore beginning with Bor (they offer great blank journals CHEAP) and I am just going to use the techniques. Cheers!!"},{"Title":"Making Journals by Hand: 20 Creative Projects for Keeping Your Thoughts","review":"I have read this book over and over and still I keep going back to it for inspiration for my journal projects.

If I could have only one book for making, decorating and filling handmade journals, this would definitely be it!"},{"Title":"Making Journals by Hand: 20 Creative Projects for Keeping Your Thoughts","review":"&quot;Making Journals By Hand&quot; is a highly inspirational, original book. Lots of interesting anecdotes and ideas for putting together your own personalized journals, diaries, and albums. I thought many of the different artist's journals were simply magnificent, and are a true inspiration if you want to undertake a project like this. I thought this was a really great read, and will give you a real creative &quot;charge.&quot; It even includes cool stuff like how to carve your own cork and eraser stamps. Awesome book, highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Making Journals by Hand: 20 Creative Projects for Keeping Your Thoughts","review":"I am fascinated with the examples provided in this book!

This book did not show the basics. It was a waste of money, the author seemed more interested in presenting cute ideas and making pretty pictures than teaching basics."},{"Title":"Pictures of the Night","review":"I waited a long time for this to be republished in England. It begins just as the other two did, 'once upon a time', but Bella is actually speaking the words. I was looking forward to this book, not only for the story and the wrapping up of Alice's and Megan's tales, but also to discover Bella's mind.Bella is the most flamboyant and rebellious of the trio: she is constantly compared to Carmen throughout the trilogy, a nod to the allure she has for men and her troubles with them, and she is the one who keeps up with popular culture. However, although Bella loves Elvis and other rock'n'roll singers, she is deeply touched by the world of jazz and the blues. And this is a perfect example of her character: though she can seem shallow, arrogant and irritating, inside Bella is actually quite thoughtful. The agony of the blues and jazz touches her because she has had sadness in her life, the dynamics of the original fairytale being unchanged. As before, the stepmother, whom Bella wanted to love, despises her beauty and does everything she can to stifle her spirit. Therefore, Bella is, in fact, probably the most isolated of the trio, because she seems the most invulnerable. Geras brilliantly reveals the insecurities behind Bella's faade: her doubts about love, just as real as Alice's and Megan's; her distress about what happened to Alice (she was the one, after all, who decided to protect her that first night); and most of all, is Marjorie really as hostile as Bella thinks she is, or is she really being 'melodramatic' as everyone else says?The sense of doom that permanently hovered over 'Watching the Roses' is subtly changed here into a creeping suspicion, as Geras brilliantly mimicks what happened to Snow-Drop in the original fairytale, even managing to get the bit about Bella's colouring. Bella adores to sing jazz and blues, to get rid of her agony, and even the title of the story comes from a song in the story which is about chasing the blues away. The meeting of her 'prince' in Paris, on a holiday after her A-levels, is incredibly romantic, but typically the course of true love does not run smooth and he disappears, leaving Bella vulnerable.As both Megan and Alice's tales reach their end, Bella feels left out, remarking that 'it would never, never be only the three of us ever again'. Where is her happy ending? And why does she keep seeing a white cat every time something strange happens...?This story is powerful, but also sensitive as it probes Bella's mind, her defiance of the adult world and rules as personified by her stepmother, her refusal to pity herself, but also her longing for love, the one who is protected instead of the one who protects. However, it does make you wonder what it was like for Megan alone on holiday with Dorothy, and what Alice did in France. And what is Bella going to do after the end of the story? Marjorie is especially well-detailed: her jealousy of Bella is increasingly sinister, but Geras also ridicules it, and gives the reader the satisfaction of a kind of show-down between the two. Bella herself emerges as a fully rounded character, and the story ends in a very romantic, upbeat way, typical of her. Yes, there is sex, but as before it is dealt with as a fact of life, something that girls on the verge of womanhood would obviously think about. 'Pictures of the Night' will not disappoint fans of the series."},{"Title":"Pictures of the Night","review":"The third and final installment of the Egerton Hall series, _Pictures of the Night_, is a retelling of the Snow White story. Our heroine this time is Bella, the most flamboyant, rebellious, and wild of the three girls. This is the only one of the books not told in a diary format, which I found to be an excellent touch, since I could never see Bella sitting down long enough to write a journal.Wanting to get away from her jealous stepmother, who is upset because her hairdresser thinks Bella is prettier, Bella crashes at the house of a band, the Magnificent Seven, with whom she sometimes sings. They get a gig in Paris, and Bella runs off with them for the summer, telling her father and stepmother that she's staying with a friend's aunt. She finds ecstasy on stage, and two very different kinds of love, but always there is a whiff of fear in the air. For Bella is constantly meeting strange women, women who remind her of her stepmother, who rave of her beauty and then give her gifts which always somehow result in Bella becoming ill. Then she returns to Egerton for the fall term, and she and her friends discuss their future plans, and Bella does a lot of soul-searching. And the band is getting ready to play one last big show--and this time her stepmother will be in the audience.Bella can be obnoxious, shallow, and callous, but I accept that, because making her &quot;sweetness and light&quot; wouldn't be true to the Bella we saw in the first two books. My only gripe is that Miss van der Leyden does not appear in this book. Dear Ms. Geras: Please write a book about everyone's favorite housemother. There must be a story there."},{"Title":"Pictures of the Night","review":"I just couldn't get into this book. Right from the start, it seemed like the author was trying to hide something from the reader and that annoyed me. Also, it contained too many long descriptions.

This book can save a mom on a snow day- as long as you don't mind what will be created!"},{"Title":"A Kids' Guide to Building Forts","review":"We got a copy of this book from the library. When it was time to return it my son begged for his own copy. Great book."},{"Title":"A Kids' Guide to Building Forts","review":"My review may seem a bit rambling & repetitive but its an early morning for me while the kids are still sleeping. Just take in consideration, I encourage you to GET THIS BOOK! SPEND TIME with your kid{s} utilizing it before they become older and you missed out on all the fun you could of had with them. making those memories that last a lifetime of smiles. Now grab your coffee/tea for why I personally find this book to be of a dying breed. Much love to the Author & publishers for sharing the Kids guide to building forts &lt;3 .Despite what a reviewer has wrote about \\"safety\\" no where in this book does it say to hand it over to the kid and leave them to do it ALONE. This book is perfect for the adult to SHADOW but in no way means for them to let the kid hit the local junkyard after receiving their Tet shot....Yes, it's true if you live in the city or some close together suburban neighborhood, the kids may have a hard time finding the common resources for building these things BUT there is NO reason why as a PARENT/ADULT you can not get involved in the hunt. Instead of finding a way to entertain your kid without you \\"having\\" to be involved, man/woman up and play with your kids!! This book is full of great inspiration & motivation for kids & their parents to spend time together. If the kid has never experienced this way of play then surely you know not to hand them the wheel without some supervision. If you do not have tree branches, pruning's around in your yard then ask around the neighborhood when you see trees being cut.Ask Grandma/pa or other relatives & friends. Ask a local tree cutting service if you can have branches from trees they are cutting nearby {instead of these things being put through their chipper machine}.The writer encourages resourcefulness, imagination, problem solving & common sense. Kids learn through playing and this book will do just that. From figuring out on their own what can be used {this is where you the parent/adult can take the time to look the book over with them & discuss what they would like to build from the authors pages} all the way to how the items they found will fit/work out with what they envision. There are no measurements, per say, it's all about collecting the items needed and putting it all together which is powered within their minds by problem solving. Great pictures and illustrations for guidance but this is not a blueprint style of book. This style of learning is one of the most lacked & must have skills our children NEED to learn. Many thanks needs to go to the author for putting this book out there for encouraging kids to use skills much needed in their adult lives. Resourceful problem solving. The adult can shadow, being their mind of reason with suggestions and encouragement but do not become so deeply involved the kids are not the main players. Build your own fort! :)Although I did not buy this book {yet! & surely will as a permanent piece of the kids home library}, I picked a copy up at the public library for some winter dreaming by the fire with my kids. My son & I looked it over, searching for which one he would like to build in the Spring with his sisters. We discussed where they might find such items for the fort designs he liked. He was won over by the stick/tree branch debri square fort, using a wattle weave for the walls. Kids learn that weave in school with paper projects so he knew by relating to the school project, how to wattle the walls. In this day & age where kids are rarely with the power of resourceful imagination due to the whole \\"sanitary & safety\\" hype, I was frustrated by lack of variety in books that do encourage & SPARK a kid to use their brains for resourceful problem solving with outdoor fun. This book provides that spark PLUS is a great way to get adults OUT OF THE HOUSE and playing with their kids. As a kid my brothers & I were left to roam the woods and neighborhood without supervision {it was the 80's!}, unlike children now who are locked behind fences & indoors with factory made electronic devices sapping up their childhood. Get over what the neighbors will think about you collecting & having tree branches laying around in the yard or collecting them.The bonus to their fort building is now what to put inside of it! A table made from a log? Planting some Mint or penny-royal around the edges to help keep bugs at bay? How about coming up with a club sign or sewing up a Fort flag?! This book can be the beginning to many great fun filled days. A domino effect, bubbling up the sparkle of imagination and happy times."},{"Title":"A Kids' Guide to Building Forts","review":"Nice concept but after reading it, these were all forts we built as kids. Granted it's been awhile, I'd rather check a book like this out from the library as it was mostly a memory trigger. I'll keep the book for our two boys (1&3) but they'll out imagine it by age 6 I'm guessing."},{"Title":"A Kids' Guide to Building Forts","review":"I bought this book thinking how cool it would be for an 8-year-old nephew. But I am blown away by the number of ways a kid could get hurt or even killed by following the advice in this book. After a very brief and largely useless &quot;safety first&quot; warning, the author goes on to suggest such things as snow forts that use car hoods and other heavy objects as the roof -- with snow packed on top, no less. If the kid isn't crushed or suffocated in his nifty new fort, he probably will die of lock-jaw from the cut he gets on the rusty edge of the car hood -- or from the old windows that the author suggests are the perfect thing for lean-to forts. Does this guy live next to a junk yard? There are several cool ideas in the book, but none that a kid probably couldn't come up with on his own -- especially if mom and dad say, &quot;Yeah, go ahead. Anything and everything you can find to drag into the backyard is ok with us.&quot; Several of the tee-pee/wigwam forts are just fine if a kid is in the woods with lots of deadfall. Otherwise, the environment is going to take a hit -- as are the $180 trees that the neighbors just planted last spring. Which is nothing compared to the hospital bill you'll have for the 19 stitches required to close up the gash from the suggested use of a scythe or weed cutter to &quot;gather handfuls of grass or hay no shorter than 15 inches.&quot; Send 'em over to my yard; my lawn needs mowing. Seriously, folks. This book should be recalled."},{"Title":"Painting Fabulous Floorcloths","review":"I found this book very informative.

I usually read these books in one or two days. I have been pleased with Xanth books from the beginning and have not missed a volume. The reason that this book only received three stars from me is the cover art. The story depicts Breanna as a very dark skinned young woman. The cover depicts her as a pale faced girl with dirty or hairy arms and legs. A little more consistancy between the artist and the illustrator would appropriate and appreciated.I am amazed to find that what seems like such a minor detail is so incremental in causing this book to lose two stars from my vote.Piers and publishers, you cannot present a wonderfully diverse setting if the marketing on the front tries to appeal to only one group, by making the black character look almost white."},{"Title":"ZOMBIE LOVER (XANTH)","review":"In the past twelve years, I've gone to being a rabid, enthusiastic and proselytizing Anthony fan to being... well... sorta lukewarm. (My first Xanth book -- and thus my favorite of the series for a long time, just for sheer exuberant silliness -- was &quot;Crewel Lye.&quot;) To compare the style and scope of &quot;Zombie Lover&quot; to, say, &quot;A Spell for Chameleon&quot; or other earlier books is just begging to be depressed. The series has gone from being always gripping, often moving and consistently hilarious to merely amusing. (I've been noticing a constant, half-hearted resurrection of older characters from the series' &quot;glory days,&quot; before Ivy's adolescence and before the Adult Conspiracy became such an annoyingly inescapable plot point.) And like many of today's mainstream authors, Anthony means well, but his interpretation of, for example, racial prejudice (in this book at least) is superficial and clueless. (I would be interested to guess the number of black women fans (yes they do exist) who, not having green eyes and straight, rump-length hair, might be more than a little hurt by his interpretation of black &quot;beauty.&quot; Black Barbie, indeed. No offense meant to the Halle Berrys of the world who actually look like that.)I was sad to realize that this will probably be my last Xanth book. Mild amusement has its place, but if you want a *real* taste of Anthony, let Xanth die a quiet death already and go directly to the &quot;Incarnations of Immortality&quot; series, or the first two &quot;Geodyssey&quot; books."},{"Title":"ZOMBIE LOVER (XANTH)","review":"I enjoyed this book, and even bought it instead of borrowing from the library. But for a faithful Xanth fan, it is a little disappointing. The earlier books were gems. The middle ones were fun. But lately the quality of the plot (not the writing) has gone down. There is still hope for Xanth, though; I read a few Tamora Pierce books like Wolf Speaker and The Woman Who Rides Like A Man which didn't live up to my expectations of her, then WHAM! she retaliates with Emperor Mage and Lioness Rampant. Don't despair, friends: Xanth is not lost forever! In the meantime, check out Tamora Pierce and Gath Nix."},{"Title":"ZOMBIE LOVER (XANTH)","review":"The Xanth series is what got me reading sci-fi and fantasy novels. Its a shame this series has turned into unreadable mush.Zombie Lover was the last book I've bought in this series and I don't think I'll continue with it. I can't take in anymore stories of adolescents thinking about who they want or don't want to have sex with."},{"Title":"ZOMBIE LOVER (XANTH)","review":"This book is alright but I feel that the author shouldconcentrate more on the plot and dispense with the puns... they'regetting irritating... I started reading xanth when I was 8 and was hooked instantly- I couldn't wait for the next book to come out! But now I think the books are getting worse and worse... frankly this is sort of a disappointment... I much prefer the earlier books."},{"Title":"ZOMBIE LOVER (XANTH)","review":"This is not a bad book, but it would have been better if the author would concentrate on story-telling and humor, including the inevitable puns. I am no prude. There is nothing wrong with sexual innuendo, or outright sex for that matter. I read plenty of books that have sex in them. That said, I think the whole Adult Conspiracy sub-plot is getting way out of proportion in recent Xanth books. No one reads Xanth books looking for titillation. Also, why the thinly veiled social relevance? Anthony is always complaining about the &quot;cri-tics&quot; and I begin to wonder if he is responding to them by force-feeding political correctness into the stories. There is plenty of fiction, even fantasy fiction, on the market that addresses serious issues. Xanth books are marketted as being light entertainment, so why not provide that? Despite all that, I enjoyed the book. I just would've enjoyed it a lot more without the coyness and PC attitude."},{"Title":"ZOMBIE LOVER (XANTH)","review":"Once again the master has done it, romance, comedy, (lots and lots of puns) a bit of danger, and anything a person could ever want in a good book. In a world shaped suspiciously like Florida, magic rules and pigs actually can fly; anything is possible. In this newest Xanth saga, Breanna, a not so-average mundane girl is given the adventure of her life with the promise of more to come. She is smart, sassy, beautiful, and willing to grasp the chance of a life-time. And our dear friend Jenny Elf is back, and just wait till you find out what happens to her. I stayed up all night reading this book and lost lots of potential beauty sleep. A pure delight to any Xanth fans, a must have for any collection. I have my copy, do you have yours?"},{"Title":"ZOMBIE LOVER (XANTH)","review":"I would actually give this book 3 1/2 stars--I liked it better than \\"Faun and Games,\\" which I gave 3 stars, but not enough to merit 4. The reappearance of characters from earlier in the series was a nice surprise, especially when one has been rejuvenated younger than his grandchild. It was a humorous touch, and the first half of this book seemed to recapture a part of the lightness that made the first several books such pleasant reads. I initially really liked Breanna's spirit and how she faced her prejudices, but her outspoken and militant pro-zombie tone was a turn off. The \\"zombies are people, too\\" message was handled much better, IMO, in \\"Dragon on a Pedestal,\\" when Irene comes to appreciate Zora Zombie.No Xanth novel would be complete without at least one region of bad puns, nor at least one beautiful woman using her assets to manipulate men. In this case, the victims are married and subjected to kisses and tantalizing contact with provocative portions of distaff flesh. The men even do some kissing themselves. Light sexuality has always been part of this series, but in some of these last several books, what used to come across as just fun seems to have taken a naughty turn. The married men resist temptation, to their credit, but the author seems to be toying a bit close to the borders of adultery. In spite of all this, the story was still enjoyable and a quick read.The ending hints at significant developments in the novels ahead, so it's on to the next one. . ."},{"Title":"ZOMBIE LOVER (XANTH)","review":"Book came in good condition.

Breeanne was a great and very original charecter and I think I'm in love with Justen Tree. Definately a must read."},{"Title":"ZOMBIE LOVER (XANTH)","review":"Xanth #22: Zombie Lover, by Piers AnthonyI think \\"Zombie Lover\\" was the first Xanth book I read, and it's a perfect book for getting into the series. Breanna, the main character, isn't a native of Xanth but instead migrated with the Black Wave; human migration into Xanth has always happened in waves of people. And so the readers see Xanth through Breanna's eyes, which is a great way to see it if you're new to the series.Not overfull of puns, as some of the later Xanth books are, \\"Zombie Lover\\" follows Breanna as she tries to escape marrying a zombie king. Anthony examines bigotry and racism through her attitude toward zombies, which mirrors the feelings some have toward Breanna herself as she is black.Parallel to Breanna's story are the stories of Jenny, and of the kings of Xanth, who accidently drank Lethe water, causing them to forget where home was. Jenny, an elf and another non-native of Xanth, is writing invitations and planning a massive wedding, but no one knows who the bride is.\\"Zombie Lover\\" is a solid installment in the series, and is better than some of the recent Xanth books published.3/5."},{"Title":"ZOMBIE LOVER (XANTH)","review":"This was the first Xanth novel I ever read, but it was easy enough to get into. I wasn't too confused by reference to other Xanth novels as they were minimal and were not much focused on. Some of the jokes were rather funny, and the plot had enough humorous twists in it (and a couple of cool surprises!) to keep me well-entertained. It was a rather enjoyable book, though I definitely like Incarnations of Immortality better. overall 3.5/5 stars."},{"Title":"ZOMBIE LOVER (XANTH)","review":"Xanth is so good that when something happens in another book that reminds you of a similar situation in Xanth, it's the best part of that book while it's just another part of a Xanth novel. The best part of a Xanth novel is...the whole book. I started reading Xanth in January, and now in December I am eagerly awaiting Xanth 23. They are light in terms of content and easy to read; you only have to read them once."},{"Title":"ZOMBIE LOVER (XANTH)","review":"Zombie Lover is one of the best of the recent Xanth novels. I really liked Faun and Games, so I enjoyed Ida's many moons. I also like that Bink, Dor, and Dolph were main characters."},{"Title":"ZOMBIE LOVER (XANTH)","review":"First of all, I am HUGE fan of Piers Anthony and Xanth. That said, I still liked this book better than the last few writings, because it's inventive and you an realate to the characters. Anthony goes back to a straight human main character, which is good, and I thought the idea of a black person in Xanth was a good idea. One of my favorite parts was how Anthony brings back Dolph, Dor, and Bink as major characters. Another good thing was Jenny Elf's romance. It's good to see her settle down. But my favorite part of the book had to be the Breanna's hatred of the Adult Conspiracy. The Conspiracy has been my least favorite part of the seires. Clio mentioned in the Epilog that something big was going to happen in the next book. Could it be the abolishing of the Conspiracy? Only time will tell."},{"Title":"ZOMBIE LOVER (XANTH)","review":"I've been a fan of Piers Anthony for a while. This knewest addition to the Xanth series will please and delight old and knew Xanth fans everywhere The book is about a young girl from the black wave who accidentially stirs up the zombies. With the help of some famous Xanthians. This is the story of how Breanna got into an adventurefilled with plenty of puns."},{"Title":"ZOMBIE LOVER (XANTH)","review":"What a disappointment this book was. I used to be such a huge Piers Anthony fan but, unfortunately, this book has changed that. Anyone picking up this book and expecting to find a fun, light-hearted, magical read (the like usually found in a Xanth book) will instead find a disturbing racist, sexist horror of a tale. The main character is almost raped a number of times (which is more or less dismissed by the author as par for the course), a pair of sisters try to seduce their great grandfather (and are only playfully chastised for it), black people are likened to zombies in the author's effort to show that he's morally enlightened, and a good portion of the book is devoted to illustrating that the only thing women are concerned with is tricking, sexing, and inevitably trapping a man into marriage, because a woman is next to useless without a man (and the only thing women are good for is sex). I've read every single book in the Xanth series up to Zombie Lover (and every book in the Incarnations of Immortality Series, also by Piers Anthony), and I really wish I could go back to when I hadn't read this book. This series used to be such a fun little world to escape into, but I found myself becoming disenchanted with the author. I hadn't realized he was such a perverted, bigoted, chauvinst. Now that I've seen what Piers Anthony's view of the world is really like, I don't think I'll be reading any more of his work. Which is a shame because, up to this point, he's been one of my favorite writers."},{"Title":"ZOMBIE LOVER (XANTH)","review":"I craved for a fantasy read and stumbled onto Piers Anthony (my first time reading him) and who could turn down a book titled Zombie Lover? Our 15-year-old, black wave hero Breanna takes the reader on a tour of Xanth (and other worlds) as she runs from a zombie king in a Snow White kissed awake tale gone wrong. Along the way she picks up many delightful characters and intrigue continues. I was a bit turned off as Anthony insists on explaining all of his puns to the reader and the end of the book was rather predictable (i.e. I mostly skimmed the last 40-pages or so). I was really turned off at the never ending smorgasbord of [...] and bottoms and poorly done sexual quips. In addition, half of my love for fantasy tends to be the cover art and I was hugely disappointed that Breanna was depicted as a slightly tan white girl rather than the black girl she's described as in the story. Additionally, Anthony's commentary on race seemed very superficial and uninformed. Overall it was a fun \\"bad\\" read but one I definitely had political problems with."},{"Title":"ZOMBIE LOVER (XANTH)","review":"Now look, I know Piers Anthony is a great author. I've read his Incarnation of Immortality series, all the Xanth books, the Mode books, and the Apprentice Adept series. But this, I have to say, is the best of the bunch. What do you get when you cross a young black Mundane with a magical talent, a 130 year old man who was transformed into a tree, three kings, and a mess of zombies? Believe it or not, one of the best surprises to come into Xanth in years, thanks to the devious plotting of Good Magician Humphrey, Clio the Muse, and everybody's favorite elf, Jenny of the World of Two Moons. For all of us raised on fairy tales, this one beats them all."},{"Title":"ZOMBIE LOVER (XANTH)","review":"I love Xanth...I read this book and found it as intriguing as the first one...&quot;A Spell For Chameleon&quot;..

In a textbook, the definitions would go on and on for pages. In a dictionary, there are often only one or two sentences. In this format, every term, person etc.. gets one page, which comes out to roughly 300 - 400 words each. In the definitions, there is often a definition a paragraph in length, then arguments for the concept and then criticisms that have been offered against the concept. Often, there is an illustration of the theory, which may be of assistance to people who are new to the subject. This is a useful ready reference book for someone wondering what some of the major ideas have been in the past 2500 years of Western philosophy.Some of the different concepts and persons covered are:EmpiricismEthicsKarl JaspersContinental PhilosophyArgument ad hominemAbsolutismMaterialismPhilosophy of EducationRationalismRene D&eacute;scartesJohn LockePantheismMeaningExistentialismNaturalismFree WillDeductionEgoismMetaphysicsObjectivismMy criticism of the book is that if occasionally explains a term via an analogy or scenario but then fails to provide a clear definition of the term itself. However, only a handful of the entries are like this.In ethics, I think I would affirm Absolutism and Objectivism which are defined as: Absolutism: &quot;This is the general philosophical view that there are fundamental truths about the world which are independent of the opinions of individual people or of different societies... Ethical absolutism is the view that there are moral principles which are true in all cultures and societies, and at all times in history, irrespective of whether human beings do in fact adhere to them.&quot; (page 2)Objectivism: &quot;This is the contention in ethics that there are certain moral principles which are true and which are quite independent of the beliefs of individual human beings.&quot; (page 69)Some of the other frankly illogical and dangerous ideas are emotive theory (&quot;... the view that moral judgments are fundamentally an articulation of feelings...&quot; page 32) or relativism (&quot;Relativism takes the view there are no fixed or absolute standards in relation to knowledge about the world, moral behaviour, social organization, or any other aspect of human life.&quot; page 84). Emotive theory is apparently a representative of the non-cognitivist school of ethics.The series, as far as I know, is British. Both this series (101 key ideas) and the other &quot;Teach Yourself,&quot; books are British. Their style is somewhat different from American or Canadian writing but as this is a ready-reference work, that is not really an issue.The end of the book is a one page long, \\"Further Reading,\\" section.Two excellent Christian books that cover some of these ideas and provide a Christian response are:The Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics by Norman GeislerRelativism: Feet Firmly Planted in Mid-Air by Francis J.

Best wishes for good health."},{"Title":"Adult Leukemia: A Comprehensive Guide for Patients and Families","review":"First, a note: I knew Barbara Lackritz AKA GrannyBarb. She was a tireless advocate for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. She spoke at numerous patient's meetings, presented to groups of doctors, and fielded many, many questions from caregivers and patients concerning this disease.The book GrannyBarb wrote is an excellent overview of CLL. It includes an overview of the disease, symptoms, potential treatments, possible side effects, and what to expect when the disease progresses. It is very well written and covers more than the basics one might pick up from the Web. This is one strength of the book: it distills all that is known about the disease and covers ground that is probably available on the Web, but can be very easily overlooked. GrannyBarb puts all of it together in an interesting and easy to read book.Since GrannyBarb is no longer with us, sadly, the book may not be updated. With the pace of research into this and other leukemias in high gear, there are now more treatments available, and in clinical trials, than when she wrote the book. On the other hand, pretty much all of the mainstream treatments that a patient is likely to run into are covered in the book.Highly recommended. If you are a patient, or a caregiver, there is no better book than this to give you the 'lay of the land'.BTW, to the reviewer who was disappointed because AML wasn't covered in this book, well, that's because the book isn't about AML! Geesh! I suppose I could complain that the book didn't cover model railroading, either, but it isn't a legitimate complaint, to my mind.If you have CLL, get this book.

He lives in the Northwest United States and has heard of the legends of Bigfoot. One night, he sees large tracks in the snow and thinks Bigfoot left them. On another night he sees a large furry creatures chased by dogs. No one believes him, thinking that he is just a boy whose imagination runs wild when he is alone.However, on a later night he sees a large furry animal outside the window. It is a bear that has an injured leg. While he is safe in the house, he knows that his mother will be coming home soon and the bear may attack her. Therefore, he decides to capture the bear in the garage. He opens the garage door and uses a trail of bacon to entice the bear into the garage. Once he gets it in there, he closes the door, trapping it inside. He then alerts his parents and a vet comes with a tranquilizer gun. The bear is subdued and taken some distance away before it is freed.This is an odd story in the sense that a fundamental element is that such a young boy is left alone late at night. Furthermore, the nearest house is some distance away, so he is truly alone.

I must say to the people who have self-esteem issues who are not overweight, or haven't had an eating disorder...even though you find it hard to find something that reaches out to you, there are some good books that deal strictly with self-esteem and confidence issues. You must look within yourself to find out what it truly is that upsets you about yourself...is it your body, or is it that you feel inadequate in another way? Perhaps when you do that, you will realize that you are not unhappy with your body, but rather with another aspect of your life/personality. For the women who have weight issues, feel unattractive--we have many issues facing us. We have been labeled for the majority of our lives, and our issues have always been hidden...trying to avoid attention and finally we have resources that can help us deal with the emotional damage our weight and self confidence issues have caused.I'm looking forward to reading this book.

This book gave me a way to explain some concepts simply that I didn't have the words for. To be able to do, but not be able to understand HOW has been the chasm around drawing101. This book is your bridge over that chasm. It is great to teach out of, but I doubt a child would want to pick up this book on his or her own, to learn out of that isn't talented to begin with. The feel of it seems more mature than that.For those who can draw well, this book was not made for you. It was made for beginners and those who look at drawing as something \\"talented\\" people do.

We called them our \\"goofy drawings\\" and the kids loved them the best of all. Yes, it's more of a booklet than a textbook, but it takes time to work through it....as a side resource it usually takes me a school year to get through it with my students.

It takes no special talent, and only a very tiny minority will be unable to acquire this skill.Conventional art education says that art is used solely to \\"express yourself,\\" without ever learning the basis of art - drawing. This is as silly (and frustrating, and ultimately, discouraging) as giving a child a violin and telling him to express himself through music. We can be taught the fundamentals of drawing just as we can be taught the fundamentals of music, and while most of us will never achieve mastery or beauty, we can at least achieve proficiency, and have a new, lifelong skill.

I found the heroine wonderfully engaging--intelligent,witty, warm and normal looking! And Tarquin--tall, dark, handsome and just enough aloof to be totally attractive to me. I loved the development of these two characters. Unlike the second Hong Kong reviewer, if you read carefully (and please don't skim this book!), you will find hints of Tarquin's enlightenment and recognition of his true feelings for Sybil sprinkled throughout the story.

Marble Reviewer, All About Romance"},{"Title":"Best Laid Schemes (Regency Romance)","review":"As complex and intriguing as a romance novel can be, Best Laid Schemes is my favorite regency to date. Not only are the episodes hilarious and the story touching, Emma Jensen has seemed to convey a sense of lighthearted suspense as we race to the end to see who's causing everything to go so wrong for Tarquin's party. She has also created a heartfelt believability through the development of the characters. We feel drawn to the intelligent, loving, self-sacrificing Sybil, the incurably romantic and hair-brained Lady Leverham, the fun loving Julian, and even the practical, responsible Tarquin. We are annoyed by the &quot;Three Graces&quot; and their parents. Overall, though, it was the side-splitting comedy that had me laughing hysterically the first time i read it that made me really love and enjoy it as well as giving Best Laid Schemes the title of my favorite Regency Novel of all time."},{"Title":"Best Laid Schemes (Regency Romance)","review":"Well develope charecters.

Life is good, but suddenly, he discovers that his mother has decided to invite Sibyl Cameron to his bride-choosing house party. Tarquin has always had a problem with Sibyl. Basically, everything she does or says ends up embarrassing him.But Sibyl is no longer a mischievous child in pigtails wreaking havoc in his life, she has grown into a beautiful woman whom he finds himself strangely attracted to. The story is wonderfully funny, the monkey alone will have you up in whoops, so make sure you read this book privately if you don't want people to eye you oddly!Emma Jensen is a wonderful writer and she draws her characters with wonderful accuracy and detail. This is one book you'll want to keep since you'll probably enjoy reading it again and again."},{"Title":"Best Laid Schemes (Regency Romance)","review":"I was delighted when I started to read this book and realised that it featured a minor character from 'His Grace Endures,' another Jensen book I enjoyed. Some other characters from that earlier book also appear here (eg Lady Leverham), and others are referred to.This is a very funny book, somewhat in contrast to 'His Grace Endures' which, while it had its amusing moments, was more heartwrenching. Jensen in this book reveals a light touch and a gift for putting her characters in ridiculous situations; her narrative also has some very amusing touches to it, particularly some of Tarquin's introspection.I think the second reviewer from Hong Kong missed the point of this book: it is *supposed* to be funny. Additionally, I'm puzzled as to how s/he can say that Tarquin wasn't attracted to Sibyl. It was obvious all along that he was more interested in her than he wanted to be, and there were plenty of subtle hints: the way he sought out her company in preference to the company of others at times; the way he started to notice the colour of her eyes; how well she looked in her blue dress; the scene when he sought refuge in her bedroom - there, his attraction to her was blindingly obvious, and I'm not sure how this reviewer missed it. And, of course, when she escorted him to his room when he was drunk - he may have been drunk, but he wasn't incapable! Not to mention the conversation through the locked door. After all that, I have no idea how anyone could say there was no attraction or chemistry.This book is quite a contrast to my other favourites, books by Oliver, Balogh and Kelly for example, but as a comedy-romance it is excellent."},{"Title":"Best Laid Schemes (Regency Romance)","review":"These characters are wonderful!

It also left me wanting to read more about some of the minor characters, and I'm betting at least one of them has their own book. : )"},{"Title":"Best Laid Schemes (Regency Romance)","review":"This is my first Emma Jensen book and I felt let down after reading it. The plot shows great promise but the contents lack substance and credibility. The hero, Tarquin Rome invited three beautiful ladies and their parents, to be his house guests at his Kent country estate. He had been pressured by his mother to marry and fill his nursery and he intended to choose a bride from among the three Incomparables. He was not in love with any of them and &quot;took pride in the fact that he had never succumbed to the awkward and messy business of falling in love&quot;.He was dismayed to learn that his mother had included in his house party Lady Leverham who was bringing her pet monkey and her niece Sibyl Cameron.As far as he could remember, Sibyl Cameron brought nothing but havoc in her wake and was responsible for the several injuries he suffered in the few times she stayed at Rome Castle. He did not care much for her or her aunt's company . The house party did not go as well as he had hoped and he committed some faux-pas such as scratching himself in front of the assembled guests because the monkey's fleas had got on him. There were other mishaps like his going swimming in the middle of the night and afterwards found his clothes missing and had to go home naked. The whole house was roused by a scream at the most inappropiate moment when he was getting up the stairs leading to his room ...etc. All these were too much like scenes from some slapstick comedy. What makes the story most unconvincing is that Tourquin had never felt attracted to Sibyl and there was no chemistry whatsoever between them .She had never inspired any romantic notion in him throughout the greater part of the story although she was in love with him. Therefore the sudden twist at the end is both contrived, hypociritical, incredible and unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Mediating Dangerously: The Frontiers of Conflict Resolution","review":"This is a passionate, in-your-face plea for exploring the difficult process of transformational mediation, truly digging into the roots, the skin, the pores of people's, group's and organization's conflicts (although Cloke denies being a wholehearted transformational mediation believer).Cloke is the highly respected author of numerous books on conflict resolution and the director of the Center for Dispute Resolution in Santa Monica, Calif. He has a very fine sense of the nature of conflict, in all its rough-and-tumble, down-and-dirty depth and breadth. Cloke deftly and deeply explores the psychological, emotional and spiritual nature of conflict within each of us - an important facet of mediation.But sometimes, in his very exploration of these matters, he overreaches in his hopes of what mediation can accomplish. Certainly, in the confines of community mediation, even generally with only few participants involved, there is just so much of transformational mediation, of this deep personal examination that one can accomplish in basically a two-hour time period, the general length of most community mediations, at least in most of the United States, I believe.I find Cloke veering toward encouraging counseling and psychotherapy as part of meditation. Mediators are rarely trained in these and other similar fields and should tread lightly when going beyond their skill level and the parameters of mediation itself. In other forms of more in-depth and complex mediation, these possibilities might be explored, but in community mediation, it hardly seems likely or even possible.Cloke does come up with some astute observations. He says to not be afraid of conflict, which obviously can become tense and heated. This is very important, especially in Minnesota (where I've been a community mediator for 19 years), where people are frequently afraid of confrontation, of raising of the voice, where, from my understanding, the introductory comments of Minneapolis Mediation Program mediators are suppose to include saying basically that the participants should not raise their voice and not get confrontational, something I have never been comfortable saying, and something I as a mediator rarely do indeed mention.He gives an outstanding list of questions mediators can use in exploring conflicts (pages 37-38), citing a specific case of bullying. Mediation absolutely benefits from deep and clear thinking, and this series of questions is an excellent example of how a mediator can explore participants' conflicts in a very thoughtful and crucial way. This is a very valuable exploration.Cloke does a very good job of telling and showing how to become a better, more insightful mediator, a more self-examined mediator and person.Sometimes, however, Cloke can have his head in the clouds in his hopes and dreams of what mediation can be. On page 47 he mentions \\"...moving conflicts beyond settlement and resolution, beyond resolution to personal and organizational transformation, and beyond transformation to transcendence\\" (page 47). Whew! Made me feel like I was at an EST seminar and what exactly was he smoking? But better to have a grand vision and greater reach than to have a small and puny mind. No one could accuse Ken Cloke of that.He spends pages trying to define \\"spirit\\" and gets nowhere. He is just too New Agey in this and some other regards.Still, there is much valuable and thought-provoking material in this first half of the book, entitled \\"The Inner Frontiers.\\"The book's second half, \\"The Outer Frontiers,\\" is less successful, discussing the larger issues of overcoming fascism and racism, building community, the limits of law, transforming institutional systems, etc. His plea for an issues-based thought process is delightful, and when we can convince dictators and warring tribes about this the world will be a better place. But hey, put out the ideas. Dream. Here some readers will find Cloke a visionary, others a dreamer. I lean toward the latter but admire his reach. I feel Cloke has little here that can be of use to a mediator. But if schools, businesses, government bodies and so on can use this kind of thinking and make some inroads on change and growth, wonderful.He does make a bold plea for the value of mediating domestic abuse, something mediation, in my opinion, correctly has avoided. With all his arguments, he fails to make the most important one: the imbalance of power between the parties. An obvious omission.\\"Mediating Dangerously\\" can be of significant benefit to both the beginner and experienced mediator, although the complexities Cloke often delves into are much more likely to be of value to an experienced mediator who can more relate to these situations from the very fact of having gone through them. Still, they can be a valuable learning experience for the new mediator.In spite of some flaws, \\"Mediating Dangerously\\" is a valuable resource."},{"Title":"Mediating Dangerously: The Frontiers of Conflict Resolution","review":"This book connects conflict mediation with spiritual growth.

It is as informative for the novice as it is challenging for the expert. If you have even the slightest interest in the demise of a world superpower and the twentieth century's most influential - and murderous - ideology, you simply must read this book."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"Despite the book's Pulitzer Prize, I'm a little ambivalent about saying this in one of the best books I have read. For sure, some of the best parts are that Remnick seemingly has open access to all the major Soviet political players while he was there. And he doesn't even brag about it. The titans of Soviet politics seem to be open to all who want to speak with them, though Remnick's day job as the Moscow correspondent for the Washington Post certainly helped...a large part of his life in Russia then that he totally did not to write about.It's fun to follow him track down figures and weasel his way to get access to whoever he wants to talk with. He clearly is excited to be there during the transition and is personally invested in the story, as he speaks Russian and both his parents and his parents-in-laws have Russian ancestry. On the other hand, the book is a rag tag, contemporaneous collection of personal reporting and interests, lacking to some degree the broad overview that only comes with the passage of time.Doubtlessly, you get the feeling of what it was like living in the Soviet Union during the Gorbachev years and the transition to Yeltsin and the end of the Communist Party....with the addition of having Remnick magically inserting himself in front of whoever he wants to talk with to fill you in on the inside story.Enjoy it."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"A useful history of the last days of Soviet rule and the early days of democracy in Russia, told through the stories of several, mostly prominent individuals.

Communism was doomed from the start. Here, Remnick explains exactly why. The Russian people are wonderful, I've met many of them.

He amazes the reader with one heartbreaking vignette after another. It seems amazing that, though while only spending a few years in Russia, he seemingly met everybody who was anybody and traveled to the remotest parts of the dying empire.Remnick does not try hard, unfortunately, to maintain objectivity. He deifies much of the intellectual dissident movement, even repeatedly callling Andrei Sakharov a &quot;saint.&quot; Remnick turns Gorbachev into nothing more than a well-meaning Pandora, responsible for and unable to control the breakup of the Soviet Union.Remnick does show what I believe to be responsible for the breakup of the USSR- namely the rot, corruption and inefficiency endemic in the Soviet system- but he seemingly relegates it to symptomatic and not primary status. The empire would have inevitably broken up with or without Perestroika and Glasnost. The book should rank, despite its flaws, among the best books of contemporary history ever written-doing for Russia what Democracy in America did for the US."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"&quot;Lenin's Tomb&quot; is the best and most complete account available of the remarkable transformation of Soviet Russia.

I've read it 5 times and I will read it again"},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"Remnick masterfully kills the Republican/Conservative myth that Ronald Reagan, &quot;a triumph of the embalmer's art&quot; in Gore Vidal's words, led the demise of the Soviet communist empire through buying ever too many useless weapons. By showing the implosion of a very cruel, very corrupt, poorly managed state, there can no longer be doubt about the reason for the demise of Lenin's dream. It's interesting to note that since capitalistic democracy has been introduced in Russia, living standards have actually dropped (in large part because of corruption and cronyism). I definitely want to read Remnick's follow-up, Resurrection, to learn more about this."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"David Remnick reported on site for the WASHINGTON POST during the Soviet Union's last days. He interviewed many persons, from society's bottom to society's top, from homeless derelict to Mikhail Gorbachev. That and his readable prose help explain how he won the Pulitzer. Of course it also helped that he was against totalitarianism and for humanity.When I read history I prefer a firm grip on the date. Overall, this story does flow in chronological order from 1988 to 1992, or to 1994 if you get the most recent edition with its afterword. But the story jumps backward occasionally when Remnick tells the history of a character, and at other moments I was vague on the date. I think chapters should have been subheaded with dates, and more spots within chapters should have stated the date.Nevertheless, do not let my preceding quibble deter you. I think this book is already something of a classic, and I'll be darned if I'm going to give it anything less than five stars. Does another book do as well as what this book does, which is put you into the scene of the collapse of the vast Soviet empire?I would have advised Mr. Remnick to include a double-paged map of the U.S.S.R. and a glossary of names, events, and institutions. We do get source notes, bibliography, index, a list of interviews, and twenty-two pages of relevant photos.The Vintage trade-paperback edition is over five hundred pages in small font. So be ready for something to settle back with. It will be worth a portion of the limited time you have in life. The story and the people are phenomenal, and they will expand your existential horizon."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"A stupendous chronicling of history in the making! We are presented with several differing viewpoints on the collapse of the Soviet regime and its splintering, in these truly tumultuous years. As the author points out, whereas other empires, like England, took decades to recede and change - this took place within a few years. Within days sometimes, overwhelming transitions took place.The efficacy of this book is the internal focus on the people in the country itself; there is none of this hyperbole on how Ronald Reagan solely dismantled the evil empire! The book is about the Soviet Union - there is little on the break-away of the Eastern Bloc countries like Poland or East Germany. Mr. Remnick presents us with a wide array of people across this vast land - from various dissidents to various neo-Stalinists. We experience their anguish as the grim and brutal history of their country becomes revealed as once secret archives are exposed.This book is well-written, engaging and sprinkled with some wry humour. If you are interested in this epoch it is a truly marvellous and first-hand account."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"Both Remnick's on Russia provide deep and useful insights on the political life of this country. A must-read for people interested in Russia's recent history."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"This book is one of those books that captured your attention from the beginning to the end. What differentiates this book from other books about Russia is the author's ability to convey to us the mood, the essence of a country that was in the brink of collapse &amp; to be revived as a brand new country. It is also one of those books that is difficult to be summarised in a few words but rather, it has to be read to be appreciated. This work depicts Russia as a country with turbulent &amp; troubled histories, occupied by citizens, some who were proud of its past glories (particularly its victory over the Facism in the war with Germany during World War 2, its Great Empire's status and a superforce to be reckoned with in the past) &amp; would shed their bloods for the glory of their nation, some who opted for the stability of the past when Communism seemed to promise that everybody is going to be looked after, some who are anxious to be caught on with the rest of the world. For an ex-Communist country that tried to catch up with the West, shamelessly influenced by capitalism for as long as we can remember, it has to overcome its steep learning curve. Growing pains such as emergence of mafias instead of enterpreneurs surfaced, corruptions, civil wars, &amp; so forth. A few chapters in the book are highly interesting such as the rise &amp; fall of Gorbachev (clearing the myths about him, &amp; conveying him as what a politician should be), the emergence of Yeltsin &amp; despite their differences, both of them deservedly win their places in history. Moreover, there are also chapters about common people who are living in God forsaken places with no basic necessities such as clean air, indoor plumbing, heating system that actually works, intellectuals who wanted to bring out the correct version of Russia's history so that they could learn from the past &amp; evolve from there to better beings but alas, it wasn't meant to be, writers like Sakharov, Solzhenitsyn who dared to write of the truths for the love of their nation with total disregard of their own safety, people who were killed in the millions during Stalin's reign &amp; Stalin as a person, Khruschev, Brezhnev, coup-de-etat that was supposed to clean up the mess that Gorbachev had created but subsequently, it was deemed as a farce in its own right, &amp; so forth. A substantial book that enlightens me about the plight of Russia &amp; a book that is definitely worth reading in this lifetime. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"David Remnick's \\"Lenin's Tomb\\" is a book about the journalist's experiences just before and during the collapse of the USSR at the end of the 1980s. Using a chronological overview, Remnick describes what the Soviet Union was like under the reign of Gorbachov (or \\"Gorbachev\\" in US spelling) and his views on the various leaders, journalists, KGB officers, bureaucrats, dissidents and so on.Because Remnick goes almost entirely by interviews for his information, the book gives a very thorough biographical view of the times, but there is very little information on the general state of the country, economic and social causes for the collapse, and so on. Remnick's tone and style are very much like those of a tabloid investigative journalist, describing people and events mostly by way of the author's opinions and what the people he interviews look and act like. This has the benefit of giving one the impression of re-living the interactions with the famous of those years, but is far too shallow for any explanatory purpose.Additionally, Remnick has too obvious favorites among the people involved. Gorbachov is generally shown more negatively than often in the West, but that fits the overall negative appraisal given to him in Russia. But people like Yeltsin and Solzhenitsyn are praised endlessly and can practically do no wrong, even though there are serious issues with both. Sakharov in particular is elevated literally to the level of a modern saint by Remnick: he is never mentioned without describing his \\"saintliness\\", \\"superior morality\\", and so on. Now in many of the cases Remnick's qualifications of his interviewees seem deserved, but it does get annoying after a while. Better to let readers decide whom they like than to pre-ordain all this.Overall, the book is mostly useful as a collection of interviews of important people at the end of the 1980s, and as such it is very balanced in the kind of people interviewed. It fails entirely as anything more though, and should not be used as a serious explanatory book on the hows and whys of the USSR's collapse. And that is somewhat disappointing."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"Book is over 600 pages and the print is so small it was difficult for me to try to read so I returned it. Perhaps if it ever comes out on Kindle I would try again."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"this book should be a text book for those studying soviet history. the author assumes that the reader is very well informed--certainly better informed that i am. he drops names that are mostly meaningless and impossible to put into context! his vocabulary is beyond the college level. do you know the word &quot;ramify&quot;? i didn't.but the positive side is that remnick has done remarkable research. he has put himself into situations that have put him at risk. his descriptions are graphic and frightening. he is courageous.i read the first half, but couldn't continue. it is part of my too hard file."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"The book is a compilation of short stories (each chapter a dozen pages or so) about the author's first-hand experiences in the Gorbachev's Soviet Union. From Baltic to Sakhalin and from coal miners to Gorbachev himself, from Stalin to Yeltsin and from Solzhenitsyn to Sakharov, the book paints the picture of the monolith's fall. This colorful collage describing the critical period in Russian history, combined with keen commentary, creates for the reader the distinct flavor of the time.For Russia, it was the age of confusion and disillusionment. Gorbachev's half-hearted reforms (the interest in truth ended where the Party interests were concerned, the pursuit of democracy gave way to the pursuit of the runaway republics etc.) were matched by the half-hearted '91 coup (no real plan, no propaganda with the military, Lenin wouldn't have approved).For generations, Russian people did not know much of the sad history of their country and less still about the life in the West. The blissful ignorance was one thing that helped them in their miserable existence. Their various degrees of belief in the grand ideals were the other. With glasnost, Gorbachev aimed at opening the gates of truth while preserving the faith. In all honesty, it was impossible: the foundation for the faith was thoroughly rotten and relaxing the state control of mass media could only reveal it. All of a sudden, millions of people had to face hard evidence showing that the glorious history of their country never was. That the Bolshevik revolution was but a ruthless coup followed by a bloody terror. That many national heroes, all the way to Lenin, were privilege- and power-hungry maniacs. The Russian people had to go (and are still going) through an incredible adjustment of their understanding of right and wrong, brought about by a mere possibility of truth in the phrase of Molotov (himself not the most impeccable politician): &quot;Compared to Lenin Stalin was a mere lamb&quot;. Similarly, it was a hard realization for many a soviet man that in the late 80's &quot;an average Soviet had to work 10 times longer than the average American to buy a pound of meat&quot;. The full awareness of their tragic history and miserable reality must make it so much more difficult for Russian people to live in the country which is overwhelmingly corrupt, lawless and poor.Remnick's parents and in-laws, all four having escaped from the old empire, could not imagine going back even for a visit, apparently having no faith in the Russian democratic changeover. On the other side of the ocean, the Russian military colonel excavating the Katyn massacre site, by disobeying direct orders from a KGB general to stop the work, believed in the prevalence of positive change in Russia. Today's Russia, with its authoritarian government and shady political and legal process, still leaves its democratic future a matter of faith.By way of some criticism, Gorbachev brought about an incredible change. His glasnost and personal presence revived the anemic (or galvanized the non-existent) political forces unheard of in a largely Brezhnev-era Russia. He fought many of the first battles alone. The book does not make a case for that. Glasnost provided food for the hungry Soviet mind, but perestroika, restructuring, was supposed to change the way Soviet people live. The book could have benefited from taking on perestroika in some detail.Overall, very enjoyable and engaging."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"Remnick's prose makes this history/political science book both readable and entertaining. Arguing that the country's downfall was due to the Soviet leaderships' ongoing assault against its country's collective historical memory and it's feeble attempts to give the country just enough perestroika and glastnost to keep it at bay are chronicled in a series of chapters or themes. Ironically, the limited attempts by Gorbachev to instill some democratic themes was just enough to whet the populace's appetite for more and set the country on a road it could not turn back from. Interestingly, Remnick argues that Gorbachev was at heart, a true communist who only wanted to make adjustments, not change the whole system. One gleans from this whole book that in a modern world, democratization of the body politic is inevitable, once its processes are set in motion. Though the author focuses very little on outside influences contributing to the USS's demise, i.e. the cold war or &quot;evil empire&quot; policies of the U.S. he has written the most compelling account of the country's downfall as orchestrated from within its borders and i nthe process graphically illustrated the moral degradation and vacousness of communisim, its practitioners, and the suffering endured by its people. The Soviet Union was essentially a Third World Country with a first world military, over 80% of the population lived in squalor equal to most thirld world citizens. A stupendous book!"},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"Remnick's frank, insightful analysis of the Soviet Union's final days filled me with inspiration and sadness. I'm inspired by the inhuman perseverance of the Russian and Soviet bloc people and saddened by the intense and lethal persecution of millions at the hands of their so-called leaders. Remnick shows a society led by decades of fear - citizens who feared persecution and leaders who feared the loss of power. The author flows easily from dissecting the Communist party and power brokers of Soviet society to eating cabbage with Siberian miners who don't expect to live past 35 to intense discussions with the Russian intelligentsia who fought the system quietly and desperately. It is a long book and at times I found myself needing a Russian history reference guide. But Remnick is not writing a history filled with facts and statistics. It is all about the people. Lenin's Tomb should be read by any journalist who feels the urge to go beyond 8 graphs. Truly wonderful."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"It's hard to imagine there was any dissention from the Pulitzer committee over \\"Lenin's Tomb\\". This book excellently combines top-notch journalism and fine, precise, descriptive writing for an increbidly enjoyable and informative read. Considering how most such \\"good for you\\" books are long slogs about as exciting as bran, \\"Lenin's Tomb\\" was a surprising pleasure.I came to this book with minimal knowledge of Russia in general, let alone the Soviet transition, and disliking what I had encountered of Russia's culture and people. \\"Lenin's Tomb\\" manages to explain the basics to ignorant laypeople like myself without condescending or dragging through too much history. What you need to understand what was happening, Remnick provides, no more and no less.\\"Lenin's Tomb\\" proved an eye opener about the Soviet experience, but it also reflects on the larger ramifications of Communist autocracy. So many of the explorations of the Soviet erosion of society and culture gave me a sense of Deja Vu compared with China, only China has perhaps been less scathed by the shorter span of its bureaucratic red terror. Also, while \\"Lenin's Tomb\\" did not make me like Russia or Russians any more, it did present the context of how and why people can be a certain way, so that I now hold it against them less.\\"Lenin's Tomb\\" is almost novelesque in its readability, a page-turner and easily beach or plane fare. I doff my hat to Remnick's ability to carve dense political stuff into an involving, compelling narrative. Perhaps Russia scholars would find points to criticize, but from a journalistic perspective, \\"Lenin's Tomb\\" is the book all of us wish we could write."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"Mr. Remnick has given us a masterwork. He seamlessly meshes intimate portraits of Soviet citizens within the larger landscape of the last days of the Soviet Empire. He has a rare ability to blend the micro and the macro in a soul-stirring narrative. This is a profound work that is filled with compelling stories. Lenin's Tomb is so superb that even those who avoid \\"history books\\" will relish it. Could not more highly recommend this book. The scads of glowing reviews below are all well deserved."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"David Remnick in \\"Lenin's Tomb\\" writes a fascinating book on the demise of the Soviet Union. Remnick manages to convey the views of the liberals who want to democratize the country and the neo-Stalinist conservatives who want to turn the clock back to the repression of life under Stalin.The author has little sympathy for Mikhail Gorbachev who once he launched \\"perestroika\\" could not make the final commitment to democracy and republicanism and remained trapped in the dying and corrupt Communist Party. Yet, Gorbachev's half-hearted attempts at reform nearly ended in a disasterous rigt-wing coup. Only, the incompetence of the plotters and will of the people not to turn back to a corrupt failed system prevented the USSR in falling back into despotism.Because of \\"glasnost and perestroika\\" Remnick was able to obtain candid views from everyone he interviewed during his stay in the Soviet Union. Miners, dissident and even communist party apparatchiks spoke freely about the good and bad of Russia. Nearly, 50 years after his death, Stalin's shadow still hovered over everything and everyone in the nation. Liberals such as Andrei Sakharov wanted the government and the party to fully acknowledge the heinous attrocities of mass murder and imprisonments committed during Stalin's reign, Khrukhschev made a tentative start at 20th party congress in denouncing Stalin but failed to follow through with real reform. During the Brezhnev years the country lurched backwards thast by the time Gorbachev came to power the Soviet Union was totally morally, politically and economically bankrupt.Remnick also does a fine job showing the first hesitant steps toward capitalism yet evenn today 10 years after the Soviet Union collapsed Russia still refuses to make the fundamental changes to bring a market economy fully to fruition. Under the Communists there was \\"equity in poverty\\" today in Russia you see the extremes of rich and poor. This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in the demise of the Soviet Union, but it needs an update to encompass the last decade."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"In the Pulizer-Prize winner Lenin's Tomb, David Remnick offers the reader a trip through history that is at once frightening and enthralling. Beginning with the horrors orchestrated by Lenin and continuing through the rise of Yeltsin to power, Remnick intertwines political and social history with first-hand accounts which he gathered during his time in Russia during the 80s. The result is a work of unparalleled genius, taking hard facts and presenting them in a personal way that makes the reader feel as if he is actually experiencing them. The end result is a chilling dose of reality for those who have idealistic notions of the world in which we live. I highly recommend this work in which Remnick portrays the brutal realities of socialist life as well as the inevitable downfall of such a system."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"Now that we are a decade removed from the fall of the Soviet Empire, it is a wonderful to look back and read a fabulous primary source about the events. Remnick, the Moscow correspondant for The Washington Post, during the late 80's and early 90's (and since the editor of the New Yorker, which was a well deserved honor for a fabulous journalist, if I may say so myself) was right on the scene when the incredible collapse of Communism took place. He interviewed hundreds, if not thousands, of people who had lived through the Soviet regime and who played some role, regarldless of how small and seemingly insignificant, in the transformation of the nation, and this research paid huge dividends. He combines all these personal stories into one great book that explains and analyzes why and how this happened. It is very well written, and while being comprehensive remains comprehensible. It is a wonderful book and anyone who is interested in Russia (or would like to become so), likes history in general, or enjoys good semi-academic writing this book is for you."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"After seventy-four years, the Soviet Union, a decrepit gerontocrat like its former pilots, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko, shuffled off its mortal coil. Journalist David Remnick, who spent four years in Moscow, compiled a series of thematic events into Lenin's Tomb, and explained how glasnost, initiated in small doses by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, became GLASNOST that proved too potent for the dilapidated Soviet state, and in the end, the Marxist-Leninist foundation on which the State had been build. An overdose of GLASNOST gave the Soviet Union a fatal political cardiac arrest.However, in his indicting assessment, he notes how the Party and the Soviet Union, like Lenin's mummified husk, was politically, spiritually, and economically bankrupt. \\"The Soviet Union was an old tyrant slouched in the corner with cataracts and gallstones, his muscles gone slack. He wore plastic shoes and a shiny suit that stank of sweat. He hogged all the food and fouled his pants. Mornings, his tongue was coated with the ash-taste of age. ... The state was senile but still dangerous enough.\\" Nice analogy, huh?Remnick further identifies the cause of that decay with the Party and its failure to keep the promises of socialism to the ordinary Soviets: \\"The men of the Communist Party, the leaders of the KGB and the military and the millions of provincial functionaries who had grown up on a falsified history, could not bear the truth. Not because they didn't believe it. They knew the facts of the past better than anyone else. But the truth challenged their existence, their comfort and privileges. Their right to a decent office, a cut of meat, the month of vacation in the Crimea--it all depended on a colossal social deception, on the forced ignorance of 280 million people. ... When history was no longer and instrument of the Party, the Party was doomed to failure. For history proved precisely that: that the Party was rotten to the core.\\" And once ordinary Soviets realized they had been lied to, that the socialist utopia was a pipe dream, they wanted the riches and luxuries that only a capitalist system could provide. In short, the Party was over.Gorbachev was willing to give the Soviet people an inch, i.e. glasnost. As the caretaker of History, he was willing to demonize Stalin but not Lenin. Denouncing Lenin would mean denouncing Marx and Communism, and flat out telling the Soviet people that they had lived a lie for seventy-four years. Instead, the Soviet people took their miles, GLASNOST, and ran with it to many finish line; for the Russians, it would be the demonstration in front of the parliament building on 20-21 August 1991.Glasnost had thus led to GLASNOST. The influx of information and culture from the West, formerly forbidden books, had led to the ghosts of the past rising up again, be they formerly independent republics absorbed by Russia, or institutions that had been partially banned, such as the church.Glasnost also revealed the failings of the system, and this was most painfully apparent with the Chernobyl tragedy 26 April 1986. Chernobyl was the epitomy of many things. One, it symbolized \\"every curse of the Soviet system, the decay and arrogance, the willful ignorance and self-deception.\\" Two, \\"Chernobyl was not like the Communist system. They were one in the same. ... The system ate into our bones the same way the radiation did, and the powers that be--or the powers that were--did everything they could to cover it all up, to wish it all away\\"According to Remnick, Gorbachev introduced glasnost and perestroika as a bandage, albeit a piffling one, to the Soviet Union, and he should be credited for that courageous act in face of the opposition he faced. However, he was outshadowed by Andrei Sakharov and Boris Yeltsin, who advocated what the people really wanted, GLASNOST and PERESTROIKA, i.e. open heart surgery. They and the Soviet peoples took GLASNOST to its logical conclusion, chucking the Soviet Union's bones into the dustbins of History.This is a well-detailed critical book that explores the whys and hows of the Soviet Union's collapse, and more interesting for those like me who witnessed the Gorbachev era."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"Lenin's Tomb is an autopsy of sorts, performed by one present during the last death throes of the Soviet Union. There are ultimate causes of death (a non-functioning economy), as well as underlying factors (a history of repression, totalitarian rule) contributing to this body politic's demise.Imagine a coal mine with no elevator in the shafts so the miners have to walk 2 hours to get to their place in the mine where they can start working. The kicker: they don't get paid for travelling to and from their place in the mine. Imagine Soviet prisoners of war released after WW2, only to have Stalin send them to labor camps because he was afraid they had lived too long under foreign influence.There are stories of people who were part of the system yet tried as much as they could to follow their conscience so they could somehow bridge the chasm cleaving their souls in two. Remnick describes hardliners, people who genuinely long for the days of Stalin, and with a compassionate eye, tries to describe the world they have lived through and now find themselves orphans of sorts in the new order.I was amazed that so many lived and died so miserably for so long.

I wanted to buy a noteworthy book that was definitive re: old USSR. I looked to award winning books on the subject and then, as always, checked with Amazonian's ratings. Before I started the book I assumed I would read some, scan some and re-educate myself on the subject. It was GREAT READING. A book that describes despair, fear and degradation of an entire nation of people. One asks onself, again and again throughout history, what conditions of the mind must exist that have throughout time enabled those in power to justify the destruction of the human spirit. Of course that begs the question as to how those STAY in power for decades on end. Author Remnick writes wonderfully and easily of tough experiences and yet they are not so horrific when laid on the page by this author, rather this book does read like a novel and thus it is easlily digested and hard to stop reading.

This book is a terrific read."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"The ironically titled Lenin's Tomb is a stunning piece of reportage about the circumstances leading up to the destruction of the Soviet Union. It was written by a reporter who was in the middle of the crisis as it reached its apex, and has a lived-in immediacy to it that sets it apart from other researched works on the topic. It succeeds on numerous levels, as journalism, as accessible history lesson, as a devastating portrait of a massive and failing country, as a treatise on 1980's European politics, and as an honest character study on the big names in Soviet government, their desires and intentions, and how those were never humanely transposed to the public which led to massive protest and a stunning moment in world history. Remnick tells the story circuitously, devoting whole chapters to different injustices or portraits of Communism's failures throughout the country, be it in starvation in a collectivized farm, corruption with the KGB in Lubyanka, or miserable working conditions in a coal mine in the Urals. These pieces of governmental incompetence grow and grow, culminating in murder, Chernobyl, apathy mixed with anger, and a renunciation of perestroika and Gorbachev within the Politburo. It is an incredibly complex story beautifully told by a brilliant reporter who knows the topic inside and out. Attention to detail is great here as well; Moscow, a far away city going through unbelievable upheaval, comes alive here. My only complaint is that the book got a little dry in the end, but for what you learn up to that point it is highly recommended for anyone interested in the subject."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"David Remnick has given us two things: a chilling historical account of the tremendous fall of the Soviet Union, and the loss of hope of its terrorized people, ...and a beautifully written detective story, a very personal touch that reflects a deep understanding of humanity; an authenticity only available through hundreds of interviews. It's meeting history face to face with all its cruelty and abuse jump out at you ever so subtly. It is almost reminiscent of that simplicity that was once bestowed to us through Tolstoy's humble genius. It is a story unlike any other, taking place all over the Soviet Empire. And best of all, Remnick has given the reader a chance to ride in the shoes of the actual Soviet people, ...indeed recreating history yet so much more. The condition that these people lived in is comparable to the Nazi Holocaust. The periodic discovery of mass murder sites keeps contributing to this effect. The Shoah makes an effort &quot;to never forget,&quot; and yet in the Soviet years, many more innocent people were killed and tortured than Hitler's Armada ever would during the Nazi era. In this way, Mr. Remnick has also made an effort to capture his experience and knowledge for all to not only vividly read through, but to live through as well. I sincerely applaud Mr. Remnick. He has created something that should stand the test of time...by way of engraving it in our minds. You will never look at history the same way again."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"Remnick's book is easily the most graphic and accurate account in English of the Gorbachev years between 1985 and 1991. It is unlikely to be surpassed. I judge his accuracy from his account of the August 1991 putsch, which is excellent given the information that was available. As the renegade agent that triggered the June 'constitutional coup', KGB Chief Kryuchkov's August 6th decision to draft coup documents AND the August 14th decision to again start drafting the documents, I have referred to Remnick in my research on the coup and the events that lead up to it. Suffice it to say that Kryuchkov's final decision on August 14th was triggered by the Bulgarian President, who fired the two KGB appointees at the head of his intelligence service, at my instigation. I had disclosed to him some intelligence secrets that compromised both the KGB and the British MI6, and proved that his intelligence chiefs were communist puppets, which was hardly surprising since Presidents Bush and Gorbachev had agreed to leave Bulgaria in the Soviet sphere of interest at Malta in June 1989. Like a lot of people in Bulgaria, I disagreed with that decision. One of the best ways of judging the accuracy of a book like Remnick's is to see how the information given in the book dovetails with the secret stuff, and his book does so nicely."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"A great fresco of the dramatic death of the communist URSS. The author lived as a correspondant in moscow for many years during the final years of the cold war and describes the tragic living conditions of the common people, the corrupt style of living of the burocrats, the disgusting privileges of the elites. An enclosed empire founded on corruption, lies, violence and misery where the dream of a better life for the masses promised by the communist leaders in the decades only became a rotten shell of deception and misery. The author interviewed hundreds of people of any social class, from the miners in the urals to Mr. Gorbachev, from Yeltsin to the moscow houseviwes, including scientists, artists, poets, smart people confined to the edges of the empire because of their open mindedness and acumen. This book is another important tragic witness of a wrecked dream, a tale told by hundreds of different voices that all tell thesame story of treachery and indecency, corruption and stupidity. A great history book that I highly recommend and that clearly helps us to understand why now Urss is governed like an authocracy by an ex kgb officer. Great book."},{"Title":"Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire","review":"This book is a fascinating exploration of the last days of the Soviet Union, providing a background of the broad mix of events and people involved both before, during and after the Gorbachev era.

Also read Ronald Reagan's autobiography \\"An American Life.\\" Reagan himself debunks the false claim that he destroyed the USSR. In fact, he and Gorbachev became friends and peacefully ended the cold war a few years before Gorbachev fell from power. Reagan wrote that he was concerned that his friend Gorbachev might be harmed by Soviet hardliners in a coup. He turned out to be right.A coup was staged, but it failed.

This fascinating book is full of such accounts, from William Shirer's account of the 1938 Munich Conference (including his brush with a swaggering Hitler) to fascinating reports of the fall of Paris by A. J. Liebling and Virginia Cowles, to Edward R. Murrow's descriptions of war-torn but defiant London to Ernie Pyle's moving tales of soldiers in the trenches of Africa and Sicily. This book offers a unique glimpse into World War II by the people who were there, who lived through the extraordinary as well as the ordinary moments of that war. Included in this volume are incredible snapshots of the American homefront, including a report from a Japanese internment camps, as well as a &quot;report on mass murder&quot; in German concerntration camps by Ed Murrow in 1942, long before most Americans had any idea of the true horror of the holocaust. This volume explores all aspects of the war, and, as such, is an incredible historical document as well as a fascinating read. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Reporting World War II, Part 1: American Journalism, 1938-1944 (Library of America)","review":"I am so glad the Library of America put together these volumes of reporting from the Second World War. Sadly, all those who were living during those years are leaving us all to rapidly. Certainly, the living knowledge of the events and times is fading fast. While we value the books great authors give us, we should treasure even more the writing given us at the time. In volume one we have reporting from great journalists starting in 1938 Shirer's article on the Munich conference that gave Germany the Sudetenland.We get to follow the rise of Anti-Semitism in Germany with Kristallnacht, the fall of Poland and Paris. The London Blitz is covered by Edward R. Murrow and more and more. The United States doe not even enter the war until page 241 with the Herald Tribune's reporting of Roosevelt's \\"War Message\\".The reporting also takes us into the Pacific and gets us down with those doing the actual work of the war including Annalee Jacoby's account of nurses under fire in Bataan. We get early reporting on the Japanese Internment camps and the Holocaust with the NY Times reporting in 1942 that one million Jews reported slain.There is a section of fine photos of the reporters included and others in the text including some aerial shots from a bomber's point of view. This first volume ends with the Mountain Campaign in Italy in 1944. The volume also supplies a short, but full chronology of the war, some excellent maps, biographies of the journalists, acknowledgements, notes on the texts, and a glossary of military terms.A superb job."},{"Title":"Reporting World War II, Part 1: American Journalism, 1938-1944 (Library of America)","review":"You can read history books and watch all of the redigitalized DVD's (movies) of World War II stories but the \\"best of the best\\" is right here in this wonderful compilation of first hand accounts from reporters who were on the scene and reported back to their readership when the events were actually occurring. It is fascinating to read what was reported at that time in history. This compliation is well worth reading. It also contains a great general biographical summary of all of the reporters who's work appears in the book. These were interesting people in their own right. I will use their biographies as a valuable resource for other additional readings."},{"Title":"Reporting World War II, Part 1: American Journalism, 1938-1944 (Library of America)","review":"If any book deserves more than a five star rating this (as well as its sequel, \\"Reporting World War II Part Two: American Journalism 1944-1946\\") is it. Attractively bound, compact and very readable, this volume is Part One of a two-volume set which provides an incomparable overview of World War II, as it was experienced by our parents' and grandparents' generation.This is not just another book about The War and the Big Names who create and control Events. It is above all a book about ordinary people and for ordinary people, who find themselves caught up in positions not of their choosing. Some are victims, some are heroes, some just watch and wait, but most are small pieces in a Big Picture they can barely comprehend.Unlike the usual histories of World War II, which have been written long after the fact and with the benefit of hind-sight, this superb collection, arranged in chronological order and using newspapers, magazine articles, radio broadcasts, diaries and photographs from the great journalists of the day, allows us to follow the events - at home and abroad -- as they happened. We all know how events turned out, but this book takes us back to that time, with an immediacy, an uncertainty and an irony, to what it was like to be alive during this immense, all-consuming, mid-20th century, global conflict.Beginning with William Shirer at the Munich Conference of 1938 which handed the Sudetenland over to Hitler, then in Berlin on September 1, 1939 reporting on the German Invasion of Poland, and later, at Compiegne for the surrender of France in 1940, these are some of the high-lights:Sigrid Schultz in Berlin on Kristallnacht, November 9, 1938;A J Leibling in Paris and Virginia Cowles fleeing Paris before the German advance;Edward R Murrow broadcasting daily from London during the Blitz;C L Sulzberger from Athens (also soon to fall) on the German invasion of Yugoslavia, April 1941; andMargaret Bourke-White on the Russian Front in 1941;The New York Herald Tribune prints Roosevelt's war message on December 8, 1941 as \\"America declares War\\";Husband and wife team -- Melville Jacoby describes the Japanese attack on the Philippines, December 1941, \\"War Hits Manila\\", and Annalee Jacoby records the heroism of \\"Bataan Nurses\\" under fire;Raymond Clapper provides a \\"Pearl Harbor Post-mortem\\";Ernie Pyle is on the spot in London, North Africa, Sicily & the Italian campaign;On Christmas Night 1941 Cecil Brown sends a cable from Singapore on the \\"Malay Jungle War\\";Jack Belden describes \\"Stilwell's Retreat Through Burma\\", May 1942;Brendan Gill is on the US Home Front in 1942, \\"Rationing\\";\\"A Vast Slaughterhouse\\", a report of the extermination of Jews, appears in the New York Times, June 1942 - a harbinger of the horrors to come;E B White follows Dorothy Lamour to Bangor, Maine for a \\"Bond Rally\\";Roi Ottley, George Schuyler & Deton Brooks report separate incidents of racial discrimination including the murder of black soldiers in the US;John Hersey is at Guadalcanal, October 1942;John Steinbeck joins a troop ship to Salerno, September 1943;Edward Kennedy reports on the infamous \\"Patton Slapping Case\\", November 1943;Martha Gelhorn visits the RAF Burn Centre, 1943 in \\"the Price of Fire\\";War correspondent Richard Tregaskis with the troops in Italy reports on himself getting shot; andGertrude Stein writing from Occupied France in 1944 is \\"Tired of Winter Tired of War.\\"This volume concludes in the spring of 1944 as the tide is turning in Allied favour.I highly recommend this book and its sequel.

Library of America has done a fine job collecting these works, and adding useful sections on maps, notes, author mini bios and an excellent yet brief Chronology of the main events of WWII.Some of these articles verge on literature. Consider the following opening sentences of an article written by Mary Heaton Vorse on munition girl workers (\\"The girls of Elkton, Maryland\\", p. 471):\\"It was pay day at the munitions plant. There seemed to be a run on the bank at Elkton.\\"Or, how about Ernye Plye reporting the London bombing of December 29, 1940 (p. 147):\\"Half an hour after the firing started I gathered a couple of friends and went to a high, darkened balcony that gave us a view of one-third of the entire circle of London.

It was very slow getting to me and I am disappointed"},{"Title":"White Rock Ways","review":"The epitome of the kind of book I look for in my travels, &quot;White Rock Ways&quot; has everything one can imagine occurring as a part of life in a small town-or a small island-in Maine.Set in the 1960s, though I had a hard time coming up with anything but images of folk from a decade long before, such was the ambiance of the characters, the stories of life in the community of White Rock unfold.Through a narrative rich in Maine dialect and phraseology, we discover the ways of the locals and learn to care for them as we become involved in the comings and goings of their daily lives.There is a tendency to sum each other up in one-word adjectives; for instance, Clara and Levi Weymouth, introduced early in the story and most consistently present throughout, are known as the \\"near Weymouths\\", which sometimes bothers Levi, who thinks it \\"fine to be \`near', but not so fine to be \`tight as the bark to a tree'.\\"When a neighbor's closed summer home has some suspicious activity taking place around it, Levi discovers a couple of intruding, though apparently harmless, neighborhood boys. He brings them back to his own house to report them to the authorities and makes them sit on the \\"funeral couch\\", made up of leftover coffin lining material Clara purchased from the local funeral director; an example of her reputation of being near, not to mention giving the boys the heebie jeebies as added, though unintended, punishment.One woman, Meg, \\"from away\\" laments the fact that the villagers don't seem to read. It is not long before she comes to realize that \\"Rockahs ahn't readahs\\", as her husband puts it, but they are eager listeners. Meg, having plenty of opportunity to narrate her stories to islanders, finds parallels between village life and the lives of characters from some of her favorite books by authors such as Shakespeare and Sherwood Anderson. She learns that while White Rock dwellers may not read much literature, they \\"certainly lived it.\\"There is suspicion of child molestation by a teacher. Intrigue comes to town in the form of a tragic \\"fancy woman.\\" Long memories of small town folk is proven when a sheriff's deputy is asked about a knee injury from a childhood incident as though it was just weeks ago he was injured. Secrets are revealed of the old doctor who would find interesting areas of women's bodies requiring examination-no matter of what ailment she complained upon arrival in his office. Mystery comes in the form of a Spanish man who shows up in the local cemetery. Lessons in preparing brown bread and salting cod also bring us directly into their realm.One of my favorite traits of Mainers is the very fine thread used to tie people together who are \\"almost\\" related. It so happens that a distant relation of those from whom the author of this book purchased her own home some years ago owns the cottage in which I presently live. Makes me wonder if the author will allow me to claim her as a relation because of this thread, thereby allowing me a bit of leeway given the fact that I am \\"from away.\\"In addition, of course, there are the stories surrounding the white rock, which gives the island its name. You will have to read the book to learn of these."},{"Title":"Collected Poems, 1920-1954: Revised Bilingual Edition","review":"Eugenio Montale is my favourite poet, and before I was able to read him in the original Italian I read the extant English translations by Jonathan Galassi and William Arrowsmith. Looking back, I would wholeheartedly recommend Arrowsmith's translations above Galassi's.Galassi's translations are accurate as far as the meaning goes, but do not sufficiently mirror the sound of Montale's brilliant Italian, and in several poems they do not translate the mood, the essence of Montale's poetic vision. Arrowsmith's translations have always seemed wonderful to me because they capture Montale's emotion (especially the sly irony of SATURA) and remain faithful to the sound of the Italian. If one wishes to read Montale's poems in English, I would highly suggest you purchase William Arrowsmith's translations. Arrowsmith translated not only Montale's first three books as Galassi only did, but also his retrospective SATURA, some of his best poetry.This edition by Galassi does warrant recognition, however, for one thing. His attached essay, \\"Reading Montale,\\" does a great deal for the unfamiliar reader to explain the nature of Montale's \\"Clizia\\" mythos, and his analysis of the cicada symbol teaches the reader to appreciate Montale's complex symbolism."},{"Title":"Collected Poems, 1920-1954: Revised Bilingual Edition","review":"There are some good translations of Montale around but this is not one of them: in fact I'd say it is the least successful of any of the translations that have been made. Galassi goes overboard to make Montale jagged and unmusical: in a word: unpoetic. The lovely, brief love poems of the Le Occasioni have been rendered as bits of broken glass that cut the mouth. Even the content is changed when it doesn't fit in with Galassi's arch-modernist convictions: words get dropped, content get changed around, religious words get omitted, extraneous things are put in. Galassi defends his vision of Montale as an anti-poet in an essay at the back of the book, but it doesn't convince, and, significantly, no evidence is cited in support. Even the arrangements of the poems on the page -- in this case probably the publisher's fault , rather than Galassi's -- manages to misrepresent them. Poems that were, in the original, meant to be separated by a page break are here represented in run-on fashion, so that one reads the parts as connected in a way that they are not intended to be. *News from Amiata* (not *Mount* Amiata, as Galassi renders it!) is a case in point: the parts should be on separate pages, not run-on as they are. The same goes for the Motets.But this would be less jarring if the translations themselves were more faithful to the spirit of the originals. Unfortunately they completely mislead the reader as to the meaning of Montale's poems. The translations of William Arrowsmith were much, much better and Norton would do the lover of Montale's poetry a great service by putting them back into print. Arrowsmith gets the modernism of Montale right without making him sound like he just didn't know how to write. But that, sadly, is how he comes across in Galassi's versions: a fumbling amateur, certainly not someone who could win a Nobel prize!Don't be misled by the encomiums on the back of the book. Galassi is an important New York editor: no one is going to tell him or the public the truth about his efforts at translation. The most the reader can hope for is that Norton, or Charles Wright's publisher will put out a better version of the Collected Poems so that the lover of Montale has a choice. At present we seem to be stuck with this white elephant alone!"},{"Title":"Collected Poems, 1920-1954: Revised Bilingual Edition","review":"Exchanging notes with Mike Birman about Petrarch, whose poems inspired some of the greatest composers of the 16th and 17th Centuries, I suddenly made a connection -- had an epiphany, to put it in grad school terms. Eugenio Montale (b. 1896) wrote a lot like Petrarch! That may not be such a surprise to scholars of Italian literature, or it may seem like pure nonsense to those same scholars. Che sara sara. But for the various readers of my reviews of Monteverdi and other madrigalists, the mere mention of a modern Italian poet, and an extremely good one, may be a revelation. Here's a very short poem by Montale:LUNGOMAREIl soffio cresce, il buio e rotto a squarci,e l'ombra che tu mandi sulla fragilepalizzata s'arriccia. Troppo tardise vuoi esser te stessa! Dalla palmatonfa il sorcio, il baleno e sulla miccia,sui lunghissimi cigli del tuo sguardo.But Montale lived through tougher times, and modern themes show up in his work as veins of grief through his translucent marble lyricism. Here's my own translation of his poem \\"La Primavera Hitleriana\\" :HITLER SPRINGA thick lamp-loony mist, moths, dim as sleetswirls down parapets, eddies, drains,shakes down on the stones a sheetthat crackles like sugar underfoot.When summer comes, now soon, it breakschill nitres loose the dying season heldhidden in coverts, quarries, orchards whichfrom Maiano snake down sandhills to sandy banks.Hooked crosses, flags and flambeaux, mystic chantsof stooges gorged him in -- the hellbent henchmancyclist who through the Corso just nowblazed. Shop fronts are shuttered, brokeand gutless though they, they too, sportplastic cannons. Bars creakacross the butcher's counter closing, hewho used to deck his goats' heads outwith red small berries -- rite of those tender killerswho do not know blood yet, made overin a puking reel of mashed white wings, larvaeon the mud-flats fledging, and foul waterrots its banks and no one is blameless.For nothing is it? St. John's Evegoes slowly blonde as roman candles streakadios stark as baptisms to this dolorous watchthe horde keeps. Some precious something skatesyour shoreline skyward, Tobias' seraph sevenspermed on ice. Heliotropesfoal from your fingers. --Our bleeding ulcer, April,if it freeze such death in death, is a holiday yet.Clizia, whose fate this is, though changed, youlove unchanged until that sun that squints in you islacklustered in the Other, annihilated inhim for everyone. Sirens, pig iron bells,sledging the horde's Walpurgisnacht, alreadywith peals broken off heaven,descending, conquering, chime -- Oh dawnof frosted breathing but unhorriblewhich tomorrow bursts over the fried gulches of the south....Clizia is Montale's recurrent feminine, his match for Petrarch's Laura. My translation was published some years ago in the Transatlantic Review #19. Robert Lowell included several translations of Montale poems in his book \\"Imitations\\" and Charles Wright has translated nearly all of Montale in very impressive poetic English."},{"Title":"Collected Poems, 1920-1954: Revised Bilingual Edition","review":"Some of Montale's best poems translated faithfully and presented in the original Italian.

Book was in perfect condition and arrived at exactly the announced date."},{"Title":"Collected Poems, 1920-1954: Revised Bilingual Edition","review":"I found Galassi's translations of Montale, oddly disappointing, but intriguing. Not the poet, the book. Montale's poetry is truly gorgeous, but the Galassi translation, problematic to me. I have been cherry picking my way through the poems and the very first I read seems full of misspellings, mistranslations, awkward language. In the Italian, says my google translator, page 94 \\"lameggia\\" ought to be \\"lampeggia\\" = \\"flashes\\" and there is no doubt that \\"flashes\\" is far more poetically evocative than the translation chosen, \\"shines\\". The next line or two seem rather irrationally broken, which changes them, differently than the Italian. The word \\"beata\\", which has been translated as \\"happily\\", should, I think, more properly be \\"blessedly\\" giving the poem (Maestrale/Mistral) a whole different meaning. In the second line of the poem the word \\"maretta\\" meaning \\"swell(s)\\" makes far more sense than the word used, \\"choppy\\". This was the word that seemed so odd to me initially. Anyone who has spent time by the sea knows that a \\"choppy\\" sea does not \\"talk among the rocks\\" and has a very different sound, but a swelling sea, moving among rocks, does \\"talk\\". There is more even just in this poem, but this is sufficient here. A fair amount of the English is neither grammatically correct nor suitably imagistic in this edition.There is no table of contents of poems. How ridiculous. The notes at the back of the Galassi/Montale book are alright I suppose, as far as they go, but they seem rather academic in a dry detached kind of way. There is an index of titles and first lines at the back, but it is missing the poem I refer to above \\"The Agave On The Reef\\" although the index does contain the sections of that poem: Scirocco, Tramontana and Maestrale (lampeggia is in Maestrale). Perhaps these are corrected in the 2012 revised edition; this review was written in regard to the 1998 editionCollected Poems, 1920-1954: Bilingual Edition, which is 15 pages shorter than the 2012 editionCollected Poems, 1920-1954: Newly Revised Bilingual Edition. At some point I will look at the revised 2012 edition and update these comments. Editing, design, and layout decisions (and oversights) contribute to the difficulty of finding and accessing individual poems and the notes, all of which contributes to the difficulty of connecting with the poems, which, I think, is what poetry and its language is all about, connecting.At the time of initial writing of this review one had to wait for another comprehensive translation, but now, the Arrowsmith translation of the collected works is out. It too has the word \\"lameggia,\\" but still, a google search completely rejects this word over the entire web except to this poem, and searches for, alternatively \\"lampeggia.\\" Puzzling. I find the Arrowsmith translation far more evocative, poetic, lyrical. The notes too are much better designed to be found and have their own poetic evocations in that translation, and there is a table of contents and an alphabetized index of titles and first lines, So much more accessible.Poetry in translation is always very difficult, so do some investigating first and chose your preference. While I prefer the Arrowsmith translation and it seems to flow more, the Galassi has words and phrases that stir different images in me and ultimately I like a translation that is a mix of the two. If you are keen on Montale, or any foreign language poet, you will benefit too, if you spend some time working some of it out with a dictionary yourself. It is worth the effort and will enrich your experience and your life, and isn't that what poetry is supposed to do?"},{"Title":"Collected Poems, 1920-1954: Revised Bilingual Edition","review":"Ably translated and annotated by Jonathan Galassi, this revised bilingual edition of Eugenio Montale's Collected Poems 1920-1954 brings the lyrical Italian poet's work to a new generation of readers.

Day And Night: A floating feather, too, can sketch your image/or the sunbeam playing hied-and-seek/in the furniture, rebounding off/a baby's mirror or the roofs.

As a pre-service teacher in college, I can honestly say that after all the droll books on theory and pedagogy, this book can teach you so much more in a real-life approach."},{"Title":"Lewis Cass, (American statesmen)","review":"Lewis Cass is one of the strangest biographies I have ever read. Only rarely in the book is Lewis Cass the center of the narrative. After reading the book, I still do not know if Lewis Cass was ever married or had a family. I know very little about his personality or disposition. I know only about his public career and some of the public issues with which he was involved during his long public career. Cass is presented almost exclusively through his public actions, statements and writings.His public career is quite a story in itself. This native of New Hampshire move west into Ohio in time for Cass to become a general in the War of 1812, fighting on the front between Detroit and what is now Ontario. He then stayed in Michigan where he served 18 years as territorial governor.Having grown into a National Statesman, Cass later served Andrew Jackson as Secretary of War, followed by a term as Ambassador to France. Upon to his return to the United States, Cass was a serious candidate for the Democratic nomination for President in 1844 before a deadlocked convention turned to James K. Polk. Four years later, Cass won the nomination, only to lose the election to Gen. Zachary Taylor, a loss which, according to the book, was probably attributable to the candidacy of former President Martin Van Buren on the Free Soil Ticket.Presidential politics being behind him, Cass served two terms as Michigan's Senator until the rise of the Republican party swept him out of the Senate and into the cabinet President Buchanan's as Secretary of State. It was from this position that Cass watched the dissolution of the country as well as the cabinet in the waning days of that administration.Returning to Michigan, Cass supported the cause of national unity until his death in 1866.The most interesting thing about this book is the literary style in which it is written. Throughout the book, Cass is portrayed as a righteous character opposed by a series of villainous figures toward whom attention is directed in the particular sections of the book. Prominent among these are General Hull of the War of 1812, Andrew Jackson and James Buchanan. The general style is to relate a particular aspect of history and then allude to the public role which Cass played in it.During the section on the War of 1812, Cass' position is contrasted favorably with that of Gen. Hull who is treated most roughly in the narrative. In the section on Cass' governorship of the Wisconsin territory, most of the attention is directed to the French inhabitants who occupied the territory at the start of Cass' tenure. A contrast is drawn the French, who are presented as happy but unambitious, and Cass who introduced American initiative and drive into the territory and, thereby, advanced it into the Western powerhouse which it became.The section on his service in Jackson's cabinet portrays Jackson in a very unfavorable light, while praising Cass. Cass' service as Minster to France is presented most favorably.Cass' Senate years were dominated primarily by the issues of slavery which were gradually tearing the nation apart. Cass is portrayed as the creator of the doctrine of Popular Sovereignty in which the voters of each territory would be permitted to decide the issue of slavery for itself. Swipes are taken at Stephen A. Douglas who is popularly remembered as the advocate of that position. The conclusion of the Senate service is seen against the backdrop of the swing of the Northwest from its tradition allegiance to the Democracy (Democratic Party) to the new Republican party which would soon sweep the area and the country into Civil War.The service in Buchanan's cabinet is used to present the deterioration of the country as well as Buchanan's feeble efforts to deal with the problem.The style of writing is shockingly judgmental in its treatment of the public figures portrayed in the book. While modern readers may expect to see facts presented in a way as to portray figures in favorable or unfavorable lights, we rarely expect to see the conclusions presented by strong and extreme adjectives.What real value there is in this book is its portrayal of the general history of the times and places in which Cass played his roles in the nation's drama as portrayed in the 1890s. It is in seeing our history from through the 1890s eyes of the author that we can take the greatest lessons from this book."},{"Title":"Crisis and faith","review":"Rabbi Berkovits examines the crisis of faith of modern man. He defines the sense of meaningless which has come to a Mankind which feels itself alone in an indifferent Cosmos. He sees that there has been a disintegration of traditional value systems. This sickness he sees as having also invaded traditional Judaism.He strives to understand how Judaism can provide meaning in a variety of areas of life, including in sexual ethics, in the place of the woman in society,in the state of Israel. He argues that there needs to be a new Jewish revival of spirit. He says that this should involve a Jewish movement toward combining religious and secular learning. He says that the Jewish world must find its meaning in greater unity, greater mutual caring and concern. He concludes the work as follows:\\"Contemplating the dangers besetting all Israel, the threats to our very survival- not at all unlike those in the days of Nazism-how can we think of facing the challenges of the hour without the strongest possible unity of all Israel, without the highest grade of responsibility toward Klal Yisrael, without being carried forward by the deepest sense of Ahavat Yisrael? How can we do it without realizing that Bein kakh uvein kakh , either way, such are the Jews God has still left; that either way, they are the only brothers and sisters still left us, upon whom alone we may count and who count on us!\\"Rabbi Berkovits wrote these words nearly thirty years ago at the time of the Yom Kippur War. They of course apply today when Israel and the Jewish people are encountering a new evil combination of anti- Semitism from extreme left and Islamic fundamentalist right.This is a book that speaks to the Jewish crisis even today."},{"Title":"Hunters & Shooters","review":"The great thing about this oral history is that you get a personal feel for the characters as they talk about their experiences. The wide range of experiences are reflected in the wide range of personalities that the history is drawn from. The accounts are honest and sincere. Each account begins with a brief editorial introduction and summary of a different aspect of the SEALs unit formation and operational history in Viet Nam. This helps the reader to understand the subject as a broad total of experiences rather than just a bundle of yarns slapped together. The editor did a great job of putting the accounts in an informative sequence which gave this reviewer a greater background understanding of the following accounts as I progressed through the book.I bought my copy during a visit to the SEAL/ UDT Museum in Fort Pierce, Florida and I strongly recommend other interested military buffs to buy this book and check out the museum. Well worth it."},{"Title":"Hunters & Shooters","review":"This is a great book about 15 SEALS and their experiences from training to the Vietnam war and life in the teams. It is interesting to read about the different personalities of this elite group and the things that make them alike. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hunters & Shooters","review":"I love the fact that this story was written with 15 different voices. Often times people would try to shell out 15 separate books instead, but I like the weaving interplay of the stories as they go into around and through one another.This truly does (as another reviewer said) give the impression of an oral history and stories as they'd be told around a camp fire, very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Hunters & Shooters","review":"There are an increasing number of books being published about U.S. Navy SEALs, but HUNTERS & SHOOTERS is one of the best, especially about the era when Navy SEALs served in Vietnam.The editor of this book, Bill Fawcett, gathered 15 former SEALs and asked them to relate their experiences. Some of their tales are short, others are longer, but they all have the ring of truth.The SEAL Teams matured during the Vietnam War when their mission was to identify, disrupt and eliminate where possible the leadership infrastructure of the Viet Cong. The SEALS served primarily in the Mekong Delta and over the course of the six years that they served in country, they were able to provoke deadly fear into the Viet Cong leadership. In some cases, the SEAL platoons operated individually in the Delta, though frequently with the support of Vietnamese SEALs (who were trained by the American SEALs). In other instances, the SEALs were attached to the PHOENIX program, advising Provincial Reconaissance Units (PRU's) who were often ex-Viet Cong who had turned on their communist colleagues.The PHOENIX program became a target for anti-war protesters in the late 60's and early 70's, but in fact the program was probably the most effective operation the Americans undertook in terms of inflicting damage on the Viet Cong infrastructure. Frank Thornton and Mike Boynton give the most enlightened accounts of their PHOENIX/PRU experiences.The writer should note that he himself served as a SEAL in Vietnam, so this favorable critique of HUNTERS & SHOOTERS is based on first-hand knowledge of SEAL operations. The hope from this end is that Fawcett or some other editor will compile a similar book about SEAL operations in the Middle East, including Afghanistan, to give the SEALs in those conflicts their own recognition for their efforts on behalf of our country's security."},{"Title":"Hunters & Shooters","review":"I thought this book was and indepth and exciting book. It is about 16 Navy SEALs and their stories in Vietnam. The storys range to be about 10-60 pages in length. They are written from a first person view of a Navy SEAL in their own account of the Vietnam war. The stories start from about where they were born and why they joined the Navy to become a SEAl. It goes through indepth deatil about the traing in some stories. And it also has a detailed accurate account of that person's part in the Vietnam War.

Being a Navy vet myself, I never got to meet anyone in the Seal Program. I was in, in the late 70's and early 80's, so Vietnam was just history to me. I liked the way this book is written, with 15 Seal vets telling their own individual stories, their way. It becomes apparent that there was a great diversity among the Seals and is surely that way even today. I really admire Seals and think that their contributions during Vietnam and since, is something that needs to be \\"put out there\\" more. This book held my attention throughout and was an easy read. I have found myself getting various books on Seals more and more - they fascinate me. I'm sure that a lot of other people feel the same way. They impress me with their bravery and endurance.

The illustrations are grayed out, and the bottoms of many pages are simply unreadable -- most of the characters have disappeared from the middle of the bottom two lines. This is not really even a book. It looks like their laser printer ran of toner.

Dogs weren't allowed in their cabins: &quot;Sooner ask in their pigs.&quot; As if this weren't bad enough for Little Scraggly Hair the other dogs didn't like him either.

Furthermore, he surely was hungry.Fortunately for Little Scraggly Hair he wandered into the yard of a man named Noah who was working very hard at building a boat. That was surprising as there wasn't any water nearby. Even more surprising was Noah's kindness - he was nice to the puppy and shared his dinner with him.The surprise in this endearing tale of friendship between a man and a puppy is how puppies developed cold wet noses.Children will find lots of smiles and a valuable lesson to learn in &quot;Little Scraggly Hair.&quot;- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Little Scraggly Hair: A Dog on Noah's Ark","review":"I'm partial to mutts - they always seem to be loyal and have a sweet disposition.

First, the food didn't turn out as good as I remember Korean food to be. They were kind of bland and unexciting. Secondly, many of the recipes involve use of eggs. I understand that Korean food may not be the most vegan/vegetarian friendly since they like to use shrimp paste in kimchi and other pickled vegetables, so my expectations for this book may be too high."},{"Title":"Flavors of Korea: Delicious Vegetarian Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"I've failed to cook from this cookbook. There are two recipes in this book for stir-frys that appear to differ only in the number of green peppers and amount of oil you use. The range between recipes in this cookbook is smaller than the range of accidental alterations I make to any recipe the first time I cook it. A recipe for bibimbap from another cookbook has me quick pickle the cucumbers and diakon, boil the carrots and the spinach, and fry the zucchini, which results in a large range of tastes mixing in the bibimbap. In this cookbook, you're told to simply fry everything. There is a fair amount of attention to presentation, and no attention to possible substitutions (although that is often covered by a set of recipes). I felt that I got all the advice available just by reading over this cookbook and not even cooking from it. I've tried to cook from it, but I just go to other cookbooks I've got or wing it. This cookbook doesn't even distinguish between red chili paste and red chili sauce (the paste is a simpler ingredient that needs to be mixed with fresh garlic, rice vinegar, sesame oil and water before using).I really want to know a larger variety of vegetarian possibilities in Korean cooking, but this cookbook doesn't oblige. Only purchase this if you have no experience whatsoever in stir frys or any type of Asian cooking and you want to very rigidly follow a small set of similar recipes that include detailed presentation information."},{"Title":"Flavors of Korea: Delicious Vegetarian Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"It's a good basic book- no frills.

It was my first experience cooking Korean foods - What a treat!"},{"Title":"Flavors of Korea: Delicious Vegetarian Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"I was really turned off by the evident lack of cultural research that the author did on the subject of Korean culinary customs. It is laden with errors, which could have easily been picked up by anyone familiar with Korean cooking. Koreans generally don't have dessert. It is more of a western concept. Though sometimes fruit or a fruit drink is served after dinner, this is usually in a restaurant, not at the family dining room table.She says that Kimchi and other side dishes can be prepared days in advance. Kimchi can be prepared weeks in advance. Kimchi has to ripen and will ripen according to how it is pickled and the environment it is pickled in. This statement made me lose credibility in her.Also the glossary does not consistently give both the American and the Korean names of items, making it more difficult to identify the item in a Korean grocery store.I was looking for more authentic Korean vegetarian recipes and I lost faith in my guide as I read the book. But some of the dishes I have made do taste good. So if you're not in pursuit of authenticity, this is a good alternative."},{"Title":"Flavors of Korea: Delicious Vegetarian Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"I grew up eating Korean food at least half the time. When I became a vegetarian, one of the sacrifices I made was most of my Korean food. Although I was able to make some dishes (like the spinach and bean sprout salads), it was difficult to feel like I was getting a complete meal.This cookbook allowed me to enjoy the flavors of my childhood. It's so nice to be able to flip through a Korean cookbook and know that I can cook everything in it (that's a luxury I think only vegetarians will understand!). All of the recipes I've tried so far are delicious- two thumbs way up!"},{"Title":"Flavors of Korea: Delicious Vegetarian Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"I grew up eating my mom's wonderful Korean food, and while it is certainly healthier than the usual American fare, going completely vegetarian while eating Korean seemed difficult. Although Korean side dishes and standards like bibimbop and daenjang chige are obvious vegetarian treats, many other dishes incorporate beef, pork, or chicken, although they are not the main focus of the meal. And then, of course, the wonderful barbecued meats were certainly hard to give up after becoming vegetarian.But the wonderful thing about this cookbook is that it has narrowed down those selections of Korean foods that are truly vegetarian, without trying to replace or substitute for the original meat dishes. There are also a lot of wonderful vegan options, and calorie and nutritional information are included at the bottom of the recipe.Most of the recipes are quick and easy. All in all, this book is the perfect addition to a vegetarian's library. It will nicely supplement other ethnic cookbooks and contains many meals which are easily prepared in a short amount of time. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Flavors of Korea: Delicious Vegetarian Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"Flavors of Korea is a gem of a cookbook! As a vegetarian going through a bit of &quot;menu bordom&quot;, I wanted to try Korean food to spice up my palette. I could not have made a better choice and for such a great price. Everything is explained in the book from buying Korean spices, to wonderful menus. The author has done a good job of keeping things simple for those of us who might be a bit intimidated."},{"Title":"Flavors of Korea: Delicious Vegetarian Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"I have only made a few recipes from the book, but I can safely say, it will be a book I use often. The recipes in here more or less makes small portions which is great for someone living alone, or couples. If not, you will find yourself making five or six different recipes for one dinner for four. Even though making so many different things might seem like it is too much, they are VERY simple and easy to make.What I really like about the cookbook is that it is almost vegan. Probably 80% of the recipes don't have any dairy or eggs, and clearly no meat. If someone is a vegan, I would suggest this book since a large portion works with you diet.My only complaint is that the author, I think, tries to keep the spice levels lower. It serves handy for my boyfriend who sweats over small doses of spices, but annoying for me since I like things super hot. As one one reviewer pointed out, some of the food kind-of lacks some of the punch I know from some Korean food I have eaten in the past. And I also wish that the recipes and ingredients would include Hangul spellings of ingredients. I felt a little silly looking for some of the ingredients in the store."},{"Title":"Flavors of Korea: Delicious Vegetarian Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)","review":"I love Korean food but I had found it very difficult to find a good Vegetarian Korean cookbook until I stumbled onto this terrific book.

It quickly became apparent that this cookbook is written for those in the U.S.--the measurements are American, and the text is only in English. I see many things in the Korean markets that aren't mentioned in the book, probably because they aren't readily available in the U.S.Because the range of seasonings Korean cooks use is limited, many of the recipes are similar. To my taste, they are often bland. Still, there are some real winners in the book and it has helped me develop an expansive repertoire. I've successfully made kimchi and veggie dumplings using this book.A minor pet peeve: the book is full of typos and funky layout errors, as if it were rushed into print.

Why would anyone be interested in that?A: Because core principles are slow to change... and true classics never go out of style.In this 1996 edition ofStyle and the Man: How and Where to Buy Fine Mens' Clothes, author Alan Flusser makes the opinions and judgments of the moneyed classes on business and formal wear accessible to all. While the very fashionable will object to this stiff and stuffy presentation of somewhat dated rules, the rest of us will recognize that the CEOs of the companies we work for probably follow these rules and take notes accordingly.The first fourth of the book (about 100 pages) covers the fundamentals of the suit and tie, both tailored and bespoke. There are some anachronisms - the author's pro-pleat stance for one, and his thoughts on brown shoes with a black suit - but overall these views are still current, if conservative. Following instruction as to how the dandy packs his suitcase, the remaining three quarters of the book comprise a jet-setter's travel guide to the finest men's clothiers in the world. A harsher critic would term this information \\"useless\\" as it is the most dated and few of us have the financial means to follow its advice, but does not the gentleman elevate his wardrobe by window-shopping?In 2010, anabridged versionof this book was released. Part one was left almost unchanged - nothing was done to counter the author's overuse of the word \\"sartorial\\", sadly - and part two was simply removed. I feel that this abridgment, if practical, diminishes the charm ofStyle and the Manand so recommend the original over the update."},{"Title":"Style and the Man: How and Where to Buy Fine Mens' Clothes","review":"I enjoyed A.F.'s other books enough to buy this one, although it is not nearly as practical. The sections on where to buy clothes are not only out of date by now, they are also designed for people who have far more money than most. Actually, I don't know why this book was published originally since, if you have the money to shop at these stores, you probably already know about them. It almost seems like a matter of credentialing, but who knows.I would buy one of A.F.'s other books if you are just looking for a men's clothing guide. However, if the subject matter really interests you, you will find that each of A.F.'s books covers much of the same ground, but in slightly different ways, so that there is value in reading all of them, including this one."},{"Title":"Style and the Man: How and Where to Buy Fine Mens' Clothes","review":"Alan Flusser's latest book is a must read for any man who wants to look good. Flusser is occasionally insufferably stuffy, but what he has to say about quality and fit in men's tailored clothes is well-reasoned and well-presented. He makes a strong case for a classic but not dowdy wardrobe of high-quality clothes that could make any man look and feel good, and he reviews the various places in major cities around the world where one could go about constructing it. He really doesn't deal with casual/sport clothes very well, but most men probably don't need him to -- there is vastly more confusion about a suit and tie than there is about a polo shirt and chinos."},{"Title":"Style and the Man: How and Where to Buy Fine Mens' Clothes","review":"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This book is more like the cliff notes to a book about men's fashion, tradition, style, etc. The other half of the book is relatively useless - unless, of course, you're a millionaire &amp; world traveller. The prose is humorous at times becasue it's so pretentious - bordering on the effeminate a la Niles Crane. Still, there are some very imporatnt basice male fashion rules established by history and tradition, discussed in this book, which one wishes were adhered to more regularly. The first half of the book is serviceable, but not authoritative. Flusser comes off somewhat foppish and the picture of him on the dustjacket would lead me to question his taste in, if nothing else, haircuts! I would consider a better book, with far more lavish detail and illustrations to be &quot;Gentlemen : A Timeless Fashion&quot;, only recently published."},{"Title":"Style and the Man: How and Where to Buy Fine Mens' Clothes","review":"3/4 of this book is where to shop, with locations noted in Chicago, Houston, Florence, Milan, NYC, Vienna, etc (but not Beijing, Shanghai or Hong Kong).

Much has been made about the outdated addresses of some of the stores in the second half of the book. Well my response is..get over it. Fine mens stores change addresses, its a fact of life.

It's pure gold and worth the price of the book for this alone.The remaining two thirds lists stores in most big cities in the world. This was interesting, but about as useful as a pair of tonsils.

Mr Flusser takes us on a stroll across the aged wooden floors of Savile Row to the elegant marble of Milan, and somewhere in between finds the time to advise on how,what and more importantly when certain items of clothing should be worn.Style and the Man replaces the highly expensive and Victorian need of employing a man servant.Thank you Mr Flusser.

Many of the stores in the U.S. have relocated and some have closed.On the other hand, I've used it to find choices in London and Paris that I would never have known about otherwise. And once you've made the initial investment in the measurements, you can patronize many of these establishments by telephone.A number of earlier reviews criticise Flusser for focusing on the finest quality and most expensive clothing in the world.

The instruction in this part is useful, but it's not worth the price of the book. Take away the travel guide and then clip away Flusser's dreadfully affected, ornate writing manner, and the total amount of instruction here on men's clothing boils down to about 50 pages. As for those 50 pages: they are good for providing basic information about tailored clothing, but they are nearly ruined by overly rigid sartorial rules. Flusser, who seems to have an unwarrantedly high opinon of himself, judging from his pronoucements, does not tell the reader that many of his judgments are not shared by everyone. This is a crime against the reader who buys Flusser's book as an objective guide to men's clothing and doesn't realize it's one very opinionated man's view. And some of these views are questionable to say the least. This book should be read with caution, and in conjunction with other, less opinionated books for those who are interested in men's tailored clothing. Also, a lot of this book is historical, and Flusser has no list of reference books in the back to tell the reader where he gets his info. from."},{"Title":"Style and the Man: How and Where to Buy Fine Mens' Clothes","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this book is really two books. One is a guide to the style of fine men's clothes, the other tells where to buy them. Most people will probably find the style information in the beginning the most useful part.One reviewer thought that the author left out certain points of view on style issues. It is true, for example, that the author recommends only the four-in-hand tie knot, and not the questionable half-Windsor. I think that he makes a good case for the four-in-hand being better looking, anyway. You certainly won't go wrong following the author's conservative clothing advice.There is good information on wearing difficult clothes properly, such as the bow tie, handkerchief, etc. The book also describes how to buy clothes and judge their quality.I think that the style information could be expanded and spun-off into its own book. The shopping information could stand on its own as a travel guide quite well. I would reccommend this book, however. It seems to be the best of its kind."},{"Title":"Style and the Man: How and Where to Buy Fine Mens' Clothes","review":"While it's true that Flusser's book contains a guide to some of the most expensive menswear in the world, it's silly to downgrade the book for that reason. By telling you about suit construction, Flusser makes it possible to buy good cloths inexpensively by showing you what to look for. Admittedly the second part of this book is a guide to &quot;the best&quot; available, but it's still interesting to read and instructional even if I'll never buy a suit in Milan (and I won't)."},{"Title":"Style and the Man: How and Where to Buy Fine Mens' Clothes","review":"It's true there's too much of the book devoted to cities most of us will never visit. It's true that his first book (Clothes and the Man) was better. But it's also true that you must have this book for the definitive answer on dressing.I have numerous other books on style, and almost all of them reference Flusser at one point or another. You have to get the words straight from the horse's mouth. And even the shop reviews are good. You're likely to visit at least *one* of these cities in your life, right? Besides that, in this day and age stores have legs. The analyses of NY Barneys and Brooks Brothers easily translate. If you have any interest in dressing well and classic style, you really need this book above any other. And it looks great on your shelf."},{"Title":"Style and the Man: How and Where to Buy Fine Mens' Clothes","review":"This book, published in 1996 and half of which is a directory of shops, was bound to be outdated months after publication much less ten years after, as it is now. Hence the four stars instead of five.Given that, the first part of the book is crammed with a precis or summary of Flusser's recommendations that he has used several hundred pages to expound in his other books ('Clothes And The Man', 'Dressing The Man') and makes the book worth the (used) book price.I do not understand others who warn against this book because they think it is not objective enough! This is a book written by Flusser so of course you will get his subjective view. Had it been written by a committee of tailors, well then, I would expect a more balanced view, but it is not. It is up to the intelligent reader to understand they are getting a product of one man's opinion and then proceed accordingly."},{"Title":"Style and the Man: How and Where to Buy Fine Mens' Clothes","review":"Got to say this book rocks. Flusser writes in detail about all major components of a man's attire. He explains how to recognize a well made shirt, what makes a custom made shoe worthwhile and how to choose the right suit among others. Also others here have commented on the author's choice to include stores to buy fine mens wear as a detriment to the book. I kind of like it. I work in Manhattan and it's nice to have a (biased) view on what stores have what and the general flavor of the store. He of course lists the easily recognizable Madison Ave shops but he does have some select shops that specialize in specic things like shoes, cufflinks etc. Of course all these shops are pricey but some are not totally outrageous. This is not the book for those looking to skimp and save on garments but a book for those who want to be able recognize the best and consequently get a value for their money."},{"Title":"Style and the Man: How and Where to Buy Fine Mens' Clothes","review":"A bit dated ( 1996) at this point, but still good.

Flusser, a renowned expert,respected designer and prolific writer on men's apparel, opens with a discussion of what to wear, from casual dressing to formalwear, without missing a step in between. He has a definite point of view on men's fashion, favoring traditional English-style clothing rooted in the Anglo-American traditions of the 1930's and 1940's, but also recognizes different tastes. He then takes the reader on a city-by-city shopping tour of the best men's stores around the world. He reviews a number of stores in each major city, describing the shopping experience and the merchandise and highlighting the unique or noteworthy items which distinguish each store.

Dr. Robert Reimold-an internationally recognized expert in wetlands ecology and active participant in the Water Environment Federation (WEF), a worldwide non-profit technical and educational organization-has written and edited a significant volume on integrated environmental management. Developed for environmental engineers, planners, and managers; government policymakers; economic planners; and other key stakeholders, Watershed Management builds on the correct premise that many water quality and ecosystem issues are best addressed environmentally, financially, socially, and administratively at the watershed level rather than at the individual waterbody or specific discharger level. The watershed approach addresses environmental issues within natural hydrologically defined geographic areas, taking into consideration both surface and ground water flow. Important within the watershed approach is the cumulative impact of a wide variety of human activities and the prioritization of critical issues within a given watershed. Dr. Reimold points to work in the Chesapeake Bay and the Florida Everglades as two good examples of decisions being made and focused, integrated actions being taken on a &quot;whole drainage system&quot; basis rather than by controlling point sources of pollution only. Water Management spans case studies in the U.S., France, the Nile River basin, the Pacific rim, and former Soviet Union. The book contains a foreword by Dr. Eugene P. Odum. Dr. Odum, professor emeritus at the University of Georgia, is a recipient of the Crafoord Prize-an equivalent of the Nobel Prize-for excellence in ecology from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. It is well-annotated, subject-indexed, and authenticated quantitatively. Robert S.

This book covers seven lessons for women in the workplace. Each chapter of this book covers one lesson with practical advice, biblical insight, personal stories and examples, and a touch of humor. The seven lessons included are:Lesson 1: Career planning is your job - even if it's not on your job descriptionLesson 2: Organizational politics exist in every companyLesson 3: There's always a customerLesson 4: You are not defined by the title on your business cardLesson 5: Mentoring can be magical, but it's not manufacturedLesson 6: There's no such thing as too much integrityLesson 7: Your work impacts the Kingdom of GodEach of these chapters is very well organized and very well written.

[...]"},{"Title":"Succeed at Work Without Sidetracking Your Faith: 7 Lessons of Career Excellence for Women","review":"Reviewed by Cherie Fisher for Reader Views (9/06)Author Amy C. Baker gets to the heart of the matter for working Christian women - how to integrate faith into everyday work. Ms. Baker has taken 20 years of professional experience in human relations, communications and not for profit and turned it into an easy to follow blueprint for Christian women to follow. Often using her own work experience as an executive for Dell, a hugely successful company, she shows the reader that a person does not have to compromise their values or excellence to succeed in business. Every chapter is full of solid career advice, values and some very humorous examples of successful people who use these principles. Baker ends each chapter with things to think about and evaluate in our own lives.The 7 lessons of Career Excellence include:Career Planning is your job - even if it's not in your job description. People need to take responsibility for their own careers and not leave it up to the Human Resources Department. You are the only person who really knows your skills and successes.Organizational politics exist in every company. Stories of political maneuvering go back to the Bible and will always exist. It is up to us to work with the highest ethics and Christian values when confronted with office politics.There's always a customer. Who are your customers? Do you have a good relationship with them? Would they describe you as ethical and honest?You are not defined by the title on your business card. So many people get caught up in the ego world of job titles and we are so much more than just a job title.Mentoring can be magical, but not manufactured. It is important to choose mentors who represent the values that you hold close to you.There's no such thing as too much integrity. Integrity covers much more than just work decisions, it is based on what and how we say it, gossip or inappropriate talk, and even our appearance.Your work impacts the Kingdom of God. Every person in the workforce impacts the Kingdom of God, from the frontline fast food associate to the President of a company.Baker uses successful stories from women throughout the book beginning with the foreward by Supermodel Kim Alexis. Here is a high profile woman who stands by her Christian values in the tough fashion world. Other examples include many high profile women who face tough decisions in the workplace everyday and choose the Christian way. They prove that you can be highly successful and not be swayed away from your beliefs.This is a book that I would highly recommend for Christian women going into or already in the workplace. Amy Baker does a great job integrating Christian principles and overall excellence with the career path. I would like to coin a phrase from her book where she describes successful women from Biblical Stories by saying \\"You Go Girl!\\" right back to her.Book received free of charge."},{"Title":"Munchkins Remember","review":"This was the first Stephen Cox book I bought, way back in 1989.

Within 24 hours of beginning this plan, his blood sugars had plummeted to less than 1/3rd of what they'd previously been. We've had to reduce his insulin and medication already and we've only been doing this for 1.5 weeks! We are just so encouraged by these results that we're now highly motivated to stick with the plan.

When I purchased this book I was on insulin. I am a Type 2 diabetic and had huge swings in my blood sugar. Dr. Bernstein's book is a very easy. It is written in such a way that you want to continue. I began using the low carb principles on a very strict basis initially. The first week or so I felt awful but what was happening to my blood sugars were they were stabilizing. Approximately 5 days into this dramatic change in my diet, I did begin feeling better and continued to improve day by day. This is not a diet..it is a way of life. I have been insulin free for over 4 years now and over 30 pounds lighter. I eat frequent small meals. Occasionally, I get fooled by foods you buy on the run but quickly know something is not right. For example, I bought a frozen coffee at a local eatery. The drink was suppose to be sugar free. It was except for the \\"espresso syrup\\" they put in it. Whoa, I felt bad so quickly. I contacted the company to let them know they were advertising this incorrectly and it was dangerous for diabetics. Dr. Bernstein is right. After you have been doing this for awhile, you can taste the sugar in processed foods.

After trying his recommendations I can say with no reservations that this book may have saved my life! I highly recommend it to anyone who has pre-diabetes or diabetes and hope that the general medical community opens their eyes. After only one day of this diet my blood glucose readings were close to normal, and continue to stay there, with less medication.

Among those are:Extreme diet advice that forbids the consumption of whole fresh fruits, nuts, grains and even tomatoes; enthusiasm in prescribing troglitazone for t2 (which was recalled by the FDA); Anerobic over aerobic exercise; His explanations for the causes of complications( such as nepropathy and neuropathy) in the addenum at the back of the book have since been disproven since the 1997 edition.But barring that it does have alot of good practical info and his own life story is really a compelling drama in itself.

As a type 1 diabetic of 22.5 years, I have hemoglobin results in the 4.9-5.1 range through exercising (aerobic and anaerobic), frequent testing and a low-fat, high fibre diet. I consume 170g carbohydrates a day, and have a regular dessert every Saturday night. I just make sure that I exercise more, test more, and take extra insulin on that one day. Carbohydrates offer very valuable nutrients that cannot be found in protiens and fats, therefore, they should not be so severely restricted in this &quot;Atkins-style&quot; manner!Diabetic or not, everyone should consume a well balanced diet comprised of all three macronutrients. I think that his approach would be difficult for 90% of people because we instinctively crave certain types of carbohydrates. It does not cater to vegetarians at all, like myself! He also does not talk too much from a female diabetic's perspective-it is well known that diabetes is more difficult to control in such people becuse of monthly hormonal fluctuations. He also does not talk about blood sugar problems associated with hypothyroidism, even though it is more commonly found in type 1 diabetics. Also, we only have his word to go on-we do not know any of his patients or the long term results associated with such an unhealthy and unappetizing diet!

Apparently we can not cure diabetes but there is one solution I can attest to and that is Dr. Bernstein's solution. Normalizing blood sugars stop the damage from diabetes and can even reverse some to the damage the disease has done to the body.

After 8 months of following its low carbohydrate guidelines my A1C has dropped from 8.7 to an all-time low of 6.4 and my daily insulin dosage has decreased by almost 40% (both long-acting and fast-acting). I finally feel a measure of control over the disease and am slowly getting some respite from the constant frustration that unpredictable fluctuations in blood glucose measurements inevitably induce. I must add that I have not even been following the program very rigorously and have chosen to pass on some of its more drastic aspects (to me). I do admit that losing most of my carb-heavy comfort foods was difficult at first (and occasionally still is) but the payoff is really so staggering that I believe every diabetic should be exposed to this information as part of their healthcare education and shouldn't have to buy a book in order to obtain it."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"As a mew diabetic I found this book very helpful.He writes to the insulin dependent and to the new diabetic.I had to ignore the information to the insulin dependent andgo to the parts on the type II diabetic.His advice is definite and real.

During this time he has followed the ADA reccomended eating plan....sometimes strickly, sometimes ignoring it and eating whatever he liked. No matter what he did his blood sugars were always much higher than they should have been. NO ONE ever suggested he eat a low carb diet. We tried sugar busters...eating only low glycemic carbs...baked chicken w/o skin....watched his portions....all to no avail. He was on the highest limits of oral medication that is allowed. He was told that insulin was his next option. For us, insulin is not an option as he would lose his CDL, thus leaving us with no income. I recieved a copy of Dr. Bersteins's book about five weeks ago after reading about it on BloodSugar101.com. It has changed our life. Besides all the basic information it contained that I had never heard of before, it contained something we had lost. Hope. We now have hope that we can not only control his diabetes, but REVERSE the damage it caused. We are excited for the first time in 20 years that we can control this deadly disease. He has already been taken off two of his med's, Avandia and Onglyza. The two most expensive! We have no medical insurance so this is huge for us. Many times he went without meds because we simply could not afford them. He tests his BS several times a day now...without fear. He seems proud when it keeps going down even with less medication. He eats well, although we do need to get some new recipes. I am following the diet also and the best part is no hunger. I have lost about 12 pounds he has lost about 15. I see us eating this way forever. If you're facing blindness, or amputation....that's some mighty fine motivation! I pray that God blesses Dr. Bernstein for his obsession with controlling Diabetes.

They graciously allowed me to borrow it. Within a week, I bought my own book and started \\"to study the book\\". That's right- study- not just read it.Dr. Bernstein puts his clinic's phone number in the book several times. If you have a question, just call them and they will answer it for you. I wanted to know the most accurate blood meter on the market and they told me. My sister actually had Dr. Bernstein answer when she called.I followed his advice, and my sister seeing the way I was feeling better, then bought her own book. Her blood levels have been out of whack for over 5 years. That was in the fourth week of August. By the first week of January of 2010, EVERYTHING was back in the normal range for her and she has lost a substantial amount of weight.I went on January 22,2010 and had my bloodwork done. I went back to my doctor a week later to find her extremely excited. My tri. was down to 95- that's right 95!!! My A1C was down to 5.8 and my HDL was at 65.1 and my overall cholesterial was down over 100 points, plus as a side effect, I have lost 35.2 pounds. I call it a side effect because although I wanted to lose weight, it was not my main concern.She brought in an intern to learn what I was doing to accomplish my success. When she started saying the meds were the cause, I interuppted her to explain that with the exception of the metformin, I was not taking any other prescriptions. I told her it was do to Dr. Bernstein's book. She now is telling other patients to read the book.The doctor told me I should not \\"limit\\" myself by saying I could \\"never\\" eat a certain food again. I asked her if she would ever tell me to eat tree nuts since I am highly allergic to them. She said of course not, and I then asked her why she would tell me to eat foods that would cause my diabetes to rise causing more damage to my system. No answer.Anyway...This book and Dr.Bernstein has not only changed my life, it has saved my life."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"This is an updated edition of the original book of the same title.I read Dr Bernstein's original about 3 months after my T2 diagnosis & consider that it literally saved my life!Dr Bernstein's approach is to maintain blood glucose levels in the range of the normal non-diabetic (70-99mg/dl & HbA1c 4.5% to 6%), which most of the medical community doesn't even think possible, but it is.Glycosylated Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is the best (only really) indicator we have for the risk of diabetic complications as shown by two extensive long-term studies (DCCT & UKPDS) & Dr Bernstein's approach & method is to keep blood glucose & HbA1c well down into the normal non-diabetic range to minimize complication risk.Most of the medical community are satisfied with mediocre blood glucose & HbA1c goals that are still in the range that have elevated complication risk. Not Dr Bernstein!I consider this book an excellent education on diabetes, complications, & a \\"how to\\" for achieving those \\"normal non-diabetic blood glucose levels\\".This is a \\"must read\\" for all diabetics who don't want to wind up with blindness, kidney failure or limb amputations to mention just a few of the complications that are filling our hospitals."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"This book has absolutely reversed my Type 2 Diabetes by following Dr Bernstein's recommendations and regime.

They just keep increasing the meds and finially put me on insulin without much change. By throwing out the diet plan they gave me and following this book, I have seen overnight results. I've been right on target for a week now! I look forward to continue the book's advice and hopefully get off most of the medication I'm on.

This is certainly true when following any plan or program to manage your diagnosis. You must understand and experiment how your body will react based on your existing beta cells, pancreatic and liver function, other conflicting and supporting hormones etc. This book is completely open about these issues and about how to acheive basic control of your diabetes. Type 1, Type 2, Type 3 (hybrid types too) all types for that matter can use all of Dr. B's work. True it is a challenge to change your eating, exercise and social behaviors but it can be done. My heart goes out to vegetarians who have a harder time with more narrow options, but it can be done. This is not a program for rich people or poor people but sick people who will greatly benefit.

It gives a good primer on the basics of diabetes. Then it departs from much of the convention of diabetes treatment in terms of diet. Basically, Dr. Bernstein advocates a diet devoid of almost all carbohydrates (he \\"hasn't had a piece of fruit in 40 years\\"). His advice is based on techniques he has refined over 40+ years and they have obviously worked very well for him, a Type 1 diabetic who went much of his early life improperly treated. That he is still alive today is a testament to his regimen's efficacy. However, it is a truly Draconian approach that essentially strips most food-based pleasure from your life. Also, he advocates regular, strenuous exercise to build muscles (building muscles reduces insulin resistance). He is less interested in aerobic exercise, although he acknowledges its cardiovascular benefits if practiced strenuously (not a jog, but a demanding pace that begins (on a treadmill) at a slope that exhausts you in 20 seconds, then lowering the slope and continuing, etc). As in the anerobic exercise, he warns against rest periods. The idea is only through pain do you build muscles including those of the heart. I found the book very informative, but his techniques very scary. As an almost 70-year old man, I'm not sure I'm equal to his demanding regimen. I bet it works; but I don't know how much pleasure you'll get from living all those extra years if you're constantly craving starches and rest."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"May 22, 2010 was one of the worst days of my life.I knew something was wrong . I wasn't feeling well. At a company cookout a couple of weeks earlier I felt like I was going to pass out. I hadn't eaten that much, but I was guzzling soda all day. So on May 22 I took some very simple medical tests. My blood pressure was slightly high, but I was shocked to learn that my fasting blood glucose was 194. I was walking around in a daze. I had a close relative who suffered from diabetes in the latter stages of their life, and all I could think about was the constant finger sticking and insulin injections, the constant worry over going \\"too high\\" or \\"too low\\".Just to be sure, I did the same tests the very next day. This time my fasting b/gl was 214!I thought my life was over.I knew I had to do something, but I didn't want to start taking all sorts of medications. Luckily, a friend had once sent on an article about how diabetes can be treated through diet and exercise. Further research led me to Dr. Bernstein's book. It could probably be co-titled \\"Everything You Wanted to Know About Diabetes But Were Afraid to Ask\\".Even now, after many reads, I still find Dr. Bernstein's life story inspirational. I found the stories from his patients touching. The basic message of the book can be summed up in three words - go low carb! But it's so much more than that. Meal plans, med recommendations, exercise regimens - like I said, everything you need to know.On Memorial Day weekend that year I made up my mind to start my low-carb regimen. I gave up all sugary sodas and fruit juices, bread, wheat products, chips, and potatoes. It wasn't easy at first. Who knew how addicting sugar could be! Within two weeks my blood glucose was within normal range most of the time. I lost a lot of weight - I wasn't obese, but heavier than I wanted to be - and started to feel better. I had more energy, and slept better. A lot of little aches and pains disappeared.Two years have gone by and I'm still following Dr. Bernstein's recommendations. I'm not perfect. I sneak a cookie once in a while, or a pretzel. But I don't eat a whole bagful like I used to. And whenever I come across someone suffering from diabetes, I tell them about the Bernstein protocol.

The slower insulin response results in a post-parandial (after meal) \\"lag\\", where quickly digested carbohydrates elevate the blood sugar before insulin can catch up. Such temporary elevations of blood glucose undoubtedly occur. Dr. Bernstein argues that the resulting high blood sugars can cumulatively lead to the many complications of diabetes (including kidney disease, blindness, and more -- he is unsparing in his descriptions of these.) I am not entirely sure of the general medical community's stance on this is, but its is generally accepted that the closer to normal bllod sugars are ( i.e., lower hemoglobin A1c), the lower the risk of complications.Dr. Bernstein argues that current ADA (American Diabetes Association) guidelines are not stringent enough. (I belive they recommend A1c below 7%, while the International Diabetes Federation and American College of Endocrinology recommends Hb A1c values below 6.5%). His approach is \\"tough love\\"-like, arguing that people with diabetes should acheive normal blood glucose levels (i.e., A1c's of 4 to 5%?) by strictly limiting carbohydrate intake. This approach does run counter to the prevailing advice about balancing carbs, fats, and proteins. He spends some time railing against typical medical advice, though much of what he characterizes as typical medical advice seems to date from the 70's or earlier (maybe left over from earlier edition?)He also spends some time on kooky claims that undermine his message. For example, he advises that in preparing to measure blood glucose through a finger stick, \\"Don't wipe your fingers with alcohol; this will dry out the skin and eventually foster the formation of calluses.\\" Yet in the same section he advises changing the lancet used to prick the finger only one a month. He also claims that lower carbohydate intake places \\"less stress\\" on remaining functioning beta cells (the cells in the body which produce insulin) and thus will preserve their function, allowing even a type 1 diabetic to produce small amounts of insulin indefinitely. This is anecdotal at best -- how can \\"stress\\" on beta cells be quantified? And this has not been shown in any kind of study. Studies giving insulin to people susceptible to type 1 diabetes, but not yet diagnosed, showed that reducing the workload on beta cells (stress?) did NOT reduce the incidence of full blown diabetes. He also is not fan of insulin pumps, which HAVE been clinically shown to provide better control in children.Overall, I don't doubt that his solution works for those who use it, and if I had diabetes, I would probably try it. I think it would require considerable determination to eat according to his guidelines in our super-sized, corn-syrup-soaked world. I admire anyone who takes on such a total lifestyle change. I would recommend trying before you buy -- get it from the library, see if you think you could handle it and if so then go for it! and good luck!"},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"Dr Bernstein's book gives the diabetic everything needed to live with diabetes and to avoid complications.

I now am also gaining confidence in this book because Dr. Bernstein is someone who is prescribing for the reader's health what he learned, as a diabetic, from his own experience has been good for his own health. I personally choose to put myself in the hands of practitioners who really understand the human body and the road to wellness. Dr. Bernstein seems to be one of them.I am very thankful that he put in chapters on weight loss, and for curbing the craving of carbohydrates and overeating. Maybe someone can finally teach me and I'll be a non-diabetic who also profits from this book."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"Dr. Richard Bernstein probably knows more about managing diabetes than anyone who has ever lived. He has had Type 1 diabetes since age 12. He is now in his late 60's, still works full-time plus, exercises hours every day, and has more energy than most people of any age, with or without diabetes.At age 35, his body was falling apart due to the ravages of blood sugar. He had signs of kidney disease and eye disease and nerve pain in his legs.Then he discovered how to normalize his blood sugars through the program in this book. Most of his complications eventually disappeared, and he has had no new complications since. His theory (shared by most diabetes experts) is that the complications are due to high blood sugars. But his solution (keeping your blood sugars in the normal range 24 hours a day) is rejected by most doctors, who believe it is too difficult for most people.The three keys to his program are: A very-low carbohydrate diet - This is the most important part and will probably be helpful even without the other parts. Bernstein prescribes NO sugars, grains, fruits, milk, or starchy vegetables (fast-acting carbs.) He does recommend relatively small amounts of green vegetables and other slow-acting carbs, because of their vitamins and other nutrients. This is not an Atkins-style, no-carb diet.Frequent blood sugar monitoring to develop your \\"blood glucose profile.\\" You need to learn exactly how different foods affect your sugars, and how sugars change overnight and with exercise. By checking his blood sugars after each food he ate, Bernstein discovered how carbs raised his blood sugar faster than his injected insulin could catch up. He has you check your blood sugar many times a day.Frequent dosing with fast-acting insulin or (for Type 2s) an insulin-sensitizing pill, to cover your meals, along with a low dose of long-acting insulin to get you through the night and early morning hours. He recommends insulin even for Type 2's who make some of their own, because he believes the injected insulin will take the pressure off the pancreas and allow it to heal.If this sounds like a difficult program, you haven't heard half of it yet. He also recommends extremely vigorous, anaerobic exercise. He prefers prolonged weight or resistance training to the point of pain, because building muscle mass helps soak up blood sugar and lessens insulin resistance.His program also requires you to counts carbs and proteins and calculate your proper insulin dose before meals. He recommends you have as many as four different kinds of insulin for different occasions. He wants you to floss after every meal to prevent dental infections. And there's a lot more.But is it worth it? In researching my upcoming book, \\"The Politics of Diabetes,\\" I have interviewed four people who read his book. Two thought it was too hard to try. One stayed with the program for a while and says it helped, but he has slacked off. One woman stuck with it and says it saved her life.Diabetes experts I have queried are skeptical of how much the ultra-low-carb diet helps. They cite conflicting research and the success many patients have even on a balanced diet that includes fair amounts of carbs.There is also no agreement on the need to get blood sugars down to \\"normal\\" (less than 95, say.) Many docs think getting sugars down to 120 or even 140 will be sufficient to prevent complications in most people. True, but SOME people will get complications that would not have gotten them if they kept their sugars lower.You have to have some education and a lot of self-confidence to take this on, especially as it may mean educating your doctor as well. There is a steep learning curve, and this program will probably totally take over your life for the first weeks or even months. As you get used to it, it becomes less intrusive, but still much more so than the usual programs your doctor may put you on. It comes down to how important your health is to you, how much time and money you have to devote to your diabetes care, and especially how much support you have.Bernstein is aware of these difficulties. He consistently advises lower-cost alternatives to various medications and equipment, which makes him one of the few docs or self-help writers to recognize that money is a problem for many of us. But the book is a demanding read - densely packed with valuable information on everything from insulin injection and blood glucose checking techniques to the different kinds of oral diabetes medicines, from what to do when you're vomiting (call your doctor immediately!) to pages of low-carb recipes. The language and style probably work best for people with some college education, although a determined high school graduate could handle it. It also has a number of inspiring testimonials and a good sense of humor.I think that people who are having trouble managing their diabetes might want to try this program, or at least the low-carb diet part of it. If you want to do the whole thing, this book by itself won't be enough. You will need to get the help of a doctor and probably a diabetes educator as well, and having some supportive family wouldn't hurt.If you do try it, I support that decision. I'd like to hear how you do with it."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"Amazon delivered my copy of \\"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution (Revised &Updated) The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars\\" and I've had acouple of days to digest the contents. This isn't a review, per se, but afew points on some interesting parts of the book.First off, the foundation of the book is that having \\"normal blood sugars\\"will eliminate 100% of the complications of diabetes. Extrapolating fromthe results of the NDDT, Bernstein asserts that diabetics must keep theirblood glucose levels between 80-100mg/dl ALL OF THE TIME.Specifically, knowing that non-diabetics will very rarely have blood glucoseexcursions are outside 80 to 100mg/dl, Bernstein's targets are 85mg/dl fornon-insulin dependent diabetics and 90 mg/dl for insulin dependentdiabetics. To achieve this target, Bernstein recommends a low-carbohydratediet combined with insulin-sensitizing and mimetics agents and/or insulin.The book starts off with the requisite \\"Bernstein has worked for me\\"profiles and has an interesting account of Bernstein's life, including hisearly attempts at blood glucose monitoring (he is believed by many to haveinvented the concept of using blood glucose testing for diabetic bloodglucose control) and his decision to attend medical school so that he mightbe able to get his findings published.Bernstein believes that sensitizers & mimetics such as metformin, Avandia &Actos are the best choices for lowing blood glucose because they increasethe body's ability to use insulin without making the pancreas produce extrainsulin. Additionally, aside from the fact that sulfonylureas stimulateinsulin production, Bernstein avoids them because they can causehypoglycemia.Insulin use gets over seventy pages and has what appears to be someexcellent information in calculating dosages for an intensive insulinregimen that keeps the blood glucose very close to 90mg/dl even after meals.Bernstein advocates using regular insulin instead of a rapid-acting insulinsuch as lispro or aspart before each meal. He reserves rapid-acting insulinfor special situations such as dining-out.He is not an insulin pump fan and does not believe that pumping gives bettercontrol over a properly executed intensive insulin regime.Regarding the appropriate blood sugar and HbA1c levels, Bernstein assertsthat values exceeding 75mg/dl on average increases risk of cardiac and allother causes of death, however, he does not reference the research thatsupports this claim.The book winds up with 40 pages of low-carbohydrate recipes. I have triedsome of the recipes and they were good. It's interesting to me exactly howvery low carb they are. It would be difficult to put together a completemenu with more than 10g carbs per serving. Quite a contrast to this month's\\"Diabetes Forecast\\" meatloaf dinner with whipped potatoes clocking in atover 70g carbs per serving!An appendix does a good job defending a diet higher in protein & fat anddoes cite relevant research.On top of all of this information, Bernstein includes some good informationon how to deal with hypoglycemia, how to receive the proper care inhospitals and what tools diabetics should have in their kit.SUMMARYI found the book to be very interesting and informative. I'm not sure thatI agree with keeping my blood glucose at a flat 80mg/dl, but much of theinformation in the book is invaluable. This, along with Gretchen Becker's\\"The First Year: Type 2 Diabetes\\" are the two books I recommend to thosewho ask me about diabetes."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"One of the things you learn with Dr. Bernstein's book is that excessive eating (even when you don't overeat carbs, but other food types) leads to high sugars, due to the so-called \\"Chinese Restaurant Effect\\". Well, if you were to devour this hefty book (like you will, once you get your hands on it) you will not see your blood sugar rise. If you are a diabetic (type I or II), you will find in Dr. Bernstein's book a wealth of information that will answer the questions you've ALWAYS had, and even those that you didn't know you had, about diabetes and how to keep your blood sugars in control.His approach is very unconventional (coming from a diabetic childhood, being an engineer first and a doctor later in life). But you will be fascinated with the amount of \\"Eureka!\\" moments throughout the book. I was unable to put it down from the moment I picked it up, and I am grateful to him for having taken the time to share so much wisdom from his years as a practitioner and from his many, many years as a diabetic and experimenter. His lessons are not easy to follow, but they are the way for those who want to live a long and healthy life with diabetes.I leave you with a thought. If you knew what you need to do to prolong your life and live it in a healthy manner, in spite of what you've been told about typical lifespans in diabetics and all the ailments we seem to be bound to suffer later in life, wouldn't you do it? I would. And I hope you do too.

They stay there even after I eat, which is the real blessing, as there is no spiking of blood sugars. Not only has that happened, but I am loosing weight. I no longer have gas and chest pains that are caused from gas. If you are a type I or II, this is really a Diabetes Solution. As I see it, its a painful death, or a rich healthy life. Guess which one I picked?CheersDennis DeLaurierRound Rock Texas"},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"This book has changed my life. I am a type I diabetic and have been for 15 years. My wife (many thanks to her) found this book for me and since I've read it and started following the diet and exercise (primarily diet) regimen my blood sugars are near normal. Routinely, my blood sugars would elevate over 300 mg/dl after eating carbohydrates, which the America Diabetes Association recommends as 60% of your diet. Subsequent to reading this book, I've cut my carb intake to, as he prescribes, 6 mg in the morning and 12 mg at lunch and at dinner. By doing this I have been able to completely stabalize my blood sugars day and night. With my blood meter I can see what my average blood sugars have been over the past couple of months. Before I started my average was around 240 mg/dl...not too good. But, within 4 weeks of following this diet I was able to drop my average to 174 mg/dl. And, this is still falling toward 100 mg/dl where my blood sugars reside most of the time. I do crave carbs sometimes but the benefits definitely outweigh the short term cravings. Where I thought I was destined to die an early and not so happy death from complications with diabetes, I now am lifted by the hope and knowledge that I can live well into my 90's by following this simple plan. Thank you Dr. Bernstein, I owe you my life."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"I saw Dr. Bernstein speak in 1998 and it completely changed the way I treat people with diabetes. Since that time, I have seen phenomenally better results. Though it is true the book is highly anecdotal, it is always right on in my experience. Dr. Bernstein is an incredibly humble and honorable person as well, a true critical thinker, who questions without belligerence for the truth about diabetes.This book is a must for everyone who treats people with diabetes, and for everyone with diabetes."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"For the 18 years I have been a Type 1diabetic, I have not found a more comprehensive source of information on diabetes, which has often frustrated me. This book gives a very thorough picture of the issues related to diabetes, and not only as it relates to diet. It even encompasses things like foot care and other issues diabetics might face. The book was somewhat scary to me as I finally understood what my average blood sugars read (A1c tests) and I found that my own average was 200. I am finding that my insulin use is not great for control, and that this diet is likely to get me there. I am somewhat uncomfortable with the low carb thing, but having tried it for the past week, I find it to be not so bad, and my blood sugar levels are decreasing. My doctor handed me this book, and insisted I try it. What I especially like is the detailed information on how to adjust insulin based on your own metabolism. This is information no one has bothered to discuss with me all this time."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"Unlike the ADA advice my doctor and the diabetes educators gave me, this book works.I have normal blood sugars, my cholesterol and triglycerides are normal again, and I am no longer spilling protein in my urine.I have lost 70 pounds and kept it off.My A1C results at 4.8% are very much in the non-diabetic range.Better than all that, I can feel my feet again.I had diabetic neuropathy that made my feet numb and I did not even realize it before.With my blood sugars staying between 80 and 100, the feeling has been returning to my feet and the numbness is fading.Dr. B, my little girl will thank you when she is old enough to understand that you saved her daddy's life!Get this book."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"Diabetes is a disease that used to only afflict young children when Type 1 was so dominant. But now it's the 21st Century and Type 2 diabetes hasn't just risen, but exploded into a full-fledged epidemic as one of the biggest health threats of our day. What's really scary is the fact that the problem is expected to get that much worse over the next few decades. Yikes!In 1997, Dr. Richard K. Bernstein first introduced what would become the pinnacle diabetes bible to the world when he published the first edition of The Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars. Controversial, against the grain, but extremely effective, the low-carbohydrate dietary approach to treating diabetes has never been more clearly explained.Now, Dr. Bernstein has revised and expanded his classic bestselling book to make it even better than it was when it released a decade ago. As a man who has lived with Type 1 diabetes since childhoood, he knows from whence he speaks and now wants to help others find the \\"solution\\" that he dicovered a long time ago.Controlling diabetes as much as possible without little to no use of insulin or medications is the goal of The Diabetes Solution. While the American Diabetes Association (ADA) feels good about recommending a high-carb, low-fat diet (which requires HIGHER doses of insulin and prescription diabetes drugs), Dr. Bernstein believes that is the wrong way to go about managing blood sugars.Written in a very informative and entertaining style, this book answers all those little nagging questions diabetics may have about this method of treatment, including the uniquely damaging role of carbohydrate in the diet, what the best pharmaceuticals and how they can help, a comprehensive look at the various types of insulin and which should be used, and what to do to manage your disease naturally.Is low-carb dieting controversial? Sure. But so are a whole lot of other things that we used to think were strange, but now they're normal years later after much research has proven them to be true. The same goes for the low-carb lifestyle as a treatment option for diseases like diabetes and aiding in weight loss. The science is catching up to a reality that Dr. Bernstein unveiled years ago.I personally lost nearly 200 pounds on this way of eating. Although I don't have diabetes, it runs in my family and I was borderline when I weighed over 400 pounds. But then I started a low-carb diet in 2004 and changed my life forever. Dr. Robert C. Atkins, like Dr. Bernstein, was also before his time espousing the benefits of livin' la vida low-carb.Living with diabetes need not be a hopeless situation where you feel all alone. Dr. Bernstein has The Diabetes Solution and wants you to experience the freedom that comes from knowing you can beat your diabetes. Never give up the hope for a better life, even with diabetes.Dr. Bernstein, we salute you for your contribution to diabetes management and low-carb living. You should be honored and hailed for standing up for what you know is right and refusing to just settle for the failed methods for treating your diabetes. I think your life speaks for itself. CONGRATULATIONS!"},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"I'm a 41 year old male and have recently been diagnosed with pre-diabetes (whatever it is called), with diabetes running in the family, so to get up to speed on the subject I ordered a pile of books (12 of them) off Amazon including this one. I've been through them all and this one I found the best in its explanations of the various aspects of the condition, the various treatments, and many other relevant details.Dr Bernstein was an engineer with type 1 diabetes and became a doctor to be able to help others with his experiences and findings; he conveys intimate and detailed knowledge about the condition and all its aspects, and generally impresses with the information he provides.The diet is not exactly appetising plus its very time consuming to have to calculate food details all the time I guess (not having tried it and not hoping to have to try it for awhile), however I will always keep this book in my bookcase &quot;just in case&quot; - if I do get diabetes and complications occur, I will grab this book and give it a shot. Because it is more believable than most of the other stuff out there, for the reason that it comes from someone who found out all of this himself, then became living proof of his own theory.I would buy this book initially for the descriptions of how diabetes works, how the treatments work and what the various dangers are, exercises provided, etc. - it is well worth its cost for this information alone. Secondly, the diet may come in handy in case of complications etc. and if other treatments don't work.And Dr Bernstein does indeed answer the phone himself as another writer also mentioned - I called just before opening hours and sure enough got to talk to the man himself."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"I was always scared to cut carbs out of my diet, because it seems like there has been some negative press for doing so. But, as Dr. Bernstein notes in his book, you never hear of \\"essential carbohydrate.\\" Essential fats? Yes. Essential proteins? Yes.Within 1 week of reading the first 1/3 of the book, my blood sugars have not gone above 120 or below 70. And I feel great. And I'm losing weight.If you want to get better control of your diabetes, reverse Type II (adult-onset) diabetes, or avoid ever getting diabetes, this is the absolute best investment you will ever make. Dr. Bernstein (the author) is a Type I diabetic. He puts in the book what he has been doing to save his own life, and he has had diabetes for 60 years now. The doctor you see for your regular checkups? Unless he is diabetic, he is more worried about his lawn's health than he is your health.Get the truth from the man who has had the disease for 60+ years, understands the disease, and is on your side."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"(Newly revised and updated)Dr. Bernstein is a diabetic himself, diagnosed in 1946 at age 12. Over the years he has developed his own special way of keeping his blood sugar levels at appropriate levels, which managed to keep him healthy and from suffering many of the standard serious health problems associated with diabetes. He believes in arming patients with information to control their disease themselves. This book covers new oral medications, new insulins, and new dietary supplements. Bernstein's views differ from the American Diabetes Association, particularly in his recommendation of a low carbohydrate diet, avoidance of certain types of oral medications, and using nutrients to lower insulin resistance.This very complete book includes some patient stories, chapters on the basics, tests, how and when to measure blood sugar, treatments, diet, weight loss, exercise, insulin information, and recipes. There is an excellent glossary and an index, in addition to useful appendices. Well written and easy to understand, it is over 500 pages of useful information.Some important and surprising statistics:-- 25% of Americans between age 65 and 74 are Type 2 diabetics.-- One in three babies born in the year 2000 will develop diabetes during their lifetimes.-- Every day 1,400 people are diagnosed with diabetes.-- It is third leading cause of death (and contributes to high blood pressure, heart disease, infections, that also are factors in deaths).Armchair Interviews says: It is very important to know about this disease."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"I got Dr. Bernstein's book for my husband, a Type 2 diabetic. It has helped him enormously. I have used it, along with Atkins' books, to help both of us lose weight. Dr. Atkins' books stress that you MUST check your basal body temperature before and during a low-carb diet, to make sure that your thyroid levels are normal, and remain normal. Low thyroid levels will cause weight gain, high cholesterol, and higher blood sugar. Both my husband and I have thyroid problems, which CAN be exacerbated by a low-carb diet. Sometimes you will know you have a problem when you feel cold a lot. The solution can be as simple as exercising, taking thyroid supplements, slightly increasing your carb intake, or a combination of all three.Lower carbs WILL decrease your total cholesterol, and dramatically decrease your triglycerides. As a personal example, several weeks ago, after a stressful summer, I had a total cholesterol reading of 204. I went on a lower-carb diet for 2 weeks, and then donated blood. My total cholesterol then was 154, a drop of 50 points in 2 weeks. By the way, if you donate blood every 2 months, you will get a mini-physical each time, including total cholesterol, to help keep you on the straight and narrow road while dieting."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution (2007) is a major work on the state of diabetes research and practice. It covers everything from the types of diabetes to the loading of insulin syringes. It describes relevant medications, vitamins and supplements and provides dietary menus. It also includes several appendices, a glossary and two indices.Richard K. Bernstein was a pioneer in the modern treatment of diabetes. A Type I (juvenile onset) diabetic, he struggled with the treatment methods of his day and found himself becoming progressively worse while being assured that he was doing well. His physicians were basically expecting him to die at an early age like so many had done before him.Obtaining an early version of the glucometer, Bernstein studied his own changes in blood sugar levels and based his insulin usage on the meter readings. He gradually learned what caused his blood sugar to increase or decrease and managed to regulate these levels. Then he wrote a paper on his methodology, which was submitted to -- and rejected by -- every medical journal that he thought might be interested.Eventually, Bernstein convinced a few people to try his approach. Then he entered medical school and became a physician himself. He started his own diabetic practice and continued to lead the field in diabetic treatment for decades.One of the factors underlying Bernstein's problems was the advice provided by the American Diabetes Association. Unless things have changed recently, their recommendations are directly contradicted by Bernstein's findings. Personally, I would trust Bernstein and my physician over the ADA.Bernstein puts the responsibility for controlling diabetes on the patients themselves. Individuals must monitor their blood sugar levels rather that depending on periodic visits to their physicians. However, the medical profession has a very crucial role to play in the treatment of diabetes.Your physician should know more about diabetes than you do. Reading the lifelong dedication of Bernstein to tracking information on related subjects should suggest the time and effort required to become expert in this field. If your physician does not keep up with the latest advances, find a new physician. Just don't try to do it yourself.I am a Type II diabetic with hypertension and a history of congestive heart failure. Because of my cardiac problems, my treatment for diabetes is somewhat different than for those without such problems. Thus, my experiences with diabetes medications differs from others.As an example of interaction with your physician, consider six medications mentioned in this book. All are still on the market, but later data and changes in my health have influenced their application in my diabetic treatment. These medications are metformin (Glucophage), pioglitazine (Actos), rosiglitozone (Avandia), glyburide (Diabeta), glipizide (Glucotrol), and sitagliptin (Januvia).Metformin is still the primary blood sugar control medication for Type II diabetes. Both my daughter and myself use it in the manner and dosages described by this book. My daughter's endocrinologist prescribes a higher dose of this medication than does my physician, but both of us are within the limits described herein. However, my dosage has gone up and her's has gone down, especially during her pregnancies.Both pioglitazone and rosiglitozone have been prescribed for myself, but discontinued because of the side effects, including those for cardiac conditions. Such interactions are mentioned in the book, but are scattered throughout the text.Glyburide is mentioned in the book, but the insulin-like effects that can force hypoglycemia are not stated. My physician discontinued this medication and substituted glipizide instead.Glipizide is also mentioned in the book. It has similar effects, but does not drive blood sugar levels as low as glyburide (or insulin).Sitagliptin is a fairly new medication which is mentioned twice in the book, but not is any great detail. My physician has recently prescribed this drug, but I have not noticed any significant changes.These examples strongly suggest the need for individuals to consult with their physicians. Explain your problems to your doctor and listen to their advice. If your physician won't listen to you, find one who does!Like all medical texts, however, this book was probably outdated before it hit the streets. Medical knowledge has grown by leaps and bounds, so the information in this book cannot be considered the last word in diabetes treatment. The website supporting this book would be a better source of current information, but it was apparently never intended to be such a resource.This work -- like all medical texts -- is concerned with application, not theory. Classical medicine was based on the disproved humors theory, which often killed the patients rather than cured them. But current DNA theory is beginning to turn biology into a science rather than a speculation. Yet the Human Genome Project only mapped the genes and complete knowledge of the human genome is still forthcoming.Research into human genes has produce detailed information about some genetic processes and disorders, but the genetic basis of diabetes is not yet clear. When better information is discovered and communicated, this book probably will be updated. Nonetheless, future editions will never be current with the latest research. Hopefully, Bernstein or others will establish a website for new information.This book is a Very good overview of both Type I and Type II diabetes, but the devil is in the details. Have a physician supervise and advise you in your treatment plan.Highly recommended for diabetics and for anyone related to diabetics. Do not consider it as the final word, but use it to shape questions for your physician.-Bill Jordin"},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"I have done a lot of research on diabetes at the library and on the internet after I was diagnosed Type 2 in Aug 2007. I saw the dietician/nutritionist recommended by my doctor and also real a ton of information on the internet and many books from the local library. My fasting blood sugar when I was diagnosed was 311. I was able to get it down to 110 - 120 level after dieting, exercising, and eating the things recommended by the dietician. My problem was my levels were erractic up and down even when eating the same diet.I saw Dr. Bernstein's book was highly recommended by Amazon readers, so I took the chance and bought the book. After reading that a diet of high proteins and very, very low carbs would help stabilize my blood sugars, I decided to try it. To my amazement, I started gettings readings in the mid 80's and the levels stopped spiking up and down. Carbs were my problem. Dr. Bernstein recommends an ideal reading of 83 and that is now my target.This book should be a must read for all diabetics, both Type 1 and Type 2 people. My motto is \\"you can die from diabetes or learn to live with it,\\" and I chose to learn to live with it. This book is a great learning tool and coupled with exercise (including weight training), weight loss and proper diet, you can control what happens to your body. It worked for me with results immediately.Highly, highly recommended. If you have a friend or relative with diabetes, BUY this book for them. The author (Dr Berstein) is still a practicing physcian specializing in diabetes treatment. He is also a Type 1 diabetic. Dr Berstein's experiences lead to this book being published.

At first, I wasn't sure that it would be doable, however within in month I was losing weight without being hungry, by putting Dr Bernstein's recommendations into practice. My blood glucose readings were also improved. The HBA1C was reduced from 7.9% in one month and then in May it was 5.3%. I have also lost 30lb in weight. Now 8 month later, I have BGL reading in the 80-90s.Dr Bernsteins book contains pretty much all the tools and information to help a motivated person take charge of their health. I, like many others, have diligently followed the usual suspects, like the ADAs recommendations, without seeing improvement in my health, just getting fatter and fatter and sicker.This is the only program that I have found that gets results.

Years ago, Dr. Bernstein realized that what he ate affected his blood sugar levels, contrary to the belief of the medical establishment at that time. Following his example, you can test your blood sugar with your meter and analyze the effects of various foods and of your medications. I have done that and have found that I don't have to be as restrictive with my diet as Dr. Bernstein is in his. Also, I have been able to reduce the amount of insulin that I inject.After following a lot of his suggestions, I feel so much better: I have lost the tiredness and hunger that I felt before. It's really great. I have achieved tight blood sugar control, which puts me in a small percentage of diabetics.

Ofcourse the idea is low carb and moderation and I think is the only solution for the diabetics.I do have one comment for people writing giving bad reviews. I respect everyon's opinion but if a person is not a doctor and is not diabetic, pretty much they do not know what they are talking about and what a diabetic has to go through to fight this battle. They do not have the knowledge nor the experience. An ideal person to write a review would be a doctor who is suffering from diabetes. But this is just my opinion.thanks"},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"I am a registered nurse with a diabetic daughter. I thought I knew everything there was to know about diabetes until I read Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution. It has literally changed my daughters life. This is a must read for anyone who is diabetic, has a diabetic family member, or cares for anyone who has diabetes."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"This is a much updated version of his already excellent first edition.In this edition he shows even less restrain in going against the ADA \\"Party Line\\". Maybe because since the first edition there are now several studies clearly showing the benefits of a low carbohydrate diet for everybody, especially diabetics. The good doctor names names, always telling why he is doing so.In this edition he doesn't praise the \\"glycemic index\\" anymore, the only not so good recommendation in his first book.My father was diagnosed diabetic six years ago. I gave him a copy of the previous edition of this book and a glucose meter. His life changed. He not only has excellent health with little medication, he also learned to so some \\"controlled extravagancies\\" and can eat and drink at parties and events. The he loaned the book to a friend of my brother that reversed his diabetes, sex life included. He even founded a self-help group in his hometown.If you are diabetic, has a loved one who is or if you have \\"metabolic syndrome\\", that is, is a diabetic in the making, STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING, GET AND READ THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"I was diagnosed with prediabetes in the fall of 2007, after having suffered from severe and debilitating chronic fatique and nerve pain for almost a year. When I started checking my blood sugars, I was shocked to see how high they were and immediately started looking for a diet that could help me bring those numbers down. My doctor had recommended a low carb diet, so I looked here at Amazon and found Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution. I started his diet in October of 2007.My blood sugars immediately came down, and my cholesterol and triglycerides have normalized -- total cholesterol has dropped from 241 to 172, LDL dropped from 161 to 94, HDL rose from 51 to 61, triglycerides dropped from 143 to 85. The nerve pain in my arm is now clearing up, I believe I had diabetic neuropathy and did not even know it before.Dr. Bernstein's diet is not hard to follow, once you reduce your carb intake your carb cravings will diminish and you really don't miss the carbs. And your energy levels will skyrocket so you will have the ability to exercise again! Diabetes management that seemed impossible before will suddenly become possible again!I'm so happy I found Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution -- he has literally given me back my life!!"},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"This is the third book by Dr. Bernstein that I have read and it's seems impossible but each one of his books has more and more to offer. If you have Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes, you absolutely must read this book.I read the first edition, about 6 years ago. It saved my husband's life. My husband is a type 2 diabetic. After seeing his doctor faithfully every 3 to 6 months for 20 years and taking his medications, he became more and more ill. He was at a point of taking 43 units of insulin a night, could hardly walk more than 75 or 100 feet, weighed 270 pounds, his Hemoglobin A1c was 11, he was always tired out, depressed and hell to live with.After reading Dr. Bernstein's book, I knew that my husband could be helped. I put him on a program of low carb and exercise and the results were nothing short of a miracle. He has been off (completely off!) of insulin for over 3 years, he walks 2 miles at the local gym every day, has energy to burn and has lost 80 pounds! His HA1c is 6.5. Best of all he is back to being himself. He is happy again and so am I. We are going into our 5th year of low carb lifestyle and exercise daily. Something I never would have dreamed of doing before reading Dr. Bernstein's book.Dr. Bernstein is one of the voices in the wilderness. His book clearly explains what you need to do to overcome this disease and he should know - he has been a Type 1 diabetic since the age of 12 years old.Dr. Bernstein was an engineer in his earlier years. He approached diabetes through the eyes of an engineer, working the problem until he came up with a solution. The medical profession would not listen to him (and why would they - when they get a diabetic patient, they and the pharmaceutical companies have a patient for life!). When he was 45 years old, he went back to school and became a physician!The American Diabetes Association recommends a diet of 60% carbohydrates!!!! That is absolutely wrong! Dr. Bernstein can explain it to you. Read this book. Save your life or the life of someone you love.I would give this book 10 stars if that rating was available to me."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"This book is the perfect companion for Dr. Bernstein's \\"The Diabetic Diet - the Low-Carbohydrate Solution.\\" Reading both these books over and over help me stay on track. I can already see what following Dr. B's recommendations has done for me. I am losing weight, I have more energy, and I have improved blood glucose readings. I don't want to wait until I have Diabetes 2 to be healthier, because I my liver is already diseased from being insulin resistant. By the way, the cheese cake recipe is delicious. Who needs sugar when food can taste so good without it?"},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"I am a member of the Skeptics Society, so I am no friend of \\"alternative\\" medicine, quackery, conspiracy theories, etc. But, in the case of diet and diabetes medicine, it's the establishment-- ADA, AMA, US Dept. of Agriculture, etc. that are the quacks. A charge of \\"Conspiracy\\" is a bit extreme, but the processed food industry, Big Agra, Big Pharma, and miss-informed medical professionals all have a vested interest in the status quo.With mounting scientific evidence that blood sugar control through low-carb is superior to high-carb/low fat, the ADA, etc., have changed their criticism to \\"Well, it may work, but it's a diet that no one can adhere to...\\"Bernstein's detractors seem to be saying, \\"But life-saving measures are soooooo inconvenient! (Translation: \\"Eat what you want, then inject yourself with 'industrial strength' shots of insulin!\\")I haven't seen any scientific studies of rate of adherence to ADA-type recommendations, but how many people do you know who lose weight permanently on these diets? The first winner of \\"The Biggest Loser\\" is now as heavy ever. One website did an extrapolation from the scant data on the success rate of a popular for-profit weight reduction club that uses a diet aligned with the current US Food Pyramid. Result: only 2 out of 1,000 members reach their goal and maintain it for 6 months. Could a low-carb diet be any worse?Following Dr. Bernstein's recommendations, I maintain normal blood sugar 24/7 without insulin or drugs. I probably would no longer be flagged as diabetic by many tests. A low carb diet is a bit monotonous, but it completely removes my cravings for sweets. On the ADA diet, I was constantly fighting urges for baked goods and snacks.Bernstein's recommendation of frequent monitoring of blood sugar, rather than being inconvenient, is instead highly motivational. Most people on diets rely on the occasional sudden drop in weight measured on a scale for positive feedback. I have frequent daily glucose readings to reinforce my commitment to healthy (Yes, healthy!) eating and lifestyle. (Incidentally, the AMA was once violently opposed to allowing diabetics to monitor their own glucose with meters. Go figure...)Dr. Bernstein's books are not for someone who wants to shed pounds quickly by following a regimen for a short period of time. It's for people who realize they have a life-threatening condition and are seriously committed to responding to that threat no matter how \\"inconvenient\\" that may be."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"Dr. Bernstein's book will result in lowering your blood glucose level. However, it is extremely difficult to follow -- he recommends only 6 grams of carbs for breakfast, and 12 grams for lunch and dinner, no fruits of any kind, only a few slices of lettuce & avocado. Absolutely no grains or cereals or pasta or bread of any kind. So basically, if you follow his strict diet, you'll be eating lean protein with 1/2 cup of broccoli or lettuce, and 2 nuts. Is that possible? Maybe, if you're a zealot with no human cravings for rice or bread or pasta EVER.I found a lot of useful information in this book though, such as his exercising program -- he states aerobic exercises are of no value to diabetics, which I found very revolutionary. Instead, he recommends resistance anaerobic training, inverse-pyramid method. I have tried this exercise out, and sure enough, it is a lot more difficult than walking or running for 30 minutes. But it does appear to build more muscle.I felt depressed rather than hopeful after reading this book. To not be able to ever eat an apple or a piece of fruit is depressing. I can deal with not having a pie, cake, chocolate or cookies. But to snack on a sugar-free Jello with 1 tablespoon of whip cream for the rest of my life surely sucks and makes me wish for a cure instead of having to follow this impossible low-carb diet.Read this book for what it's worth -- it has very good information & a personally inspiring story but I am not sure if you'll feel very hopeful after reading it in terms of managing your diabetes for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"For anyone struggling to maintain normal blood sugars, this book is a must!!

Bernstein's diet will change your life. I was always tired and always in the kitchen looking for more food. Now that I know what to eat and what to avoid, my energy level is super high. I used to plop on the sofa and need a break every day, but now I am looking for things to do. I expect my next A1C to be well below 6%, even after quitting metformin 1000mg x2 daily.Most importantly, I showed this diet to my primary care doctor using my kindle notes from this book (his Diabetes Diet version) and he agreed with it completely. This includes agreeing that high protein diets do not cause kidney problems. I quit the metformin a few days after leaving his office because of the improvement in my BS. I started this diet after the doctor visit and my BS readings went down to the 80's and even a few 70's.Avoiding carbs is not difficult once you experience the full feeling and high energy levels that this diet will provide.Take the time to learn something new and change those life long carb habits.Talk to your doctor before starting a new diet. Show your doc the Appendix of this book that explains why low carb/high protein is okay."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"Dr Bernstein communicates in an unfussy, understandable manner. His achievements are impressive, but he has not lost the common touch. His was not the first book on diabetes I bought, but it (together with his diet book), are the only two I still retain. When I bought my first computer I bought armfuls of manuals on how to become proficient in using it. This is the sort of person I am. I imagined, when I was diagnosed, that I would be building up a big diabetes library, that I would need this to become in control of my disease. It is a testament to the completeness of Dr Bernstein's books that I rely wholly on them. Quite simply he has gone through it all, and done it all for you, in a much more thorough way than more than a handful of very determined and motivated people ever could have. Bookshop shelves are heaving with diabetes diet books written by chefs, with the advice of some nutritionist, the advice summarily added, I often feel, in the most summary and cynical manner, to get the magic \\"D\\" word added to the title, which will make the title sell. There is a lot of commercial interst around diabetes, on the periphery, trying to push in, with little concern for the outcome, if commerce is achieved. Dr Bernsteins book eminates from the heart of the diabetes experience; his motivation survival, not money. This book stands so clearly apart from the others that anyone who has or cares for someone with diabetes should buy it. Like me, you may find that it becomes your benchmark in assesing all other diabetes media that you encounter, and you might realise that before you read it you had no real critical faculty for assesing diabetes advice, and were vulnerable to anyone looking to make a quick buck."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"As with his first book, this book has more great information for me as a Type 2 Diabetic. Although my wife is not diabetic, we love ALL the recipe's in both books. They have kept my blood sugar in total control and are delicious! Thanks Dr. Bernstein!"},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"This is an extremely useful, detailed book that presents a low-carbohydrate diet that will keep your blood sugars down to normal levels.Dr. Bernstein has himself suffered from diabetes from the age of 12, and he describes how his health deteriorated due to lack of proper treatment, until he suffered from several dangerous complications resulting from the disorder. He had to find out how to normalize his blood sugars himself, and this he did. This normalization resulted in his getting rid of most of the complications. Then he had to go to medical school at the late age of 45 in order to be able to treat and help other diabetes patients. Because of all this I have great respect for him. He has devoted his life to helping diabetes sufferers all over the world.Bernstein advises that we must follow a diet based on eating 6g of carbohydrate for breakfast, 12 g for lunch and 12g for supper.He lists which foods are acceptable and which are \\"No, no\\". There is also a chapter presenting recipe suggestions near the end of the book.I personally have been much helped by this book, since despite my suffering clear signs of the illness, both high and low blood sugars, my doctor told me my tests were completely normal, and I had no problems of this sort whatsoever. An \\"alternative\\" (in this country) scanning method (actually a wholly scientiic method used in Russia and other Eastern European countries in hospitals and by doctors for over 20 years) confirmed my own diagnosis - auto-immune, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. I suffer also from pains in my toes. Because of the lack of official diagnosis I am unable to get free testing equipment or strips.However Dr Bernstein has confirmed my own and the scanning apparatus' diagnosis. My HcbA-IC value was 5.5%, which is equivalent to a blood sugar reading of 120 mg/dl. The HgbA-IC value is 4.2% in non-diabetics, this being equivalent to 83 mg/dl. On researching the matter Bernstein found that persons having a blood sugar level of 90 mg/dl or over had a higher mortality than those having a level under 90 mg/dl.I was also helped by the author's explanation as to why I felt shaky and weak in the morning as if I had low blood sugar, when actually it was 120 mg/dl. This is apparently a common phenomenon. It feels like low blood sugar only in comparison with the high blood sugars one experiences after eating.The author goes into extreme detail about the various types of insulin available, how and when to painlessly inject and so on. This information will be extremely useful to those who use insulin. There are also helpful chapters about hypoglycemia, gastroparesis (delayed stomach-emptying) and exercise, among other things.Since I can't get insulin, and wouldn't want to use it anyway, I appreciate the author's tip that R-alpha lipoic acid when used together with evening primrose oil mimics the effect of insulin and can help to reduce blood sugars (though ALA reduces the body's levels of biotin, which should thus be taken at the same time).Bernstein's main quality is the immense detail of his explanations.This said, I would like to note a few negative points. He advocates the use of micro-wave ovens, which are known to destroy the life-energy in food subjected to them. And he also recommends the use of aspartame, Splenda and other artifical sweeteners documented as being harmful. It is as though he knows everything about how to counteract the harmful effects of diabetes, but is not so aware of other threats to our health.Moreover, since he himself suffers from beta-cell burnout, he doesn't really go into the possibilities of healing the pancreas by natural methods and thus increasing the production of insulin. The author's beta cells may or may not be beyond repair, but this will not be the case with many others reading the book.For information about such natural methods i would advise the reading of Cass Ingram's book \\"Natural cures for diabetes\\" in conjunction with this book. But I absolutely recommend that you read this book too, especially if you use insulin."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"Of the 3 books on this subject by Dr. Bernstein that I have read including his suggested recipes, this is the most detailled and informative. I started practicing what Dr. Bernstein preaches and while it is indeed, difficult at first-especially when you look to revamp your food choices that were learned over your lifetime. After a week, the cravings tend to disappear and I am seeing my sugars come down and I lost 3 lbs. This is just one battle, but if these results keep up, I see this investment into Dr. Bernstein's program is a small price to pay for nutritional and healthy control."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"I bought this book for my mom after she ended up in the hospital after being prescribed a diabetes drug that is now off the market. She was struggling with out of control blood sugars and obesity. Most of the advice for diabetes at that time included diets fairly high in carbs and that just didn't make sense to me. Dr. Bernstein was ahead of the times on that one. In this book, Dr. Bernstein who has Type 1 diabetes, clearly explains about different types of medication including insulin, types of blood tests to ask for, exercise, and ways to cope with illness when you have diabetes. He outlines a very strict low carbohydrate diet. When my mother followed this diet strictly her blood sugars remained low and she lost 40 pounds. We made several of the recipes and they were all delicious. If you are tired of fighting with your blood sugars, weight, and taking too much medication, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"This book is the absolute bible for diabetics and folks who want to improve their diets by greatly reducing their carbohydrates.

It's not easy to follow at first but it is considerably easier than killing yourself with high blood sugars. I am a convinced this is the way we all should be eating- not just diabetics and I'm a pretty skeptical person. I have read this book at least 4 times from cover to cover and refer to it weekly.

I found it when I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes years ago. Dr. Bernstein has a somewhat radical idea that instead of letting blood sugar peak and then pull it back down with meds or insulin is dangerous long term. His idea of controlling and achieving normal blood sugar levels by controlling diet is very good. I have been able to control mine for a number of years, my A1C is 5.3, and excellent value.

Removing all carbs from your diet to control blood sugar is like never leaving the house if you suffer from allergies. Following Dr. Bernstein's advice religiously without being in constant consultation with your personal MD is potentially very dangerous. Restricting ALL carbs the way he advises may help type 2 people who are overweight. Not for Type 1s who need carbs as much as we need insulin shots. I tried this type of diet and looked like a skeleton within a month. In a way us Type 1s have it easier, just more track marks, but removing all carbs and substituting them for these mysterious G/G crackers he praises can and will make you lose weight, give you more lows and create more problems. It may work for some, is probably very helpful for overweight type 2s, and a lot of the advice he does give is outstanding but please don't take it as the final word."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"...I very much appreciate the Doctor's efforts to help but this book nearly killed me (and I'm not kidding). I tried following his advice and dropped from 230pds to 160pds in about two months (I'm nearly 2 meters tall). In fact, the doctors became so concerned about my mental and physical health that my wife and I eventually went to see a shrink. My internal organs were starving and I looked like a war prisoner coming out of some awful camp. At the heart of it was this book. While it gave me some good ideas it was unrealistic for me and what I realized was that his recommendations may not be the only truth. Everyone's blood sugar goes up after eating but where diabetics get hung up is that it may go too high and doesn't want to come back down far enough. Likewise, his method is probably better for those who are on medications (I have non-diabetic blood sugar and A1C levels w/o meds) and access to foods I've never heard of.I know that he has something akin to a cult following, and run the risk of their wrath for saying anything unflattering about him, but if you're just starting out on the diabetes journey be careful with this book. There are a lot of 'experts' out there and so read what they have to say and then do what's right for you with your doctor's help. Some are selling snake oil while others provide you sound, and reasonable advice. Take a look at the book on the '50 diabetes myths' for something a bit more balanced.Diabetes is a personal journey and so there are no miracle cures or cookie cutter approaches to it.

The author talks a lot about ways to use insulin, but I have been off insulin for over a year, so those parts I skipped over.

But Dr. Bernstein put it in perspective by arguing for targeting specific BG's and eating and or medicating to achieve the target. It really does work. Moreover, it makes low carb eating much more meaningful because the results are right there for your immediate review on the test strip. You don't have to wait for the results to show up on the scale.Many have argued that this regimen is too restrictive. How can this be? We are talking personal health here. Over the past 75 days, I have managed my fasting BG under 100, have lost weight , feel excellent and all of my blood work is excellent.

I hit rock bottom in 2004 when I suffered several weeks of blindness, and was unable to work.I have now lost about forty pounds, and have average blood sugar readings in the 120 range. Previously, my average would have been at least one hundred points higher. When I get off the diet, my blood sugar goes right back into the two and three hundred range instantly.I have had improvement in symptoms. For example, the feeling in my extermities is much better. For the present, my diabetic retinopathy has stabilized, which I pray will continue.I do not find the diet change to be much of a sacrifice. That might be because I experienced the horror of having the disease completely take over my life. It can be inconvenient to eat out, but with a little creativity, I have a diverse and appealing menu.I have not been to Dr. Bernstein's clinic, but hope to go eventually.

I am in the process of plowing through this book.Dr. Bernstein is a type I diabetic who has far outlived the original predictions for lifespan for type I diabetics. He is also a pioneer in the use of glucometers (by patients) to keep their blood sugars within a tight range.I think his diet is similar to Atkins, and I would also recommend the latest Atkins book on diabetes.If someone wants to eat a lot of carbs even though diabetic and simultaneously either take a lot of medications or a lot of insulin, that is their prerogative. However, if someone is interested in actually cutting down on medications or insulin, or perhaps reversing diabetes, I would recommend using Dr. Bernstein's approach. If someone is a vehement vegetarian, however, they will have more trouble on this type of a diet, as animal protein foods are emphasized.From what I have read, eating low-carb is the way to go for a diabetic. My blood sugars have gradually been coming down. Your mileage may vary."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"As a nurse for 27 years, I have seen the decline in quality health care in the United States. Healthcare here is a privilege, not a right and as such patients are now \\"customers\\". I am amazed at the number of physicians that are coming into practice that have the \\"monkey see, monkey do\\" attitude. Many shuffle patients through their offices like cattle in a chute as they have to see a certain amount to make the money. When you are in their office they just want to write a script for the latest pill and send you on your way. This results in very little time for a quality health assessment and advice. Dr. Bernstein's books ( I have ordered the Diabetes Solution and just finished the Diabetes Diet) are a 180 approach to treating diabetes. He answers the questions you have and those you did not know you had. He is a true scientist in every sense of the word.Through his amazing work, he tells people how to live a better, healthier life with diabetes. I am not diabetic...yet. I am having a problem with insulin resistance. I am 50, very overweight and for the last two years have craved sweets like a Heroin addict. While the diet is very restrictive to those carbs that will cause a quick rise in you blood sugar (bad for diabetics AND nondiabetics) I consider myself to be an addict and need to stop these types of foods to live a better life (and a longer one). If you see yourself in any of these reviews, please get a copy of the book....somehow, even if only at the library. It can save a life. Whether your diabetic or not, this is the lifestyle you should strive for. We must stop blindly following health advice when that advice has been proven detrimental to our health and well-being.Dr. Bernstein's books are the light at the end of your tunnel.

It's wonderfully clear in its explanations and arguments. Supplement it perhaps with the general writings of Dr. Andrew Weil on various foods, vitamins, and food preparation, but take a look at what Dr. Bernstein is saying about protein and carbs. This is a field where there is much disagreement, but I find this book to be convincing and extremely helpful. The best book on diabetes I've ever read. ----- 2008 Update. This is still the best book I've ever read on Diabetes. Can't recommend it enough.

I had a severe inflamation with one of my legs, and my blood sugar was over 400 every morning.One morning, at about 4AM, I got up and searched the internet.

I was interested, but I was skeptical. The customer comments were incouraging, so I ordered the book and when I got it I devoured it. I decided to do it. Within 6 weeks, my A1C went from 9.9 to 6.9. My doctor said \\"congratulations\\"!! I was from then on my way. It is now almost 10 years later, I am consistantly at 5.0 A1C, and I have gotten rid of gastropariasis, eye problems, frozen shoulders, inflamed leg, kidney disease, and everything else.

Dr. Bernstein has been a diabetic since the age of 12 and has experienced the ravages of the disease on the body and through his inquisitve and engineering background has applied these principles in his quest to normalize his own blood sugars. From buying the first glucose monitor for personal useage and through trial and error developing a diabetic management protocol, he learned how to normalize his own blood sugars and that there could be reversal of many of the adverse effects of the disease provided they had not reached the point of irreveribility. He went on to medical school when many of his writings were not accepted by the medical community. He has been actively treating diabetics from around the world helping them to normalize their blood sugars by putting into practice the library of his knowledge and practical solutions that will not only normalize anyone's blood glucose if they heed his instructions but will also help prevent if nor reverse some or many of the potential complications. I personally have been a diabetic for a number of years and even employed an insulin pump for several years. I have had extensive diabetic counselling but still failed to maintain what I considered to be an oxymoron, i.e. control of my disease. I became very frustrated and was really on the verge of giving up. I realized that things like dialysis, stroke and heart problems were approaching unless I could do something. I had already developed significant peripheral neuropathy. When I discovered his books, I read them and applied what he said and began experiencing immediatiate improvement on a consistent predictable basis. I have personally been treated by Dr. Bernstein but if you can't see him personally in addtion to reading and folowing his book then BUY THE BOOK and religiously follow it. If you have been a diabetic for years, you will have the necessary experience to understand and make the corrections with the help of your personal physician. If you are a newly diagnosed diabetic, this will give you the opportunity to prevent many or all of the mistakes and frustrations of managing this disease and its serious complications. DR.

Before I read the book I decided to change to a low-carb diet, which is essentially the diet advocated by Dr. Bernstein. My diet change has resulted in returning my blood levels of tryglycerides and HDL to a desirable status.His book advocates a rigorous approach towards a low-carb diet as a requirement to keep a diabetic's blood glucose levels within certain bounds. His insights into how to implement a low carb diet can be read with profit by anyone who is moving toward a diabetic state. Of course, almost everybody is moving toward a diabetic state if they are on a conventional diet utilized by the average American. For instance, my siblings and my wife have all become diabetic or have indications that they are not handling a conventional diet well.All in all, I think the book is well written and I feel that its arguements are very persuasive and mathematically based. The book destroys the creditability of the American Diabetes Association. A campaign needs to be launched to publicize his views. Meanwhile many people are declining into ill health and dying while following the ADA's recommendations."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"Dr. Bernstein is a truly remarkable man - he is both brilliant and really cares about diabetics (unlike some other authors I have read who seem more interested in promoting their own agenda). I know there are things he'd rather be doing at this point, but he continues to try to get information and help out to the rest of us, despite being treated quite poorly by much of the medical community, even as they gradually work their way to saying what he's been saying all along.Dr. B may be the oldest living (74 yrs old) Type I diabetic; he essentially cured himself of a number of severe diabetic complications (severe kidney disease among others) by experimenting on himself and learning how to keep his blood sugars constantly in the normal range. He believes that diabetics are entitled to the same blood sugars non-diabetics have. This is uncommon in the medical community, most of whom advocate target blood sugars for diabetics that are well above normal - and I guess they think we should just accept these high levels and the complications that flow from them.Since I discovered Dr. Bernstein, I've read his book and have also been listening to the Teleseminars he gives, for free, once a month, to answer questions people have ([...] - but please, read the book first - people who ask questions answered in the book will not be appreciated). I have learned a phenomenal amount.Anyway, about the book. It starts w/Dr. Bernstein's personal story, which is amazing but also a good way of introducing the basic approach he has come to and the rationale behind it.Exercise:Dr. Bernstein is a huge advocate of exercise for diabetics (especially Type II w/insulin resistance), and he discusses what he considers to be the best type of exercise for improving insulin sensitivity and reversing cardiovascular complications. He himself has a body-fat percentage of seven and (I've seen him in video) has amazing muscle tone for a man of any age, much less a diabetic man in his 70s.Diet:Dr. Bernstein also advocates a very low carbohydrate diet*, and the rationale is sound.a. For Type IIs, carbs are of course the source of glucose, and eating them forces whatever pancreatic beta cells you have left to wear themselves out producing insulin to cover what you ate. And, more than likely, if you're a Type II, you are insulin resistant which means you need to produce much more insulin than a normal person would to cover your carb intake. So, keeping carbs to a minimun gives your pancreas a break and may let you recover some (but probably not all) of the beta cells you've lost to overwork and glucose-related damage.b. For Type Is or insulin-dependent Type IIs, trying to accurately estimate how much insulin you need if you are eating a high carbohydrate meal is virtually impossible. Apparently, food manufacturers are allowed to be up to 20% off in their estimates of nutrient content. So, if you think you are eating a 100 g carb meal, you could be eating only 80g, in which case you've taken too much insulin and could have a hypoglycemic reaction, or you could be eating 120g, in which case your blood sugar will be too high.Medication:Because he is committed to the idea that diabetics are entitled to fully normal blood sugars (which he estimates to be 83 plus or minus 2), he readily advocates medications, up to and including insulin, if diet and exercise have not be enough to get blood sugars to normal levels. And again, the rationale is there. Most importantly, by the time you get fasting blood sugars in the pre-diabetic or diabetic range, you've lost a large percentage of your pancreatic beta cell function. [Why docs don't routinely do post-prandial blood sugars and/or Hemoglobin A1C screening is a mystery to me - if they did, many of us would have been in a position to prevent this damage much earlier.] In any case, you can give your pancreas a rest and allow your not-yet-dead beta cells to recover by a) reducing insulin resistance (with Insulin Sensitizing agents) and/or b) providing an external source of insulin (injecting) so that your pancreas doesn't have to do the work.Dr. B. discusses the various medications available, how they work and why he does or does not use them. He also covers information that is only relevant to people on insulin, but it is very interesting, and the practical details he covers really gives you a sense that this is someone who deals with diabetes and diabetics every day.I would especially encourage medical professionals to read this book. We desperately need more medical professionals who understand these things. If you are a diabetic or pre-diabetic, read the book (I'd recommend reading it a couple times) and pass it on to your doctor.Hope this was helpful to someone.*I have been a huge carb eater all my life, but cutting them out has not been nearly as difficult as I would have imagined. Even if you read this and think \\"I just couldn't do that,\\" read the book anyway. Then decide."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"Diabetes is now considered an epidemic in prosperous nations. This is from a recent article in the \`New York Times' about a typical hospital in the Bronx: \\"Begin on the sixth floor...a 60-year-old woman was having two toes sawed off. One floor up, corner room: a middle-aged man sprawled, recuperating from a kidney transplant. Next door: nerve damage. Eighth floor, first room to the left: stroke. Two doors down: more toes being removed. Next room: a flawed heart.\\"These assorted medical problems result from a single disease: diabetes. 21 million Americans are diabetic and another 41 million are pre-diabetic. Fast-acting carbohydrates are kicking the bejaysus out of our nation's collective pancreas.The author of this book, Dr. Richard Bernstein has saved the lives of many diabetic patients, including his own. I read this book and am willing, at this point in my disease when I'm not experiencing the really bad diabetic outcomes mentioned above, like cardiac neuropathy or kidney failure, to cherry-pick Dr. Bernstein's suggestions that don't pertain to his very strict low-carbohydrate diet.Perhaps as I test my glucose level after meals and see what an orange or a dish of cottage cheese really does to my blood sugar, I'll be more willing to give them up. His chapter on \\"Diet Guidelines Essential to the Treatment of All Diabetics\\" contains a very demanding nutritional plan, but Dr. Bernstein has lived most of his life with Type 1 diabetes and has brought himself and many patients back from the brink of blindness, amputation, kidney failure, and death. He's an amazing man--an engineer who became a physician because others in the medical profession wouldn't take his research into diabetes seriously until he was one of them.If you are diabetic, please read this book. There are many recommendations on the tests you should get from your physician when first diagnosed (most of them are never even mentioned in other books about diabetes). Dr. Bernstein illuminates every aspect of self-care, including a better place on your hand to poke yourself for glucose testing (all of the other diabetes books I read AND the instructions that came with my glucose meter show alternate spots to those which Dr. Bernstein recommends--see figures 4.1 and 4.2).If I can't manage my blood glucose following my current physician's recommendations, at least I now know that I can fall back on this book to micro-manage my disease.

It is what they put all of their Type II diabetics on. By following that I have been able to control my Type II medication free. I also walk a lot, an hour at a time, 5 and 6 days a week.About eight years ago I took a VM class regarding their diet with 18 people in attendance and all but one of us was overweight. The class returned a month later and with one exception (a guy who was on a cruise and couldn't resist the buffet) we had all lost weight and our blood sugar was lower. One woman lost 20 pounds in that one month. (The woman next to me had a BS reading of 385 in the first class and it dropped to 85 in the second class.) I'm relating this because the VM diet is so similar to Bernstein's diet that I want everyone to know that is at least one place in mainstream medicine where a diet similar to this one is being prescribed.After that class I found this book and find it actually easier to follow than the 15 carbohydrates per meal. For some reason even 15 carbohydrates of any type flip a switch in me that within minutes sends me craving more carbohydrates. With this diet I don't have that problem as much.The downside to this diet has already been mentioned because it is difficult to follow and I used to fall off it quite often. Then after a disappointing a1c test of 7.1 I buckled down and was pretty consistent on it for three months and my last test was 5.8 which is in the normal range. I take no medication, only diet - unlike my brothers who can't control their diet and are on drugs.Another issue for me is alcohol. I don't abuse it but I do like my almost no carbohydrate double martini or scotch or brandy every week or two. The alcohol doesn't raise my blood sugar level but it rips up my self control and I have often then run out and bought ice cream (my favorite cheat) which defeats the diet for a few days making it difficult to climb back on board. What I now do after learning my pattern is I sit down and have a chat with myself, set some ground rules of not running for snacks after drinking and if I feel that I can really comply with that have a drink. Yes, I have more than once not taken a drink because I knew it wouldn't work. Kind of like compassionate self-parenting but it really does work.For those concerned about doctor's approval I agree except there are still many doctors out there who don't believe the miracle of low carb and they push people in a less healthy direction. But particularly in the past 10 years I'm seeing more and more studies pointing to the direction that this book supports."},{"Title":"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars Revised & Updated","review":"This is an enormously informative, scholarly book which at the same time is practical, with ideas and suggestions easy to apply.

The novel has several weaknesses, but the one that turns it into a spectacular failure is its ludicrous framing story.Donnegan, a short red-haired tramp, rides the rails in search of a man named Rusty Dick (please, no snickering). Having discovered that his quarry is dead, Donnegan jumps off the train, forces his way into a stranger's house, and falls in love with the owner's daughter on the spot. The owner, one Colonel Macon, sends Donnegan with his daughter to the Corner, a mining town, hoping that the girl will win back her lover, Jim Landis, from the shadowy Lord Nick, who has horned in on the Colonel's profitable business arrangements with Landis. Failing that, Donnegan is to kill Landis.This nearly intolerable beginning then gives place to a fairly good second act; the Corner turns out to be an interesting place with interesting characters. Donnegan wins himself an ally, a giant black fighting man named George Washington Green, while the beautiful, scheming Nelly Lebrun proves a formidable obstacle to Donnegan. Jim Landis proves to be no opponent at all, but a mere human football whom the real players are fighting to possess.Donnegan's character gets more fleshed out in the second act. As in Destry Rides Again, Max Brand shows a talent for portraying a hero who is severely and obviously flawed - lazy, an almost pathological liar, perpetually needing to prove his manhood - yet nonetheless lovable for that. Indeed, Donnegan is so flawed that the story seems to be inevitably heading for a tragic denouement that might redeem the absurdity of the first act.Unfortunately, there's no such luck. Almost from the minute the shadowy Lord Nick walks on the stage (his true identity should surprise no one), the story careers off into utter absurdity again. The characters' motivations, none too credible to begin with, now contort into self-parody. Don't feel bad if you can make no sense whatsoever out of the last few chapters; everybody, including the characters themselves, is just as confused as you are.Unlike many later Western authors, many of whom preferred to tiptoe around the question of racism, Max Brand places race relations front and center in this novel, even more than in Destry Rides Again. This time, we get a clearer picture of what Brand's own racial attitudes were: he wanted to give a friendly and sympathetic view of African Americans, and largely succeeded, but could not entirely free himself of the unconscious prejudices of his era. George Washington Green is a strong, brave, and likeable character, as he is intended to be, and Brand consciously rejects his contemporaries' stereotypes of black people as perpetual children. There is a major scene showing Brand's contempt for racial segregation. However, Brand cannot portray a real friendship between Green and Donnegan; he can conceive no intimate relationship between a white man and a black one other than that of master and servant.At the same time, Brand continues to hint at a much less wholesome racial attitude, not toward blacks, but toward Chinese. His hero, like the other major characters here and in Destry, harbors a deep contempt and distrust of the Chinese, and this time, there is also a strong implication that the villainous Colonel Macon's love for things Chinese is a reflection of his cruelty and avarice. While it would be unfair to judge Brand by modern standards, it would also be a mistake to think that he had already won through to the racial enlightenment of later times..The description of the Corner and the racial attitudes make Brand's work a sort of academically interesting specimen, but not, by the wildest stretch of the imagination, a good novel. It's a shame that, unlike Destry Rides Again, Donnegan was never made into a movie. A good film treatment might have redeemed some of the book's flaws, and it would have been delightful to see Orson Welles play Colonel Macon."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"\\"Stopped at Stalingrad\\" is one of those genuine surprises. Just when you think you have read everything you need to read or want to read about a given subject, along comes a book that forever alters your view of that subject.This book's principle focus is on the Luftwaffe's role on the Eastern Front. It may, indeed, be the only book length treatment of the subject. Joel Hayward demonstrates with great care that the German's use of air power as a tactical, and not strategic, weapon in close support of ground forces was perhaps THE key factor in the German army's early successes in the East. Patton and the Allied Generals could only DREAM of tactical air-ground support on this level. Writes Hayward, \\"The Luftwaffe, together with the army meticulously co-ordinated their operations and created joint \\"Schwerpunkte\\"(points of main efforts).\\" I may be demonstrating my own woeful lack of knowledge, but this is the first time in all my reading about the German war effort that I encountered a discussion of the critical doctrine of Schwerpunkte.But one of this book's best offerings, comes at the very beginning where Hayward outlines in detail the crucial role that oil, or the lack thereof, played in the entire German war effort. From the outset, the German's were running at a critical deficit. And even with the Rumanian oil fields running at full capacity, the German's were in terrible trouble. And every time they absorbed a new chunk of territory, their situation became all the more desperate.So great was Germany's reliance upon the Rumanian oil fields that Hitler became obsessed with the potential for Russian bombers to turn them in to what he called, \\"an expanse of smoking debris.\\" The fear proved, of course groundless, the Russians were never able to mount an effective long-range bomber command. But this fear led to a costly, Quixotic \\"cleansing of the Crimea\\" -- the so-called \\"Operation Bustard Hunt\\".When the German's launched Operation Barbarossa, their requirements for oil became critical. And this chronic problem led Hitler to focus on the oil fields of the Caucasus. Indeed from this point on much of the German strategic war effort was geared towards securing a reliable oil supply (or developing alternatives).The effort to reach the Caucasus proved, in many respects, to be Germany's undoing. And it was a fruitless effort to begin with. It assumed that: (A) they could reach the fields at all; (B) that if they reached them the oil fields were not so badly sabotaged that they could be put into production in time to make a difference; and (c) the oil supply once secured could be actually brought back to German over a SINGLE rail line of varying gauges that crossed thousands of miles of terrain open to sabotage and air attack. But Hitler was blind to all of this.Hayward writes with great passion and precision. At times one feels a little overwhelmed by details. But his portraits of the individual German pilots and commanders, as well of the shocking conditions under which they fought and died, is truly memorable.This is a book that is not only for the specialist. Anyone with an interest in the Second World War needs to read this book. It makes a brilliant companion to Antony Beevor's book, \\"Stalingrad\\"."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"You'll have to search hard to find any book that better interweaves a rollicking good narrative with top-notch scholarly analysis of tactics, operational art and strategy. Added to that are good clear maps, a helpful glossary, thorough source and footnote details and a full index. This book initially upset a lot of buffs by slaying several sacred cows, yet Hayward's interpretations have not only survived, but they have been widely accepted by scholars and Stalingrad enthusiasts alike. This has indeed, as another reviewer noted, become a necessary &quot;standard work&quot; on Stalingrad."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"The author has done an outstanding job on this book. I was very pleased with the coverage of the Crimean battles of early 1942 and the launching of Operation Blue when Richtofen's Corps was moved north to support the attack. You get a good, solid picture of the decision's at Army Command, Group, corp, and Division level throughout. The best part for me about a book is when I learn not just one thing, but learn new info on several aspect's of this huge struggle in the East. Enough praise now purchase this book! Anyone interested in the Eastern Front of WW2 should have this book."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"This is a detailed book with a strong analytical component, great new photographs, and a good bilingual bibliography. The author begins in March 1942 and takes the Stalingrad campaign through to its death in February 1942. Both air force and ground operations get good coverage, but the real strength of this book is its explanation of how the two branches (and even the German navy in the Black Sea) cooperated together. The account is based on a careful reading of scores of unpublished war diaries and other rare documents, and is therefore a nice surprise after reading countless previous Stalingrad books which all quote the same, readily available sources (Lost Victories, Chuikov's book, etc). The book is stronger overall than Beevor's book, even if the latter is faster paced and has more on the Soviets."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"This account of the Luftwaffe's cooperation with the German army in the east during the long year from March 1942 to 1943 is historical reconstruction at its very best. Expertly it explains war in all its levels, from tactical to operational to strategic, and it focuses for the first time in any such book on the complex everyday operating relationship between ground and air forces. Scholars may think Hayward too hard on Hitler's and Goering's \\"incompetent\\" decision-making, but they'll be hard-pressed to disprove his theories. That's because Hayward's account is based on unpublished wartime documents and diaries. You don't have a complete record of Stalingrad without this book!"},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"Beevor's famous book covers both sides in equal detail. This one doesn't. It deals mainly with Germans and their Romanian, Hungarian, Croatian and Italian comrades. But unlike Beevor it covers all three armed forces: airforce army and navy. As such it is actually a very rare book. Its conclusion that the Luftwaffe were at least equal partners in all German operations, and sometimes even the dominant service, is hard to refute. The story is engaging and the writing excellent. Maps and photos are helpful and the index is more than adequate. All things said, therefore, this is an excellent book."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"Put plainly: you can't understand the Battle of Stalingrad without this book. It is the only analysis of air and joint components of that hell on earth battle. Its author did a huge amount of work in archives and relies on unpublished diaries, notebooks, situation reports, squadron records, afteraction assessments and so on. The argument is clear and persuasive: that much of the credit for German successes during the eastern battles of 1942 must go to the Luftwaffe. Whereas many enthusiasts and some scholars have always presented the Luftwaffe as the secondary, supportive arm, with the army dominant, Dr Hayward makes clear that that view is out of date and unsupportable. The Luftwaffe led and dominated during the entire 1942 campaign. That doesn't mean that it could perform the impossible task Goering and Jeschonnek gave to it: supply of Sixth Army. Hayward's analysis of the airlift is the only authoritative account. The book is superbly crafted and compellingly written. It is one of three or four books that every Stalingrad reader MUST own."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"I read Antony Beevor which got me hooked on Stalingrad, and this book is as good as Beevor's. It is also as good as Hayward's new book on Admiral Nelson. Both get my high praise. Scholarly works that are also readable are few and far between, so make the most of this guy's work."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"This may have been written for professional military scholars and experts, but it is also of immense value to amateurs and military buffs. This is solid, heavy going but deeply analytical and more informative than any other book on the subject. It ranks alongside Ziemke and Bauer, David Glantz, and John Erickson (who have written a stunning review of it) as a top Stalingrad book."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"This book is mandatory reading to anyone interested in the Wehrmacht's campaigns on the Eastern Front. The study has been meticulously researched, is reflective, well written, and evidence that the author is one of the foremost experts of German military operations against the Soviet Union during 1942. The book is a scholarly, detailed study of the Luftwaffe's campaigns during this critical year, yet provides perfect analytical context by explaining army operations, which the Luftwaffe was closely affiliated and therefore necessary for understanding its own activities, and also the strategic/political factors driving the Wehrmacht's overall campaign. It also demonstrates, to often overlooked in most campaign studies, the significant role that individual personalities can, and do, play in war. This book is a MUST read to anyone that is especially interested in the Luftwaffe, joint warfare, dynamic leadership and airpower. All military practitioners, scholars and commentators will thoroughly enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"Wonderful book on the most pivotal year in the Barbarossa campaign, but lessons exist here for people today regarding leadership and goalsetting. Hayward description of events clearly indicates that the German 1942 campaign would have been successful if the German leadership (from the General Staff on up) had created operational focus and maintained it throughout the campaign.The lesson for us today is that, in our age of limited resources, failure to followthrough and focus our resources on the important goals, in the order that those goals must be achieved is the most important requirement for success.I would recommend this, not just to history buffs, but to business leaders of all types."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"This is a very interesting book about Stalingrad because it looks at the whole 1942 campaign to put Stalingrad into political, strategic, and economic context. And its focus on how the Luftwaffe contributed so much to all 1942 battles, and the Sixth Army's unsuccessful supply, is almost entirely new. A well done &quot;essential&quot; book."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"This is a very dry and academic approach which studies the role of the Luftwaffe in the 1942 German campaign in Russia. Haywood likes quoting big chunks of Generaloberst Richtoften's diary and similar sources but this gives only a very high-level view of the campaign. Soviet sources are addressed but amazingly, Haywood fails to delve deeply into the German's opponents - the Soviet Air Force. There is very little military or strategic analysis here, nor is this a chronological account of daily operations. Instead, Haywood gives a general flavor for Luftwaffe operations. Nor is there the necessary quantitative data to support a full analysis of Luftwaffe operations: complete OB for the campaign, aircraft on-hand and available, supplies available, detailed info on logistics. Instead, we are presented a generalized account. The sketch maps used in this book are also crude and totally inadequate.In an account covering an operational air campaign, one would expect to find specific analysis of the opposing air forces performance in the key missions of air superiority, ground support, reconnaissance and transport. Unfortunately, Haywood only skims over these core missions, probably because he fails to comprehend their importance to his account. Comparative equipment analysis is also missing here. No account of the Battle of Britain would skip over the technical issues of Me-109 vs Spitfire that shaped the battle, but Haywood eschews technical specifics. Hence the reader will not learn anything about how Luftwaffe aircraft compared with their Soviet rivals.There are also errors such as the assertion that the Germans conquered Voronezh in July 1942 when in fact they only seized part of the city before they ran out of steam (they failed to get the bridges over the Don). There is very little mention of specific pilots or units, which is odd considering that Erich Hartmann got his start here in November 1942.One interesting point is that Haywood puts heavy emphasis on German tactical success being dependent upon the coordination of a joint armor-aviation schwerpunkt. He also has interesting information on the participation of Luftwaffe Flak units in ground battles and the handful of German deep penetration raids against the Caucusus oil fields.In sum, this book is valuable because an operational level account of the German air war in Russia in 1942 is a rare bird indeed. However, the book is too narrowly focused on von Richtofen's viewpoint and the style too academic to make this the definitive account. Haywood has added to the general material available on Luftwaffe operations in Russia, but the book lacks depth in too many areas."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"What makes this book come alive is the excerpts from the diary of the incredible Wolfram von Richtofen. Also especially noteworthy are text from Mansteins memoirs, and even a passage from the famous stuka pilot, Hans Rudel.Unfortunately, I can't say I found any of Hayward's analysis convincing. In fact, even the characterizations of Richtofen and maybe Paulus seem to be wrong. For example, the author concludes that Richtofen was arrogant which boggles the mind.There is a nice photo inset and the author clearly is furious at the authors who have published works with biased numbers in favour of the Soviets because he points them out by name. That I appreciate as well as using works from the needlessly harrassed David Irving and Paul Carell.I also would have appreciated a bit of text on the tragic final days of Richtofen. Under his photograph it says he died of a brain tumour in 1945 and one can only imagine his depression in those final days as Germany was being destroyed."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"I really enjoyed this book, which gives the best analysis in any language of the Stalingrad air battles and the doomed airlift. I also enjoyed the sections on German strategy, which were insightful and very well informed.I have a copy of the paperback, but I may well hunt out the hardcover because I want to keep a permanent copy of this excellent book in my collection of Wermacht books."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"This meticulous study of the Luftwaffe on the Russian Front during the 1942-1943 debacle doubtless is a major contribution to the genre, but the text is peculiarly dry and remote despite the extraordinary subject matter. Hayward decided to &quot;avoid all unnecessary anecdotes, however fascinating they are&quot; and the resulting narrative, in this reader's opinion, exhibits a curious detachment that is in sharp contrast to the drama of the events he describes.Although it would be absurd to compare this book with, say, a Tom Clancy novel, it also would be fair to say that the text largely fails to capture and reflect the human dimensions of these shattering conflicts. As a substantive work of scholarship it deserves much credit, but it is difficult to know exactly who the intended audience is. I doubt that the general reader of WW II history will read this detailed chronology from cover to cover. The text does not compel that kind of sustained attention.I wonder if all the reviewers who have heaped accolades on this book actually have read it through. It often is easier to recognize virtue than to embrace it...In it's favor, I cheerfully concede that the scholarship appears to be thorough and careful. The abbreviation lists, explanations of German operational units/commands, endnotes and bibliography are quite helpful. I assume that the technical accuracy is beyond reproach. Possibly it is the best and most accessible English-language chronology available to serious scholars of these actions.The problem here seems to be that a meticulous and dispassionate chronology of military engagements, movements of units, and casualty lists, written after the fact by distilling details from primary sources, is not a full history. It is an essential part of the historical record, to be sure, but it is two-dimensional. The total experiences of the Luftwaffe on the Russian Front cannot be so neatly described because the conflict was not neat and tidy. War is a desperate enterprise: quirky, unpredictable, savage, gentle, brave, cowardly, wise, foolish, loving, hateful, and essentially incomprehensible. In short, it subsumes the full, rich tapestry of the human experience.In Hawyard's book we have the melody, but by his choice the harmonies are missing. If one contrasts this text with Bruce Cattons' extraordinary series of Civil War studies, or with Evan Connell's brilliant and evocative biography of George Armstrong Custer in &quot;Son of the Morning Star&quot;, one is struck by the difference between history as art and history as an actuarial record.Reading Hayward's precise, accurate, and aseptic text seems, to me, like watching a skilled neurosurgeon perform a difficult operation: Technically impressive but emotionally absent. The men on both sides who struggled and died here largely have been overlooked, subordinated to the sanitary recounting of operational details. They deserve more.As a different approach to the historiography of this conflict, one might wish to read &quot;Citadel: the Battle of Kursk&quot; by Robin Cross (Sarpedon, c1993).The index is very poor. The large number of undifferentiated page references make it, in part, useless. For example, under &quot;Hitler, Adolf&quot; we find over 60 page numbers or page ranges strung uselessly together. Similarly, under &quot;Richthofen, Wolfram Freiherr von&quot; we find 42 page numbers/page ranges en bloc. Under &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot; 56 page references are clustered together. Undoubtedly this makes for a shorter index. But, as Einstein once remarked, &quot;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not any simpler.&quot;The Luftwaffe campaign in the East reflects all the intrinsic contradictions, strengths and weakness, brilliant successes, tragic failures, and unparalleled human cost, of this titanic conflict between two profoundly antagonistic world views. If Hayward's text represents the high-water mark of scholarship regarding Luftwaffe actions on the Eastern Front, the fully-fledged, three-dimensional account of this unprecedented carnage remains to be written."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"This is a superbly written, highly detailed look at the battle for Stalingrad from the perspective of the German Air Force. Since Hayward has chosen the unique vantage point of concentrating on the actions of Germany, namely the Luftwaffe, I found Hayward almost in a supporting role, and myself, disturbingly, rooting for the axis. Possibly because of the extensive use of formations, numbers, and tactical movements it became a bit dry, but as it progressed it improved. And what seemed to be inconsequential details, only added to the flavor. This book is an excellent addition to others that cover this period in history, and most notably the more colorful book, \\"The Battle for Stalingrad\\".Hayward utilizes and quotes extensively from the diaries and personal papers of key airman and military leaders. He is also not afraid to critique other works and correct false history. A good portion of the book covers the lead-up to the fight for Stalingrad. The numbers of materials and planes destroyed throughout the campaign was staggering and the Russians contempt for its own people was appalling. It was remarkable Russia held them off. But even with poor Russian leadership, it was the over extension by Hitler, the severe Russian winters, and the sheer numbers of tanks and men that would eventually lead to Germany's destruction----it was economics over military objectives. The study concludes with a critique, a summary, and an aftermath.Lord's BlessingsScott"},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"Let me lead off by saying I consider myself an amateur historian, and possess over 400 books on the Second World War alone. I would place this book in the top ten books I've read on the conflict. As others have noted, the book covers the Luftwaffe's contributions to the Crimean battles of early 1942 and the initial success and ultimate failure of Operation Blue. From its initial explanation of the importance of oil to the German decision making process on deciding what the focus for the 1942 campaign would be, to the final failure of the greatly overtaxed Luftwaffe to provide adequate support to either 6th Army in Stalingrad or the German efforts in the Caucasus, the book added greatly to my knowledge and understanding of why things happened as they did. This book provides a unique perspective and complements the other fine works on the Eastern Front in 1942, and is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"Hayward has created a truly unique perspective on the German Eastern campaigns of 1942. The German effort in the air is the focus of this work, discussing in detail the Luftwaffe's contributions to the overall German strategy during Case Blue and lead up operations, such as the seige of Sevastopol. His treatment of German air actions in the Black Sea is unparalleld in the English literature on the subject. Precise and fascinating details of operations, insights into the motivations and personalities of the main players, and superb scholarship, combined with a very readable style make this book one of my favourite reads. Highly recommended, and essential reading for anyone interested in this period of history."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"This book is a treasure.

In his book, Hayward supports his thesis by stating that during the battle for Stalingrad,the Luftwaffe paid too much attention to supporting the ground forces and not enough attention to interdicting the ferries carrying Russian soldiers across the Volga river. Hayward also criticizes the Luftwaffe for not bombing the Caucasusian oil fields which could have severely hampered the Russian war effort. Finally, Hayward writes that the Luftwaffe was spread out to thinly to support the main thrust at Stalingrad and Manstein's southern advance in the Caucasus. I would strongly reccomend this book to anyone whose interested in the faults of German military doctine during World War II."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"Given the amount of aircraft involved and the huge losses sustained by both the Germans and the Russians, it is difficult to understand the absence of literature on the German-Soviet air war during World war II. This book is an important step in providing detailed accounts on this topic. The author convincingly demonstrates that aereal operations on the Russian Front were every bit as intense as those occurring say, during the Battle of Britain or what was experienced by the AAF in 1943-44. For the first time, many World war II enthusiasts will become aware that Luftwaffe raids killed almost as many Russian civilians at Stalingrad as were killed during the entire London Blitz. I was pleasantly surprised to see at least some description of the heavy Luftwaffe strikes against the oil targets around Grozny since these were every bit as important as the much documented USAF raids on Ploesti. The book also centers itself around Wolfram von Richtofen, a German Air Marshall who played a critical and very influential role in Luftwaffe strategy during the German victories from 1939-1942 but who is relatively ignored in most western air warfare histories.On the negative side, the book's tone is too scholarly at times and dwells too often on the organizational structure of the German Air force. Thus it makes an exciting topic a bit dull in sections of the book. Still...Given the lack of information and literature on this topic the book must be considered very good if for no other reason than by default."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"The overwhelming majority of publications or television broadcast documentaries dealing with the European Air War in WWII give the impression that all significant air compaigns were between the RAF and/or USAAF and the Luftwaffe. This book greatly dispels this myth. During the spring and summer of 1942 the Luftwaffe launched massive asssaults both against the Russian army and the Russian civilian population. Air raids against such cities as Stalingrad were every bit as deadly/destructive as the raids lauched earlier against London or Warsaw, a fact most of us never learned in history classes or see on the History Channel. It is also apparent the Luftwaffe support of ground forces was as intense and ubiquitous as anything experienced by the Western Allies. It is obvious the sucess of the British and Americans in the African theater during the fall of 1942 can be attributed to the fact that the German armed forces, especially the Luftwaffe, were overwhelmingly preoccupied on the Eastern Front. This books decribes many of these operations in great detail and gives some insight into the fascinating character of Wolfram von Richtofen.My only criticism is the author goes into too much detail on describing the administrative and organizational aspects of the Luftwaffe which tends to make portions of the book a bit booring. Overall however, it is long overdue significant achievement."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"I agree with what esteemed Professor Richard Overy said in his review of this book: &quot;This is a model of its kind, which ought to set an agenda for the reconstruction of the air narrative in this and other theatres in the greatest of wars.&quot; But I will go further; this book isn't only or even mainly a narrative. It's a powerfully strong piece of operational-level analysis. It is written in a lively and captivating way, which makes the density of analysis easy to cope with.

Many, maybe most, of these documents have never been used by historians before. So the information from them and the author's conclusions are revelations. This book explains Stalingrad strategies, in the air and on the ground, better than any other book, and is the very first to explain the Luftwaffe's centrel role in German victories and defeats during 1942 and early 1943.

Effective marketing and its corresponding sales do not mean it is the best book on Stalingrad.Perhaps Hayward's book IS.Because I wanted to know WHY things became as violent and bloody and chaotic as Beevor portrayed, I needed a book that explained the strategy employed by German attackers, Russian defenders and then Russian attackers and German defenders. I also need to know WHY the Germans ever thought Stalingrad was strategically important, WHY Hitler refused to abadon it even after his Sixth Army got surrounded there, why GOERING promised to keep that army fully supplied by air, WHY the local air force leaders said that it could not be thus supplied, WHY Hitler listened to Goering, WHY the Luftwaffe failed so badly, and WHY Goering didn't get the sack.All these questions are answered in a highly original study by Joel Hayward, whose fluency with German sources is noteworthy. His answers don't fit the traditional explanations and in fact, he demolishes many long-held beliefs.While condemning the Nazi leadership he pays tribute to the Luftwaffe's exceptionally hardworking and industrious commanders at the front. They tried incredibly hard and did far better than circumstances ordinarily would have allowed. Sadly for Sixth Army it was not enough, and Richthofen the brilliant senior air commander never recovered from his sense of failure. Stalingrad broke him physically and emotionally.Also important in Hayward's book is his skilful analysis of the Luftwaffe's key role in the Battles of Kharkov, Kerch and Sevastopl, events that were ignored for too long by schlars unwilling or unable to spend months in German military archives like Hayward did.His unparallelled use of archival material, his carefull assessment of all material, his compelling and hard-to-refute arguments all turn this fluently-written book into the definitive account, in any language, of the Stalingrad airlift.You must read this book if you want to understand how the German army almost took Stalingrad (mainly because of the Luftwaffe's excellent close air support and logistical support of oil and fuel to panzer vanguards) and why it ultimately failed."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"The first edition came out in 1998 and, six years on, this work has not been surpassed for its importance as an analysis of WWII joint warfighting, the Luftwaffe's way of war, airpower in the Crimea, airpower in the Caucasus, airpower at Stalingrad, and naturally the Stalingrad airlift itself.The reasons for this book's immediate &quot;classic&quot; status are easy to pick: totally accurate citing of hundreds of never-before-used sources in several languages drawn from major archives; a highly original approach to the writing of campaign histories; a clear argument; a fair and balanced approach; no Wehrmacht-devotee comments or tone (all too common I'm afraid); a wonderfully readable writing style; and precise footnotes that help the reader to determine the reliability of all claims or statements.A true model of a WWII campaign analysis. VERY highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"This book's back cover ratings by the world's leading historians are not exaggerated. This book is fantastic and is essential to read if you want to know what the Germans did RIGHT and WRONG at Stalingrad (granted; they should never have been there in the first place). The research, the approach and the arguments are highly original, making this book invaluable for Stalingrad and Ostfront enthusiasts. It is also stylishly written. Fine book!"},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"This is the most excellent book on the Battle we all think we know about. But this book shows how little we know. It has great research in Germany's Militaerarchiv in Freiburg and in captured war documents in American national and militar archives. Many, maybe most, of these documents have never been used by historians before. So the information from them and the author's conclusions are revelations. This book explains Stalingrad strategies, in the air and on the ground, better than any other book, and is the very first to explain the Luftwaffe's centrel role in German victories and defeats during 1942 and early 1943. Every Stalingrad reader will enjoy."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"This is one of the very best book on the Luftwaffe by serious, academic historian, and possibly the only one to date to give credit and recognition to one of the best tactical minds of he Luftwaffe, GFM von Richtofen.While justifiably lambasting the Luftwaffe (and Hitler too) on its short sightedness in forgoing the development of a strategic, heavy bomber in favour of tactical, short range fighters and light payload bombers, Hayward does remind us the indispensable role of the Luftwaffe as the Heer's flying artillery and its role in her battlefield successes.The fact that the Luftwaffe was staffed mainly by transferees from the Heer may be a determining factor in shaping its mission as a tactical, close support airforce, and its reluctance to develop, acqueisce or sustain a naval air arm for the tonnage battle in the Atlantic (same can be said of Raeder's and D&ouml;nitz's strategic shortcomings, both concentrating on their respective favourites, battleships and U-boats, while paying little heed to the crucial role of air cover for naval actions) may stem from the tradtional rivalry during the Kaiser's times between the senior service, Army and the Kaiser's favourite, the Kriegsmarine, which in the Great War proved to be a less than war winning tool, and a dtermining factor (with her mutinies) in the dissolution of the Reich.It is amazing that nobody in the top echelons of the Luftwaffe had articulated a strategic vision for the role of the service in war. Same with the Krigesmarine with its focus and fetish on battleships and U boats.Bearing in mind that Germany was flanked by her traditional enemies in Europe, and the need for the avoidance of the nightmarish 2 front war like the last war, which stretched Germany to her limits as a middling power battling the superpowers (Britain, Russia and USA), the much vaunted General Staff as well as OKW, OKH. OKM. OKL had not seen the need for a strategic airforce of long range fighters and high altitude heavy bombers (plus aircraft carriers for the inevitable last fight with the US after mastery of Europe) that will serve as a deterrent in any enforced peace with Britain and USSR, or as an indisepnsable deep penetrating tool for crippling her enemies' military-political-industrial complexes, the cross-Channel invasion of Britain, the strangling of trans-Atlantic trade between Britian and her Dminions as well as her banker, the US.Inter-service rivalry will see the Luftwaffe refusing to build up a naval air arm, or let the Kriegamrine to have one, nor did the latter, with its uni-dimensional focus on the war at sea, see the need for aircover and aircraft carriers ( all because of the myopic expedient that for the same amount of steel, you can build 20 U boats in a shorter time) for her naval units. This led to the loss of aircover over her bases, and drove the U boats underwater (thus limiting her striking power as they fought on the surface!) and her surface units immobilised in hideouts in France and Norway.Without a strategic airforce, and with the loss of air supremacy at home and above the battelfields, Germany suffred from the vicious cycle of loss of aircover, then devastated industries, then even less aircrafts, arms and munitions to fight off her enemies on all fronts,and so on. In the end, the Luftwaffe was no more than the Heer's last mobile artiller and machine gun battalions (most of the Heer's artillery was horse drawn) and the Kreigsmarine an impotent coast guard.It would be interesting to see if, like the Generalstab, most of the Heer transferees were artillerists ( the most technical proficient branch and thus uniquely suited to the technically most demanding service), who with their mindset would predisposed them to a tactical, close support vision of the Luftwaffe"},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"This volume is a major contribution to the history of the Luftwaffe during the Russo-Germano war. &quot;Stopped at Stalingrad&quot; is also a richly drawn study of the most important air campaigns in the Eastern Front. Written in an accessible style this volume will be welcomed by anyone with an interest in the WWII. I was very pleasantly surprised by the book and also the quality of its contents. The author did a masterful job of research. Joel Hayward draws on diaries of both key commanders and regular airmen. He also shows that the poorly conceived strategies of Hitler and his buffoon, Goering, dommed the efforts of men such von Manstein, Milch and Wolfram von Richthofen (an outstanding soldier) to come to grips with an impossible situation.
